\subsubsection{Citation}

A citation network represented as a directed unweighted graph, with nodes representing individual documents and edges indicating a citation from one document to another.

\input{figures/citation}

Figure \ref{fig:citation} depicts a citation diad in which document $d_1$ cites document $d_2$.

\subsubsection{Co-Citation}

A co-citation network represented as an undirected weighted graph, with nodes corresponding to individual documents and edge weights representing the frequency with which two documents are co-cited.

\citep{small1973,small1974,griffith1974,small1977,small1979}

\input{figures/co_citation}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:co_citation}, the edge weight of 2 between documents $d_3$ and $d_4$ reflects the fact that they are co-cited by two documents, $d_1$ and $d_2$.

\subsubsection{Co-Occurrence}

A co-occurrence network represented as an undirected weighted graph, with nodes representing individual terms and edge weights indicating the frequency with which two terms co-occur within a document.

\input{figures/co_occurrence}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:co_occurrence}, the edge weight of 2 between terms $w_3$ and $w_4$ 
reflects the fact that they co-occur in both documents, $d_1$ and $d_2$.
