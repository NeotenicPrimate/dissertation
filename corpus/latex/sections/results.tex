\subsection{Density Effect (Edges)}

Both co-citation and co-occurrence graphs are found to be sparse for every discipline, which is 
indicated by the negative and significant coefficients. A sparse network is characterized by a 
relatively low proportion of connections between individuals in comparison to the total number of 
potential connections that can exist within the network.

\subsection{Small-World effect (Triangles)}

As suggested by prior research, the social networks under investigation demonstrate a higher 
prevalence of triangles than what would be expected by random chance. Triangles, which represent a 
set of three documents or concepts who are mutually connected, are a common feature of social networks and are 
thought to play an important role in social cohesion and network structure 
\citep{kossinets2006, newman2018}. The observed excess of 
triangles in the current study is consistent with previous findings on the presence of triadic 
closure in social networks, where nodes tend to form connections with the neighbors of their 
neighbors \citep{burt2000}.

All coefficients that are statistically significant for triangles exhibit a positive sign, which 
suggests that triangles are present in the social network under investigation at a rate higher than 
that which would be expected by chance alone.
