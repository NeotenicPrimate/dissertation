Bibliometric networks exhibit the following characteristics \citep{holme2002}:

\begin{itemize}
\item They are large and sparse graphs, meaning that only a small fraction of all possible edges 
actually exist \citep{watts1998,newman2003,jackson2010}
\item The average geodesic (shortest path) length grows logarithmically \citep{leskovec2007}
\item The degree distribution approximately follows a power law decay \citep{barabasi1999}
\item They exhivit a high degree of clustering \citep{newman2003,kretschmer2004}
\end{itemize}
