    This paper examines the structure and dynamics of science across 16 fields by analyzing both 
    bibliographic and semantic networks. The study finds that there are few structural differences
    between the fields, indicating that the underlying structure of scientific knowledge is 
    relatively uniform. The analysis reveals that there are common patterns of co-citation and term 
    co-occurrence, highlighting the interconnected nature of scientific research.
