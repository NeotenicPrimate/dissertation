%     Nodes with high betweenness centrality in this type of network may represent important bridge terms or pivot terms that connect different topics or themes within the corpus of documents. The betweenness centrality $c_b$ of node $n$ is given by:

%     $$
%     c_b(i) = \sum_{j \ne k} \frac{\sigma_{jk}(i)}{\sigma_{jk}}
%     $$

%     Where $\sigma_{ij}$ is the total number of shortest paths from node $i$ to node $j$ and $\sigma_{ij}(n)$ is the number of those paths that pass through node $n$. In other words, it is the proportion of all shortest paths between nodes $i$ and $j$ that pass through node $n$. The average betweenness centrality over all nodes of the network is taken as another network statistic.

    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Community detection algorithm
    
    \item Partition a network into distinct communities based on the structural patterns of connections between nodes

    \item Modularity maximization

    \end{itemize}

    % The Louvain community detection method consists of two main steps. Initially, each node is assigned to a separate community. Then, for each node, the algorithm attempts to optimize the modularity of the network by evaluating the potential gain in modularity achieved by moving the node to each of its neighboring communities. If no gain is achieved, the node remains in its original community.

    % In the second step, a new network is constructed where each node represents a community from the previous step. The edges between the new nodes are weighted by the sum of the weights of the edges between the nodes in the corresponding communities in the original network. The Louvain method is then applied to this new network, and the process is repeated until no further improvement in modularity can be achieved.

    % Modularity is a measure of the degree of segregation of a network into communities. It is calculated 
    % as the difference between the fraction of edges within a given group and the expected fraction of 
    % edges if they were randomly distributed in the network. The change in modularity $\Delta Q$ achieved 
    % by moving the node to each of its neighboring communities is measured as

    % $$
    % Q = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i,j}[A_{ij} - \frac{k_ik_j}{2m}]\delta(c_i,c_j)
    % $$

    % where:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item $Q$ is the modularity index
    %     \item $m$ is the total number of edges in the network
    %     \item $A_{ij}$ is the weight of the edge between nodes $i$ and $j$
    %     \item $k_i$ and $k_j$ are the degrees of nodes $i$ and $j$, respectively
    %     \item $c_i$ and $c_j$ are the community assignments of nodes $i$ and $j$
    %     \item $\delta(c_i,c_j)$ is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to 1 if nodes $i$ and $j$ are in the same community and 0 otherwise.
