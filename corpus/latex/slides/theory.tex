	\framesubtitle{Attention Space \citep{collins1994}}

	% To answer this question Collins posits that all fields are subject to the "Law of Small Numbers"

	% Scientific communities compete for the "attention space" (i.e., resources)

	% A sort of carrying capacity which determines the upper limit of the number of subfields

	% Consolidation or restructuring takes place soon after surpassing the carrying capacity

	\begin{itemize}

		\item “Dynamics of the Law of Small Numbers, dividing the attention space among factions […] a struggle for attention” \citep[158-160]{collins1994}

		\item "In any period of creative life, there are typically between three and six [...] lineages or schools" \citep[157]{collins1994}

		\item "\textbf{Law of Small Numbers}, dividing the \textbf{attention space} among factions" \citep[158]{collins1994}

	\end{itemize}

	\vfill

	$\bm{H_{1}}$: When the \textbf{density of subfields} within a field surpasses six, the field is more likely to experience a tendency towards \textbf{consolidation}.

	\framesubtitle{Moving Frontier \citep{collins1994}}

	% Collins distinguishes between "high-consensus rapid-discovery science" and "low-consensus" science

	% He posits that these "high-consensus rapid-discovery" science have "fast moving research front"

	% "Fast moving research front" as refers to the fact that disagreements are confined to the research frontier

	\begin{itemize}

		\item "High-consensus rapid-discovery science" \citep[157]{collins1994}

		\item \textbf{"Fast moving research front"} \citep[158]{collins1994}

	\framesubtitle{Research Technology \citep{collins1994}}

	% So how does he explain the difference between "high-consensus rapid-discovery" science and "low-consensus" science?

	% Well, ite relies on the institutionalization of practices

	% Specifically: "routinized" research practices

	% Groups form around a technology which produces consistent & reliable outputs

	% So, for Collins, what distinguises "high-consensus rapid-discovery" science, is not "empiricism", "measurement precision", "formalization", or the "experimental method", but a "genealogy of technologies" producing reliable results.

	\begin{itemize}

		\item What sets appart "\textbf{high-consensus rapid-discovery}" from "\textbf{low-consensus non-rapid-discovery}" science? \citep[158]{collins1994}

		\item Not "empiricism", "measurement precision", "formalization", or the "experimental method" \citep[158]{collins1994}

	\framesubtitle{Scientific Revolutions \citep{kuhn2012}}

	\begin{itemize}

		% In Kuhn's model, sciences go through periods of relative stability (i.e., "normal" or "paradigmatic" science) 

		% Anomalies accumulate.

		% Anomalies are observation that do not fit the current models

		% As anomalies accumulate

		% New paradigms emerge and compete

		% Scientific revolution ends when consensus is reached

		% Compares them to political revolutions
		% One institution must die for the next one to be born

		% Basis of science is community consensus (e.g., textbook, curriculums, etc.)


		\item “Political revolutions aim to change political institutions in ways that those institutions themselves prohibit […] necessitates the partial relinquishment of one set of institutions in favor of another […] Initially it is crisis […] that attenuates the role of political institutions […] and the role of paradigms” \citep[93]{kuhn2012}

		\item "Recurrent debates about whether one or another of the contemporary social sciences is really a science [...] will cease to be a source of concern not when a definition is found, but when the groups that now doubt their own status achieve consensus about their past and present accomplishments” \citep[161]{kuhn2012}
