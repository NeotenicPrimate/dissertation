Evaluation of e-marketing in aquaculture using an aquachoupal model in the East and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE			English	Article						aquaculture; analytical hierarchy process; Sen's capability approach; Brown's information-based approach; India	SERVICE QUALITY	In order to evaluate e-marketing systems in the aquaculture value chain, the authors conducted a study on the aquachoupal model in the East and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh, India. Developmental impact and measurement of information dissemination were evaluated using Sen's capability approach and Brown's information-based approach. Quality of service as a component of the value chain is very important for e-marketing, yet difficult to assess due to its complex and intangible nature. In this study, an analytical hierarchy process was used to examine changes in service quality as a result of e-marketing. The study showed that the aquachoupal had been helpful in improving human resource development through the value chain channels of growth and productivity. It also increased the volume, coverage and diversity of information flows in the study area. There has been significant improvement in service quality in the aquaculture value chain as a result of e-marketing.

J	Szoltysek, J; Fraczkiewicz-Wronka, A				Szoltysek, Jacek; Fraczkiewicz-Wronka, Aldona			The application of supply chain analysis to the evaluation of the effectiveness of social service organizations	MANAGEMENT-POLAND			English	Article						Key success factors; strategy; public organization; service		The identification and analysis of value chains is a way to find the sources of an organization's in-/efficiency, and an opportunity to explore how an organization is managed. Having in mind that an "organization network" is a form similar, in its functioning, to a separate organization, one may, using the value chain concept, investigate the management of local activity programmes, as of the networks they are. The researched partnerships introduced a management innovation, in that the social service provision organizations were brought together to form one chain. The researched organizations providing social services have introduced innovations in management that are supposed to unite organizations providing social services in a single chain. This kind of approach allows to obtain additional benefits, including the joint management of subjects composing the chain. In practice, it is also connected with sharing benefits between the participants in the chain, as well as replacing the elements of competition and suspicion with cooperation and trust. Delivering value to the beneficiary, under the provision of social services, is important not only from the point of view of humanity, but also in order to maximize the use of resources, usually insufficient to meet all the needs. The presented studies of supply chains of social services in Silesia showed, that some features of these newly created areas being subject of joint management, still crave for numerous improvements. What may help is logistics, in particular business logistics, having years of experience in the area of observation and active participation in the chain management. However, unconditional adaptation of these experiences is not possible due to the fact that developed methods are based on cost and maintenance compromises, which are insensitive to human needs when the service cost for the chain is not sufficiently profitable. Therefore, it is necessary to implement different methods of managing these chains, principles of which are described in the social logistics. The authors are convinced that combination of the efforts of the organizers of social services and experienced logistics professionals can bring a double benefit. In practical terms it may help to improve the delivery of services with no deterioration of their quality, and to increase the range of services (quantitative or qualitative) based on specific resources. In the epistemological dimension it may enable to develop rules to adapt the theory of logistics for the socially significant needs. Therefore, this paper can be considered as the beginning of the discussion in this regard.

Affirming the dominance of the open network in organizing worldwide value chains, it transformed Japan and US into trade partners rather than rivals. It allows firms like Apple, Nokia and Sony to outsource production tasks to People's Republic of China, which serves as the world's workplace, and provides a niche for Singapore and Taiwan in late industrialization. Tapping into the economy of scope from the pooling of capacity and information, contract manufacturers like Foxconn and Flextronics provide durable and significant benefit for their economies of domicile, hence a novel niche in late industrialization.

Basic concepts are revised, explaining how it can be introduced inside the enterprises, also how it can be applied to the whole value chain and how we can understand if we are capable to make it or if we are oriented on right path. We cover the Stakeholders concept inside and outside of the companies, clarifying that we must adopt and have a new culture that answers to requirements of different interest groups that surround enterprise in the society. Additionally we explain as it is a feature already implemented in many important local companies and how exists Foundations in Chile that are so many years concerned by Corporate Social Responsability. Finally we go aboard the concept of individual responsability of consumer or user, which turns basic for making the other macro social concept to take the Global position that requires now days.

Currently, a process model was usually included in a lengthy process containing many process components, which makes them difficult for managers and other users to learn. This study proposes an approach for transforming an Event Process Chain (EPC)-based process model into a hierarchical functional model. The proposed approach identifies structural errors in the process model and then converts it to a structured process model. A blocking approach is then used to form a hierarchical model by grouping sets of process elements into several sub-function units and to construct a hierarchical model.

Electromobility - opportunity for Austria's economy	ELEKTROTECHNIK UND INFORMATIONSTECHNIK			German	Article						Austrian economy; value chain; competence of Austrian industry		Gradual electrification of the drive propulsion system and the associated new technologies for vehicle and infrastructure will lead to changes in the classic car industry as well as other industry sectors. In the course of these changes not only technological issues arise, but also questions about the impacts of new drive concepts on the Austrian economy and the industrial location. In order to analyze the impacts, the Federal Ministry of Economy, Family and Youth, the Austrian Economic Chambers and the Federation of Austrian Industries commissioned the Institute for Powertrains and Automotive Technology of the Vienna University of Technology and Fraunhofer Austria Research GmbH to conduct a study. Potentials for the establishment and development of value added and employment effects have been identified within detailed analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of the Austrian economy. The study identifies direct value added effects in the amount of (sic) 300 million and 3800 full-time employees in 2020 and approximately (sic) 1.2 billion and 14,800 full-time workers in 2030. Taking induced effects, the overall effects of electric mobility are estimated at a value added of (sic) 2.9 billion and 35,600 full-time workers. The Austrian potentials used best in terms of expertise and market position even a potential in the amount of 57,100 full time employees will result for the year 2030.

J	Domadenik, P; Farcnik, D				Domadenik, Polona; Farcnik, Dasa			The Role of the Education System and On-the-Job Training in Innovation: Evidence from the Slovenian Manufacturing and Service Sector	CROATIAN ECONOMIC SURVEY			English	Article						education; innovation; on-the-job training; Slovenia	TRANSITION; GROWTH; PANEL	This paper contributes to the debate on the importance of education for sustainable economic growth. Following a recent contribution by Aghion (2009), we focus on the role of tertiary education in innovation at the company level using patent applications as a proxy. Rather than examining tertiary education spending or the share of the population with tertiary education, we make use of the Aghion Index, which measures the quality of tertiary education. Moreover, as innovation is only the first step in the value chain at the company level, we complement data on the quality of tertiary education with company-level data on human capital spending in large and medium-sized Slovenian firms. We report that not only a sound education system, but also on-the-job training is important for increased company-level invention and innovation. Firms with more on-the-job training reported a significantly higher number of patents in the period of 2007-2009.

J	Boutroy, E; Bourdeau, P; Mao, P; Senil, N				Boutroy, Eric; Bourdeau, Philippe; Mao, Pascal; Senil, Nicolas			Combination of geographical and socio-economic proximities The "mountain and nature sports tourism" commodity chain in the Rhone-Alpes region	REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH			English	Article						commodity chain; mountains; geographical proximity; socio-economic proximity; sport; tourism		While iris today acknowledged that the Rhone-Alpes region is characterised by a singular concentration of sport-related firms, specialising particularly in the mountain and nature sports sector, the phenomenon does not appear to fall within classic paradigms for analysing the territorialised interrelationships between actors in the fields of industry, research and training. Such observations do not imply the absence, in Rhone-Alpes, of strong interaction between geographically close actors, but rather prompt a more descriptive and measured approach in addressing the phenomenon. On the basis of the results of a study cross-cutting economic geography and cultural geography, this article will first show how the Rhone-Alpes region sustains a leading "mountain and nature sports tourism" commodity chain, by detailing its structural and territorial features, including broadened spatial scale, plurality of actors and interrelated functions. As part of a comprehensive approach, an attempt will then be made to show the existence of localised cooperation configurations, based on complementarity of geographical and socio-economic proximities. At a time when centralised public cluster policies are coming under question (uranton et. al., 2008), it would seem legitimate to observe the "spontaneous" dynamics between organisations, in order to gain a more realistic understanding of the link between the attractiveness of the region's territories and the competitiveness of a commodity chain.

While the aviation industry accounts for only 2% of global emission, many airlines are exploring, partnering with appropriate players along the value chain to source biojet fuels that will give them green credentials. Several challenges inform the possible expansion of the aviation biofuels industry. These include policy drivers with sufficient incentives, in particular financial support, specific technical requirement and rigorous testing, feedstock production on marginal lands not competing with food crops and effective linkages in the production supply chain. This paper highlights and discusses these issues and describes initiatives in this sector by the two major airlines Lufthansa and Quantas amongst others.

J	Bose, I; Saha, D; Huang, MY				Bose, Indranil; Saha, Debashis; Huang, Minyi			Sanchari: Moving Up the Value Chain Through Telecommunication Services	COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						cloud computing; e-government project; telecommunication industry; India; teaching case; telecommunication infrastructure; telecommunication service provider; value chain		The year 2009 was a critical year in the development of Sanchari, a state-owned telecommunication infrastructure (TI) service provider in India. Over the past few years, Sanchari had successfully developed and delivered on-demand infrastructure services to customers in the state of Karnataka, India. Sanchari's management team wanted to move their business up the value chain to take advantage of the rapidly growing telecommunication industry in India. In the middle of 2009, Sanchari was approached by the state government of Karnataka to lead the development of a state-wide-area-network (SWAN) under the e-government initiative. This e-government project could give Sanchari an opportunity to move up the value chain. Sanchari needed to decide whether it would take the sole responsibility of this project as the government agent or form a partnership with a private company to execute it. This decision, however, would depend on whether Sanchari wanted to develop into an infrastructure or software service provider or maintain its status quo as a TI service provider in the long term. The teaching case provides a challenging decision-making situation for students and urges them to analyze the benefits and risks of moving up the telecommunication value chain.

J	Boshoff, WH				Boshoff, Willem H.			THE STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF BLACK EMPOWERMENT POLICY IN SOUTH AFRICA: A CASE STUDY OF BOUNDARY CHOICE AND CLIENT PREFERENCES IN A SMALL SERVICES FIRM	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article						boundaries; vertical integration; black empowerment; demand-side	ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT; INDUSTRY; ARCHITECTURE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; BUY	This paper studies the relationship between a firm's boundary choices within its value chain and the BEE pressures it faces from its clients. The paper shows that BEE policy alters the value chain preferences of a firm's clients. These changes in client preferences motivate the firm to altering its boundaries. More important, boundary changes due to BEE are implemented in a way that ensures that the firm retains crucial architectural knowledge, which preserves its competitive advantage. Firms therefore do not respond passively to BEE-induced changes in client preferences, but aim to meet BEE aims within their broader strategic environment.

SEGMENTING FOOD CONSUMPTION IN THE FREE STATE PROVINCE OF SOUTH AFRICA	AGREKON			English	Article						market segments; binary logit model; consumer economics; drivers of food consumption; food policy	DEMAND	In this paper the nature of diversity that exists with regard to food consumption in the Free State Province is investigated. Furthermore, this paper also investigates the factors (quality attributes and household characteristics) differentiating these market segments from one another. Four separate steps were followed in an integrated manner in the investigation. Firstly, a representative sample was drawn for the Free State Province food consumers. Households are then segmented into smaller submarkets. The second step involved the use of principal component analysis to correct for the strong and prevalent underlying structure with respect to household preferences. In the final step, a binary logit model was applied to analyse the determinants of the market segments' food consumption. Five market segments are prevalent in the Free State Province, namely: Cluster 1 (34.7%) - inferior-product consumers; Cluster 2 (23.6%) - at-home (basics) consumers; Cluster 3 (26.6%) - balanced consumers; Cluster 4 (12.3%) - value-added-oriented consumers, and Cluster 5 (2.6%) - high-frequency consumers (broad product range). The final logit model that was applied consisted broadly of economic and non-economic variables. The results show that significant differences prevail amongst the five market segments, for both economic and non-economic variables included in the model. Producers, marketers and other participants in the food value chain can use this as a basis from which appropriate marketing strategies could be developed, formalised and implemented.

B	Chlosta, D		MacGregor, SP; Carleton, T		Chlosta, Dagmar			Revolutionizing the Value Chain in the Sporting Goods Industry Through Virtualization	SUSTAINING INNOVATION:COLLABORATION MODELS FOR A COMPLEX WORLD	Innovation Technology and Knowledge Management		English	Article; Book Chapter								The sporting goods market is a (sic)59-billion business at wholesale. Add to that a fashion wholesale market of (sic)125 billion, and you arrive at a sizeable industry that continues to build its value chain on traditional processes and technologies. This chapter discusses how a major sporting goods company, like many other consumer goods companies, faced the challenge of shortening product creation lead times to get closer to the consumer, reducing costs in the supply chain to improve the bottom line, and bringing its sales and marketing processes to the next level. An overhaul of the value chain was essential to meet the demands of the twenty-first century and delight consumers with a truly new brand experience. These challenges led to the creation of the virtualization strategy-a revolutionary, innovative approach to the value chain, unique in the sporting goods industry. The creation and implementation of virtualization became an innovation driver in cross-functional collaboration, speed to market, and supply chain efficiencies, and ultimately turned into a consumer stimulus.

CASE STUDY IN PYMES OF THE PARTY OF CNEL. SUAREZ, BUENOS AIRES	SABERES			Spanish	Article						Cooperation; Competition; Rural tourism	BUSINESS NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	This article focuses on the nature of the network developed by the Grupo de Cambio Rural (INTA) "Cortaderas II" of Coronel Suarez (Buenos Aires province) in the field of agrotourism. It also seeks to explore if that particular kind of institutional networking falls in the concept of coopetition as long as both, cooperation and conflict, occur. It is a case study in which information was gathered throughout interviews, surveys and direct observation. Preliminary results show that the Grupo de Cambio Rural sets up as a local business network whose agents participate without internal hierarchies in the value chain, mainly seeking solutions to market access. The predominant attitude is cooperation and solidarity. However, as the network evolves over time, rupture and competitive behavior may arise among its members as a result of internal symmetries, competition and shared knowledge.

J	Ewert, J				Ewert, Joachim			Is 'embeddedness' always good for economic development? The case of the South African wine industry	AGER-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS SOBRE DESPOBLACION Y DESARROLLO RURAL			English	Article						embeddedness; wine; regulation; South Africa		A great deal of the 'embeddedness' literature is based on the premise that increased 'local' embeddedness is inherently beneficial for a firm, industry or a whole region. Put differently, it is often assumed that the level of 'embeddedness' is proportional to how successful a commodity or value chain is. A study of the South African wine industry shows that this is not always the case. In fact, even a cursory reading of the history of the industry before the early 1990s clearly demonstrates that the opposite can be the case, i.e. that 'deep' local embeddedness can result in 'path dependency', 'lock- in' and very little innovation. Although the Cape wine industry expanded throughout the 20th century, and became increasingly embedded into the local political system, regulation had the effect that most of what the industry produced over the next seven decades was low quality wine, barely able to compete in international markets. It was only when the industry was deregulated and exposed to the force of international markets, that the creative synergy embedded in the Cape cluster could come to the fore and play its beneficial part, resulting in improved quality and competitiveness.

India possesses the world's second largest arable land area and the largest area under irrigation. India now ranks third worldwide in terms of the value of agri-food production, trailing only China and the European Union. In this paper, we use an interdisciplinary approach to assess prospects for India's production, consumption and trade in agri-food products for the next decade. Key drivers and determinants include the expansion of enabling infrastructure, water governance and prospective physical and institutional improvements to India's value chain.

Successive monopolies and product variety	APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS			English	Article						double marginalization; successive monopolies; product variety; price obfuscation	DOUBLE MARGINALIZATION; BILATERAL MONOPOLY; MARKET-STRUCTURE; LESSONS; PRICE	If there is a shift of market power from manufacturers to retailers or from retailers to manufacturers, how are consumers affected? When the value chain has successive firms, each with market power, the shifting balance of power up or down the chain (away from the consumer or towards the consumer, respectively) can lead to a further fractionation of the consumer market, meaning greater product variety. If retailers have a minimum efficient scale greater than manufacturers, a shift in bargaining power from manufacturers to retailers will increase consumer welfare while market fractionation can enhance firms' abilities to price discriminate, capturing some of this consumer surplus.

A preliminary step in this process includes mapping and quantifying the production chain. We present the results of applying the method to one of the most important agribusiness chains in Brazil-the cotton sector. The Gross Domestic Product for the cotton sector in the 2010-2011 crop year was estimated at nearly $19.2 billion. We show the interconnections between the links in the chain and its ability to generate revenues, taxes and jobs.

J	Pauline, L				Pauline, Laval			Dynamics of knowledge and exchanges of a non timber forest product in border territory. The case of acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) in the Lower Oyapock	CONFINS-REVUE FRANCO-BRESILIENNE DE GEOGRAPHIE-REVISTA FRANCO-BRASILEIRA DE GEOGRAFIA			French	Article						ethnoecology; French Guiana; non-timber forest products; value chain		Acai palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.), also called wassai or pinot in French Guyana, is native from the Amazon Basin in South America. From its fruits, indigenous people are used to prepare a thick juice, which is a staple food during the period of fruiting of the palm tree. This juice is henceforth fashionable in urban zones in Brazil, and is exported under a wide range of industrial products, thanks to its recognized energy and anti-oxidizing properties. If the major part of the production and the transformation of acai takes place in Belem, in the State of Para in Brazil, many other production sites exist on a smaller scale, because the fruit as the nectar, highly perishable, cannot be transported. In this paper we focus on the production chain of acai juice in the lower Oyapock region, which is the river border between French Guiana and Amapa, a State of Brazil. In the theoretical framework of ethnoecology, we study the impacts of the border on the dynamics of knowledge and exchanges of acai. More than hundred semi-directive interviews were conducted among different ethnic groups of low Oyapock, as well as works of participating observation, of mapping of the growth areas of acai palm, and a trilingual specialized lexicon was made. The results reveal a great diversity of knowledge, know-how and uses of this palm tree among the nine ethnic groups living in the region. These are mostly specific to each group, and in loss of speed, safe concerning the consumption of nectar, which is common to all the ethnic groups and is increasing. The knowledge and skills dedicated to palm domestication and to the preparation of the nectar are clarified. With the aim of understanding the distribution of the palm tree on this territory, the mapping of the zones of growth of the palm tree in the region is established by taking into account three main ecosystems distinguished by indigenous people, as well as the zones of collection and circuits followed by fruits and juice throughout the process of production and consumption. The final discussion approaches the problem of tenure of lands on each bank of the river Oyapock. The situation is blocked and that hinders the conditions of collection fruits, and slows down the improvement of collected volumes. Finally, we question the impact of the construction of a bridge on the Oyapock river, on the organization of the actors of the network.

J	Poon, D				Poon, Daniel			China's move up the value chain: Implications for Canada	CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY			English	Article						Canada; China; Economy; Value chains		With Canada's main trading partners under severe economic and political duress, the pre-crisis strategy of engaging globalization primarily intermediated by leading U.S. firms and production networks is ill-suited for the next stage of globalization, in which emerging economies like China are playing a larger role. The materially different post-crisis global setting requires adaptation if Canada wishes to better harness and balance the gains from globalization. Such a strategy is not without risk and will not be accomplished in the short term, but will ultimately prove to be a crucial factor in Canada's long-term prosperity, welfare and employment prospects in a less US centric world order.

S degree and upper took part in the statistical universe of this survey. 232 people were chosen by using systematic sampling method and the sample size formula. To collect data, two researcher-made questionnaires of KM and HRD have been used. Also content validity and face validity of questionnaires in this research were confirmed by experts. The validity of both questionnaires was estimated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient (alpha) which equals to 0.87 in KM and 0.83 in HRD. The result has shown that there is a relationship between KM and employee participation (r = 82%, alpha = 0.001), a relationship between KM and employee empowerment (r = 76%, alpha = 0.001) and a relationship between KM and employee training (r = 63%, alpha = 0.001).

Value-added is enjoyed by tens of millions of people involved in the value chain. But, the business is experiencing severe challenges to the issue of certification and forest products (green or certified furniture) and the scarcity of wood. Certified furniture is intended for preservation of forest resources, the healthy processing of furniture making as well as improving the welfare of artisans. From the supply side of certified furniture, large producers have been prepared while small producers are not ready. From the demand side, domestic consumers only want to pay less for certified furniture, while British and Norway consumers are 16% 7.5% respectively. The increase in willingness to pay is lower than the certified furniture prices increased between 6-30%., Certification can be done by a third party accredited by the Tropical Forest Trust (TFT), Indonesian Ecolabel Institute (LEI), or Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). When the increase in production costs are higher than the desire of consumers to pay, then the certified furniture becomes difficult to be realized. Need specific strategies to market certified furniture. This article is a case study in Jepara furniture craftsmen who accounted for 10% of national exports.

The question arises on whether construction companies have superior abilities as real estate service providers. We have examined the value implications of 106 large merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the construction industry worldwide from 1986 to 2006. We inquire if a vertical expansion of the construction value chain in the real estate life cycle through M&A leads to the creation of shareholder value. We find out that this is not the case. M&A success is mainly determined by industry-specific size effects and common agency conflicts.

A Computer-Aided Process Simulation Model to Navigate Value Chain Reconfiguration Using a Three-Layered Methodology	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Balanced scorecard; analytic hierarchy process; architecture of integrated information system; event-driven process chains; systems thinking; value chain; critical success factor; key performance indicators	BUSINESS; AHP; FRAMEWORK; TOOL	This paper develops a computer-aided process simulation model (CPSM) to navigate value chain reconfiguration. The model uses a three-layered methodology incorporating the principle of knowledge-integrated traceability (KIT) to create more efficient performance measures and provides a rigorous and stepwise clustered module structure that will act as a guideline for all entities decision makers are involved. The model is based on three kinds of mature toolsets variable. First, an in-depth interview of a group of experts makes the BSC (Balanced Scorecard) KIT model along with AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) technique into an integrated AHP-BSC structure. Second, internal validation of core propositions during CPSM development is then used to construct an account both qualitative and quantitative decision factors in the best delivery causality diagram of theory-building mode. Defining the KIT of toolset variables into two specific themes allows a practical hierarchy for AHP-BSC structure to be evaluated without excessive computation barriers, and the systems thinking archetype of strategic activities in the ARIS-EPCs (Architecture of Integrated Information System/extending Event-driven Process Chains) architecture delivers the validity and reliability of research methodology as validation model of CPSM development. Third, the hybrid ST-ARIS (System Thinking) simulation model is constructed based on the feasibility test of relevant decision factors whether or not KPI (Key Performance Indicator) could be measured. The reconfiguration provides new insights for contributing to the foundations to link the process capability of the value chain with the three-layered methodology, and emphasises the CPSM development by highlighting a specific approach associated with KIT.

With a literature review on the ecology of enterprises and value chain system and tried to understand how to give the interactions between members of the same chain. Seeking representation and identify the strength of each level. It was selected for this research an automaker, market leader, in popular new cars. For data collection were developed a structured questionnaire (survey) with open questions and a Likert scale. Despite the quantitative character, the survey sought to obtain respondents' impressions about the current relationship and prospected with the other members of your value system (suppliers, competitors and customers). The result shows that in this segment, the customer and the supplier (automaker) have a great bargaining power over automotive Dealers, providing little leeway in the strategies. Compared to competitors, it was observed that there is still a dim view and undefined by the managers of the dealerships, meaning that in addition to monitoring of prices and promotions, nothing more is known about the main competitors.

The present study raises questions about whether various financial sources contributed differentially to their portfolio firms during the market boom of 2000. Results show that no single capital source showed better performance, and only corporate venture capitalists contributed to intermediate goods firms. The latter finding might reflect the unique ability of corporate venture capitalists to use vertical value-chain linkages for their investments.

Billions of dollars have been invested, both to enhance the diets of chronically undernourished people in development settings, and to support nutritional needs during conflicts and natural disasters. Objective: Review the institutional processes-from procurement to delivery-that support this programming. Methods: We examined the systems that govern and oversee the many components of food aid programming and the extent to which they support a whole-of-government, multi-agency food aid agenda. We conducted consultations with US government employees and contractors, academics, industry representatives, donor agency staff United Nations personnel, and field-level food aid programming technical staff from many countries. A survey of USAID implementing partners conducted among 64 responding offices in 40 countries provided data on the use and effectiveness of enriched, fortified, or blended Title II commodities, the use of new commodities, and related procurement or logistics aspects. Expert panels provided input and feedback throughout the process. Results: We identified potential improvements to overall delivery and cost-effectiveness of USAID programming to better meet the nutrition needs of beneficiaries. Options include changes in product formulation, the range of products provided, and/or the modes of product approval, processing, procurement, and distribution. This research points to several improvements in processes related to food aid: 1) Establish an interagency committee to oversee all government interests in the food aid agenda through an ongoing review process. 2) Enhance processes and quality assurance along the product value chain including the importance of effective interaction with the private sector to incorporate industry best practices and create public-private partnerships to promote product innovations. 3) Strengthen the evidence base for innovations in products, programming approaches, and institutional processes. Conclusion: Successful programming requires knowledge and understanding of the unit cost of impact, not simply tonnage and "numbers of hungry people fed". Empirical rigor is essential; any significant program changes, including those recommended here, should be tested and monitored.

J	Alves, S				Alves, Simone			Differentiation Strategies in Mature Markets: A view from the segment of hospitality services	SISTEMAS & GESTAO			Portuguese	Article						Marketing strategies; Differentiation; Innovation; Hospitality; Life Cycle		This theoretical essay approaches the innovations in hotel services in the context of the marketing strategies adopted by companies operating in this segment, which represents an important link of the travel and tourism services 'value chain. The sector can be considered as in the stage of maturity on its life cycle, represented a typically mature market. Thus, innovation on the services offers to its customers is of paramount importance to ensure not only survival and profitability of these companies to face increasingly fierce competition, but also the revitalization of the segment as a whole. It presents an analysis based on the typology of innovations proposed by Moore (2005), associated with the life cycle-maturity category, classifying real cases of the worldwide hospitality market, selected from literature sources specialized in tourism and identified by tourism experts as trends for differentiation and/or innovation in this segment. It also identifies the key innovation strategic differentials related to three aspects: the basis of differentiation factors (SCHNAARS, 1998), core competences priority and value disciplines required (TREACY and WIERSENA, 1993). The results suggest a set of six groups of innovation, namely: boutique, design and exclusive hotels; fashion hotels (or fashionistas hotels); feminine hotels (or exclusive offers for women), "green" hotels, "techies" hotels (or which opt for intensive use of new technologies as specialized service for guests), besides a last group that represents creation of new hospitality markets (or mixed-markets) and includes initiatives involving partnerships with the sectors of health, aesthetics, wellness, beauty and real estate.

In this research study we analyze the value chain from the approach of social integration and establishment of links between actors who intervene: producers, retailers, wholesalers, transformers, marketers and local organizations. The methodology used includes: 1) identifying the sector; 2) identifying agents; 3) value chain analysis; 4) agent analysis; and, 5) cooperation strategy. The research was carried out in the municipality of Salinas, San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Field information was obtained through surveys and structured interviews. Data point out that the sheep sector's value chain in Salinas has a low level of competitiveness. Also, it is disjointed with regards to both horizontal and vertical relations. It is advisable to encourage training and technical assistance in the different areas of species management: feeding, reproduction, product transformation and marketing.

J	Lindstrom, L				Lindstrom, Lisbeth			Leisure, Government and Governance: a Swedish perspective	POLICY FUTURES IN EDUCATION			English	Article								The leisure sector has witnessed a tremendous expansion since 1960. The purpose of this article is to analyse the decisions and goals of Swedish government policy during the period 1962 to 2005. The empirical analysis covers government Propositions and governmental investigations. The fields covered are sports, culture, exercise, tourism and recreation. The article concludes that during the last ten years the private sector, led by companies, economic associations and foundations, has expanded its involvement in the leisure sector. Whereas the state used to control all parts of the leisure value chain, it is now possible to distinguish between those who produce, arrange and finance leisure services.

This work has as the objective of analyzing two service outsourcing models developed by Brazilian electricity distribution companies. Interviews in situ with stakeholders from both companies and from the outsourcing companies were made along with visits. The main contribution is that outsourcing activities require more sophisticated management models, suggested by the need to increase technical and managerial capabilities in the firms.

J	Borges-Rey, EL				Borges-Rey, Eddy L.			Buhoneros' reggaeton: Emerging Venezuelan musical practices through mediations in the informal sociopolitical ecosystem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDIA & CULTURAL POLITICS			English	Article						musical identity; communicating mediations; sharing; musical practices; informal commerce; Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; social networks		The following article explores the musical practices and communicating mediations carried out in each stage of the music industry's value chain in Venezuela, in order to observe the way those mediations influence the actors involved, determining the elements that both interact and define the Venezuelan's musical identity taking reggaeton (very broadly speaking, reggaeton is a Latinized derivative of Jamaican reggae, originating in Puerto Rico, via an interpretation of Panamanian reggae) as a case study. With this purpose, the research has used some empirical data and qualitative techniques, such as participants' observation, interviews and netnography, as well as quantitative data obtained from the main statistical sources in the country. After establishing the state of the art, the study raises a number of questions to be discussed: (a) the features reaffirmed through a transculturalization process - mainly led by reggaeton - in the Venezuelan's musical identity; (b) the creative uses the consumer has given to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in order to participate in the new communicating dynamics on the Internet; and (c) the effects that content appropriations, mainly encouraged by the habits of the new Internet user or Venezuelan informal commerce, are having in the country's music industry.

J	Mejia, MG				Garcia Mejia, Mauricio			Methodology for Diagnosis, Prevention and Control of Corruption in Programs of Citizen Security	REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA			Spanish	Article						Public Security; Violence; Delinquency; Administrative Corruption; Governmental Control; Methodology; Proposal; Latin America		Corruption and insecurity are intimately linked. Crime uses corruption to gain the support from the authorities to continue their criminal activities, and deteriorating public security and democratic governance. The actors involved in public safety programs are particularly susceptible to corruption due to low wages, weak controls and general institutional weakness in many countries of Latin American region. It is therefore necessary to define a systematic process of identifying, analyzing and responding to risks of corruption in citizens' security programs. The proposed methodology, based on the value chain allows this, increasing probability of success achieving their expected objectives of scope, cost, time and quality. The critical macro-processes of the value chain of public safety identified are: (i) developing security policies; (ii) prevention of violence; (iii) control and sanction; (iv) rehabilitation and reintegration into society; and (v) monitoring and evaluation of policies. The administrative and support processes are: (i) infrastructure of the organization, (ii) developing technology, (iii) managing human resources, and (iv) managing supply. This methodology is complemented by risk analysis methodologies of systemic corruption in the countries. The proposed methodology is purposeful in the sense that it raises a number of measures to address identified risks. If corruption in citizens' security institutions is not prevented, the vicious circle insecurity-corruption could bring many countries in the region to serious political instability, loss of control of its territory and extended wars of rival groups with loss of lives.

With an increasingly dynamic environment of Mobile Services and multiple Mobile Devices, however, and with an ever changing ecosystem, characterized by new value chain entrants, new (partial) identities need to be provided for the end users. Here, emerging Secure Elements such as Stickers and Secure SD cards can be leveraged in addition to the omnipresent SIM card / UICC. For future services though, even more flexible, secure and privacy enhanced Secure Elements, such as Trusted Execution Environments can be expected. They are needed to cope with an ever more dynamic Mobile Services environment that depends upon reliable, partial identities of the end users and increasingly calls for privacy and security measures. This chapter elaborates upon the emerging and future Secure Element technologies for Mobile Devices. These technologies shall allow an increasingly dynamic creation of services between front-end Mobile Devices and back-end Servers. The Chapter sets the current developments of the ecosystem for Mobile Services into perspective with the needed technologies, reflects on the contributions of the Prime Life project and draws attention towards the still needed future directions of innovation.

This paradigm has become a commonly known fact today. It needs no reiteration that everyone appreciates the significance of managing the information and knowledge in the organization. However, the philosophy has transcended organizational boundaries to take into its fold the entire stakeholder network of the organization. The Petroleum and Mining industries work along with various external entities for strategic planning, execution, and control purposes. These entities could belong to either the business or governmental realm. It is the collaboration with these external entities across the value chain that can be positively affected by the Web. Leading organizations like petroleum super-majors and large mining companies have already started utilizing Web for some near real-time and batch-mode interaction with the external entities. However, they have touched only the tip of the iceberg. The collaborative Web has tremendous potential to further enhance their operational efficiencies. Many of these enhancements are beyond our imagination today. However, some have already been visualized, but are yet to be implemented at a wide scale. The roles of these external entities span across various functions of the core value chain. This chapter focuses on collaboration in the core functions like geo-sciences, engineering, production operations, supply chain, transportation & logistics, equipment maintenance, materials management, sales and marketing, and environment health and safety (EH&S) etc.	[Chaturvedi, Nikhil] SAP Asia Pte Ltd, Ind Business Unit IBU Min & Mill Prod, Singapore, Singapore		Chaturvedi, N (corresponding author), SAP Asia Pte Ltd, Ind Business Unit IBU Min & Mill Prod, Singapore, Singapore.

The research documents the shifting structure of the value chain from the north to the south as Chile replaced northern Europe as the locus of production and the major world supplier of farmed Atlantic salmon. Farmed salmon was supported by the Chilean state as part of its export-oriented industrialization model that attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) from northern TNCs. Chile's low costs of production combined with growing environmental problems in the north and global retailers' demand for large quantities of low-cost product resulted in the restructuring of the farmed Atlantic-salmon value chain as northern capital sourced the south as a lucrative production platform to service northern consumers. A detailed investigation of the rise in dominance of the firm Marine Harvest is provided to illustrate the process of industry concentration the Chilean farmed-salmon industry. This model has generated a legitimation crisis related to environmental degradation and labor abuses resulting in social movement organization both nationally and internationally. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications of the Wal-Mart Effect on the agrifood industry in particular and in the farmed-salmon industry in particular.

J	Corpadean, IR				Corpadean, Ioana-Raluca			Izvoru Crisului - a Handicraft Based Tourist Village	JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING			English	Article						handicraft; tourism demand; geotourism; value chain		In a period of time when in Romania the concept of rural tourism was related to negative stereotypes, which failed to bring the image capital required for a harmonious development, the village Izvoru Crisului proved itself as a model of special strategy. The village is one of the richest in Cluj County and has a continuous potential of economic development. Moreover, being a village of ethnic diversity, it received a stable starting point by default. Tourism has occurred here instantaneously as a result of economic activity, especially handicraft. As a matter of fact the key to this village's success lies in the proper exploitation of its cultural resources (handicrafts, architectural heritage, folklore), exploitation of the advantages provided by the natural environment (location at the boundary between the Huedin Depression and the Paniceni Plateau; in the proximity of the Apuseni Mountains), as well as the transport network (the village is crossed by DN1 - E60). Taking some of the existent classifications into account Izvoru Crisului meets at least two of the proposed tourism forms. Consequently, the best shaped types are geotourism and alternative tourism forms, like transit, business and academic tourism, of course under the roof of rural tourism. Precisely, due to the complementary character between art and tourismbased economy, the village managed to build an effective economic model, which perfectly complies with the requirements of globalization.

Technologies such as those supporting electronic business (e-Business) and mobile business (m-Business) are being used across organizations extensively in an attempt to improve operations and subsequently translate in either financial gains or strategic advantages. Opportunities for realizing either of the two types of benefits can be identified through an examination of a business' value chain. This conceptual study begins by proposing a business-centric interaction model that helps explain the interactions among all participants involved in an organization's possible activities. The paper then explores the potential fit of wireless and mobile technologies across a company's value chain through the citation of potential mobile and wireless business applications currently available. Finally, a discussion on the expected benefits and relevant concerns of mobile technology, as well as considerations for future research are provided.									3Com, 2005, 3COM GOES WIR IMPR E; Accenture, 2005, INT BAS HUM RES SOL; [Anonymous], 2005, INTRO TRULY MOBILE S; [Anonymous], 2007, PURCHASING, V136, P32; AT&T, 2006, LAYING GROUNDW WIMAX; AT&T, 2007, MARK BRIEF AG WIR LA; AT&T, 2007, VERT APPL WIR LANS; AT&T, 2007, RAD FREQ ID; AT&T, 2007, MAK CAS ENT MOB; Bergells L., 2004, WIRELESS ADVERTISING; Biesecker C., 2006, C41 NEWS        1123, P1; Bryant J., 2007, CONTROL ENG, V54, P8; Collett S., 2003, COMPUTER WORLD  0523; Coursaris C, 2003, CAN J ADM SCI, V20, P54; COURSARIS C, 2002, Q J ELECT COMMER, V0003, P00247; DAVIS FD, 1989, MANAGE SCI, V35, P982, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982; DTI, 2005, WIR MOB; Ericson J., 2003, CONSIDERING INBOUND, V56; Ewalt D., 2003, INFORMATIONWEEK 0804; Extended Systems, 2004, SUCC STOR; Ferguson B., 2001, EWEEK           0207; Gosling A., 2007, MOBILISE        1214; HOFFMAN W, 2006, TRAFFIC WORLD, P1; HP, 2007, HP BTO SOFTW ACC TIM; Hsu C, 2007, IEEE T SYST MAN CY A, V37, P519, DOI 10.1109/TSMCA.2007.897587; IBM, 2004, RFID SOL SUPPL CHAIN; IDA, 2000, INFOCOMM21 LEAD DIAL; IGC, 2005, AB IGC; Linder J., 2005, RES DEV 21 CENTURY W; Moozakis C., 2000, INTERNETWEEK    1211; Morley D, 2007, MANUF ENG, V138, P144; NIELSEN J, 2000, DESIGNING WEB USABIL; Petersen L., 2000, MYPRIMETIME      NOV; Porter ME, 2001, HARVARD BUS REV, V79, P62; Porter ME, 1985, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAG; RIM, 2005, PROD; Roberts B., 2001, HR MAGAZINE      DEC; Roberts M., 2002, SCHNEIDER LOGIS 0520; Rogers E., 1995, DIFFUSION INNOVATION, V4th ed.; Siemens, 2004, GSM GPRS MOD KEEP CO; Turban E., 2002, ELECT COMMERCE MANAG, P867; WATAC coordinator's reports in WATAC NSW Inc, 2001, NEWS; WhereNet, 2004, HUMM FACT IMPL WHER; White A., 2005, P 26 WORLD C MAN E B; Williams D., 2004, STRATEGIC IMPLICTION; Winther M., 2007, FIXED MOBILE CONVERG; Wireless-i, 2005, PROD; ZeoSoft, 2005, NEW APPR ENT WIR STR	48	0	0	0	2	CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP	BOCA RATON	6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA			978-1-4665-5997-4; 978-1-926692-90-6				2011							222	248			10.1201/b12879		27	Business; Management	Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH)	Business & Economics	BC7ZM	WOS:000355435900013					2022-01-14

The ultimate goal of semantic matchmaking is to identify the best resources (supply) that fully meet the requirements (demand); however, such a goal is very difficult to achieve due to information distributed over disparate systems. To alleviate this problem in the context of eMarketplaces, the authors suggest an agent-enabled infomediary-based eMarketplace that enables semantic matchmaking. They extend and apply the exact, partial, and potential match algorithms developed in Di Noia et al. (2004) to show how partial and potential matches can become full matches. Specifically, the authors show how multi-criteria decision making techniques can be utilized to rank matches. They describe mechanisms for knowledge representation and exchange to allow partner organizations to seamlessly share information and knowledge to facilitate the discovery process in an eMarketplace context.

Therefore this study sought to identify issues relevant to structuring of their work as well as performance of COOPA-ROCA. It was disclosed that the intermediation of the cooperative with important partners was centralized in one person, individual cooperative attitude is not recognized, craftswomen have not internalized the meaning of ownership and remain ignorant about financial performance. They avoid strategy-oriented meetings, however social activities are important. After understanding relations between the main activities in the cooperative value chain, this study also presented a basic outline for a management system.

B	Dahawy, K; Samaha, K			El-Khazindar Business Research and Case Center	Dahawy, Khaled; Samaha, Khaled			Blending Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with an Accounting System: The Case of the Egyptian International Motors Company (EIM)	CASES ON BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT IN THE MENA REGION: NEW TRENDS AND OPPORTUNITIES			English	Article; Book Chapter								Rapid technological changes in the business world place immense pressure on business executives to stay ahead of the competition by dramatically and continually integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in redesigning business processes and models, nevertheless accounting processes and models. In today's computerized, interconnected, global business environment, the accounting profession has to deal with a host of complex issues that never existed in the past-for instance, how to capture and record new business transactions and events, develop value-added business and information processes, create new value-chain opportunities, disseminate useful knowledge to a wide array of information consumers, and provide assurance services across the entire spectrum of economic activities. The use of automated accounting information system has become an integral part of accounting systems worldwide. An Accounting Information System (AIS) usually consists of integrated sets of components established to collect, store, and manage financial data, and provide useful information supporting managers in decision making. The AIS main goals would be the collation and processing of business activities data efficiently and effectively; processing data into accurate, timely, and useful information, nevertheless establishing adequate controls to ensure that data recorded and processed accurately. The presence of well designed automated AIS would lead to progressed efficiency through providing timely information; higher organization profit by progressing the efficiency and effectiveness of its supply chain; improved decision making by providing accurate information in a timely manner, in addition to easier sharing of knowledge and expertise. However, decisions relating to the choice and implementation of computerized accounting systems are very sensitive to cultural, economic, and environmental factors including IT skills, IT budgeting, and end users' resistance. Such factors differ dramatically between developed and developing nations. In addition, within the context of developing nations, the cultural, political, and economic realities of each country are often very different; therefore, automated accounting information systems decisions should be studied within the context of their own environments. Improving our understanding of the accounting information system development in a specific Egyptian context, this case aims to investigate the development of a redesigned automated accounting system in a privately owned Egyptian company that was planning material changes in its accounting systems and organizational structure through integrating ICT systems. In other words, this case attempts to explore the company's strategic decisions regarding computerized accounting information system implementation choices, problems met during the implementation process, and the actions taken to takeover these problems to gain the potential accounting system redesign benefits. Tracking the automated accounting system redesign highlights some implementation success key factors and emphasizes that obtaining top management commitment to the process of an automated accounting system implementation is a prerequisite for success.

Bomba			Transparency and the value chain in extractive industries in Central Africa	GEOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND GOOD GOVERNANCE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: HOLISTIC APPROACHES TO TRANSPARENCY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE EXTRACTIVE SECTOR			English	Article; Book Chapter								The oil economies of Central African countries are predominantly revenue-based economies characterised by an opaque management of oil revenue, widespread corruption and a poor development track record. The extractive sector is characterised by a certain lack of clarity and confusion in the way it operates. The confusion relates, for example, to the destination of the oil, gas and mineral products extracted in Central African countries, and to who really benefits from the revenue generated. This confusion can impact on social order, leading to conflict, resentment and disruption to businesses and public services. In the worst cases, it can result in physical damage to installations and equipment, and even the intimidation of company employees. In Central Africa, oil revenue has provoked or fuelled civil wars and repeated human rights violations, as well as increasing poverty. Transparency could help improve poor economic performance, reduce corruption and poverty, promote social order and remove conflicts that are not infrequently based on oil and mineral resources.

Strategic actors from the Virtual Innovation Society network were interviewed to identify critical factors that address this issue. As a result, this study suggests the characterization of inter-dependent added-values and its performance as input for managing the externalities, the integration of the articulation between business operations, strategy and IT, and waste of innovation.

J	Herold, MW; Rines, S				Herold, Marc W.; Rines, Samuel			A Half-century monopoly (1880-1930s): the black diamonds (carbonados) of Bahia and Jewish Merchants	REVISTA CIENCIAS ADMINISTRATIVAS			English	Article						Black (industrial) diamond cycle; Bahia's Chapada Diamantina mining; Leschot drill; Paris diamond market; Jewish merchants		Bahia's black diamond (carbonado) production and trade is rarely mentioned in the academic literature though reports were made in popular magazines, in U.S and British consular reports and in trade journals. This diamond trade was mostly carried out by foreigners having few connections with the local Bahia elite and the small physical volume of diamonds made transportation easy (or invisible through smuggling). Carbonados began figuring importantly in Bahia's exports after the invention of the Leschot diamond head drill in 1862. Important European Jewish diamond merchants set up agencies in Salvador and soon Bahia's carbonados were being shipped to Paris and London and thence to the "carbon kings" of New York City. Bahia's diamond trade never fell into the hands of the De Beers cartel. In the first decade of the twentieth century diamonds (both white and black) accounted for at least 11% of Bahia's exports and employed some 5,000 persons. Substantial amounts of the commodity value chain remained in Bahia. Carbonado exports were estimated to be worth about $5 million in 1909. In the 1920's, a little-known American capitalist, Arthur S. Bandler, made large direct investments in Bahia's Chapada Mountains seeking to introduce mechanized mining of black diamonds. This effort represents a powerful example of U. S. interest in post-World War I Brazil.

Problems of practical CEMIS (Corporate Environment Information Management Systems) usage	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING: NEW TRENDS AND CHALLENGES	Environmental Science and Engineering	Environmental Engineering	English	Article; Book Chapter						Corporate Environmental Management Information Systems SME; Empirical study		Up to now environmental oriented activities has been sufficiently efficient neither in politics nor in administration to gain essential improvements of the global or national environmental situation. Consequently laws and regulations have been enacted, which influenced significantly the economical oriented actions of companies. Companies, which intend to meet these challenges, are forced to consider the complete value chain from procurement over production to distribution regarding the aspects of saving resources and the minimization of waste and emissions. Despite of the fact, that the responsibility for environment protection are fixed in mission statements of many companies CEMIS are seldom in use. In a noteworthy amount just systems to fulfil legal compliance are expanded in companies. Within the last decade we have performed or supervised more then 40 projects to implement CEMIS in SME. In these projects one has to detect, that management is not interested in an implementation of comprehensive holistic CEMIS. They are mainly interested in systems to fulfil legal regulations and the connected burden of proof. The following chapter shows, in which corporate application areas the use of CEMIS is demanded in business practise. It should be possible to derive categories of application areas from the empirical findings and to find out for which reasons the management of SME didn't spend the desirable attention to CEMIS.

First we review the driving forces that led to success and present an in-depth dual case study of Wipro Technologies and Infosys. We then discuss the position of the six major Indian IT companies compared to their four major competitors in the USA, and their competition from developing countries, specifically Pakistan. We develop two possible complementary strategies, organic and inorganic, for future progress: 1 climbing (integrating) up the value chain and relinquishing the lower end 2 mergers and acquisitions utilising the available rich cash reserves. We conclude with a probable scenario of development of the Indian IT industry during the next decade.

J	Kozlovskaja, A				Kozlovskaja, Audrone			THE ECONOMIC IMPACT EVALUATION MODEL OF THE USE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IN AGRICULTURAS AND FOOD	MANAGEMENT THEORY AND STUDIES FOR RURAL BUSINESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT			Lithuanian	Article						Activity based costing; assessment of economic impact; financial results accounting algorithm; genetically modified organisms (GMOs); genetically modified products (GMP); use of GMOs in the manufacturing process; value chain		In manufacturing of GMOs, the EU introduced requirements of coexistence and product un-mixture. To meet these requirements is an expensive and a lot of efforts and time needed process. Currently, EU Member states are empowered to allow or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified (GM) plants on their territory. In this situation, the assessment of economic impact of GMOs use at the national level is very important. Evaluation modeling of the economic impact of GMOs use in manufacturing has started only last years. The requirements of the GMOs and non GMOs coexistence and products' admixture result administrative activities of public institutions. These activities generate cost. Accounting and allocation of these costs is a problem that is not yet solved in economic-science jobs. The aim of article is to set out a model of evaluation of an economic impact of the GMOs use in the manufacturing process in agricultural and food sectors. The model needs to be based on GMOS' manufacturing processes and allocation of administrative costs. In article is also issued GMOs manufacturing financial results' accounting algorithm. Research methods are analogies, logical comparison and deduction, the scientific literature and information analysis. Also value chain, activity based costing and benefit-costs methods are used. The article presents these results - the economic impact assessment model of GMOs manufacturing, which gives information about how the use of GMOs in production impact on processes and individual producers' incomes and costs than administrative costs are allocated. On Lithuanian broad legislative and normative base, the schemes of GMOs manufacturing processes are established. Value chain approach is used to formulate of GMOs manufacturing processes. Using activity based costing and benefit-costs methods the universal algorithm of the financial results accounting is produced.

Not less than 17.7% of the exporting value from this industry is from diamond. Approximately 70% of total exporting diamonds are polished diamond. With the reputation of "Bangkok Cut", the exporting rate seems to grow rapidly. However while we enjoy the export growth of these gems, the value add to diamond jewelry is still low. An attempt is made in this study to investigate the whole supply chain from rough cut diamond to polished diamond and to diamond jewelry. The diamond supply chain is modeled by SCOR model. Problems in the chain are reflected. It is found that Thailand has a potential to become the diamond exchange centre of the region. Surprisingly, the idea of value chain for gems to jewelry cannot be achieved. Instead, we test the solution of Virtual supply chain via E-marketplace. The architecture of this virtual exchange network is proposed. The strategy enforcing this network is then positioned.

Innovation is closely related to creating value and generating wealth through successful service to consumer needs. Thus, it is not necessarily restricted to the use of new knowledge generated from research, but on the development of new products or services that are obtained with creative use of knowledge, new or already known. This study aimed to identify management practices that promote a culture of innovation in small and medium enterprises and analyze how they contribute to the innovative capacity of these companies. The research method was the multiple case study with six small and medium businesses that have at least one case of significant innovation in its history. The main results showed that amongst the practices are: a) performance in highly specialized niches and deep focus on customer needs; b) strong investment and incorporation of new knowledge outside the company (open innovation); c) speed and agility in the absorption and deployment of new knowledge and technologies; d) retention of employees; e) acting as an integrator combining diverse knowledge and technologies; f) the information management of the knowledge acquired by the company; g) little concern to patent the technology; h) flexibility and informal, fluid and open communication between employees of the company that promotes agility in management and i) the management of partnerships across the value chain, including the functional areas.

J	Ficco, CR				Rita Ficco, Cecilia			THE COSTS BASED ON ACTIVITY IN UNIVERSITIES: A TOOL FOR STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND VALUE CREATION	SABERES			Spanish	Article						Higher Education; Costing Systems; Control		In the current configuration of state-university-society relation, public universities should be accountable to those who have interests in them, providing objective information. But they also must develop internal planning and control processes according to the current demands. This raises the problem of designing information systems for management adapted to the specificities of these organizations. Regarding this issue, a cost model based on the Activity Based Costing was designed for universities, which was experienced in the Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto. This study aims to describe the general aspects of the model designed and base the importance that it has, in the methodology of the value chain, for strategic planning and control.

International approaches to improve resource governance in Africa	GEOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND GOOD GOVERNANCE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: HOLISTIC APPROACHES TO TRANSPARENCY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE EXTRACTIVE SECTOR			English	Article; Book Chapter								Revenues resulting from the extraction, processing and export of mineral resources can potentially contribute significantly towards the financing of Africa's development needs. Different steps, ranging from the award of contracts and licences, regulation and monitoring of extraction activities, to the allocation of revenues are required to put a country's resource endowment to good use. This paper will analyse in more detail the different elements of resource governance as highlighted by the World Bank Extractive Industries Value Chain and present an overview of international and bilateral approaches to support resource governance in Africa. Until today, most support approaches focus on the regulation and monitoring of the extraction, processing and trade of resources as well as on the collection of taxes and royalties. Yet, resource governance should be understood and addressed in the broader context of good (democratic) governance and should focus on all steps of the Extractive Industries Value Chain.

These processes imply forms of control, subordination and resistance of the actors (agricultural worker and primary producers) in a context of constant negotiation of the social conditions of production. The methodological strategy is based on an emblematic case of transformation process of agri-food system. This is a transnational firm, leading company in the regional fresh fruit chains. The nature of the work required to take into account both the microsocial dimensions as macroestructurales, incorporating the diachronic dimensions of business trajectory. The approach involves triangulation quali-quantitative research techniques and various analysis procedures.

Pulp and paper industry offers a large variety of products and thus has some specifics of manufacturing. It is characterized by high capital intensity and materials consumption, sophisticated technology and machinery processes domination, and producing a large number of by-products. Methods: The method of efficiency calculation of logistical processes is used. It is based on the analysis of the logistical cycle parts duration. The logistical cycle duration is divided into periods depending on their increasing or not increasing of the value for the consumer. The analysis of fixed and variable logistic costs in main functional logistic spheres is carried out and the logistic costs influence on operational and financial leverages is estimated. Results and conclusions: Using the approaches offered to evaluate the effectiveness of logistical processes, the method of calculation logistic leverage and analysis of logistic costs will allow passing on to the definition of given result in the supply chain and to the quantitative evaluation of the total value for the consumer.

Operating effectively in such an environment requires a basic understanding of airport infrastructure, operation and economics. This section will examine aspects of airport change both physically, as in the planning of plant and infrastructure and economically as in the adjustment to privatisation. The importance of the Airport Master Plan is addressed and issues of upgrading airports are discussed. Similarly, aspects of revenue generation and expenditures are reviewed within airport management and support functions by means of a value chain. Finally, the negative impacts of airports, especially on the environment, are discussed in light of its economic benefit. In summary, this section is intended to provide the reader with an overview of managing airport infrastructure and alert him or her to key issues and their effect on airport economics and long term survivability.

J	Fernandes, FT				Fernandes, Felipe Tamega			Institutions, Geography, and Market Power: The Political Economy of Rubber in the Brazilian Amazon, c. 1870-1910	ENTERPRISE & SOCIETY			English	Article								The thesis applies a political economy approach to the study of how institutions and geography explain the development of a commodity chain. Focusing on the Brazilian Amazon from 1870 to 1910, the analysis develops a new theoretical framework constructed by combining standard trade models with institutions and economic geography. There are two levels of analysis: interactions among and within different nodes of the commodity chain. A quantitative-driven analysis from macroeconomic data supports inferences from microeconomic behavior. The thesis provides new information on rubber prices and exports, trader ledgers, estate accounts, newspapers, traveler accounts, and official documents. The research develops a demand-and supply-side analysis of the history of rubber, from tappers to manufacturers. It features the main rubber manufacturing countries, Britain and the U.S.A., and shows how competition prevailed along the chain, translating into a struggle for rubber supply. Rubber was not a homogeneous product. Due to a combination of quantity and quality, the Brazilian Amazon possessed significant market power, market power that shaped the rubber chain. In this light, the thesis investigates how the Brazilian rubber supply chain was organized and how agents profited from its monopolistic position. It also shows that taxation increased the regional welfare and allowed the government to support two related activities: telegraphs and shipping. The thesis proves that violence and coercion were not necessary features of rubber production, as argued by much of the literature. Through a game theoretic approach, the thesis demonstrates conditions under which production could have occurred without exploitation. In a context of high price inelasticity of demand and rising prices, production was driven by market forces. Inelasticity of demand was indeed one of the main features of the rubber boom. It shaped production, bargaining power between different nodes of the chain and competition within them, defining the distribution of profits along the rubber chain.

EFFECT OF MODIFIED ATMOSPHERES ON PIGMENT AND ANTIOXIDANT RETENTION OF BETEL LEAF (PIPER BETEL L.)	JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Anti-oxidant; betel leaf; modified atmosphere packaging; phenols; pigments; polymeric films		Betel leaves were stored for 10 days at 20C under modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to assess the impact of differential in-pack gaseous atmospheres on the pigments and an antioxidant. Under all the packaging treatments, chlorophyll was maintained during the entire storage period, and the final retention levels were highly influenced by package headspace atmosphere dynamics. Among different packaging treatments, the in-pack partial pressures of 2.5 kPa for O-2 and 6.2 kPa for CO2, respectively, for the film packages containing 750 g of betel leaves, resulted in better retention of chlorophyll. The beta-carotene content remained largely unaffected. Results suggested that although the build-up of CO2 is necessary for the prevention of browning and maintenance of chlorophyll in the betel leaves. However, either the packaging film with appropriate permeabilities for O-2 and CO2 or in-pack weight of betel leaves might be such that equilibrated O2 partial pressures could be still higher (9 kPa) to effect only a beneficial increase in the phenolic content. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Betel leaf has an enormous market around the world, and the crop, worth billions of Indian Rupees, is exported from India. Traditional packaging, handling, storage and transportation techniques reduce the shelf life and its various nutritional and phytochemical components. This research has focused on the application of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) technology for the packaging of betel leaf for retail handling and storage, which is, at present, carried out in ice boxes or gunny bags. The results of the study have implied that the pigments and phenolic content of betel leaf can be sufficiently maintained in polypropylene film packages, which shows the potential of MAP for the packaging of betel leaf. Utilization of the results of this research is likely to benefit the wholesaler and the retailer in the value chain to better maintain its shelf-life and various physicochemical properties, as compared with that obtained using traditional storage techniques.

Why Mobile Wireless carriers Share networks and Services Provisioning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Active and Passive Infrastructure; Backhaul; Coverage; Network Sharing; Next-Generation Networks; Spectrum; Wireless Services Provisioning	VALUE CHAIN; MARKET	This paper provides a theory that empirically examines why mobile wireless carriers share the costs of building networks and provisioning wireless services. Of the cost drivers of network operators, the most influential on the industry's dynamics are capital investments, which include network infrastructure investments. As the industry evolves, players strive to streamline their services, applications, revenue, and business models to revive this industry. In this regard, one model in particular is the network operators', which shares network investments and service provisioning expenses to reduce their total expenditures while strengthening their financial liquidity. In this paper, the authors integrate research results to provide a new theory on network sharing with concepts and viewpoints that have been developed based on extensive studies of network sharing adopted by network operators and service providers across the world during the past decade.

Performance measurement frameworks in a state controlled research organization: Can the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) be modified?	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MEASUREMENT SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT	The development of multiple stakeholder performance measurement frameworks (PMF) is a complex process in the public research sector. The objective of the paper was to investigate whether the performance measurement framework (PM F) of a state owned research organization could be adapted to the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). A conceptual framework developed a hybrid form of BSC that could be applied in a research setting before describing a case study setting. A case study, as well as a survey was employed to investigate the research questions. The results suggest that the research sector PMF incorporated the properties the organization's value chain, as well as reflected its strategies and key actions. Furthermore, suitable performance measures had been created for all the organization's stakeholders. Further inductive analysis indicated that the PMF resembled a hybrid form of BSC based on the Moullin (2002) public sector framework. Finally, the results indicated that the PMF motivated its researchers at operations level, however, a survey of opinions suggests there was a significant difference in opinion between different categories of researchers.

The media crisis has many faces and one of the most important is the growing autonomy of the actors involved in information processes. First, the growing presence of the sources as information providers alter the conventional space news agencies and media, on the other, the Internet increases the weight of citizens as actors. That crisis has structural features is not only due to poor economic or advertising. Understand their effects requires reviewing the value chain of editorial processes and denounce the apparent opposition between the information logic and economic logic says that only information missing values (quality, rigor, independence) can be profitable, just depreciating work journalists can save the media.

J	Nascimento, A; Santos, F				Nascimento, Alvaro; Santos, Fernando			Valuation of Alternative Business Models in Information, Communication and Media Markets: Convergence, ubiquity and pervasiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS DATA COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Aggregation; Convergence; Flexibility; Pervasiveness; Real Options; Telecommunications; Ubiquity	REAL OPTIONS; PROJECTS	Information, Communication and Media Markets (ICMM) are in a process of tremendous change. IP-based technologies and services such as broadband and triple/quadruple-play are realities that have the ability to enforce the convergence of so far parallel industries, that is, Telephony, Internet, and Broadcast. In this paper, the authors derive a scenario where a telecom operator aims to design, develop, and validate a global B3G (Beyond 3rd Generation) framework to support secure, personalized, and pervasive telecommunications services built on heterogeneous network and service infrastructures. The authors rethink the telecommunications architecture and business models to enable easy, seamless, and pervasive access to content and services, while supporting user preferences and context. This proposal involves significant changes in current industry business models. A value chain approach allows the identification of different scenarios, where the firm faces several options from which to choose. The authors investigate operators' decision process and evaluates the project based on its flexibility, using a real option approach.

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES WOOD SUPPLY SYSTEM: A VALUE CHAIN APPROACH	GLOBAL CHANGE AND FORESTRY: ECONOMIC AND POLICY IMPACTS AND RESPONSES	Climate Change and its Causes Effects and Prediction		English	Article; Book Chapter						Wood; Harvesting; Supply system; Value chain; Southern US		Supply chains typically depict a process which accounts for the acquisition of raw materials, conversion of these materials into a merchantable product, and the delivery of these products or goods to the consumer. Value chains are the "other side" of a supply chain, responsible for distributing elements of value back to the suppliers of those goods and services. A well-constructed value chain is much more complex than a supply chain, the economic and social interactions more difficult to trace. Traditional emphasis has been on only two segments of the value chain, timber growers and converting firms. The intermediate enterprises and participants have been considered mere producers of service, therefore largely "outside" the wood supply system (WSS). Increasing logging operating expenses coupled with decreasing prices paid for services rendered affected the entire WSS and the ramifications and repercussions could be severe and long-term in nature. The economic activity generated by timber harvesting contributed heavily to rural economies; the subsequent currency turnover of harvesting generated revenue in such communities was high. The value chain for forestry extended completely across the physical and political landscape, and the socio-economic impacts benefitted locations ranging from urban centers to rural communities and land holdings.

Development of biorefineries will mark the historic transition into a sustainable society in which biological feedstocks, processes and products constitute the main pillars of the economy. Energy policy facilitating the introduction of biofuels, including biodiesel, avails itself of taxation, subsidies and mandates, which are not always unquestioned. Transformation of vegetable oils to liquid fuels is achieved industrially by catalytic transesterification. Biodiesel manufacturing, as yet based mainly on rapeseed oil (Europe), soybean oil (US, Argentina, Brazil) and palm oil (South-East Asia), requires further feedstock development. Important actors in the biodiesel value chain are vegetable oil milling facilities and the crude oil industry.	[Bart, Jan C. J.] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Bart, Jan C.

There is a descriptive analysis of the more significant dimensions in the food sector, mainly the innovation process and the interaction transparency-efficiency. As a consequence, the paper gives the main hints of the performance in the food chain. The main idea has been to combine theory and practise. Therefore, the value chain dimensions are applied to the olive oil market as a case study, following the trend in others European and American countries.

J	Cardoso, CP; Vaughan, R; Edwards, J				Cardoso, Carla Pinto; Vaughan, Roger; Edwards, Jonathan			An analysis of the perceived effects of economic and monetary union on hotels in the north of Portugal Implications for management	WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES			English	Article						European monetary union; Business environment; Competitive strategy; Portugal; Hotel and catering industry		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the perceived implications of economic and monetary union (EMU) as a driver for changes in the hotel business environment and, consequently, on Portuguese competitiveness, in terms of the conceptual framework and methodology adopted and showing the way how it may contribute to help managers and decision makers to effectively manage their competitive strategies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopted and adapted Porter's models (Diamond, Five Forces and Value Chain) as the basis for analysing the implications of EMU upon the hotel business environment (at national, industry and operational level). Those implications are the ones perceived by the stakeholders in that sector: public authorities, trade associations and hoteliers. Findings - The findings indicated that EMU not only changed the hotel business environment at a national level, but also changed the competitive and operational environment. Nonetheless, as this study found, the hotel stakeholders had relatively different hopes and fears concerning EMU. Practical implications - The paper offers a conceptual framework sufficiently versatile (regarding the context of the study) which can be used by decision makers or managers as a tool to understand their business environment and, consequently, to cope with potential challenges. Originality/value - Two of the innovative features of this study are: the triangulation of perspectives on the implications of EMU on hotels and the use of a combination of Porter's models as a suitable tool for studying the implications of EMU in the services sector. This can be useful to service decision makers and managers that seek to cope with the business environment challenges.

J	Chattopadhyay, S				Chattopadhyay, Sekhar			The Atomic Views of Flat Supply Chains in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flat supply chain; Network of Networks; Sphere of influence; Reference Architectures; People centric; Molecular organisation; Globally Dispersed; Disaggregated Value Chain		China's domestic supply chain networks are getting flat and unbalanced despite its spectacular growth and rise to the enviable position in the global supply chain arena in recent times. The aftermath of continued investment explosion, especially in the coastal areas of the mainland, calls for an interwoven relationship of Chinese companies with the rest of the global supply chains. However, with new information and communication technologies, the real-time problems arising from this flattened supply chains are much more complex, multifaceted and multidimensional. China needs to re-think and re-focus on better alignment to the western values and cultures while managing its global business activities. This paper discusses four recently developed enterprise models in the light of several case studies conducted recently in Australia, China and India to characterise these new flat supply chains: People-Centric, Molecular Organization, Globally Dispersed and Disaggregated Value Chain. These, apparently different but inherently similar models have a vibrant architecture and system behaviour in their core and propose an alternative approach to address challenges of unbalanced domestic flat supply chains in China and helps the Chinese manufacturers to explore an approach to embrace Western values and cultures by enlarging their sphere of influence.

Against this background we explore the importance of collaboration in strategic planning processes. Starting from the relevant literature we develop a quantitative approach which is used to demonstrate the benefits achieved through collaboration by means of computer-based simulation.

J	Hyong, RS				Hyong, Rhee Sung			The impact of China on Latin America: Inter-industrial trade and challenges	PORTES-REVISTA MEXICANA DE ESTUDIOS SOBRE LA CUENCA DEL PACIFICO			Spanish	Article								This article analyses the implications of the rapid economic rise of China for the development prospects of Latin America. Since 1990s we have witnessed the growing exchanges between Latin America and Asian economies. China has led the Latin-Pacific exchanges. Based on an analysis of the changing trade relations between China and major Latin American countries since 2000, it argues as follows. First, China imports energy, food and other resources for domestic and export needs, and looks more like a "trade angel"and a "helping hand"as well as being an outlet for huge amounts of commodities from the region. China's trade impact on Latin America is positive with higher gdp per capita, both directly, through a boom of export and indirectly, through better terms of trade. But it is also a challenge for development for the future. Second, the trade relations are now structured into a kind of inter-industry trade. China imports natural resources and primary products but exports manufacturing products from low-wage products (such as textiles and apparel) to high-wage products (mainly electronics and telecommunications). Lack of inter-industry relation with China shows the weaker side of Latin America's integrations in the value chain of global production. In this sense, the China boom presents a challenge to Latin American countries. For the region's raw-materials producers, there is good news in the short-term but they run the risk of losing enthusiasm for diversification beyond extraction-based industries. Economic forces tend to reduce incentives for engaging in activities outside the resource sector: the "Dutch disease."In order to ameliorate somewhat the effects of Dutch disease and move up the value chain, they need more proactive development strategy which has focused on developing domestic technological capabilities and diversifying the productive structure.

HARNESSING ICTS FOR THE COMPETITIVENESS OF SMES IN NEPAL: PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES	INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNIOLOGIES POLICIES AND PRACTICES	Media and Communications Technologies Policies and Challenges		English	Article; Book Chapter						SMEs; ICT; e-commerce; e-business; competitiveness; knowledge economy; value chain; partnership		Technology plays an increasingly important role in development, be it economic or social. In the prevailing world economic order the pervasive use of technologies has brought countries like Nepal to the crossroads between traditional approaches and a paradigm shift towards sustainable development by capitalizing innovations in information and communication technologies (ICT), particularly the Internet. It is imperative for Nepal to adopt an information technology-friendly business environment so that it can further boost domestic and international trade regime in the wake of its paramount willingness to be a competitive newest republic in the globe. This calls for coordinated efforts from both public and private sectors aimed at promoting e-commerce in Nepal. The contribution of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the overall economic growth and the GDP is highly significant in Nepal, where SMEs constitute almost all establishments covered by censuses and contributes 63% of the value-added segment. SMEs are the major source of income, a breeding ground for entrepreneurs and a creator of jobs. Such SMEs' efficiency can be enhanced by ICTs which also reduce costs and broaden market reach, both locally and globally. Unfortunately, many such factors discourage SMEs from fully realizing the benefits of ICTs, including a lack of knowledge, resources and trust. This paper attempts to highlight how ICTs can enhance the export competitiveness of SMEs in Nepal, and thereby the prospects and challenges with policy implications in the changed context of building a 'new' Nepal.

In the following part will be analyzed the reality of the "e-" phenomenon in life. In the same time we will see how powerful is the social transformation produced in the context of the new technology development. It is necessary for an organization to find a proper strategy to integrate the business processes into the eBusiness concept and hence to optimize them and reach optimum profit. It is crucial in a first step to harmonize all business activities and processes for an optimized output. This also means finding a standardized solution for the business process model or value chain. These activities need to be connected or included in the eBusiness concept. As mentioned before this step could mean an adaptation to the new conditions or a total change of the process itself In the next phase could follow the integration of value chains of different companies within the eBusiness concept by using the Internet. This means the integration of technologies, systems and processes within an organization but also the integration of partners, suppliers, etc.	[Mihalcescu, Cezar] Romanian Amer Univ Expozitiei, Bucharest, Romania		Mihalcescu, C (corresponding author), Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania.	cezar_mihalcescu@hotmail.com					HERMANNS A, 1999, MANAGEMENT HDB ELECT; KAUFFELS FJ, 1998, E BUSINESS METHODISC; Kotler P., 1999, MARKETING MANAGEMENT; Porter M., 1985, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAG; REBSTOCK M, 1999, E BUSINESS MANAGER; SCHEER AW, 1999, ELECT BUSINESS ENG	6	0	0	5	15	EDITURA STIINTIFICA FMR	BUCHAREST	CALEA GRIVITEI, NR 83, SECTOR 1, O P 12, BUCHAREST, 010705, ROMANIA	1582-2214			METAL INT	Metal.

Polish companies have been forced to change their way of running their business because former strategies were inefficient. The main point of the text is an attempt at characterising how business models of Polish companies are being fitted to new circumstances. Based on theoretical knowledge and own empirical researches, the authors try to indicate changes that have taken place in the structure of the value chain and also evaluate these models with reference to the transformation of clothing industry in the European Union.

In the manufacturer-retailer relationship the experience has moved beyond transaction to experiential in consumer and business procurement activity, by engaging with customers. There is a real need for building a channel strategy starting from channel power assessment and cooperation levels and managing conflict implications for distribution strategy so as to enhance the overall shopping experience. Supply chains have become increasingly complex and time-sensitive and at the level of the new partnership between producer - distributor - consumer it is pledging for identifying a set of capability standards to ensure both, shopper satisfaction and organizational effectiveness. Within the economic turmoil driving shoppers to pay more attention to their experiences in the store, trading partners must innovate and adopt new mindsets that place the shopper at the center of the manufacturer-retailer relationship.

To benefit from the recent outsourcing boom in ICT services, India's government has directed investments into the restructuring and expansion of the local ICT services sector, positioning the country among the most popular ICT services outsourcing destinations. Drawing on national innovation system theory and concepts of absorptive capacity, this paper questions the sustainability of India's success as a top ICT offshoring destination. In the immediate distance, eroding cost advantages and unsophisticated service exports are threatening India's top position. To avoid competition in the low-segments of ICT services exports, India would have to move up the value chain, requiring the expansion of the ICT services sector into higher spheres of software design and development. However, as this paper argues, the expansion of this industry is constrained by the enormous variation in inter-state levels of ICT education and infrastructure. The poor absorptive capacity of the remaining part of the country is found to severely limit the industry's expansion possibilities. As empirically shown, state efforts to build a learning system exclusively for the ICT sector have prevented a nation-wide investment in absorptive capacity. Therefore this paper proposes that resolving these inter-state disparities requires the development of learning capabilities outside the ICT industry; enabling the remaining economic sectors to absorb the benefits generated by the expansion of the ICT sector. However, until this aim is achieved, India's ICT sector may have long lost its competitive advantage.

J	Yano, E				Yano, Ei			Environmental Innovation Activities of Fujitsu Laboratories	FUJITSU SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								Effective addressing of global environmental problems is considered to be one of the most important issues for ongoing corporate activities. In its fourth assessment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that emissions of greenhouse gases like CO(2), if left unchecked, could cause the average global temperature to rise by 2-6 degrees C by the end of the 21st century, leaving the future of mankind at risk. Innovation by information technology (IT) is indispensable in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050, and Fujitsu Laboratories initiated the development of diverse technologies for reducing the environmental load. Part of Fujitsu's development policy is to introduce its environmental perspectives into the R&D roadmap and to evaluate the development targets by life cycle assessment in order to predict the environmental load reductions beforehand. In addition, Fujitsu promotes total technology development from materials/devices to system/solutions, aiming at effective energy saving by integrating elemental technologies and building an ecological value chain. This paper outlines the latest activities of Fujitsu Laboratories toward environmental innovations.

Value chain analysis of the UK food sector	DELIVERING PERFORMANCE IN FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS	Woodhead Publishing in Food Science Technology and Nutrition		English	Article; Book Chapter						supply chain management; value chain; value stream mapping; lean thinking; UK food sector; supply chain improvement		The chapter reports on the findings from a major research project into the UK agri-food industry commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs over a period of four years. Several researchers were involved in this project which mapped 33 extended supply chains in detail and produced a portfolio of findings across four primary food sectors, that is cereals, red meat, horticulture and dairy. This chapter puts forward the data collection protocol deployed during this extensive project which should serve as a practical step-by-step guide to analysis of supply chains for readers. It is explained that there is a dearth of methodologies for supply chain analysis and improvement. Therefore one of the key contributions of this chapter is to put forward this successfully applied chain improvement guideline. Moreover, the chapter explains the subtle difference between chain analysis for improving efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed 'value chain analysis' method is distinctive in that it emphasises improvement in chain effectiveness while also delivers considerable efficiency gains. Finally, the method and its subtle differences are explained through an explanatory case study.

Andalusia starts to operate in the process of internationalization, considering this as a growth strategy for the international geographic diversification that affects the different activities in the value chain and the organizational structure of the enterprise. Hand in hand, the technological innovation also has known a dynamic phase that is the result of the progressive implementation of new technologies and the use of innovative and non-innovative technologies, producing changes in the managing procedures and introducing Andalusia in the public service economy and industrial one. Up to now, the investigations has not been able to demonstrate adequately that there are connections between innovation and internationalization. This article has as main purposes, on the one hand, the study of the innovative process features of the enterprises located in Andalusia considering the internalization criteria chosen by the enterprises (direct foreign investment, agreements, cooperation, direct and indirect exports) and, in the other hand, to delimit the main features of the strategy taken by these enterprises as far as activities in of R+D and innovation are concerned. In this sense, we have noticed several variables that can help us to define the strategies (innovative and technological) with a group of 175 innovative enterprises in Andalusia (from a sample of 263) with both the factorial analysis techniques and the cluster one. Thus, the taxonomy of the enterprise has been defined considering tree groups of variables (innovation, strategy and internationalization) to study the connections between all of them and to be able to conclude that there is a positive connection in the innovative process and the internationalization one, that both processes are hierarchical and grow in the same direction as a result of the strategy introduced.

The Case of Current TV	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Ebusiness; Television; Value Chain		In this article, the authors adapt a value chain analysis framework used in the music industry and apply it to the television industry, in order to probe the television value creation and distribution mechanisms and examine how they were affected by technology. More specifically, they examine how viewers can effectively become producers by repositioning themselves in the value chain and the implications of such a shift. Their discussion takes place in the context of a case study, that of Current TV, in order to illustrate in practice the opportunities and implications for the content producers, the broadcasters, and the viewers themselves.

However, in spite of the well-established advantages, not all value-chains have implemented such information exchanges. In this paper, we show that this lack of implementation Could arise due to strategic behavior of value-chain partners. Specifically, allowing for strategic behavior, we examine the conditions under which information exchanges might or might not be implemented. The value-chain partners' trade off their share of increased value-chain profits from information exchange against the loss of their information rent. We develop the model of a two-partner value-chain with a manufacturer and a privately informed retailer. We show that the value-chain partners will agree to move from the traditional (no information exchange) to the information exchange regime only if (a) the retailer is Sufficiently large, (b) the demand variability is Sufficiently high, and (c) the cost of manufacturing is Sufficiently low. This provides a rationale for why information exchange is not prevalent with small retailers.

In consonance with the evolutionary perspective, the concept of value chain was introduced as an analytical framework with potential to analyze the competitive dynamic of the clusters. It shows the elements that seem to be appropriate to the study of the furniture production chain, based on the proposed structure. The main contribution of this research consists in the proposal of an analytical framework of easy application that permits classifying the organizations from an APL cluster according to the strategic and competitive standards, and also identify the characteristics that deserve to be highlighted and maybe validate a special attention from the entrepreneurs and the policy makers.

Drawing on detailed interviews and household-level surveys, it demonstrates that the advent of competition is increasing access to telecommunications throughout Vanuatu, reducing the costs of doing business and expanding business opportunities. Furthering the benefits of telecommunications liberalisation, however, requires addressing issues of affordability, encouraging more elaborate uses of telephony and investing in complementary infrastructure.

This system is not only a computer system but also a system of governmental emergency response mechanism and it is tremendous and complex. The system integrates and coordinates the correlative resources of emergency response units of the city. We consider the efficiency of the system. In addition, the run cost of the system also is taken into account. Based on this framework, the Qingdao's practical situation is analyzed. As a result, a design proposal of the Qingdao's crisis response system is put forward.

World coconut oil production has remained at more or less the same level in the last ten years (average 3 MT/year).The study of the coconut commodity chain in Ghana show that this sector is confronted with many constraints: the inadequacy price of coconut oil and the competition with other oleaginous plants; an aging coconut plantation; the impacts of the coconut yellow lethal disease, an important demand in peeled nuts towards Nigeria market and the weak dynamism of its institutional organization. Four commodity chains are moving together: the commodity chains of the processing of traditional and semi-industrial coconut oil produce little added value. The commodity of fresh nuts produces a higher added value with limited urban market. Finally, the recent export of peeled nuts commodity chain towards Nigeria offers a large market and brings an important added value to the smallholders. Despite a replanting project in hybrid coconuts, the rehabilitation/replanting of coconut plantation remains one of the challenges to deal with, in order to boost the coconut commodity chain in Ghana. The observation is that smallholders have not taken up the challenge after the public interventions have seized, in order to rehabilitate or replant their coconut trees. The strategy developed does not sufficiently lay on the market signal which today has evolved. The improved material available and the tested technologies should allow the boosting of the production sector and the reduction of the vulnerable conditions of household affected or threaten by the disease. The same way, the divergent strategies of stakeholders of the coconut commodity chain in Ghana slow down the dynamic of reorientation of this sector towards the export of peeled nuts. Producers in particular, should take advantage of this lucrative commodity chain. It is about all the stakeholders having interest in this commodity chain by preserving the coconut oil sector, which shows an economic, but also considerable social dimension. The boost of this production passes necessarily through the support function of the production and through professional organizations of producers.

It has grown out of the CERGOCIVIS Research, Development and Innovation project which was committed to making the user part of the value chain in the ceramic process. This means that the product is also seen as part of a one-stop solution allowing the inclusion of properties which make sense in context, accessibility, combinations with other elements or the subjective perception of safety and comfort. The most noteworthy properties are safe friction for all users, toe clearance design, fitting and design which put across a sense of subjective safety, compliance with the specifications of the technical code, the ability to ensure compliance with standards on accessibility and the strengthening structural design of the relief on the back of the ceramic tile (Strongrib), thus ensuring both mechanical strength and resistance to building pathologies which are far greater than the majority of outdoor coverings.

In this paper, we look at the value chain boundaries of pervasive information systems. We identify a new value chain comprised of (1) info-structures, (2) devices, (3) interfaces, and (4) smart spaces that form the core elements of a pervasive information environment. We further investigate how businesses can achieve competitive advantage in this value-chain through the design and delivery of pervasive products and services. Different stakeholders at each level of the value chain are identified by surveying current research in the area as well as specific firm-level strategies and business models to determine key success factors. Based on our survey, we offer several propositions towards a managerial framework for conceptualizing pervasive information systems in today's service-oriented organizations.

We elaborate on the process where complex immaterial quality dimensions are built through bundling resources at different levels. We present results from 11 in-depth interviews with representatives from the fragmented Norwegian value chain for lamb products. The results show that to achieve customer-oriented differentiation focus you have to combine different regimes of coordination and control throughout the value chain. Implications for management of the value chain and contract relations between the actors in the chain are discussed.	[Borch, O. J.] Bodo Grad Sch Business, N-8049 Bodo, Norway; [Roaldsen, I. H.

B	Capo-Vicedo, J		Elling, LR		Capo-Vicedo, Josep			THE MICROCLUSTER VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS	SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT	Social Issues Justice and Status		English	Article; Book Chapter						SMEs; clusters; interorganizational networks; value chain		This paper tries to study the particular workings of clusters, proposing a tool that helps with the empowerment and development of inter-organisational networks that might exist in them. It is a new tool for territorial strategic analysis focused in clustering policy based on the innovation; the microcluster value chain analysis. Territorial competitiveness should be looked for by starting from the generation of external economies, from strategic decisions taken by those responsible for the interrelated networks, and from the identification and the empowerment of the key relationships among the agent leaders. These are the objectives that the tool proposed will try to resolve. To achieve this, the most important thing will be to know how to locate and to diffuse the necessary knowledge to be able to identify the opportunities or key success factors that can motivate the creation of concrete inter-organisational networks in the heart of a microcluster.

J	Durasevic, S				Durasevic, Silvana			CLUSTERS AS THE BASE FOR THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN TOURISM	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			Croatian	Article						clusters; connectivity; innovation; productivity; competition; regional development		The tourism as an exceptionally dynamic branch is naturally more receptive from other areas for the introduction of flexible politics of the regional development. The economic form that allows the regional development through the achievement of innovation, higher productivity, the competition and the exporting market orientation, presents clusters. For the achievement of those results, it is the responsibility of the complementary groups of market and non-market subjects and institutions which are connected by the common interests. Therefore, the model of clustering in tourism is accepted throughout the world, as the powerful frame for the destination sustainable development from the economic, social and ecological viewpoint. The ability of providing the higher value through the cluster model is allowing the region to be competitive and to expect better business results, through numerous activities in the 'tourist value chain'. The initiation, organization and implementation of tourist clusters in the developed European countries and in those in developing are significantly different due to the different economic development and the different level of social capital. Minding that this is a very new form that in the region of Balkan countries is at the administrative initiation stage, a need for the organization of clusters in Montenegrin tourism is analyzed. The main reason why Montenegro should decide to apply the cluster model is the low competition of today's economy.

J	Bono, JRG				Gallego Bono, Juan Ramon			The local-global joint of territorial systems of production and of innovation	REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS REGIONALES			Spanish	Article						Learning; Production and innovation systems; Local-global articulation		The local or global character of innovation in territorial innovation and production systems (IPS) is currently being discussed in regional economy. This paper outlines an evolutionist theoretical framework based on the concept of localized technological nodes (LOTENO) which are links in the value chain where internal specificity and the higher external relational density of the IPS converge. This allows the local-global articulation of the IPS to be depicted. The analysis of the interaction between the Valencian citrus fruit IPS and the Catalonian and Argentinian-Uruguayan citrus fruit IPS shows the dual sequential and recursive character that the above mentioned articulation may exhibit.

S	Goodman, EP		Gerbarg, D		Goodman, Ellen P.			Spectrum Policy and the Public Interest	TELEVISION GOES DIGITAL	Economics of Information Communication and Entertainment		English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter examines how spectrum policy priorities came to shape today's television broadcast system and the issues that will influence the future of wireless video. As video services come to migrate freely between wired and wireless platforms and as broadcast television merges with other forms of wireless video, spectrum policy and the public interest values that it reflects will shape the video value chain. These values are often cross-cutting and require tradeoffs among such interests as maintaining existing communications services, technical innovation, spectrum efficiency, universal service, media diversity and competition. What tradeoffs are made and what they cost, is too frequently hidden from public view.

J	Hartmann, S				Hartmann, Simon			Globalized Conflict-Economy in the Heart of Africa. The Role of Coltan in the "African World War"	ZEITGESCHICHTE			German	Article								In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) an extraordinary bloody conflict has claimed more than 5 million lives since 1998. In 2001 the United Nations concluded that five key mineral resources are the most important drivers for the ongoing violence. Coltan is one of them. The ore is frequently quoted as strategic important for hi-tech-industries. In terms of world reserves, huge deposits are situated in the Kivus. These provinces are located amongst the war torn Eastern 'epicentre' of the Congo Conflict. Data on regional and global trade of Congolese Coltan is very heterogeneous. The state collapse in the 1990s and recent conflicts barely left any institutions that could guarantee any control of Coltan production and trade. Given this circumstances, the paper provides a structural analysis of the commodity chain and various official and unofficial data, allowing a basic classification of Coltan as part of the regional conflict economy from a regional as well as global view.

B	Healy, M		Aurifeille, JM; Medlin, CJ; Tisdell, C		Healy, Marilyn			TRUST IN A GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN: A CASE STUDY OF THE KIMBERLEY PROCESS	TRUST, GLOBALISATION AND MARKET EXPANSION	Economic Issues Problems and Perspectives		English	Article; Book Chapter						trust; adaptation; diamonds; Kimberley Process; value chain	EXCHANGE; ETHICS	The thesis of this paper is that the diamond industry is restoring consumer trust through the certification of its global value chain, a concept known as the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. This process controls the movements of diamonds within the global value chain, from the rough to the finished product at the consumer level. The aim of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is to ensure that conflict, or illicit unofficial rough diamonds are excluded from the legitimate value chain. Conflict diamonds have become a major issue in international trade. Diamonds are a symbol of love and devotion, but diamonds are big business. Some may argue that diamonds are a commodity and therefore one cannot trust a commodity nor the process of its value chain. However, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is restoring consumer trust in the industry by ensuring the integrity of its global value chain.

The ILC goes through many phases, involves many professional disciplines, and requires many skills, tools and processes. Therefore, this paper proposes an evaluation model combining the concept of ILC and industrial value chain (IVC). In addition, the paper develops the integrated strategies of value chain (ISVC) for the different four stages of ILC. A model is established by analytic hierarchic process (AFP) and grey relational analysis (GRA). It is anticipated that the model can provide the other industries decision maker selection different integrated strategies under the different stages of ILC. Importantly, the proposed model can assist the any industry decision makers to assess the integration strategies, making it highly applicable for academia and commercial purposes.

The project aims to support ethical trade by implementing digital tracing technologies in value chains to provide consumers and producers with enhanced information about specific products; in this case, Chilean wine and Indian coffee. The genesis and first stage of the project - as it relates to the India case study - was documented in an earlier research note published in Contemporary South Asia one year ago. This note goes on to describe the second stage of this case study, which begins by mapping the life of the coffee bean in its current global commodity chain, and ends with proposing a traceable value chain for small growers of Indian coffee. It is argued that the use of tracking technologies will help increase the value chain 'rents' that accrue to farmers in developing countries by allowing them to charge more for differentiated products increasingly demanded by informed consumers, both in the West and in home markets.

Also to be able to devise and execute the strategy, under a scheme of strategic planning is necessary to measure. The statistical information available today, in Cordoba, Argentina, is insufficient to assess the potential of a territory. Is investigated here if necessary, even if not indispensable, having a land information system (GIS) to plan development and if so, what should be the contents of it. The main assumption of the work said that the establishment of SIT is a critical tool to facilitate the implementation of strategies for economic development land. This research contributes to local economic development analysis of the importance of having systematically organized information and provides a description of information that a SIT should focus. In sum, an SIT can help guide the collection of information to key aspects of ownership of value-added in the territories and can help make assessment of local development projects.

This is the transformation of the role of consumer from passive audience or simply buyer towards active participant in co-creating value. Consumers today are increasingly engaged in a direct and explicit dialogue with companies to become an integral part in value creation process. Furthermore, consumers are becoming business collaborators who have as much to contribute to value creation as companies themselves do. This changing role of consumers through the value chain raised our enthusiasm to examine the overwhelming influence of consumers on value chain as the ultimate purpose of this study.

J	Murdock, A; Lamb, B				Murdock, Alex; Lamb, Brian			The impact of the RNID on auditory services in England Borrowing lawnmowers and the price of salt	SOCIAL ENTERPRISE JOURNAL			English	Article						Public procurement; Partnership; Disabilities; Value chain; Charities; United Kingdom		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID), a major UK third sector organisation, on public sector provision. The case examined is that of auditory services (in effect the nature of assessment and provision of hearing aids in England). Design/methodology/approach - The approach is that of a case study of the actions and approach of the RNID and their engagement with the public sector, in particular with the UK National Health Service. Findings - The case study shows the very considerable impact, which the RNID had in effecting a dramatic improvement in the quality of the service offered through the move to digital hearing aids and through the improvement of the audiology services themselves. The RNID, through using its expertise, also succeeded in achieving a huge reduction in the unit cost of digital hearing aids. A value chain approach is utilised to examine the effect of the RNID. Research limitations/implications - The case study furnishes an account of impact on a national level in a key service. It shows how a third sector organisation can use expertise to leverage impact using public sector resources. It shows that even with very large government purchases a key factor is specific knowledge, which if possessed by a third sector organisations, can be used to major effect. Originality/value - The case study demonstrates impact and the effective operation of a cross-sectoral partnership. One of the authors (Lamb) is closely involved from the organisational perspective.

Cosidering that value can now be produced by several actors at once, the concept of value system becomes necessary in order to describe the process of value creation, this concept requiring the existence of organizational networks. The value networks' success depends on their capacity to generate and use knowledge, since value is created through the interrelated generative, productive and representative knowledge processes.

J	Tagg, BS				Tagg, B. S.			The IBM Services Connection: Service delivery through self-service portal technologies	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Self-service technologies are relied upon by service delivery organizations that make use of their low cost and ubiquity to deliver componentized self-service to worldwide clients. A role-based portal can be a key technology component for any service-delivery organization seeking to provide an advanced self-service capability. Portals that have access to information on the client's organization, its contracted services, and the service components provided can be used to manage the parameters of service delivery. Providing the client's management dashboard through self-service portals establishes a foundation that allows a service organization to present its services value chain in terms and subprocesses that are relevant to its clients. Exposing services processes to clients requires a governance layer that ensures consumers of multiple services can manage their service delivery in ways that make the client more efficient. Supporting technologies such as "single sign on," reporting, model-driven tooling, and real-time linkages to services entitlement complete the core technology set that fulfills the end-to-end self-service architecture. In this paper, we provide an overview of the unique self-service requirements for service delivery, followed by an overview of the technologies required to meet those requirements. We also review innovations that enable the creation of the IBM Services Connection, a worldwide deployed service support portal.

J	Tjeldvoll, A; Welle-Strand, A				Tjeldvoll, Arild; Welle-Strand, Anne			A Report on the HEAD-Ache in Norway	EUROPEAN EDUCATION			English	Article								The article examines different understandings of school leadership in Norway by reporting the findings of a HEAD Project (2004-8). The article discusses how school leadership training in Norway has responded to the government's educational policy aims and strategies in the context of globalization. Using the concept of "education value chain," the study reveals that while the government favors professional leadership policy formulated within the New Public Management framework, the policy is not implemented in practice. Instead, the training perpetuates a tradition of focusing on teachers more than on school leaders. The reasons for this Norwegian particularity are found in the country's culture, curriculum tradition, and its present affluent national economy.

J	Venter, BP; van der Merwe, J				Venter, Ben-Piet; van der Merwe, Johann			CAN PUBLIC RELATIONS PUT THE TRUST BACK IN ORGANISATIONS?	COMMUNITAS			English	Article								The last two years have seen top South African and international companies being accused or criticised for activities that do not serve the interests of their stakeholders. A sad result of this and other organisational philandering is that the name of public relations - already tainted - is sullied even more. The ethics of organisational management, the ethical impacts of public relations, and the ethics of public relations practitioners are addressed in this article. In deliberating the sticky ethics issue, the current role of public relations in the organisation as well as public relations education in South Africa are also discussed. It is suggested that the value chain can be used to assist public relations in overcoming its uncertain position in the ethics debacle by firstly placing it firmly in the organisation's value chain as a support activity alongside those of human resources, firm infrastructure, and technology development; secondly that the placement of public relations as support function in the value chain is a good argument for the allocation to public relations of its rightful place in the organisation's formal chain of command; and thirdly, given the acceptance that public relations is a support function not only to marketing and sales, but also to inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, and service, it becomes necessary to revise the educational curriculum of public relations students.

J	Constantin, F; de Giusti, G; Tattara, G				Constantin, Florentina; de Giusti, Giovanna; Tattara, Giuseppe			The governance of the global value chain of Italian industrial districts: selected case studies	POLITICA ECONOMICA			Italian	Article						production organization; global value chains; fragmentation; internationalization; footwear; furniture; refrigeration industry Italy		This study deals with the reallocation of firms localized in three important Veneto districts in Romania producing footwear, furniture and industrial refrigeration and air conditioning. The Veneto region has a strong specialization in these sectors at the national level. The footwear and furniture firms present a vertically fragmented structure according to a phase specialization. Firms have moved abroad the practice of sourcing that they were used to practice in the domestic economy. Footwear firms have commissioned to foreign subcontractors part of the productive process, or the whole of it, or have established own productive plants abroad through FDI. Furniture firms have made recourse mainly to FDI with the aim of controlling the source of raw materials (wood) while refrigeration and air conditioning look forward to secure there own space in the growing consumer markets of the East, mainly the Russian market, and commission to local manufacturer only the production of some components. These firms are intensive in capital and technology; the main components are bought on the international market and are assembled in Romania. The product is distributed directly in Romania and in the neighbouring countries and cost reduction is not the main issue.

J	Nummi, J				Nummi, Jyrki			How to Eat the Centre-Periphery Model and Still Retain it? A Theory of Descending Cultural Values and Aleksis Kivi	PRIMERJALNA KNJIZEVNOST			Polish	Article						cultural studies; Finnish literature; Kivi, Aleksis; literary influences		I examine Aleksis Kivi's cultural and critical reception as a Finruish poeta laureata under the double tension of international (European) and Finnish sources. My intention is to show that behind the need to prove Kivi to be a representative of original Finnish folk culture, there is a specific interpretation of center-periphery tension, which has been interiorized as a basic condition for Finnish culture, the theory of descending cultural values), which was widely accepted at the turn of the century (gesunkenes Kulturgut but still popular in the 1920's and 30's. The theory may be briefly described as follows. As the nations compete on cultural (and other) fields, the leading nation(s) produce(s) the innovations and the (non-leading) receiving nations imitate them. Imitation can be detected on the individual level of a single work and author (oeuvre) or on the collective level of artistic genres, schools and movements. Imitation is explained as a chain of influence from center to periphery (positive method). The chain of influences is understood to move on the scale of descending values: as the innovation moves ahead in the chain, it wears, and, finally, is reduced to a mere copy. Consequently, the center and the periphery acquire different value roles in the model. The sender is understood as active, energetic and innovative; the receiver is stigmatized as passive, forceless and dependent with little inherent value. As the creation of the artistic systems on European proceeded in Finland, a special strategy was created to "save" the new national culture from getting reduced to a passive mirror of exterior cultural influences. This general strategy was applied to Kivi, and a specific interpretative model was created that turned the direction of influences from top-down to bottom-up: Two basic strategies were created for peripheral literary cultures to ward off the negative effects of their low status due to the descending value chain. The first one may be briefly described as follows: (1) cut the chain between the centre and the peripheral literature - (2) neutralize the positions of comparable literary works - (3) equalize the literary cultures of centre and periphery. The second one could be put Like this: (1) prioritize the local elements of work under study - (2) minimize the exterior connections - (3) rebuild the chain within the peripheral literature. The analysis produced the following results: (1) Kivi was regarded as a representative of Finnish folk culture instead of a student of European and Classical literatures, and (2) the genius of Kivi was explained as a representative of genuine spirit of the Finnish people, an ennobler the original material of Finnish folk culture into an original art form and a creator of an independent form of "truly Finnish" art.

J	Oh, DW				Oh, Dae-Won			Changes in the Efficiency of the Chinese Manufacturing Industry	JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION			Chinese	Article						China; Efficiency; Manufacturing Industry; Industry Sophistication; SFA	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT	In analyzing the factors that have led China to move up in the structure of international vertical trade, a number of studies have focused on its trade dimension. Contrary to these studies, this research examines the role of Chinese manufacturing industry in China's upward shift in the value chain. This study measures the efficiency of Chinese manufacturing industry by adopting the stochastic frontier approach model, which uses the inefficient error term in the Cobb-Douglas production function. The manufacturing industry classification from EU-KLEMS and CEIC from the sample period of 1996 to 2005 for five countries (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea) is the data used. The industry classification is classified into three categories according to technology level, following the OECD standard. The sample period is divided into two eras of 1996 to 2000 and 2001 to 2005, since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. This study finds that the efficiency of the Chinese manufacturing industry has substantially improved in the high-and medium-technology industries since 2001. This improvement in the Chinese manufacturing industry's efficiency appears to have helped China's transformation from a "world assembler" to a more sophisticated producer. These findings suggest that the export of intermediate goods from Japan and the East Asian Newly Industrialized Economies to China is likely to decline.

J	Teipen, C				Teipen, Christina			Reflecting upon High Technology Companies in the "Varieties of Capitalism"-Approach	KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE			German	Article						New Economy; Software Industry; Labor Regulation; Value Chain; Sweden; Poland		What role do national institutions of labor regulation as well as work and employment systems at the company level play for the development of "new economy" industries? The article is based on eleven company case studies in the Swedish, Polish and German video game industry as well as on an analysis of industry-related expert interviews and data. Power relations between hardware, publishing and development companies play a significant role in the industry. Independent development firms are the weakest link in the value chain; they have to carry the greatest risks. The results show that the lack of a financial system for the high risky software development is a decisive factor for the low international competitiveness of the industry in all three countries. They demonstrate as well that, especially in the field of labor regulation, the "Varieties of Capitalism"-approach underestimates the divergence of industries in national economies and a leeway for flexibility in institutional systems. For instance, employment flexibility of video game development firms is very high. The comparison of the "coordinated market economies" of Germany and Sweden reveals differences regarding the integration of the industry into nation-specific institutional systems, such as the establishment of adequate vocational education and interest representation by unions.

The ICG organized a Top-level expert meeting on the "Future of Advanced Materials and Glass-Melting Technologies for the year 2020" in Brig (Switzerland), In March 2008, financed by the European Union within the framework of the EFONGA project. Two expert workshops were held in parallel and covered the topics "Advances in materials: glasses, glass-ceramics, ceramics" as well as "Innovation in glass melting technology: revolution or evolution". Three months later, the 9th ESG Conference along with the Annual Meeting of the ICG, hosted by the Slovak Glass Society, was held in June 2008 in Trencin, Slovakia. The conference was intended to deal not only with the state-of-the art in the areas (glass science and technology today) concerned, but also to address the questions of future developments, applications and challenges in glass science and technology. Special attention was paid to the future role of the ICG (International Commission on Glass).

WOCHENBLATT FUR PAPIERFABRIKATION			German	Article								Model-based tools available today allow process-and product parameters to be controlled at a quality and reproducibility not previously attainable. In the near future, papermakers will thus be able to produce the desired paper quality "on demand", i.e. by request. Envisaged benefits include the avoidance of broke and off-spec production, reduction of pulp-, additive- and energy demands, and minimization of start-up- and grade change times. If implemented properly, model-based process control results in considerable savings of variable costs whilst ensuring the desired product characteristics. How to significantly reduce production costs whilst maintaining a consistently high product quality will be shown by the example of bleaching chemical dosing in a recovered paper treatment plant. Identification of the most cost-effective operating point is mainly based on the different bleaching charcteristics of the two bleaching stages. Appropriate model adoption and coordination functionalities provide for adjustment of the continuously changing quality parameters of incoming recovered paper But which product characteristics are really relevant and in need of control? How important is it to look at other parts of the value chain besides the papermaking plant itself in this respect? Will control systems of this type become indispensable tools for each papermaking plant in future? The authors answer these questions, summarise the present state of developments in this area, and describe how to implement comprehensive process control step by step based on the development of new soft sensors.

Janse			ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPTS FOR VALUE CHAINS	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The Porter Value Chain has been widely adopted by the business community as a mechanism to understand and comprehend complexity in business environments, with the ultimate goat of structuring the business to maximize its competitive advantage. Implementing the Value Chain is not easy: a number of organizations can testify to their failure to derive any benefits at all from this concept. To overcome this problem, an approach is presented to assist the organization in creating a Value Chain reference model within the broader context of the organization's enterprise architecture.

Evaluating regional net benefits of whole crop harvesting to maximise cogeneration	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Congress of the International-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists	JUL 29-AUG 02, 2007	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA	Int Soc Sugar Cane Technol		bagasse; multi-agent modelling; trash; value chain; whole crop harvesting	TRANSPORT; SYSTEMS	There has been substantial interest in maximising electricity cogeneration in Australia in response to Government policy that created a market for renewable energy. Cogeneration of electricity can be maximised by harvesting the whole crop, i.e. using the additional fibre in tops and trash to fuel cogeneration. However, whole crop harvesting will have complex and interacting impacts on the whole value chain; growing, harvesting, transport and milling. These impacts will be very difficult to predict a priori. We developed and applied a novel value chain modelling framework that included the main biophysical and economic aspects of the production of raw sugar and co-generated electricity to determine the biophysical feasibility and financial attractiveness of whole crop harvesting in three areas. In the model, income from electricity is weighed against not only the costs of constructing the co-generation facility, but also the costs associated with loss of trash from the field, harvesting the whole crop and transporting it to the mill, separation of trash from cane, and the impact of increased extraneous matter on sugar milling. In general, the impact of losing trash from the farming system was greater than anticipated, while the impacts in the harvesting and transport sectors were less than expected because of increased efficiency that could be achieved in these sectors and the overestimation of volumes of trash and tops used in previous analyses of the problem. The analysis thus provides a more complete understanding of the possible impacts of whole crop harvesting than previously available. It also illustrates the advantages of taking a comprehensive modelling approach to assess changes to the whole value chain.	[Thorburn, P. J.; Archer, A. A.; Higgins, A. J.; Prestwidge, D.

An Analytics Engine Architecture for Service Provider Deployments	BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								Service providers are continually looking for new applications to increase revenues, enhance the end user experience, and be a part of an emerging next-generation services value chain. Service providers can play an important role in this emerging market by leveraging data mining and analytics. In this paper, we propose an analytics engine (AE), an application enabler that accepts inputs from various sources in real time and non-real time, such as subscriber historic, static, dynamic, and application data available in the service provider's network and from external sources including end users. It analyzes the data to develop and continuously refine user profiles that can be used by other applications. There is a growing demand for real time business intelligence which correlates to a shift in how that information is being used. The idea is to use some small aggregate summary output of analytics to help guide the real time decisions, such as in providing relevant advertising and in service simplification/personalization. Use of an analytics engine will enable service providers quickly to monetize information available in their networks today (C) 2008 Alcatel-Lucent.

J	Butler, C				Butler, Colin			Planning with Blue Ocean strategy in the United Arab Emirates	STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE			English	Article								Blue Ocean strategy emphasizes revisiting the value added of various activities in the value chain. Key activities should have added value whilst other activities should have reduced value. Some activities should be eliminated and new activities should be introduced. Non-customers should be targeted through innovation and change in strategy rather than competing head-on with direct competitors. In the UAE, new businesses are starting in a high-growth economy and new strategies are being implemented by small and medium-sized enterprises and multinational enterprises. This paper investigates approaches to a Blue Ocean strategic formulation and implementation by both the SME and MNE sectors and analyses key differences between the firms of different sizes.

First of all, using secondary information sources, the authors characterized the structure and operation bovine chain; afterward they identified its value adding activities, as well as its trading margins were calculated. Main results revealed that primary producer's activities represent 41% of final price at consumer level, while 41% remunerates trading companies' functions and the rest (19%) goes to sellers located at the end of trading chain. This research considered all actors and functions since primary production to consumers, directed to support bovine management decisions, as well as future researches on agri- food and bovine issues.

This paper takes the reader through a literature review to define green marketing and applies the term to Colombian exporting firms recognized for their environmental practices or products. A survey of seventy-five small and medium sized Colombian exporters determines usage and perceptions of green marketing practices. Research indicates that Colombian small and medium sized firms do not yet feel market pressures to adopt green marketing strategies, but do so based on corporate level ethics.

Subsequently, the demand for organized market services grows alongside trading volumes, number of market participants, and distribution reach. This paper focuses on sports betting as a new asset class and uses the analogies between the development of traditional and new asset classes as a framework to extend market organization. The first section motivates sports betting as a new asset class based on its economic relevance. In Sect. 2, the European market is described by product design, distribution platforms, and regulatory environment. In Sect. 3, we discuss the dimensions of market model, technology, and regulation as prerequisites to develop organized markets. Against this background, we compare the value chain in financial and sports betting markets to identify and describe three options for development: a regulated market environment, an inter-bookmaker platform, and central counterparty clearing services.

J	Le, NP				Nguyen Phuong Le			Commodity Chain of Woodcarvings: Global Impacts and Local Responses: A Case Study in Traditional Craft Village, Red River Delta, Vietnam	ASR CHIANG MAI UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Woodcarving; Commodity Chain; Global; Local; Actor; Power Relations		This paper aims to demonstrate that since the time of Doi Moi, traditional woodcarving industry in Kim Thieu has intensively integrated into the global commodity chain. The global commodity chains of woodcarvings are built up by a number of actors who are working in different sites and at various levels - from local to national and regional. These actors are interrelated to one another not only based on vertical or horizontal, but also on multidirectional relations. Each actor has been specialized in each node of chain. The reality of woodcarving commodity chains demonstrates that transnational states' policies of forest conservation and trade, big merchants of wooden products and material big providers have dominant influences. These actors' behaviors determine all decisions of direct producers relating to production process from designing to material selecting, technology and market target. However, local producers know how to situate their knowledge under instable conditions and under the uneven power relations.

This paper presents status SRM policy and research in worldwide, and analyzes decoupling of economic activity from energy consumption of domestic manufacturing, using decoupling factor. Also This paper suggests methodologies and strategies of SRM in Korea. SRM is established through various analysis and survey as following; forecasting of resource demand, material flow analysis and value chain analysis, resource market structure analysis. Through these analysis, we can obtain hot-spot and solution of environmental burden, recycling market management, recycling technology and best-optimal supply rate of primary and secondary resource. In Korea, resource management system must be linked with national and regional material flow analysis, and it is necessary to make SRM-law of national dimension for effective run of sustainable resource management system.

J	Uddin, MT				Uddin, Mohammad Taj			Safety standards in shrimp export from Bangladesh to the world's market	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						safety standards; HACCP; shrimp; traceability; Bangladesh		Shrimp, the second largest export earner, is potentially the next to garment sector of Bangladesh. The EU, USA and Japan are the world's major importers of shrimp from Bangladesh. It is already among the top 10 exporters in the world. As the continued success in Bangladesh shrimp industry depends on the ability to successfully confront the challenges currently shaping the global food industry, increasing focus is being placed on the safety of foods along with buyers' changing requirements. On the international level, buyers and consumers are increasingly demanding that shrimp is produced and exported in compliance with the recognized codes of conduct. This study aims to sketch out various activities of different stakeholders in the value chain from the production level to export market inconformity with the food safety standards. Field surveys, interviews, discussions, communications, consultations and interactions with different stakeholders were conducted, analyzed and used as the basis of the paper. The results reveal that shrimp farming is very much profitable and work environment is being improved. Department of Fisheries monitors the hygiene and sanitation condition of different stakeholders. Processors-cum-exporters implement HACCP principles about 85% in all stages of production, distribution, processing and export of shrimp. They are trying to practice traceability. Some international organizations are working as third party certification agency. However, it is recommended to ensure traceability from the farm level to shipment as well. It is also recommended to recover the illegally occupied government land and distribute those to the real shrimp farmers and processors to augment its production and export volume.

The drivers influencing the relationship between sales representatives and customers and the impact this relationship has on sales volume within Coca-Cola's Western Cape region	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TRUST	Companies within the FMCG sector are continually trying to create value from their brands by increasing their margins and/or selling more of their products. Taking cost out of the value chain gives the company a competitive advantage, but this advantage is short lived as competitors also reduce costs. Differentiating a product through enhanced features and benefits also provides a competitive advantage, but is also subject to imitation by rivals. As competition increases, companies are looking for new avenues to differentiate themselves. Relationship marketing has, as a result, increased its prevalence as a competitive tool to provide that point of difference. This research investigated the factors that influence the relationships between a Coca-Cola sales representative and his/her customers within the Cape Town region. This article was developed after studying literature as it pertained to customer relationship marketing. From the literature the foundation blocks in developing buyer-seller relationships were studied. The research methodology tested the impact of certain factors on the ability to build a relationship between buyer and seller and then tested the validity of those answers using underlying determinants of a relationship. These determinants included the ability to communicate, the ability to trust, the degree of loyalty and the ability to influence a customer. The response to the questionnaires was extremely high (over 95%) and provided for a robust evaluation of data. The research showed that there was a positive correlation between the profile of a sales representative and a customer. It is easier for a sales representative to build a relationship with a customer who is a similar age. It is however easier for the sales representative to influence a younger customer. Gender plays no role in a sales representative's ability to build a relationship. With respect to education, a stronger relationship exists between a customer and sales representative of a similar education. Again it is easier for a representative to influence a customer who has a lower level of education. Race does have an impact on the ability to build relationships. The research showed that an African sales representative should service an African customer. There was a positive link between matching sales representatives and customers who come from similar areas and have the same religion. There was no correlation between the degree of the relationship that a Coca-Cola sales representative in the Western Cape region has with a customer and the sales growth within the outlets. This final conclusion must be read in the context of the relative high market share that the Coca-Cola Company has in the Western Cape.	[Herbst, F.

J	Clarke, K; Flanagan, J; O'Neill, S				Clarke, Kevin; Flanagan, Jack; O'Neill, Sharron			The Financial Information Value Chain: Repositioning Accounting Knowledge	AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						\ accountants; direct investors; media; financial information; evidence based accounting; value-chain analysis	NEWS	Recently a body of literature has emerged from the United States that attempts to quantify and explain the role the media plays in the provision of financial information to share markets. This paper extends that line of enquiry by focusing on the implications for the accounting profession of various forms of alternative, frequently mediadriven, financial information providers. The paper briefly examines the demographic changes in the Australian share markets and adopts a 'value chain' approach in its analysis of the relationship between the media and the accounting profession. It highlights the growth in the media's provision of financial information, analysis and advice and examines the response of the accounting discipline to the changes in the 'financial information' market. Finally, the paper suggests that for the accounting profession to maintain its members' presence in the financial information market it will need to rigorously develop and differentiate its knowledge set to reinforce its value against the growing competition for financial advice coming from 'new' media.

People struggle to keep control over their fragmented digital identities, and user privacy is not correctly enforced. As countermeasures, new digital identity initiatives include several distinct federated identity models, like Liberty Alliance or InfoCard. Based on the results of a French innovative R&D project called FC(2) (Federation of Circles of Trust), this paper investigates the ways to create a federated identity architecture compatible with the major existing identity technologies while providing a secure and coherent user experience. In the light of a practical use case involving a bike rental service requiring attributes from its users to complete their registration, the card-based identity selector seems to arise as a major client identity component. The first project results highlight the need for clear and simple user information on service providers about identity exchanges. A 'Simplified Sign-On' procedure for users and the need for digitally certified attributes are also exposed. On the business side, possible future models are sketched with their benefits for the different actors of the identity value chain. Eventually, studying the legal issues related to the federated identity model show that the responsibilities of the different actors should carefully be established within a circle of trust.

These are, for example, the governance forms that are different from the state government and the intergovernmental ones. While recognizing their importance, this paper points out other governance forms organized in networks, like the so-called global civil society. It has reached as important goals as the negotiation of social and environmental standards with leading enterprises in the global value chain. These negotiations have been developed through new mechanisms that are more flexible and efficient than the endless negotiations of International Organizations.

The new paradigm shift of modern business management is that individual businesses no longer compete as solely autonomous entities, but rather as supply chains. The paper examines financial performance rates of 25 listed firms on BOVESPA witch had investments on information technology to control and manage the supply chain between the years 1992 and 2005. The aim of this paper is to verify the changes of financial performance before and after the implementation through the applying the Dehning et al. (2006) model witch related the performance rates and process linked with the supply chain based on Porter model value chain. The results show positives effects on the return on assets (RSA), the assets turnover (GA) and market share (PM) and negative effect on return on sales (RSV).

In common with activity-based value chains, our framework is a method for representing and analyzing the firm, and identifying what may be its optimal configuration. However, as opposed to an activity-based value chain, our approach is specifically designed to help clarify interrelationships between a firm's various assets and capabilities. Thus, it may help researchers and managers alike to analyze to what extent a firm's successes may be attributed to a certain set of resources and capabilities and whether there is scope to further develop them to advance the firm's strategies. Our value chain framework can be used singly or in conjunction with an activity value chain framework, depending on the strategic problem being addressed. However, we suggest that our resource and capabilities value chain will be most useful when determining how a firm's business processes should be funded, what resources and capabilities should make them up, or how these decisions could affect the firm's present organizational structure.

The stress is being put on structural characteristics of value-added, FDI and R&D and innovation activities indicating the change of competitive advantage towards the increasing role of internal innovation capacity and unique product and processes. This change, however, may not be fast enough to compensate for weakening cost-based competitiveness. Despite the increasing share of FDI companies in domestic R&D activities, their average knowledge intensity remains low. The prevailing competitive strategy relies on adoption of foreign technology knowledge to local needs, possibly with minor adjustments.

J	Lessmeister, R				Lessmeister, Ralph			Downgrading by improvement? The situation of Moroccan actors in trekking-tourism in the Atlas mountains	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGRAPHIE			English	Article						global value chains; tourism; regional development; Morocco		For many actors in developing countries the integration into a global value chain is the only possibility to gain access to western markets. The Moroccan actors quickly adapted to international standards and made the Atlas Mountains a well known destination for trekkers. This process of organizational learning however did not stick with the actors inside the chain, it spread over to other actors in the region and this at first seemed to be a desirable effect as it provoked regional development. But soon it turned out that it also increased competition and hence weakened the position of the Moroccan actors compared with the European lead firms who where well protected by efficient barriers to their activities. The paper argues that organizational learning does not necessarily lead to a process of upgrading when the market is restricted and no sufficient barriers to protect this knowledge are possible. Knowledge then will become a ubiquitous asset and the achieved enhancement oil the regional scale will lead to entrepreneurial losses for the single actor.

B	Lilischkis, S		Cunningham, P; Cunningham, M		Lilischkis, Stefan			How Bytes Meet Coils: ICT and E-business in the Steel Industry	COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY: ISSUES, APPLICATIONS, CASE STUDIES, PT 2			English	Article; Book Chapter								This paper presents findings about the use of ICT and e-business in the steel industry as well as related impacts and policy implications. The study was carried out in the framework of the Sectoral e-Business Watch, a service to the European Commission's DG Enterprise and Industry. In the framework of the study, managers from 449 steel firms in the EU and the US were interviewed and ten case studies were conducted. A core finding was that ICT are important along the industry's whole value chain. ICT are used to increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve customer relationships. Almost two thirds of the large steel companies reported that ICT has increased competition. ICT use in steel firms is similar to other manufacturing industries, which may contradict the industry's public image of being old-fashioned. However, current policy activities in the steel industry do not adequately reflect the importance of ICT.

The educational approach in itself has direct implications for business practice. The translation and modification of generic business concepts to an educational program focused on subsistence contexts highlights a number of issues of relevance to business education, research and practice. These issues are directly relevant to businesses that work with individuals in subsistence marketplaces along elements of the value chain as entrepreneurs and as customers. The research underlying the educational program also has important implications for business. Unique to this research in distinguishing it from other approaches to studying poverty is the bottom-up focus here that can be contrasted with a macrolevel economic focus or a medium level business strategy focus. We begin by discussing implications of the educational program for business, covering potential applications. We then derive implications inherent in our translation of generic business concepts to subsistence contexts. We then cover implications of our research for business. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges that subsistence marketplaces pose to business research and practice.

JEL:D23; F23; M21		This paper analyses outsourcing and the change in production locations from a joint perspective, given that both of them are considered as a de-composition of the value-chain. The first one supposes to divide the production process among a larger set of autonomous firms. The second ones, supposes to divide it among a larger set of emplacements. Although there are some reasons that explain why both of them have become more important along the last few years, both of them are presented as explainable by the classical economic theories.

J	Hernandez, RA				Hernandez, Rene A.			Is the phasing out of the Sgreement on Textiles and Clothing eroding competitiveness in Central America and the Dominican Republic?	CEPAL REVIEW			English	Article						textile iundustry; clothing industry; competition; treaties; free trade; economic analysis; mathematical models; Central America; El Salvador; Honduras; United States		The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the restrictions deriving therefrom, expired on 1 January 2005. This article quantifies the expected effect of the phasing out of ATC in the context of the free trade agreement between Central America, the Dominican Republic and the United States (DR-CAFTA). We argue that, other things equal, Central America and the Dominican Republic will obtain a smaller share of the United States market, owing to stronger competition from Asian countries, the consequent market reorganization, the rise of the "full package" system, and the lesser competitive advantage afforded by low wages in the value chain of the textile and clothing sectors, In the post-ATC era, other factors, such as just-in-time production and specialization, are the keys to competing advantageously on the international market, given the trend of integration in the links of that chain.				rene.hernandez@cepal.org					ANDIC S, 1977, LECT FONDO CULTURA E, V19; BULMER ER, 2005, 30542DO WORLD BANK; DUSSEL E, 2004, LCMEXR853 ECLAC SUGR; DUSSEL E, 2001, ESTUDIOS PERSPECTIVE, V1; *ECLAC, MAGIC MOD AN GROWTH; GINE WR, 1978, TRADE NEGOTIATIONS T; Hernandez Rene A, 2006, ESTUDIOS PERSPECTIVA, V50; *IMF, 1984, DM8454 IMF; *INT TRAD COMM, 2004, USITC PUBL, V3671; *INT TRAD COMM, 2004, USITC PUBL, V3701; *INT TRAD COMM, 2004, USITC PUBL, V3717; JACHIA L, 1999, 141 UNCTAD; KUWAYAMA M, 2005, COMERCIO INT SERIES, V53; LAIRD S, 1986, 19 UN C TRAD DEV; MAYER J, 2004, 176 UN C TRAD DEV; Nordas Hildegunn Kyvik, 2004, GLOBAL TEXTILE CLOTH; OLARREAGA M, 2004, AGOA APPAREL WHO CAP; OZDEN C, 2004, 3244 WORLD BANK; SAPIR A, 1983, INDIA TOKYO ROUND WO, V2; STERN R, 1976, J WORLD TRADE LAW; WINTERS AL, 2000, J INT EC	21	0	0	0	0	COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE	SANTIAGO	CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, CHILE	0251-2920			CEPAL REV	Cepal Rev.

J	Karlsson, U; Hyllner, J; Runeberg, K				Karlsson, Ulrika; Hyllner, Johan; Runeberg, Kristina			Trends in the Human Embryonic Stem Cell Patent Field	RECENT PATENTS ON NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The successful derivation of human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines in late 1990s marks the birth of a new era in biomedical research. In the USA, this landmark invention is protected by granted composition-of-matter patents. In addition to these patents, several others have been granted on further development of hES cell research, such as on differentiated cell types and in vitro and in vivo use aspects. In Europe, there is presently no consensus pertaining to the patentability of hES cells, and all patent applications pending at the European patent office are therefore awaiting a principal decision by the Enlarged Board of Appeal. The authors argue that it will be of importance to the stem cell industry that patents are granted on inventions downstream in the value chain, e. g on specialised cell types derived from hES cells and different drug discovery applications. Patents and patent applications on such inventions for the three germ layers ectoderm/neuro, endoderm/hepato and mesoderm/cardio have been examined. The number of patents increased in the period 2001 to 2006 for all three lineages with ectoderm/neuro as the most patent intensive field. There where 9-13 times more US patent applications filed related to the three lineages compared to in Europe.

It is a case in which several strategies were combined, triggered by the leading supplier of bicycle components (Shimano), to face new limitations and opportunities that this supplier observed would affect the bicycle business in that country. The program not only created an innovative product, but also established that business practice should go beyond the tangible product.

Content providers in the Netherlands joined forces to analyse these issues and find ways, together with consumers and all Dutch mobile network operators, to minimize or take away the obstacles that prevent an open mobile Internet. The latter being necessary in order to boost mobile data use and revenues for all parties in the value chain.

PRODUCER ORGANISATIONS AND MARKET CHAINS: FACILITATING TRAJECTORIES OF CHANGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article; Book Chapter								The introduction of a fair trade standard in the fresh fruit sector in 1996 has proven to be a successful initiative to provide smallholder producers with an opportunity to access rapidly expanding supermarket retail segments in many European countries. However, the recent arrival of multinational companies in the fair trade arena threatens to push smallholders once again out of the international retail market. The author argues that co-ownership of the trading firm and the direct influence of producers on value chain development should guarantee the benefits of fair trade for small farmers.

J	Marttila, R				Marttila, Risto			Global Benchmark study shows: Solution business can double profits	PAPERI JA PUU-PAPER AND TIMBER			Finnish	Article								'Solution business' is now making rapid inroads in the process industry. Tom Lindholm of the consulting company Vectia, which specializes in customer-oriented business development, says that companies are increasingly expanding their product sales-based business models towards solution business (article on pages 316-318). "A global study conducted by our company shows beyond doubt that companies employing a solution business approach produce much better financial results than companies who focus only on their products. Several companies have actually doubled their profits", he says. Lindholm argues that many companies in the process industry are still clinging to the concept of simply selling their products - tonnes, litres or kilowatt hours - and nothing else. They do not control the whole of the value chain, which is in much more important. For example, a paper manufacturer supplies paper to newspaper or magazine publishers, who then sell their products to consumers; alternatively, paper is supplied to printers, who in turn sell their services. Extending the value chain leads to the very core of solution business, which proceeds from product enhancement and application enhancement to end-use enhancement.										0	0	0	0	0	FINNISH PAPER TIMBER	HELSINKI	SNELLMANINKATU 13, PL PO BOX 155, FIN-00171 HELSINKI, FINLAND	0031-1243			PAP PUU-PAP TIM	Pap.

Some organizations have applied these methodologies and performance models. However, none of these provides a general methodological framework where systematic steps may be taken by a company in order to ascertain how to develop a project appropriately when change in processes is involved, regardless of the methodology or performance model implemented. In this article a methodological framework is presented that has been developed as the result of the comparison of some of the existing methodologies and the work done by the author as a consultant. This methodology has been designed to be applied by work teams of companies in charge of the re- design and improvement projects on processes.

J	Schmierl, K				Schmierl, Klaus			Transformative capabilities in the "very Old economy": Intersectoral Innovation networks and learning alliances	REVUE INTERVENTIONS ECONOMIQUES-PAPERS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article						innovation networks; learning; learning alliances; knowledge creation		The central starting point of the paper is that well-known classical patterns of creating innovations are changing. Innovation processes aren't originated exclusively within ''knowledge intensive' (high-tech) companies any more, but rather mutually between companies of different sectors. This has twofold consequences: On the one hand, the so-called high-tech industry influences non-high-tech branches as well as important suppliers of innovative solutions. On the other hand, the particular requirements and conditions of so-called low-tech branches affect companies of high-tech industries as specific drivers of innovation, too. Considered as a productive force, intersectoral cooperation becomes a main source of innovation, further growing in importance; innovation processes are more and more organized along "distributed knowledge bases" across economic sectors. Therefore, the main thesis of the paper is that today's knowledge isn't located within one company originating from one industrial sector any more, but is distributed along the respective value-chain and various sectors. At the same time, the "network" is not only relevant in technology-intensive branches such as IT industry or automotive industry, but becomes also a relevant analytical category for exploring "low-tech" industries and their innovation processes.

A case study methodology is used in seventeen subsidiaries located in Venezuela with activities in different sub-sectors. The study shows that hostile environments are one of the factors that exert great influence on subsidiary role mandate determination, inducing a devaluation of the roles of the same. Overall impact of mandate determinants varies according with the subsidiary typology: those with a low value added activities, usually marketing and sales, essentially depends on company headquarter assignments, while subsidiaries with a larger number of activities in the value chain also integrate other determinants such as adverse environment determinism and subsidiary initiative developed locally.

Innovative biotechnology - A source of distinct competence in the food industry	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Geotricum candidum; flexible technological scheme; environmental responsibility; human and animal consumption; regional cooperation		This paper is dedicated to the importance of creativity in food technology which must create value added on the food processing, in order to serve much broader targets than the product itself. We argue that on a new flexible technological schema which may be implemented without extra investments, our product induces remarkable results in terms of economic efficiency and output innovation and diversification. But another very important issue is treated: the responsible behaviour of the traceability operators which act in cooperative way in term of product research innovation spread on the food value chain. The last important implication is to mention that the current use of our product is damaging for the environment, that's way we believe that the alternative way we propose is environmental friendly.

J	Radbourne, J				Radbourne, Jennifer			A values approach to business education in Hong Kong	INDUSTRY AND HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Chinese students; learning behaviour; business education; Hong Kong; teaching and learning value chain		This paper investigates the learning behaviour, learning environment and learning outcomes of Hong Kong Chinese students enrolled on an Australian university's Bachelor of Business degree course taught by visiting Australian lecturers in Hong Kong. The Chinese students are task-focused and passive learners. They do not demonstrate creative thinking, critical analysis or risk taking in problem solving, and appear to focus on surface-level rote learning. Semi-structured interviews with students and lecturers identified the changes experienced in learning behaviour and teaching strategies. By applying a teaching and learning value chain developed by Radbourne in 2001 and using Biggs's 3P culturally modified model of teaching and learning, new teaching strategies were developed to ensure that the Chinese Hong Kong students graduated with the capabilities required to be effective in the global workplace.

This institucionalise choice process pursues to determine whether a value chain activity of the shipbuilding industry should be carried out within the shipyard, as a market operation or through of the subscription of cooperation agreements. Explanatory factors in the proposed model have been taken from the Transaction Cost Theory and multicotomic logistical regression is the fittest statistical technique for the kind of data from our survey.

J	Higgins, A; Archer, A; Thorburn, P; Jakku, E				Higgins, Andrew; Archer, Ainsley; Thorburn, Peter; Jakku, Emma			Value chain research in sugar - lessons from the past and opportunities for the future	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article								Many agricultural industries in Australia consider value chain research a key to improving efficiencies, responsiveness and ultimately market competitiveness. In the Australian sugar industry, value chain research has expanded significantly in the last decade. We have reviewed 16 past and current R&D projects from Australian and overseas sugar industries, which primarily focused on the sectors connecting the farm to the mill. The review has shown that value chain research methodologies have improved considerably in that time, as has industry understanding, acceptance and adoption of the opportunities. Several challenges are also highlighted, including the need to evaluate hard-to-quantify benefits that value chain research produces, accommodate influences from events external to the project and address the high cost of conducting and implementing some value chain research.

J	Hassler, M				Hassler, Markus			The Indonesian consumer market for clothing: Institutions, firms and organizational behaviours	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						commodity chains; Indonesia; developing economies; institutional framework; clothing industry; brand-name licensing	HOME-WORKING; LABOR; EVOLUTION; INDUSTRY; CHAINS; TRADE	The clothing industry is widely cited as an industrial sector that is embedded primarily in buyer-driven structures of global commodity chains in which retailers and brand-name companies, rather than manufacturers, are the key driving forces. Analysis of clothing production systems within the commodity chain literature, however, has been predominantly Western-centric, with little emphasis on similarities and/or differences between competitors in different institutional and societal contexts. Therefore, this paper explores the ways in which international and domestic clothing brand-owners compete for market shares within Indonesia. The analytical focus includes important issues such as the influence of the regulatory policy framework on firm-specific behaviour as well as applied marketing strategies within individual fashion segments.

J	Fleming, GF				Fleming, GF			Cooperative systems: an information systems model for industry value chain management	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th Annual Conference of the Australian-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologiest	MAY 03-06, 2005	Bundaberg, AUSTRALIA	Australian Soc Sugar Cane Technologists				The Cooperative Systems model provides an information systems framework for a value chain management approach to the sugar industry. It uses modern computer and communication technologies to integrate data and systems and provide tools across the industry value chain to assist decision making at the individual business level, and to support and implement whole of value chain management strategies. The framework consists of a central database underlying a web portal. The portal provides a common, standard interface to computer applications operating on the database that provide information and operational support for the members of the value chain. Members interact with the portal via communication networks and end-user systems appropriate to their situation. A number of computer systems and tools are being developed and trialed on this framework to demonstrate potential savings and benefits. They include paddock recording systems, variety selection tools, cane quality and analysis systems, harvester monitoring and tracking, and electronic consignment. An alternative cane payment system based on NIR analysis has also been developed. The research and its 'spin-offs' have generated considerable interest in the Mackay region. With the strong focus on a whole of value chain approach being adopted in the Central Region's business plan, it is likely that the proposed new cane payment system and other elements of the Cooperative Systems model will be adopted on a broad scale in 2005 and beyond.				g.fleming@mkysugar.com.au					CRANE JA, 2003, P AUST SOC SUGAR CAN, V25; MCNURLIN B, 1989, INFROM SYSTEMS MANAG, P71	2	0	0	0	4	INT SUGAR JOURNAL LTD	KENT	80 CALVERLEY, TUNBRIDGE WELLS, KENT TN1 2UN, WALES	0020-8841			INT SUGAR J	Int.

J	Lancon, J; Mucchielli, A				Lancon, J; Mucchielli, A			The panoramic table: A contribution to strategic and prospective analysis of a plant breeding situation	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article								Once in a while, every plant breeding project has to face a difficult situation: for example, objectives not reached, insufficient production of new genetic material, Poor variety adoption and context change. In most cases, the Problems are biological in nature, but they may also arise from poor situation analysis leading to inappropriate selection criteria or failing seed systems. We believe that plant breeders need special tools for analysing the human situations in which they are immersed. Such tools would assist them in identifying strategies which are favourable for one, several or all of the actors in a Situation. Comprehensive sociology proposes a method derived from actionist analysis. This method relies on a situation description organized in a Panoramic or Pan Table (PT) and on empathetic induction by the breeder of the actors' positions. The PT facilitates the identification of the zones of potential conflict. This paper is methodological. We show how to use the PT method in a real situation for tactical or strategic purposes. In our example, the breeder has to elaborate a specification for a cotton breeding project in the case of a commodity chain thatis co-ordinated by a national cotton company. After describing the PT method and its use, we discuss its limitations and the way human problems can be taken into account when elaborating strategies for action.

Microelectronic manufacturing is an important subject of the supply chain management because of the vital role of the microelectronics industry in the global economy. The systems for microelectronic manufacturing processes are usually linear, rigid, and produce solutions that are far from optimal. This paper presents a commitment-oriented "sense and respond" system, called COSAR, for microelectronic manufacturing. COSAR enables the development of adaptive and configurable manufacturing systems. The concept of commitment is explained in this paper. Furthermore, the concept of "chain of commitments" has been extended to "network of commitments." Functionality of COSAR can have vertical, horizontal, or mesh decomposition. The foundation, architecture and implementation status of COSAR are discussed.

Due to the increasing penetration of the open-source philosophy, WebGIS tools are becoming more and more affordable also for wine related SMEs. In this paper the DiVino model is presented, consisting of. 1) an integrated technology platform, deploying seamless e-services to all the value chain stakeholders, 2) a suitable sustainability model based on the concept of the Wine Territorial Management Organisations (WTMO), a proper market validation strategy, and a roadmap for delivering similar services in other agricultural markets. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been extensively tested in five different pilot sites belonging to four different European Countries (Italy, France, Spain, Portugal).

During 20 months the consortium was intensively working on the project idea of developing and deploying an electronic mobile system for Bilbao city travellers. The vision of the SITMO project was to offer tourists a broad array of location based information and services during their city breaks by providing them an end to end advanced mobile tourism device that would become an automated mobile tourist guide. SITMO business model offered a complete innovative and customised service for clients and tourists, adding value to the tourism value chain. Another key aspect of SITMO was that it would also help to promote the use of 2.5/3G cellular networks in the Spanish market. With these overall objectives in mind six companies from different branches came together to put into practise the innovative and future orientated mobile business idea.

INTERNATIONALIZATION AND VALUE CREATION IN THE GLOBAL TEXTILES AND APPAREL INDUSTRY: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LITHUANIA AND MOLDOVA	VALUE CREATION IN MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE	International Finance Review		English	Article; Book Chapter								This study examines the internationalization process within the textiles and apparel industry in two countries: Lithuania and Moldova. In particular, this study shows how the evolution by an industry toward greater internationalization is intricately linked to its ability to move up its specific value chain. This analysis compares and contrasts the ability of this industry in a Western European (Lithuania) and a nonaccession Eastern European country (Moldova) to move up the textiles and apparel value chain and so achieve higher levels of internationalization. In examining and relating the relevant factors, this analysis provides insights into - and suggests important modifications to - important concepts and themes such as the stage theory of internationalization, the role of "inward-outward'' linkages in the value creation process, the mechanism of the internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the part played by the European Union in the internationalization (and thus globalization) process.

J	Rodriguez, W				Rodriguez, Walter			E-Business Operations Shift: From Supply Chain Management to Sense-and-Response Systems	JOURNAL OF INTERNET COMMERCE			English	Article						e-Business; supply chain management; demand chain management; sense-and-response systems; adaptive systems; e-Commerce		The design of e-business operations is often relegated to the implementation stage of the Internet commerce development process. The objective of this paper is to present a new framework to facilitate continuous electronic communication among trading partners in the supply chain and the seamless integration of electronic operations throughout the e-business development process. As background, the paper reviews e-business design methodology and related supply chain issues. Then, it articulates a demand-driven, sense-and-response system (SRS) framework for guiding e-business operations and monitoring products across value chain networks without hindering human autonomy. The paper presents a model for the SRS integration of business-process enabling strategies, technologies and systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management, Supply Chain Management, Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment, Point of Sale, Radio Frequency Identification Tags, and Global Positioning System. These systems can be instrumental in the ultimate SRS framework realization. The paper also examines ways in which SRS framework implementation may prevent the bullwhip effect by quickly anticipating demand and reducing response time. (C) 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Whereas adoption and usage of mobile business in several markets has remained far behind initial expectations, the case of NTT DoCoMo's i-mode in Japan is a famous example for success in mobile business, with many players at different steps in the mobile value chain thriving at the same time. In our analysis, we assume a perspective different from the existing approaches for explaining i-mode's success. Analyzing the economics of the i-mode system, we argue that NTT DoCoMo has been able to install its business model and secure its own position by employing a novel strategic management concept, which we term "value scope management."

From competitive point of view there are some critical issues for companies in every day activity: the pressure to reduce overall supply chain costs, exploiting company's assets more effectively, more effective cooperation with trading partners and improving service level of customer. Those issues are the main goal of supply chain's control at first step and managing value of product in supply chain at second step. The ability to create and increase product value in supply chain depends on the ability to control it. The analytical data of a value chain analytical data provides companies with insights into their total product cost and profit behaviour. Logistics strategy controlling that bases on value measures of supply chain has its consequences in activity managment and assets allocation according to the guidelines of four BSC perspectives. Planning of cooperation in a supply chain is a business strategy issue that should base on value chain analysis. The value chain analysis is used to identify the possible sources of improved performance. The management of mutually related business processes is supported by SCM (Supply Chain Management) integrated information system. Applying a progressive approach to cost measurement of the value chain in company's integrated value system also brings a better understanding of their customers' cost, suppliers, products and processes as they move through procurement, production or distribution chain. This paper focuses on the benefits of supply chain management inside company's integrated value.

It is advocated that as a result of conceptual and technology convergence, BPM is now ready to be the enabler of this dynamic reconfiguration capability. Business processing is increasing in complexity. It is proposed that there are two dimensions to complexity: breadth complexity (the range of activity types within a process) and depth complexity (the abstraction levels of process logic within a process). Current process design strategies tend to specialise in specific breadth/depth complexity combinations. Given individual processes can span multiple breadth/depth segments, this specialisation strategy can result in multiple process design strategies and toolsets within the one process. This will prevent true business process dynamic reconfiguration. A number of conceptual and technology developments need to be further evaluated with the objective being an integrated consistent process design strategy across all breadth and depth complexity segments.

They consist of the patient and wearable ECG sensor, network service, healthcare service, emergency service, and PKI service providers. To enhance the security level control for the patient's medical privacy, individual private and public keys should be stored on smart cards. All the patient and service providers in the proposed security control architecture should have suitable secure private and public keys to access medical data and diagnosis results with RFID/GPS tracking information for emergency service. By enforcing the requirements of necessary keys among the patient and service providers, the patient's ECG data can be protected and effectively controlled over the open medical directory service. Consequently, the proposed architecture for ubiquitous RFID healthcare system using the smart card terminal is appropriate to build up medical privacy policies in future ubiquitous sensor networking and home networking environments. In addition, we have analyzed an economic value-chain model based on the proposed architecture consisting of RFID, GPS, PDA, ECG sensor, and smart card systems in large-scale wireless sensor networks and have also analyzed two market derivers-customer demands and technology - in the proposed service architecture using the value-chain model. Finally, policy modeling for privacy and security protection for customers, service providers, and regulatory agency is considered to promote beneficial utilization of the collected healthcare data and derived new business of healthcare applications.

The main issue has been the emergence of new intermediaries which reorganise business and management process throughout the value chain. Electronic marketplaces are gradually transforming the organisational structure between firms, but have been seriously affected by a major recession consequent to the collapse of the 'New Economy'. This article focuses on their impact on industries and provides a conceptual framework that aims to show how they affect the business and coordination process, with the automotive industry as an example.

S	Wende, K; Legner, C		Cunningham, P; Cunningham, M		Wende, Kristin; Legner, Christine			Evolution of Business Interoperability in the Automotive Industry	EXPLOITING THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY: ISSUES, APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES, PTS 1 AND 2	Information and Communication Technologies and the Knowledge Economy		English	Article; Book Chapter								In recent years, the established roles in the automotive industry have undergone changes: Automakers which have traditionally executed control over the entire value chain are now increasingly focusing oil branding and distribution. At the same time, tier-1 suppliers are becoming vehicle integrators. This paper analyses how new forms of cooperation impact the required level of business interoperability. The comparison of two cases, a traditional OEM-supplier relationship and all innovative form of cooperation, reveals that the extensive need for coordination results in higher requirements in terms of business interoperability. The analysis is conducted using a coherent Business Interoperability Framework which covers the dimensions management of external relationships, culture & employee, collaborative business processes and information systems.

J	Castillo, D				Castillo, Dilia			How to apply the administrative flexibility in the entities of top education by means of the system of costs abc?	CULTURA CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						(chain value); (economic value added); (pools); (costdrivers)		The method called "Costs Based in Activities" has been created to generate flexible administrative structures in the organizations, by means of the activities classification (value chain) in primary and support centres. This system allows the direct costs accumulation in every dependence responsible for developing tasks, which on the whole allow the organization to offer to its clients an ended product or an efficient service at a certain previously determined real cost. The tasks produced by a common cause are contained in pools, minimizing those factors that don ' t generate an added value. To implement this costs system it is necessary to carry out five stages: definition and classification of primary and support activities, definition of cost instigators, execution of primary allotment and of costs accumulation in the activity centres, execution of secondary allotment in the primary activity centres and exhibition of results of each main activity. The ABC costs system is an alternative to the flexibility use in the administration of a superior education entity, and it overcomes the problem of the sub or over-application of total costs in each activity, necessary to the service benefit.

J	Vial, ID				Diez Vial, Isabel			Vertical integration, market imperfections, firm attributes and industry changes	ESIC MARKET			English	Article						Theoretical review; specific assets; resources and market power		This study analyses the main reasons for vertical integration from four perspectives: the industrial organization, the new institutional economics, the re source-based view and dynamic vertical integration models. For each of these, we identify the hypotheses developed, the measures used and the characteristics of the existing empirical evidence. On the basis of this review, we conclude that vertical integration decisions involve a simultaneous consideration of the industry's characteristics and the market power differences that exist between the phases involved, the attributes of the transactions between stages and their consequences upon the efficiency of vertical integration, the resources owned by the company and their applicability along the value chain and, lastly, the appearance of innovations in the industry which alter the way in which the production process is organised.

J	Horovitz, J; Ohlsson, AV				Horovitz, Jacques; Ohlsson, Anne-Valerie			DUBAI INTERNET CITY: SERVING BUSINESS	ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CASES			English	Article						Business parks; Service; Growth; Internationalization; Free zones; Clusters; Value innovation		Dubai Internet City (DIC) was inaugurated in October 2000. Although it carried the name Internet, the free zone was designed as a hub for all information and communications technology companies (ICT). While the original plan focused primarily on real estate, the shift to an innovative, one-stop approach was almost immediate. As a result DIC offered its clients not only office space, but handled visas, incorporation, travel bookings, work permits, etc. To further support clients, DIC set up a state-of-the-art telecommunications company. This was the first in a series of businesses which DIC would launch to serve customers and then spin-off as stand-alone entities. The park's objective was to help companies do business in the area while making it as easy as possible to operate out of Dubai. The fact that the park operated inside a free zone meant that it could offer clients attractive deals such as 100 per cent foreign ownership, no tax, or 100 per cent repatriation of capital. The large concentration of companies working out of a single location (600 by 2004) would also create networking opportunities, which the company further supported through organized events. By 2004, the company had reached the objectives it had set itself for 2007, and began looking at different options: internationalizing by either building, operating or advising on similar parks abroad, or capturing other parts of the value chain (manufacturing, outsourcing, etc.). **EFMD European Case Writing Competition Category Winner 2004**										0	0	0	0	0	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD	NEW DELHI	B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA	0972-8201	0973-0621		ASIAN J MANAG CASES	Asian J.

J	Klei, M				Klei, M			EU gas market liberalisation and security of supply - An antagonism?	OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE			English	Article								In the ongoing political debate on incentive-based concepts for a harmonized regulation of the EU gas market regulators and their governments of EU member States are confronted with a decisive opinion of gas network operators. The establishment of an EU-wide regulatory regime in order to intensify competition in all segments of the gas value chain and to reduce the tariffs for Third Party Access to networks is considered to constitute a hazard to the usual quality and reliability of gas supply services. In other words enforced regulation could jeopardize the security of gas supply. The analysis is trying to trace the evolution of the EU gas market and to find a rationale for reconciliation of the contrary positions from a welfare economics point of view.

J	Maleszyk, E				Maleszyk, Edward			INTEGRATED PURCHASES IN THE VALUE CHAIN	GOSPODARKA NARODOWA			Polish	Article								Integrated purchases as a sign of cooperation among enterprises forming retail chains are a potential source of creating value (advantages) for the consumer. This process is carried out by the integrator as part of privileges resulting from contractual agreements with groups of enterprises. It may contribute to developing some important elements of the value chain such as a competitive range of products, competitive prices and quality, easy access to goods combined with various concessions in the process of consumer service, positive perception of a network integrated through its image and confidence in private labels, the attachment and loyalty of consumers and suppliers toward the chain etc. The article explains the essence of integrated purchases and their connection with the marketing activities of integrated retail chains oriented toward creating the value chain. For this purpose, the author uses the assumptions and concept of relationship (partnership) marketing. As a result of empirical research, the main marketing strategies linked with value creation are described. The author specifies the scope and possibilities of implementing these strategies and the conditions and chances for introducing the rules and instruments of partnership marketing to integrated groups of retail enterprises.

This exploratory study looks at how e-commerce has transformed the logistics industry in Malaysia - more specifically at the downstream activities, which include the distribution and sale of products to customers. It also looks at some issues of concern and also opportunities that this brings to the traditional logistics companies. Review of literature shows that e-commerce has had a positive effect on the logistics industry as a whole in the world. It was also revealed that almost all the Malaysian companies (involved in e-commerce) studied, outsourced their delivery services. Choice of the third party logistics (3PL) provider is crucial. Maintaining a good relationship especially communication between the e-commerce companies and the Logistics Service Provider may be a matter of survival.

Now, however, high growth rates in broadband access are giving carriers a much more optimistic view of the market. New interactive TV offerings show how fixed-network carriers can compete with cable operators. This paper outlines on the one hand the chances and opportunities for carriers offering such new services, and on the other hand new challenges related to the content issue, changes in the value chain and the 'war' between the different codec formats.				peter.tschulik@siemens.com						0	0	0	0	0	THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK	KENT	PUBLICATIONS OFFICE 2A SOUTH GIPSY ROAD WELLING, KENT DA16 2EP, ENGLAND	1477-4739			J COMMUN NETW-UK	J.

J	Downes, AM				Downes, AM			Reducing value chain vulnerability to terrorist attacks	PROCESS SAFETY PROGRESS			English	Article								Like most U.S. chemical companies, you probably know where your security-sensitive inventories are located within your sites and have assured yourself that you have taken reasonable precautions to reduce the risk of their being used in a terrorist attack. What about when you ship them? How secure are the various parts of your value chain - offsite storage and transportation of your products, raw materials, intermediates, and wastes, and processing of ordering and invoicing transactions? Value chain security focuses on tampering and misuse of materials handled outside the plant boundaries. At FMC, we took a three-stage approach to identifying and dealing with potential security issues posed by materials in transit. Stage 1 was a quick review to determine which of our products, intermediates, or raw materials might be potentially useful to terrorists. In Stage 2 we looked for specific security-emergency scenarios that might involve those chemicals, estimated the risk of those scenarios, and made recommendations to reduce the vulnerability to terrorist attack. In Stage 3 we are implementing the plans we developed. FMC's approach has successfully focused our efforts and used familiar techniques to break down complex Value Chains into manageable sections and then to identify. the possible scenarios and (relative) risks at each section. We were able to do this with minimal travel costs. This paper describes the general organization of FMC's value chain security efforts and our analysis technique, and discusses lessons (including a few surprises) that we have learned from the analyses.

The hematite/magnetite ore is low grade, steeply dipping and intensively folded. The company excavates about 1.2 million tonnes of ore annually. The mining method is sublevel stoping. The final products are a hematite concentrate and different magnetite-products. The bits and bytes based methods and systems implemented for production planning and controlling are presented in the paper. Focus is on geological modelling, utilisation of variations in the deposit and associated uncertainty accumulating throughout the value chain. The methods and systems enable the mining department in greater extent than before, to deliver fragmented ore according to the specifications given by the processing plant.

J	Sheard, S				Sheard, Stephen			White Mythology: From Linear to Virtual Value Chains in E-Business	PHILOSOPHY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This article examines the development of the concept of the value chain from the linear to the virtual conception of the chain, through the evolution of the literature from Michael Porter's writings of the mid 1990s to the theorists of e-business and e-commerce in the later 1990s I argue that Porter's account employs white metaphors and that writings on the virtual value chain both extend the white metaphors of Porter's linear chain, and suggest a pronouncedly metaphysical system of thought - one which has correlates in areas of thought, including Renaissance Neo-Platonism, cybernetics and the discourse of cyberspace. I suggest that this offers a model of the advance of metaphor - of its usure, as described by Derrida in his White Mythology - and that this model can be synthesised with the views of Ricoeur about the evolution of metaphor towards symbolism. When we apply these ideas of Derrida and Ricoeur to the development of the White Metaphor of the linear chain towards a progressive symbolism, we can see a correlation between the complex causality inferred as a feature of the virtual chain and the cosmological affinities of Renaissance notions of causation.

For the case analysis, a dedicated analysis framework was developed. This framework focuses on the layers of the value chain and business processes, the two 'building blocks' of the business model. The framework tool proved to be effective in discovering trends in combinations of value layers and business processes. Amongst other findings, the study identified directions in which convergence is occurring, whereby innovation is attained by the joint efforts of all optimal number of actors. The study also suggested that standardisation allows the reduction of the number of actors involved in the business model, thus reducing complexity and increasing the chance of success.

It is than necessary to include the aspect of networks to the new paradigm of competition that concentrates on these elements of value chain that make the most value as well as proper relations between other elements of the chain. It is worth trying to build an appropriate analytical schema dedicated to these problems. Theory of value migration, conception of companies activity models, profit models and modular approach - these tools may be used here. It is also necessary to confront the knowledge related to the economic networks with the theory of clusters.

J	Habegger, E; Kirschbaum, G; Vollenweider, I				Habegger, E; Kirschbaum, G; Vollenweider, I			"Times are changing... and so must we" - Integral logistics and services for the world-scale producer in Switzerland	CHIMIA			English	Article						chemical distribution market; logistics; transportation; warehousing		The chemical distribution business has traditionally consisted of a more or less one-way flow of information and products channeled through the distributor's organization. Changes in the industry require more integral service-oriented models to meet current needs. Distributors become both the supplier's and the customer's partner in the supply chain management, with an awareness of their partners' key objectives and strategies. The European chemical distribution market is highly fragmented. In order to be able to provide the required broad range of services and to run the business on a sustainable economic basis, the distribution operations must exceed a critical minimal size. Therefore a consolidation tends to shift towards larger distributors with broader services and product ranges. The competitive supplier in the chemical distribution business must provide a complete service. The following activities are viewed as essential elements of this integral service: Storage and materials handling, transportation, dispensing and refilling operations (if necessary in clean rooms under cGMP conditions), mixing and blending operations, tailor-made labeling, recovery and disposal service, quality control support, and last but not least experts advising the customer on chemical, technical, application, safety, logistical and commercial issues. Chemical distributors represent and serve important sectors of the chemical industry's value chain.

J	Kang, XG; Ma, QB				Kang, XG; Ma, QB			Relationship between urban eco-environment and competitiveness with the background of globalization: Statistical explanation based on industry type newly classified with environment demand and environment pressure	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						global urban system; urban competitiveness; urban eco-environment; industry structure		Within the global urban system, the statistical relationship between urban eco-environment(UE) and urban competitiveness(UC) (RUEC) is researched. Data showed that there is a statistically inverted-U relationship between UE and UC. Eco-environmental factor is put into the classification of industries, and gets six industrial types by two indexes viz. industries' eco-environmental demand and pressure. The statistical results showed that there is a strong relationship, for new industrial classification, between the changes of industrial structure and evolvement of UE. The drive mechanism of the evolvement of urban eco-environment, with human demand and global work division was analyzed. The conclusion is that the development stratege, industrial policies of cities, and environmental policies fo cities must be fit with their ranks among the global urban system. At the era of globalization, so far as the environmental policies, their rationality could not be assessed with the level of strictness, but it can enhance cities' competitiveness when they are fit with cities' capabilities to attract and control some sections of the industry's value-chain. None but these kinds of environmental policies can probably enhance the UC.

J	Konecka-Jurga, S				Konecka-Jurga, Sylwia			COMPETITIVENESS OF BUSINESS NETWORKS BASED ON THE EXAMPLE OF AUTOMOTIVE BRANCH	LOGFORUM			Polish	Article						competitiveness; business networks; automotive branch		The basis of creation of business networks is decomposition of the company's value chain resulting from assigning selected activities of the company to be implemented by other companies which thus become its partners in the network. Therefore the changes which occur in the automotive branch may be connected with migration of value as well as with the emergence of no profit zones. The companies must follow the migrating value and look for new profitable zones. In the automotive industry profit is created in the final links of the chain of value. The concept of value migration shows how competitive advantage may be achieved via an analysis of the paths of development of the branch. The concept of network constitutes a new manner of generating and keeping competitive advantage and makes competition of networks is acceptable. Car manufacturers created a global network of interconnected companies. The main cause of the above was primarily strengthening of international competitiveness. Historically, the development of delivery network was ascribed to the automotive industry. Therefore an analysis of competitiveness of business networks seems to especially well grounded with respect to automotive branch.

J	Stetter, R				Stetter, Ralf			INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR COLLABORATION MANAGEMENT	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE			English	Article						collaboration management; product development; strategies and tools		The presented work is concerned with the development of innovative strategies and tools for the management of collaborations between original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and suppliers in product development departments in automotive industry. The term "supplier" refers to system suppliers who deliver complex systems directly to the OEM as well as to component suppliers who deliver indirectly to the OEM. Due to rising product complexity, the need for collaboration in the product development of car components is still increasing. For instance, in the design of an automotive seating system for a certain model more than a hundred industrial designers, design engineers, project managers, accountants, and prototype experts need to collaborate effectively and efficiently in order to achieve the technical and economic objectives. Extensive work has already covered this area (Eckert et al. 2001, Kristjansson et al. 2003, Krystek et al. 1997, Link et al. 2001, Shaughnessy 1994, Wunram et al. 2003), especially in the field of collaboration in industrial production (supply/value chain management). However, in daily practice many problems on a technical, personal, and organisational level still hinder efficient collaboration. This paper presents a collection of strategies and tools which were found to support the collaboration management. Firstly, the results of an in-depth analysis of the product development are presented in section 1. Secondly, the strategies and tools that were collected and generated on basis of the analysis are described in section 2.

The aim of the research task is to facilitate cross-organisational business processes (CBPs) under consideration of aspects of ergonomics in order to provide adequate work procedures for employees in SMEs. The chosen approach addresses technical and human aspects, respectively. The latter are to cause severe tensions between entrepreneurs and employees working in inter-organisational settings e.g by intransparency of the whole value chain process and lack of shared vision and knowledge. Therefore. the goal is to design a holistic and interdisciplinary framework for research and to identify some leverage points for collaborational work. Starting point is the analysis of the business scenario at hand. The paper intends to present the chosen approach and wants to discuss hitherto existing lessons learned.

Revenue forecasts are particularly challenging. Cooperating suppliers must estimate and model future prices and sales volumes. They have to agree on a ratio of distribution for jointly generated revenues. Furthermore, they must compare different value chain configurations and assess consequences for the distribution of revenues. We propose a heuristic method that helps to forecast revenues for bundled goods. We demonstrate the heuristic method with the example of Application Service Providing.

Demands for more accountability and transparency mount daily from government, corporations and civil society. Globalisation and revolutions in communication and information drive the emergence and quest for global knowledge. Increased environmental and social awareness press leaders, citizens and communities to view the future in very different ways. Organisations of all kinds are increasingly aware their future may depend on their ability to create solutions to economic, environmental, social and cultural plus governance issues. Global sustainability; environment, economic, social and cultural and governance (Triple Bottom Line + One) must be used in a full analysis of the dairy industry and its value chain. What does this mean for the dairy industry - in all its parts, along all of its value chain? What does water and the contemporary debate around it mean for the dairy industry? Carbon trading is sure to be here within five years. How will the dairy industry respond? Trust is a major issue. Is the dairy industry trusted by the community? There is enormous and important new knowledge and ideas around sustainability; the dairy industry needs to know.

J	De Sanctis, M				De Sanctis, M			Business models for aeronautical in flight telecom services	SPACE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								The introduction of telecommunication services on commercial flights for passengers and airline crew requires a careful balance in the value chain in order to offer services at reasonable prices, and thereby speed up the market acceptance. Thus, a comprehensive business model is needed that addresses all types of services, licensing, billing, roles of the interested parties, and the relation of the business model to system architecture. Services like Web browsing and E-mail can be offered without licensing issues. Mobile telephony and short message service (SMS) require licensing, and most likely, both the involvement of mobile operators and roaming agreements, for rapid market expansion. This paper describes the different actors likely to participate in the business model. Of two alternative business models, one is preferred that may simplify system architecture, enabling operators to maintain virtually unchanged networks. The impact of the preferred business model on the billing system is described in some detail.

J	Ghani, JA				Ghani, Jawaid Abdul			BATA: STRATEGIC CHOICES	ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CASES			English	Article						Strategy; vertical integration; outsourcing; distribution channels; footwear		The case describes the history of Bata (Pakistan) together with relevant information on major competitors in Pakistan's footwear industry. Bata started as a vertically integrated manufacturer and soon dominated the industry. The development of the leather export industry and growth in consumer buying power in the eighties, selective imposition of sales tax in the mid-eighties, and lowering of trade barriers in the twenty-first century, resulted in the emergence of firms specializing in different stages along the value chain. When this occurred, Bata's wide scope and vertical integration no longer remained a source of competitive advantage, and resulted in threats from inexpensive imports and leaner and more specialized firms. The case allows students the opportunity to analyse outsourcing decisions, issues related to franchised versus company-owned stores, and introduction of global brands, in the context of a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.

This study endeavors to find out the stock price associations between the suppliers and manufacturers in the value chain of the TFT-LCD industry by means of data mining techniques, and meanwhile, to improve the Apriori algorithm so that it can facilitate association mining of discrete data points in a time series. An efficient data mining method which consists of two phases is proposed. In the first phase, data are classified and preprocessed using the algorithm proposed by R. Agrawal et al. (1996), then Apriori algorithm is applied to extract the strong association rules. The second phase further improves the Apriori algorithm by breaking down the traditional limitation of relying on pattern matching of continuous data for disclosing stock market behavior. By mining the association rules from the discrete data points in a time series and testing the corresponding hypotheses, statistically significant outcomes can be obtained. The proposed data mining method was applied to some real time-series of the stock prices of companies in the supply chain of TFT-LCD industry in Taiwan. It is suggested that a positive correlation does not necessarily exist between the companies' stock prices in the supply chain of TFT-LCD industry. For instance the result shows that, if the stock price of Sintek Phonrotic Corp., a company in the up stream of the value chain, soars for more than 5% in a day, the stock price of Tatung, a company in the down stream of the same value chain, may not respond positively accordingly. If an investor can short the stock of Tatung on the 7th day and long it back on the 10th day after Sintek's stock price soaring for more than 5%, the annual return of investment is 199.88% with 95% confidence interval. In conclusion, the results may reveal helpful information for the investors to make leveraged arbitrage profit investing decisions, and it might be interesting to apply this proposed data mining method to the time series in other industries or problems and investigate the results further.

This is achieved by small process changes, but this evolutionary approach is not the optimum. Another option is the revolutionary approach. Concentrating on customer value, new products and processes should be developed. Developments in sterilization and packaging, and possibilities for new packaging designs are discussed. Calculations on the sterilization process have been carried out, concentrating on the amount of biological kill, but also considering final food quality.

The reason for this is the opening of the market for competitive operators and the following drop in prices as well as the attractive services in the mobile telephony market. So the incumbents have to face new markets considering their large telephony customer base with availability for broadband Internet access through digital subscriber line (xDSL). One of the factors for diversification is considered to be streaming media via xDSL established over an IP content delivery network. Streaming video means delivery of audio-visual content similar to TV or video over the last-mile copper infrastructure to households, but interactive and partly on demand. This paper discusses the question of whether an interesting economical revenue potential exists for streaming media especially for the mass market. The current market is presented with focus on competitive technologies, customer situation and the relationship of the value-chain partners.

J	Schneider, B				Schneider, B			New horizons for the introduction of SIP-based applications	JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	42nd European Telecommunications Congress	SEP 04-06, 2003	BERLIN, GERMANY	FITCE				Today, a transformation in the traditional telecommunications marketplace is taking place. New business models are being introduced and shifts in the value chain are occurring. This paper looks at this transformation from an applications perspective. The trend towards voice over IP (VoIP) is clear, but among network providers there is great uncertainty about how they can do business once these services are introduced. In order not to become a basic infrastructure provider only, network providers need to act now and prepare their network infrastructure to be able to offer a value-add. However, the questions of how these new services will be introduced to the end-customer and which services will be accepted by the market place need further investigation. This paper addresses the basic business models for the introduction of services based on the session initiation protocol (SIP) and discusses services which can be offered by a network provider. We discuss why a network provider should offer SIP-based services and how it can profitably introduce them. In addition to this, we provide a market estimation for a bundle of services and describe what should be taken into account when introducing these services successfully to the market.

Large segments of the energy industry were left in uncertainty, mainly caused by price reductions which in this quality were never seen before. This gave rise to RWE Gas to reassess opportunities and, of course, risks in the energy market development. This assessment showed that the new situation was indeed a juncture for a fresh departure not only on the part of the new players in the market. Completely new potential was opening up for the established utilities, too. RWE Gas was determined to seize these opportunities. However, this was preceded by a detailed analysis focused essentially on the following questions: 1. Which forecasts are available for the German and European gas market? 2. Which opportunities can be used for external growth specifically along the value chain?

J	Burchardi, H; Thiele, HD				Burchardi, H; Thiele, HD			Analysis of extra costs for organic milk during processing and marketing	KIELER MILCHWIRTSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNGSBERICHTE			German	Article								In Germany, the development of the marketing of organic milk products was slow during the past years. Compared with the conventional market, price level and price development mainly influence the purchase behaviour of consumers. The price level for organic products is higher than in the conventional segment. In the food retail trade, the end consumer price had a different development over time, too. For fresh milk a current price gap is stated which induces consumers to prefer conventional products. According to first results of a dairy inquiry organic milk products create higher costs at processing and marketing than conventional milk products within the added value chain. On collection level, apart from extra charges for organic milk, the collection costs of raw material are higher per kg organic milk. Further costs occur in the dairies, particularly due to a low utilization degree of processing capacities as well as to higher costs for auxiliaries and additives, for distribution, for packaging and quality assurance. Extra marketing costs are above all caused by a higher fluctuation in the demand, higher communication costs, difficult placing on the market and more expensive distribution. The dairies see various possibilities to react on the presented extra costs at the manufacture of organic dairy products. Apart from reducing costs by concentration on selected product areas, e.g. through cooperation with other dairies or by strategic measures, one possibility is, among others, to increase the turnover. The results display that under certain assumptions an enhanced marketing of organic milk through the food retail market can be expected. As presented the increase of the past years was marked by extreme shocks, which promoted or impeded the enhanced marketing of organic milk and organic milk products. A future slow increase in the further course of the time series is expected. Further external events (e.g. introduction of organic milk in discounters) are required for strong growth rates to revitalize the milk market and to cause an expansion of the marketing share.

The purpose of the programme is to optimize the economic value of the RPZC mineral resource, over the total value chain of the mine, taking expected macro economic conditions into consideration as well. With Mineral Resource Management still being a relatively young drive in the mining industry, information on the concept is relatively scarce. RPZC had several successes and problems with implementing such a concept and also still has a way to go before a complete Minerals Resource Management approach is implemented at the mine and entrenched as a working culture. The purpose of this paper is to: . define a systems approach to implementing a mineral Resource Management programme at a base metal mine . indicate the specific MRM approaches taken at RPZC . indicate the expected advantages of implementing a MRM approach . measure the actions already taken against the systematic MRM approach, and indicate the advantages already captured indicate the way forward taking lessons learned into consideration . indicate proposals to implement the MRM approach in the macro mining environment in South Africa.

The infrastructure of this agile supply chain system highlights the deployment of virtual agents, which are basically intelligent functional objects emulating the behavior of human beings with relatively high adaptability. The significance of contribution of this paper is concerned with the suggestion of an infrastructural framework, which is able to enhance the agility as well as adaptability of value-added activities in a supply chain, thereby providing more alternatives and ideas for those researchers who are interested in this field of study.

There is no question that evolving and future distribution systems for images, music and movies will be digital and the distribution itself will be electronic via networks and e-channels. This contribution explores this setting in terms of economic and organizational underpinnings of electronic markets, networks and channels. We can presently observe the evolution of value networks, value-adding channels, as well as entire value webs in the distribution (and value) chain. A value web is a customer-driven network of independent firms who use information technology to coordinate their value chains to collectively produce a product or service for a market. Finally, we address some of these observations, descriptions and discussions in the context of DRM, specifically the music and movie industry. We will offer some insights, address current developments, but also some speculations how these industries may (and quite possibly must) progress.

What step needs to be taken by European operators to move from current market saturation in second-generation mobile communication systems to the new-generation systems assuring market profitability, ARPU growth, CAPEX optimisation and OPEX reduction? Several models are possible in an uncertain technical, regulatory and financial environment. The first model comes from the success of the Japanese i-mode service. This model implies vertical integration of the value chain and control by the mobile operator of each of the business models. Also considered are some modifications to this model for its possible implementation in European markets. The second model derives from the direct translation of the users' Internet success point of view, based on open transport networks, users' content and application creation, and with business models that are difficult to evaluate. This model could comprise competition between different unlicensed wireless proximity technologies. The third model, supported by the European mobile industry, tries to take advantage of the unforeseen success of short messaging systems, and looks for evolution towards multimedia mobile applications in an attempt to keep control over market evolution and business models. The models proposed are applied to operators and other agents to foresee the role they could play in the different future scenarios. This paper also considers the general mobile communications market and the regulatory implications derived from the deployment scenarios.

Considering the advent of large foundaries the future chances of small and medium sized foundaries specialised in the production of wafers for mixed signal circuits and associated services are discussed. If the mixed signal business model is developed in a proper way, e.g. not competing in the mainly digital core competence markets of the big foundaries but concentrating on specialised niches, such a model will work. For a sustainable growth scenario it is necessary to establish and maintain sufficient differentitation elements, a competitive cost structure and a credible view into a continuous development along the industry roadmap. State of the art manufacturing execution and control system are a must for foundries of any size and scope.	austriamicrosyst AG, Unterpremstatten, Austria								Helms R, 2000, SOLID STATE TECHNOL, V43, P49; HINES J, 2000, STRUCTURAL CHANGES S; SHELTON J, 2001, SEMICONDUCTOR MA MAY, P22	3	0	0	0	2	SOC MICROELECTRONICS, ELECTRON COMPONENTS MATERIALS-MIDEM	LJUBLJJANA	STEGNE 7, LJUBLJJANA 1000, SLOVENIA	0352-9045			INFORM MIDEM	Inf.

They have been providing the major part of the country's export receipts over a long period, The rise of international competition and the population increase ended up concentrating the value chain on the local market But the artisanal sector remaining prevalent and very atomized, this chain always implies a great number of actors. The development programs have been increasing the production for about ten years, but have supported only a new category of actors, the private producers of selected palm trees, Our analysis leads to several proposals for a more harmonious development of the value chain.

J	Lackova, A				Lackova, A			The system HACCP as a providing instrument of quality	EKONOMICKY CASOPIS			Slovak	Article								Under the sequences of the efforts to integrate our country to European structures, it is inevitable to liberalize and harmonize our methods with the methods of these countries, so that we could reach the desired level in the area of quality surety. Nutritive products quality is an important element in the struggle for customer and retaining of his favor and for gaining another potential customers. No doubt, sanitary safety belongs to the most important quality characteristics of nutritive products. Providing the sanitary safety is in the whole world context very significant not only thanks to its importance for the public health, but also because its influence in the international business. Quality increase effort is the best possible way to achieve and to negotiate the consumer needs and expectations. The keystone of a new successful quality strategy is to understand what influence has quality on business results of an entrepreneurship. Primary mission is an adjective orientation on the quality in the whole value chain with the help of quality management Systems and secondarily with the use of applied instruments and methods of products and quality system improvement. The required quality but mainly the health harmlessness of food can be provided in two ways. The first, by the systematic control of produced food or by managing and using the processes of their production in the way that eliminates the existence of non-acceptable food. The second way is named by an international abbreviation HACCP that comes from an english Hazard Analysis and critical control points. HACCP is a tool by which we recognize the rises connected with the production, storage, distribution and the preparation of food, beverages and seasonings and to which we define and inevitable measures to provide their hygienic safety and health harmlessness by usage of control points in which we can use the elements of management. HACCP system is a more narrowly applied system of securing the quality of products and it is compatible with other systems, as e. g. quality system according to ISO 9001. Apart from clearly qualitative requirements of the consumer. The aim of HACCP is exclusively hygienic blamelessness and quality and health harmlessness of foods. Food producing enterprises aiming to achieve a certificate for their system of quality and health harmlessness of foods. Food producing enterprises aiming to achieve a certificate for their system of quality according to ISO 9001 or ISO 9002, are bound to work out HACCP system for respective products, processes and phases of production simultaneously observing a certain progression of steps determining decisive points of this system. Introducing of some of the norms of ISO 9000 order need not neccessarity mean that the quality system considered and solved with qualification all food security questions, Therefore the food producing enterprise has to start its work on building up of quality system by building just the HACCP system as a specialised instrument and special part of quality system. On the other hand, building up of the HACCP system does not yet mean the fulfillment of all requirements of ISO 9001 or ISO 9002. The common points of both the system are the following elements of ISO 9001: the quality system, requirements on purchased products, identifiableness and the possibility to follow the product, operational management, manipulation, storage, packaging, protection and supply, internal audits, operational management of quality recording, training and preparation of workers, statistical methods etc. European Union regulations in the field of managerial hygienic practice in the sphere of food hygiene which include also the obligation to apply HACCP system, were incorporated into Food Codex SR in force since January 1, 2001. The application of international norms ISO 9000 and HACCP system are individual steps to achieve the minimum of the European quality and ability to compete in food product.

J	Schmidt, C				Schmidt, C			Management of the value-added chain in the dairy sector. Approaches and success potentials in the dairy practice	KIELER MILCHWIRTSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNGSBERICHTE			German	Article								The statements to the different approaches and success potentials of the management of the value-added chain in the dairy practice demonstrate that neither a patented management of the value-added chain nor general solutions in the field of goods or product lines exist. This is all the more true as the relational context in which goal setting, control mechanisms, requirements to profitability, quality, technology and organization are communicated and oriented, require specific approaches for solution on the level of the individual article and/or on that of the respective value chain. In the frame of the structural change of the built-up organization all the known scenarios and prognostics indicate that the future design and linking of value activities among the components of the value-added chain will be submitted to considerable changes and a high dynamic. It is stated that the concentration tendency for production and trade will lead to an intensified cooperation among the most efficient partners. The features of the sequence organization also indicate that above all the efficient and financially strong companies take profit of the standardizations and can transpose them into practice, even with a pioneer bonus. The companies (in general market leaders), involved in the case studies, support this thesis. Furthermore, it seems that, in the future, we will have to do with value-added networks and no more with value-added chains. Within these networks, structural basic prerequisites and effects of empiric curves will play an increasingly important role. It may be a comfort to the small and medium sized production and trade companies in Germany as well as to the developing companies in the CEE countries that the standards, instruments and subsystems of the management of the value-added chains are also accessible to them as so-called minimal variants. Nevertheless, in the future, the structural development in the food trade will no more be determined by the value activity "operations" but above all by other primary and supporting value activities (3).

J	Selva, GD				Selva, GD			CECSA	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article								The CECSA case describes the efforts of a Central American manufacturer of sanitary fixtures such as toilets and washbasins to improve quality and service through the application of just-in-time and total quality control (JIT/TQC) concepts. The company had been founded as part of a national policy of import substitution during the early years of the Central American common market, and its products, protected by high tariff barriers, dominated the regional market. However, its sales were affected seriously by the economic and political crises of the 1980s, forcing the company to search for markets outside the region. The case is set in 1987, at the height of the global conflicts that were being played out in Central America and at a time when opportunities for CECSA were opening in new export markets. With encouragement from its partner, an international ceramics corporation, CECSA embarked upon a plan to export to the United States. To meet the demanding quality specifications of the U.S. market, the company introduced the JIT/TQC approach. The implementation of this approach, with its emphasis on quality rather than quantity, required changes in the company culture and in traditional working habits that were difficult to make. The case demonstrates how continuous attention to quality throughout the entire value chain, including requirements made of suppliers, can pay off. CECSA was successful in entering the U.S. market. As new export projects materialized and pressure to meet deadlines mounted, however, many aspects that had been put in place to support the change process, such as the quality Involvement Groups, were abandoned. Other required changes, such as a new incentive system, were not introduced in a timely manner. As a consequence, momentum was lost. As the case closes, the general manager Antonio Mendez, must decide how to regain the momentum. In a meeting with his hey managers, a five-point implementation plan is produced, and the question that remains is whether this plan will be sufficient. The CECSA case illustrates how, in implementing the JIT/TQC approach, there is a continual danger of relapsing into old habits that paralyze the change effort. The loss of momentum, leading to work slowdowns, cannot be attributed to a single factor but to many. An important lesson is the importance of paying continuous attention to detail, to preserve the enthusiasm of personnel and managers alike. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on an open and flexible technological basis, the business framework, an industry-specific functionality is built on top of this architecture. The web technology allows companies to engage in, for instance, collaborative forecasting, the method of combining demand planning from individual members of a value chain. SAP's supply chain management solution in mySAP.com enables decision-makers throughout a company in the steel industry to concentrate on the ultimate key performance indicator (KPI), profitability. SAP has taken a strong, open, and flexible technological basis, the business framework, and built industry-specific functionality on top of this architecture. SAP's web technology is the building block upon which the SCM solution is based. Some companies did originally take the approach of installing piecemeal solutions. But soon they recognized the advantages of having an integrated real-time IT solution. Over 380 companies in the metals value chain are today managing their daily production processes with SAP's solutions. Salzgitter AG, Krupp Edelstahl-profile GmbH and Hylsa are implementing SAP Advanced Planner & Optimizer as a basis for an efficient supply chain management.

The commodity chain then slopped expanding, affected by unfavourable developments in the production context (development of lethal coconut epidemics, civil wars) and by the economic environment (stagnating copra market, liberalization, globalization). This rapid change led to strong demand for an analysis of the commodity chain, identification of new development challenges and the elaboration of appropriate solutions, causing research to redefine the content of its programmes. This resulted in the adoption of new approaches; which were less productivist and more participatory giving a socio-economic dimension to a commodity chain type approach.

In current economic environment, utilities will have to focus strongly on the reduction of their total generation costs, covering the fuel cycle costs, which are only partly under their control. Developments in the fuel cycle will be in the short-term rather evolutionary addressing the current needs of utilities. However, within the context of sustainable development and more and more inclusion of externalities in energy generation costs, more performing developments in the fuel cycle could become important and feasible. A life-cycle design approach of the fuel cycle will be requested in order to cover all factors in order to decrease significantly the nuclear energy generation cost to compete with other alternative fuels in the long-term. This paper will report on some of the trends one could distinguish in the fuel cycle with emphasis on cost reduction. OECD/NEA is currently conducting a study on the feel cycle aiming to assess current and future nuclear fuel cycles according the potential for further improvement of the full added-value chain of these cycles from a mainly technological and economic perspective including environmental and social considerations.

At the same time, the Operation Support Systems (OSS's') that are essential in order to create business value from these technologies are lagging behind market need. The authors argue for a re-think of the humble management system into a complete software wrap-around of the network to deliver a value creation platform - as different from yesterday's OSS as the bakelite telephone is from today's tri-band mobile handsets. This software will be based on product standards, not paper ones and will require a major shift of gears from the position of today. This value creation platform will be built from advanced, component based software delivered through a very different market model to that of today. Much of this technology exists; we simply need critical mass behind a common approach. The discussion in this paper represents the personal views of the authors and does not necessarily represent the views of any organisation.

J	Brett, JF; Craig, VB; Brett, KV; Wadsworth, DB; Pile, KE				Brett, JF; Craig, VB; Brett, KV; Wadsworth, DB; Pile, KE			When do drilling alliances add value? The alliance-value model	SPE DRILLING & COMPLETION			English	Article								A recent Gas Research Institute report details three previously unstudied aspects of alliances: specific measurable factors that improve alliance success, how a successful alliance should be structured, and when an alliance makes economic sense. For the purposes of this report, an alliance is defined by "technical process integration," which includes joint planning, execution and evaluation. Technical process integration shifts the definition of an alliance beyond a simple focus on the commercial terms. The most innovative tool to emerge from the report, the Alliance-Value model, addresses those aspects surrounding when an alliance makes economic sense. The theory behind the Alliance-Value model is that the longterm viability of any drilling relationship hinges on its ability to create real value and achieve stability. Based upon the report's findings, the most effective way to form such an alliance is through a detailed description and integration of the technical processes involved. This new type of process-driven alliance is characterized by a value chain which links together a common set of technical processes, mutually defined bottom-line goals, and shared benefits. Building a process-driven alliance requires time and people and therefore has an associated cost. The real value generated by an alliance must exceed this startup cost. The Alliance-Value model computes the net present value of the cash flows for four different operating arrangements: (1) business as usual (conventional competitive bidding process), (2) process-driven alliance (linking technical processes to accelerate production and reduce expenses), (3) incentivized process-driven alliance (linked technical processes with performance Incentives to promote stability), and (4) no drill case (primarily used to gauge the market value of services). These arrangements test different degrees of process integration between an operator and its suppliers. They can also help determine if the alliance can add enough value to exceed startup costs and if the relationship will be stable. Each partner can rest the impact of the relational structure on its own profitability. When an alliance is warranted, all participants can benefit from real value generated in a stable relationship. However, relationships that focus on commercial terms, instead of on process linking, may be playing a zero-sum, no-win game.

J	Bouchoris, P				Bouchoris, P			The E-commerce challenge: Strategic implications for enterprises	BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING			English	Article								Electronic commerce is a serious strategic challenge to businesses. As the e-commerce paradigm prevails, enterprises, key among them European telecommunications operators, have to understand how they can enhance value and gain competitive advantages through e-commerce. This paper puts the current state of e-commerce development into some context and sizes up its short-term future potential. It discusses the recent phenomenon of very high market capitalisations of e-commerce ventures and analyses the prime competitive strategy implications arising from the introduction of e-commerce. In brief, it identifies three ways in which enterprises can benefit from e-commerce: cost reduction, differentiation and new market development. It analyses the impact of e-commerce throughout a company's value chain: inbound logistics, production, sales, marketing, outbound logistics, distribution, post-sales support, staffing etc. Finally, the paper focuses on the development of e-commerce in Europe and the reasons it is lagging behind development in the United States marketplace.

J	Koenig, PC; von Kuegelgen, JE				Koenig, PC; von Kuegelgen, JE			Value structure analysis and process-derived performance metrics for shipbuilding	NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL			English	Article								The highly competitive international merchant ship market compels shipbuilders to deliver competitive value to their customers. U.S. naval ship construction, however, takes place within a different type of business climate. In this environment, economic competition is constrained and value can only be assured by directly measuring it. In this paper the problems associated with various existing value assessment methods applied to naval shipbuilding are discussed. It is found that a bottom-up, process-based approach is the key to naval shipbuilding value assessment. The first step in building a process-derived industrial performance measurement system is to identify the appropriate discrete precesses and build them into a value chain model. It was found that the standard value chain breakdown method could not adequately account for all of the relevant shipbuilding strategy variables, therefore a new multi-dimensional value chain breakdown was developed. Concurrent with the collection of value chain data, performance metrics for each process are being formulated. Analysis of individual process performance in the context of corporate strategies as documented in the value chain will enable a roll-up of performance and value from bottom to top, i.e. from individual processes through to the total shipbuilding outcome.

Traditional approaches, such as simulation languages and spreadsheets, do not offer effective solutions with quick 'what if' calculations for large scale profit planning systems. Based on complex management relationships, Business Structure-Based Systems can be harnessed using structured matrices to link activities to cost drivers in the value chain. With the interactive package, business scenarios are projected on super sets of tables allowing models to become visible. Structured Matrix Technology can offer a solution, readily transcribing the cost-process relation into a modelling system. The affinity of productivity and concurrent management information systems is expounded. Business Structure-Based Systems make new process designs effective and provide powerful and relevant decision-making tools in strategic productivity management.

BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING			English	Article								Part of BT's vision is to be deemed world-class by its customers. However defining your minimum performance level before you can begin to ash your customers 'How are we doing?' is not always obvious. This is perhaps particularly so when your customers are mainly internal and perhaps unaware of your contribution to the value chain. This article describes, in a practical way, how BT's Network Power Operations Unit in London set about starting down the world-class road by defining and then following an initial route-map.

J	Busch, J; Tincher, G				Busch, J; Tincher, G			Winning in industrial markets	RESEARCH-TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Marketing has been described as "the link between society's needs and its pattern of industrial response" (I). But marketing, as it is studied, is disproportionately concerned with consumer markets. For industrial markets, especially for goods like raw materials that are near the bottom of the value chain?, market success is driven by relative cost and performance. However; examination of the strategy; alternatives in industrial markets, bused on the cost and performance metric, shows that for the largest commercial success, the strategy of "low cost" appears more successful than "high performance.".

J	Menghini, P; Stang, R				Menghini, P; Stang, R			Business analysis: A hotbed for strategy ideas	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1997 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition	OCT 05-08, 1997	SAN ANTONIO, TX	Soc Petr Engineers				The rapidly changing business environment of the 1990's forced the oil and gas industry to develop new corporate and regional strategies to remain competitive. To support strategy development, much attention has been given to such analytical tools as decision and risk analysis and probabilistic modeling. Often overlooked, however, is that a solid foundation of information and a thorough understanding of the underlying business environment are required for these tools to be effective. The business-analysis process provides this understanding and serves as a "hotbed" for new strategic ideas. This paper presents several business-analysis tools that enhance awareness of the business environment and provide the foundation of information necessary for sound strategic modeling. Examples from a recent study show how tools, such as influence diagrams, value-chain analysis, benchmarking, competitor analysis, scenario development, and strength and weakness analysis, are used.

Aan overview of the DIGISAT Interactive System for Multimedia Applications is described in this paper. The most attractive Multimedia services for the Broadcasting environment are described, highlighting as a reference; "TV a la Carte", Near Video on Demand, Oriented Advertisement, Co-Direction, Pay per View, Internet Access, DVB data Broadcasting and real time TV audience data Acquisition. The results of the DIGISAT Trials are presented based on the services demonstrations already performed in 10 European countries with more than 600 users. These results provide a useful reference of the popular reaction to this kind of services. The DIGISAT Generic Reference Model for Interactive Systems has been developed with the objective of facilitating the convergence towards interoperability. This model has been discussed and eventually adopted by the DVB and ITU in coherence also with DAVIC and IEEE. DIGISAT has produced a Baseline Specification for the provision of interaction channel via satellite for SMATV based on Coaxial and Satellite sections. The DIGISAT concept is based on an open system architecture where several system options may be valid for any of the sections. For the satellite section last generation VSAT networks have been chosen based on CDMA modulation systems. Nevertheless, alternative VSAT technologies can be applied. At the moment of writing this abstract, the DIGISAT specification is under discussion at the DVB. It will probably become an ETR (ETSI Technical Report). The DIGISAT specification is creating a great expectation at the DVB, as the optimum solution for the coaxial section of the SMATV systems. Coaxial section can be reused to be concatenated with alternative transmission media to the satellite such as terrestrial UHF or microwaves (MMDS). The preliminary conclusions of the Cost Analysis is that the Coax section is economically feasible in a wide range of types of SMATV from 20 to 300 users.

J	CHOON, HN				CHOON, HN			THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING IN SINGAPORE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article								Four strategic issues for manufacturing industry in Singapore in the 1990s have been highlighted at the First Global Strategies Conference held in 1988. They are: . Competitive differentiation as opposed to low cost . Optimization of every par, of the value chain of activities . Networking the Singapore operation with other parts of the value chain located in other countries . Monitoring Singapore competitive edge constantly Manufacturing companies in Singapore are adopting information technology rapidly to cope with shorter product life cycle, demand for better customer services and product quality, flexibility in volume and design, manpower shortage and redistribution of manufacturing operation to the region. Computer integrated manufacturing has been viewed as a key towards achieving competitiveness in manufacturing. Several important CIM elements have been implemented in Singapore industries over the last decade. This paper reviews the results of a study conducted on the status of CIM development and implementation and the industry trends in the key sectors. The government plays a major role in developing the local expertise and capability in exploiting CIM technology through the setting up of mission specific CIM research institute; technology transfer centre; CIM specialist training programme; standards committee to address the issue of standardization to facilitate inter-organizational and intra-organizational integration. The factors contributing to the successful partnership between the government and industry in realigning and turning the manufacturing bases into factories of the future will be critically examined.
