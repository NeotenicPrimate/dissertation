J	Gachukia, MKW				Gachukia, Martin Kang'ethe W.			Moderating effect of traceability on value chain governance of credence goods: a perspective of the New Institutional Economics framework	STUDIES IN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						agri-food chain; transaction costs; information asymmetry; bounded rationality; behavioural uncertainty	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS; FOOD STANDARDS; CONTROL RIGHTS; INTEGRATION; OWNERSHIP; CERTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; POLICY; FIRM	This paper reviews the application of New Institutional Economics (NIE) theoretical assumptions and the way they relate to value chain governance and are moderated by traceability and information technology. Through literature review, NIE assumptions are examined by comparing how they are partially mitigated by traceability. The effect of these mitigations is realised in the readjustment of value chain governance typologies to suit lean and more competitive and visible value chains. The findings are based on the fact that information asymmetry, bounded rationality and behavioural uncertainty have given rise to incomplete contracts, especially in the agri-food sectors of most developing economies. Supply chain actors in this sector have the constant burden of assurance in ascertaining that credence goods remain authentically safe. The moderating effect of traceability is therefore proposed to reduce these uncertainties and is as such a form of assurance to promote both a holistic approach in compliance with standards and a seamless mechanism for product and process integration. However, this moderating effect, despite being novel in the value chain governance discourse, needs to be empirically ascertained. The novelty of this paper is based on the agricultural development agenda of developing economies in the light of the discourse on market-oriented reforms, following multilateral trade liberalisation and especially structural adjustment programmes in developing countries. The consequent increase in world market integration has led to the promotion of value chain strategies and reconsideration of how food is governed in these markets.

Grain sorghum is vital food crop for millions especially for the people in the arid and semi-arid parts of Africa and Asia. In developed countries, the crop is majorly used as animal or poultry feed. With continuous increase in the human population and decreasing agricultural resources especially irrigation water, sorghum represents important crop for future as it can produce optimum yield under drought and other stress conditions. The major challenges facing sorghum research and development is to deliver technologies that will enable the agricultural sector to affect transformation of "subsistence farming" to sustainable and market oriented. This can be achieved through reassessment of crop research in terms of current and future demand, resolving specific production constraints by improving productivity, development of post-harvest processing and value-addition technologies, creation of demand, marketing strategies and policies that would result in additional farm income and employment without sacrificing overall goal of attaining sustainable food and nutritional security. This chapter focuses on the nutritive composition of sorghum grain, consumption pattern in Africa and Asia, grain attributes affecting end-use quality, health benefits of sorghum, major constraints as food and suggestive measures for sustainable production. A value chain model followed at Directorate of Sorghum Research, India for sustainable use of sorghum as food is discussed. Sorghum is comparable with fine cereals like rice and wheat for most of the grain nutritional composition including starch, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals etc. The quality of sorghum grain used for preparation of various food products is an important parameter that determines its end use. In general, bold, round lustrous and intermediate endosperm textured grains are preferred for variety of food preparations. Protein quality in sorghum is also a major aspect discussed by scientists across world. The protein quality is considered to be slightly inferior compared to other fine cereals. Research efforts are in progress for development of lines with improved protein quality. However supplementation of sorghum foods with other pulses would circumvent the problems associated with sorghum protein. Sorghum grain possesses unique grain nutritional properties having significant and positive role in promoting nutrition and health of human beings. Particularly the slow release carbohydrate property of sorghum increases satiety and has role in controlling diabetes. Gluten is absent in sorghum and is considered safe for people suffering for celiac disease. In developed countries there is a growing demand for gluten free food especially sorghum due to the intolerance to wheat. Recently farmers in US have started producing sorghum hybrids that are a white grain, known as "food-grade" sorghum.

J	Gao, C; Kuah-Pearce, KE				Gao, Chong; Kuah-Pearce, Khun Eng			The Garment Industry in South China Practising Relational Wor k	CHINA PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						garment business; social relations; economic transactions; relational work; South China		Since the implementation of China's economic reform and opening-up policy at the end of the 1970s, garment manufacturing for both the domestic and global markets has developed and proliferated quickly in Guangzhou-centred South China. It is believed to be the result of the industrial restructuring of the global apparel commodity chain and a large domestic consumer demand from the Chinese people. Compared with other industries, the garment industry has long been subject to the strong impact of a transitional market economy and, more recently, the increasingly rapid process of marketisation in China. In order to provide a clear sociological conceptualisation of the market economy in the reform era, this paper aims to apply the relational work approach to analysing economic transactions in the garment business, particularly business dealings between garment producers and wholesalers. The focus is on their continued efforts to make appropriate economic arrangements in accordance with specific sets of social relations through continuous relational work. This paper will examine three categories of relational work and the associated economic forms in the making.

Through the use of this relational work framework, this paper will shed light on how the different sets of relational work help us to understand relationships and embeddedness between garment producers and wholesalers in China's rapidly evolving garment economy.

J	Muniz, HG				Garcia Muniz, Humberto			TRADE JOURNALS AS FUNDAMENTAL SOURCES FOR CARIBBEAN SUGAR HISTORIES: LE JOURNAL DES FABRICANTS DE SUCRE, THE SUGAR CANE AND THE LOUISIANA PLANTER AND SUGAR MANUFACTURER	ASCLEPIO-REVISTA DE HISTORIA DE LA MEDICINA Y DE LA CIENCIA			Spanish	Article						Caribbean history; Sugar; Sugar cane; Trade journals; Sugar journals; Commodity chain; Commercial publications; Central factory; Sugar central; Louisiana Planter and Sugar Manufacturer; The Sugar Cane; Le Journal des Fabricants de Sucre		This articule highlights the importance of sugar trade journals from the second half of the 19th century and the first of the 20th century, such as the US-Louisiana Planter and Sugar Manufacturer, British-The Sugar Cane, and French-Le Journal des Fabricants de Sucre. Their abundant and trustworty coverage of Caribbean sugar production, processing and marketing (namely, the commodity chain) makes them an indispensable source for Caribbean sugar histories. The paper centres on the Louisiana Planter and Sugar Manufacturer as a case study by explaining its establishment and international expansion, clientele, and its coverage of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico but also with references to the British, Danish, Dutch and French Caribbean.

In order to reduce significantly the volume of CO2 emissions attributable to road transport, the EU is focusing on the sustainable development of biofuels. To meet and to demonstrate compliance with sustainability criteria, throughout the length of the value chain, the oil sector has begun preparing a voluntary audit scheme, the 2BSvs (Biomass Biofuels Sustainability voluntary scheme). Recognized by the European Commission on 19 July 2011, 2BSvs covers the entire biofuel production chain, from biomass producer to bonded storage. By presenting a case study of the entire sector, from the farmer to the fuel company, this article sets out the implications for those involved in the oilseed sector, the changes that have taken place since April 2013 and the challenges ahead.

J	Hansen, E; Knowles, C; Larson, K				Hansen, E.; Knowles, C.; Larson, K.			A modified lead-user approach for new product development: an illustration from the US of a marketing research tool for the forest industry	INTERNATIONAL WOOD PRODUCTS JOURNAL			English	Article						New product development; Innovation; Lead; users		Innovation is critical for firm success, including forest sector firms. However, historically forest sector firms have focused on process over product innovations. Additionally, research shows that forest sector firms often fail to have a structured new product development (NPD) process. The purpose of this work is to illustrate use of the lead-user method to identify user-lead ideas for innovation within the wood-window value chain, thereby demonstrating the potential of a modified lead-user approach as a NPD tool for the forest industry. Personal interviews with 22 individuals were conducted with sales agents, installation experts, homebuilders, and architects. Findings outline opportunities for the introduction of new products/services, thereby demonstrating the value of relying on lead-users for identifying potential products. This study also highlights the challenges associated with the lead-user methodology, including the varying definitions of a lead-user and the subjective nature of categorising someone as a lead-user.

J	Hirshhorn, R				Hirshhorn, Ronald			Getting Value from Global Value Chains: A Canadian Perspective	TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW			English	Article						Global value chains; foreign direct investment; offshoring; economic growth; competitiveness		Value-added data document the importance of GVCs internationally, the significant increase in the fragmentation of production since the mid-1990s and the role of MNEs in driving the growth of value chains. Evidence suggests GVCs have had a positive impact on productivity. Their growth has not affected long-term employment within countries, although it has led to short-term job losses and influenced relative wages. Canada has benefited from participating in GVCs, but, as in other advanced countries, firms are being challenged to move up the value chain into knowledge-intensive activities in which they can compete effectively against low-cost foreign producers. This requires investments to be made in building capabilities that will allow Canadian workers and firms to excel internationally.

The sector, second only to agriculture in the overall economy of Bangladesh, contribute nearly 4.5 % to the gross domestic product (GDP), 23 % of gross agriculture products and 2.46 % to the total export earnings. It accounts for about 60 % of animal protein intake in the diet of the people of Bangladesh with per capita fish consumption of 18.94 kg per annum. The people of Bangladesh largely depend on fish to meet their protein needs in both the rural and urban areas. In Bangladesh, to date about 20 finfish and a several crustacean species have been domesticated, their breeding and rearing protocols have been developed and now under nation-wide aquaculture. In addition to 1.32 million full time fishers, 14.7 million people have been involved in aquaculture in Bangladesh including fish farmers and prawn/shrimp farmers. The value chain from pond/farm to plate/fork and beyond the chain includes hundreds of stakeholders, whose livelihood fully depends on aquaculture. The major stakeholders include fish farmer, prawn/shrimp farmer, hatchery owner, nurserer, farm/hatchery technicians/workers, input (feed ingredient, fertilizer, hormone, chemical, instrument etc.) importers/suppliers, feed mill owners, homestead feed producer, fisher, fish processor, fish transporter, wholesaler, exporter, retailer, consumer, technology provider (government and non-government) and many more. Aquaculture has increasingly been playing a major role in total fish production (3.26 million tons) of the country and presently more than half of the total production (52.92 %) comes from aquaculture (1.73 million tons). The sector provides living and livelihood for more than 11 % people of the country. If the available resource are used sustainably with proper technological assistance, fish produced from aquaculture would efficiently meet the protein demand of growing population of the country, and will ensure, food and nutritional security, employment generation and foreign exchange earning leading to shaping a Bangladesh free of hunger, malnutrition and poverty.

Using the high-profile football manufacturing industry in Sialkot, Pakistan as our case study, we explore whether, and if so, how CSR initiatives in this industry have addressed sexual and reproductive health needs of female football stitchers labouring at the base of the global football manufacturing value chain.

Porter's Diamond model is applied to gain insight into a clear perspective on the economic development of regional tourism in a competitive market. The findings indicate the low advancement of tourism development in Ubon Ratchathani because of cultural constraints, low quality of factor conditions, lack of coordination in the tourism value chain, low cooperation between the public and private sectors, and a low level of sophistication in demand conditions. This might facilitate the decision-making process of policy-makers and related parties to strategically plan and develop regional tourism, contributing to the quest of the Thai government and the Isan tourism sector to properly manage tourism in order to achieve a more competitive position at the national and international levels.

J	Ortiz, J; Wang, HB; Huo, D				Ortiz, Jaime; Wang, Haibo; Huo, Da			The delicate balance for jointly pursuing economic growth in Latin America and China	JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						trade dynamic; international business; competitive equilibrium; profit function	IMPACT	This paper examines the sources of economic growth for a group of Latin American countries in relation to their export performance in China. The analytical framework is based on an extended normalized quadratic profit function. The ensuing econometric results confirm that a favorable export record with China represents a positive source of growth for Latin America. However, it also creates long-run dependability conditions in terms of reduced prices and thinner profits that weaken its growth capacity. Latin American countries must seek product diversification away from their current commodity base and aggressively climb up the value chain to remain competitive worldwide. Managerial Relevance: identify the sources of economic growth for a group of Latin American countries in relation to their export performance in China; the weakness of this economic growth model; how to seek product diversification away from their current commodity base with emphasis on value chain.

J	Rolland, A				Rolland, Asle			Chains, Shops and Networks: Official Statistics and the Creation of Public Value	STATISTIKA-STATISTICS AND ECONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article						Public value; value creation; public interest; professional independence; official statistics; national statistical institutes		The paper concerns official statistics, particularly as produced by the NSIs. Their contribution to the society is considered well captured by the concept of public value. Official statistics create value for the democracy as foundation for evidence-based politics. Democracies and autocracies alike need statistics to govern the public. Unique for the democracy is the need of statistics to govern the governors, for which the independence of the NSI is crucial. Three ways of creating public value are the value chain, the value shop and the value network. The chain is appropriate for the production, the shop for the interpretation and the network for the dissemination of statistics. Automation reduces the need to rely on the value chain as core business model. Thereto automation increases the statistical output, which in turn increases the need of shop and network activities. Replacing the chain with the shop as core model will elevate the NSIs from commodity producers to a processing industry.

J	Scannella, E				Scannella, Enzo			What drives the disintegration of the loan origination value chain in the banking business	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Lending; Value chain; Information sharing; Vertical scope; Banking; Credit information	RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; FIRM; INFORMATION; CREDIT; CAPABILITIES; BOUNDARIES; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the vertical disintegration of the bank loan origination value chain. This paper conducts a study on the credit information market from the perspective of the bank's decision to vertically disintegrate the loan origination value chain. The main aim is to identify the relevant drivers of the decision to vertically disintegrate the credit assessment phase in the lending business. Design/methodology/approach - Transaction cost economics and information asymmetry are the typical perspectives of analysis of the vertical scope of business value chains. Findings - This paper argues that in order to capture the drivers underlying the dynamic evolution of the vertical scope of bank loan origination business models, the above perspectives must be combined and integrated further with a resource-based view and the modularity perspective. Combining managerial and financial perspectives, this paper offers an examination of the drivers of vertical disintegration in the lending value chain and, specifically, in the credit assessment phase. Originality/value - Although the existence of substantial research on value chain vertical integration/disintegration in the literature, none has directly focussed on the credit assessment value chain. It leaves a gap that the paper aims to overcome. The value chain disintegration has deep managerial and financial implications at firm and industry levels, and the comprehension of the rational underlying it is critical to maintaining competitive business model configurations in the bank lending industry.

Kept by the people knowledge have special value to the organization because of the range and endless possibilities to set it up. The main aim of this article is to present of knowledge development model. It is based on a combination of elements of the value chain and the Kirkpatrick model. The model assumes the possibility of creating a knowledge management strategy, which allows by measurement determine the appropriate action that are shaping the level and value of knowledge. Enterprise knowledge management requires involvement of employees and managers, and integrates the activities undertaken contributing to the development of knowledge to the needs of the recipient. The article therefore included a summary of the results of the assessment level of knowledge from the perspective of these groups.

In this perspective, the paper aims at exploring the weaknesses and constraints which hamper the progress of this sector and proposes strategies to develop the different steps of the value chain. To fulfill this objective, a methodology based on a value chain analysis was undertaken. Results show the dominance of informal activity which leads to an unfair competition with the organized sector, price fluctuations and an unequal distribution of economic margins between producers. This difference between farmers' margins and market margin and the lack of coordination between actors, highlights the need for a vertical integration between the three sub-sectors (production, processing and commercialization) and the necessity to encourage informal producers to get involved in the sector organization.

J	Stein, NV; Sick, N				Stein, Nicole Vom; Sick, Nathalie			TECHNOLOGICAL DISTANCE IN ACADEMIC COLLABORATIONS: EVIDENCE FROM BATTERY RESEARCH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Absorptive capacity; battery value chain; collaboration; electric mobility; geographical distance; min-complement distance; social distance; technological distance		Technological distance is one important factor within research projects to enhance or prevent successful knowledge transfer for innovation. To get a better understanding of bridging mechanisms of diverging technological distances, we compare publication-based and individually perceived technological distances of collaboration partners in a multi-disciplinary battery research project. Differences hint at already bridged or non-bridged technological distances. Further information, given during expert interviews, present reasons for different knowledge transfer and recombination mechanisms in different dyadic collaborations. We generally find evidence that technological distance can be bridged by reducing geographical or social distances. When research activities are really complementary and collaboration partners have a common (technical) language, there is less need of decreasing other distances. Integrating research along the traditional battery value chain needs more social or geographical proximity to decrease and not just bridge technological distance at least in a practical way.

J	Ban, XF; Tong, X				Ban, Xiaofang; Tong, Xin			A Scenario-Based Information Security Risk Evaluation Method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						risk evaluation; risk scenario; business impact; vulnerabilities; asset value chain; risk integration		Risk evaluation is the core process of information security risk management. An effective risk evaluation can protect organizations and maintain their abilities to carry out missions and activities against threats as well as helping to implement controls and safeguards that are actually needed. While the traditional information security risk evaluation approaches are lack of granular analysis and clear expression of security characteristics of risk, such as the possibility, attack path, and business impact. This paper presents the scenario-based information security risk evaluation method, based on the thought of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack, by constructing risk scenario, evaluate information system security risk status. The separation analysis of the technical impact and business impact contribute to the technicians and business decision makers to grasp system risk status from their respective responsibilities. In the end of the paper, we propose a practical risk scenario construction example, which provides scientific and effective guidance for the preparation of a risk evaluation report.

More and more projects are submitted for donors who have still few references and data to evaluate if these proposals could be successful or not. A study has been initiated to scale up successful practices. It has been based on Knowledge Harvesting and comparative analysis of several projects around the world. Discussions and focus groups were organized as parts of a seminar during the 11th International Conference on Goats. The general characteristics of goat activities and for each commodity and key success factors have been identified and described. Proposals were elaborated and debated to go forward and propose operational tools to support project donors and designers. A project and investment typology will be built and a goat value chain tool kit will be developed during a write shop. The discussions have enhanced the importance of a cost-benefits analysis and planning return on investments within the project. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently no substantial, accessible feedlot or U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)-inspected processing infrastructure exists in the study area, leading most small producers to sell their livestock at auction with few options for branding their products to participate in higher value markets. The closest substantial processing facilities are a four to six hour drive from the area - farther than most producers are willing to transport their livestock. To assess and overcome these barriers to local and a Interim Director, Office of Community Partnerships, regional markets, we explored the viability of different USDA-inspected processing options to better understand economic feasibility, environmental impacts, and the small-scale livestock production value chain (i.e., consumer demand, producer capacity and willingness to participate, and processing capacity). In this paper, we present results from stakeholder surveys, interviews, forums, and an economic impact analysis. Results indicate that several livestock processing development scenarios are socially, economically, and environmentally viable in the region. Project findings are relevant to many areas of the United States, especially areas of the West, that have low population densities, large transportation distances, and few processing options for small-scale livestock producers.

We hypothesize that small-scale sheep producers are more dependent on middlemen for market and loans than larger holders, leading to welfare losses. Our empirical findings based on a Heckman model applied for 120 farming households conducted in Khanasser region (Syria) show that despite unequal benefits, local arrangements are more blessing than curse for the poor. Small-scale sheep producers and middlemen developed intricate institutional arrangements that are mutually beneficial. Producers act collectively to pool sufficient quantity of milk to be attractive to traders (jabban) while gaining access to market and cash loans mainly for feed. This provides the middlemen needed supplies with reduced transaction costs. This suggests that development organizations should support local capacity of producing organizations to work together, small-scale producers to organize, develop small scale dairy processing workshops for pooling and possibly processing milk, support training for direct market access and facilitate access to loans. Finally, supporting organizations such as rural financial services and micro-finance need to ensure up-to-date market information is available to ensure fair prices are paid. They should also be able to negotiate favourable conditions for loans and reach out to these resource-poor rural populations where formal credit systems are absent.

J	He, J				He, Juan			WTO-plus commitments and emerging implications for China's large civil aircraft manufacturing	WORLD TRADE REVIEW			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; INDUSTRY; ECONOMY	China's accession to the WTO in 2001 is widely accepted as a landmark event for the multilateral trade system and for the country. The large-scale WTO-plus commitments have nevertheless received unceasing criticism and discussion. This article is concerned with the resulting policy implications for the Chinese initiative to become a global producer of large civil aircraft at the next stage of development. A real-life case study is expected to provide robust evidence for inquiring whether China and emerging economies alike can smoothly advance up the global value chain while honouring their WTO obligations in good faith. The article confirms the widespread opinion that there are vast legal uncertainties ahead for China throughout this journey, and for that reason, a rigorous market-orientation effort is needed to strengthen its ability to compete in the commercial aviation sector.

SMART PACKAGING FOR FOOD PRESERVATION	REVISTA RA XIMHAI			Spanish	Article						safety; security; consumer; providing information; communication; product quality		One of the biggest challenges of the food industry is the preservation of its products, that is, to prevent them from being attacked by microorganisms that decompose them hauling economic losses and severe health damage to the consumer. Today, competition in the food industry is very high and any company that does not offer the quality products is doomed to fail. Consumers demand more and the industry still stands offering what is asked: quality, security and safety. The package, in addition to fulfilling its core functions is becoming a means of sophisticated interactions with content and a record of relevant information for both the end consumer and intermediate players in the value chain and concepts are born of active and intelligent packaging. A smart container is defined as a system that monitors the condition of the packaged product, being able to register and provide information about product quality or condition of the container, showing the possible "abnormal" practices that have suffered the product or the container during the entire supply chain, such as transportation or storage. These systems monitor the mechanisms of altered food due to physiological, chemical and biological processes that respond and communicate changes in the status of the product as time-temperature, Oxygen, Carbon dioxide, microbial growth, etc. There are different types of smart packaging such as time-temperature indicators, color indicators, indicators of pathogens and indicators of leaks, to name a few. Through literature review, arguments that demonstrate the usefulness and necessity of the use of smart packaging to preserve the quality and safety of the product it contains, from manufacturing to the time it is used by consumers were found, as these besides communicating or providing information about their state, acting as a marketing tool.

Resources are the basis of capabilities, which can be developed and converted into strategic capabilities that lead to obtain a competitive advantage or equality. This paper proposes a methodology to identify and assess the current capabilities of industrial SMEs in a region in Argentina in order to find its competitive effect. In this way, four main capabilities called management, innovation, marketing and integration are defined. At the same time, capabilities are divided into "sub-capabilities" comprised of resources. They are evaluated to determine if they are present in the companies studied. Subsequently, the VRIO test is used to define the competitive effect of the capabilities. The developed methodology systematizes the evaluation of strategic capabilities in the framework of the theory of resources.

J	Albors-Garrigos, J; Molina, BD; Molina, MD				Albors-Garrigos, Jose; de Miguel Molina, Blanca; de Miguel Molina, Maria			Positioning in the Global Value Chain as a Sustainable Strategy: A Case Study in a Mature Industry	ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES			English	Article						clusters; innovation systems; value chain	CLUSTERS	As a result of the development of new industrialized countries, such as Brazil, China and other Southern Asian economies, as well as a globalized economy, traditional competitive paradigms based on advantages associated with costs and quality efficiencies or even innovation are no longer sufficient. These previous classical paradigms related competitiveness either to costs or technology innovation and the resources of industry incumbents. However, the combination of adequate knowledge and relationship management with marketing efforts brings forth a reconsideration of the present competitive models that go beyond those analyses from the point of view of global value chains. The objective of this investigation will analyze the governance structure of the territorial value chain in the Spanish and Italian ceramic tile industry, through the understanding of the previous and current roles of several industries involved in the value creation system. By way of both a case study and quantitative methodology approach, we will explore the paradigm change where traditional chain actors are losing their grip on their contribution to the territorial value creation system as new actors appear with a more stable status. The article concludes that proper positioning in the global value chain is a key strategy for the sustainability of the involved firms, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SME).

Andrade et al (2002), one of the strategies for these organizations is to improve their production processes, with the elimination/reduction of losses and waste generation throughout the value chain. The aim of this study is to identify the applicability of an environmental management program in a Automotive Center located in Santa Maria/RS. For this we carried out a survey of bibliographic and descriptive nature of qualitative approach with the strategy case study. Data collection was conducted through semi-structured interviews with the manager of the company and previously structured questionnaire administered to employees. The results obtained show that the company seeks to dispose waste in an environmentally friendly way, still needing enhance these processes. Regarding the implementation of the EMS - is it important to measure the cost of all benefits provided to the company, such as reinforcing a positive image of the company, before compliance with environmental laws, clean and safe work environment, reducing the risk of accidents and waste disposal	[Lazarotto, Daniel; Rajeh Ibdaiwi, Thiago Kader] Fac Metodista Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [de Almeida, Damiana Machado; Dias Lopes, Luis Felipe] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Flores Costa, Vania Medianeira] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Ciencias Adm, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Trindade dos Santos, Rita de Cassia] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Acad Adm, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil		Lazarotto, D (corresponding author), Fac Metodista Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.

J	Salomon, SPJ				Joel Salomon, Salas Praiz			THE CHALLENGE OF ANNONACEUS PRODUCTION IN MEXICO: PRODUCTION AND MARKETING	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE FRUTICULTURA			English; Portuguese	Article						Annona muricata; Business Network; Value Chain; Market Drivers Factors; Climate Change; Carbon Footprint		By analyzing the current Annonaceae's world challenges in Mexico, we consider all parties, from the producer, the target markets and all the way up to final consumer. In a globalized agribusiness environment and increasingly competitive, businesses that cater to the needs of consumers are the only ones that will survive and grow. The Inter-Entrepreneurial Cooperation, called by some "Network-Company", to jointly exploit the advantages of large companies (Consortia) and small business (quickness), is the first major challenge. A second challenge is composed of the factors driving the market: Food Safety, Product Quality, Innovation, Lower Costs, and Developing New Markets. A third challenge is adapting Competitive Annonaceae to climate changes. Finding efficient microorganisms of biological control, to protect food, is the fourth challenge and a promising alternative to control undesirable organisms. Positioning Annonaceae as the Emblematic Fruit of Latin America in the International Markets operating a Continental Value Chain, and converge with all continental actors in this great effort imposed by the global dynamics, is undoubtedly the Grand Challenge and our invitation, to assume, in this memorable International Congress. As such is integration of Continental Ecosystem Innovation for Sustainable Development of the Annonaceae.				joelsalas@yahoo.com					ALPUCHE-SILVESTRE E., 2006, C NACL ANNONACEAE, P58; ALVAREZ CO, 2007, J PEST SCI, V80, P63, DOI DOI 10.1007/S10340-006-0149-2.(2004); Andres-Agustin J, 2006, SCI HORTIC-AMSTERDAM, V107, P337, DOI 10.1016/j.scienta.2005.11.003; ANDRES-AGUSTIN J., 2011, BIOL DIVERSIDAD CONS; ANDRESAGUSTIN J, 1997, P INTERAMERICAN SOC, V41, P152; [Anonymous], 2005, HORTSCIENCE, V40, P1082; Bremer K, 1998, ANN MO BOT GARD, V85, P531, DOI 10.2307/2992015; Chatrou LW, 1999, ACTA HORTIC, P43, DOI 10.17660/ActaHortic.1999.497.2; FARRERA-SARMIENTO O., 2011, ANONACEAS PLANTAS AN, P121; GEORGE AP, 1987, SCI HORTIC-AMSTERDAM, V33, P75, DOI 10.1016/0304-4238(87)90034-3; GONZALEZ G.

Carien; Ham, Cori; Laengin, Dirk W.; Theron, Francois			The socioeconomic impact of the phasing out of plantations in the Western and Southern Cape regions of South Africa	SOUTHERN FORESTS			English	Article						communities; phasing out; plantations; socioeconomic impact		This study investigates the possible socioeconomic impact of the phasing out of nearly 22 500 ha of plantations within the Southern and Western Cape regions of South Africa as a result of a decision made by government in 2000. Data was collected in 2007 from three plantations (one near Grabouw in the Western Cape, and two near George in the Southern Cape) managed by Mountain to Ocean Forestry (Pty) Ltd (currently Cape Pine Investment Holdings Ltd), among three different plantation stakeholder groups. These groups are (1) forest-dependent communities, (2) stakeholders among the forestry value chain and (3) indirect stakeholders. This study indicates that there are significant differences between the potential impacts of the phasing-out process within the Southern and Western Cape regions. Communities and secondary processing companies in the Southern Cape are much more dependent on forestry than those in the Western Cape region. The study highlights three aspects related to the phasing-out process that need urgent attention. These are (1) to increase public awareness and community participation among local beneficiaries and companies to be impacted on by the phasing-out process, (2) provide appropriate training and capacity-building and thus increased skills level of workers who face unemployment and (3) the identification of alternative employment opportunities for the unemployed affected by the phasing-out process.

Current research focuses primarily on the role of postal operators in supporting domestic e-commerce and analyzes particular services covering a few aspects of the cross-border e-commerce value chain. This book chapter aims at analyzing the role of postal operators in supporting the growth of international e-commerce. It proposes and discusses four key value propositions of postal operators: 1) cost effective shipping services, 2) enhancing trust, 3) customer management, and 4) universal coverage. The chapter also identifies and analyses innovative postal services along the value chain of cross-border e-commerce, namely: access, payment, collection, transport, delivery, customer service, and return services. By the end of this chapter, executives from the e-commerce industry will have an understanding on how to better cooperate with postal operators to provide new value added services for customers. Postal operators' executives will also be invited to develop new global business models based on product innovation and service diversification adapted to the new needs of e-commerce customers.

Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted from an emerging market perspective. The sample was based on the secondary data collected from three fast-growing industries in India: automobile, pharmaceutical and fast- moving consumer goods over the three-year period from 2009 to 2012. The Panel Poisson and Tobit regression have been used to conduct this study. Findings - Drawing upon the upper echelon theory, the author found that a top management team's educational level, functional heterogeneity and total organizational tenure influence value chain action intensity and value chain activity heterogeneity. Originality/value - The author introduces the concept of value chain action intensity and value chain action heterogeneity and investigates the role of the upper echelon in influencing intensity and heterogeneity.

This approach is illustrated by the case study of the forest and wood products industry in the Green Triangle region in the southeast of South Australia, both the road maps produced and the staged policy recommendations made for immediate, short, and long-term action. The chapter concludes by summarising the key arguments for the use of strategic roadmapping as policy tool for industrial transformation, and identifying some future avenues for strategic roadmapping in the forest and wood products industry and in manufacturing industry in general.

This article describes an overview of audiovisual content market and points out the characteristics identifying future challenges in the light of global economic crisis situation. It highlights the opportunities given as well as their strengths at the moment, mainly from the perspective of new technologies, especially new emission standards and those facilitating the mobility consumption at high speeds exchange data. They provide figures that confirm the current market health, and they do predict a better future. Axis is set to perform well all the activities of their value chain linked to the link in the distribution, especially online display windows and exploitation of copyright, which is multiplied to the extent that these are open windows. This is exemplified sense for Netflix streaming first channel that gets international awards for its emissions, and speaks of the development of Content Delivery Networks (CDN). The paper describes the birth of a new way of creative and critical consumption, without schedules and multi-device which create the user-generated content (UGC), and makes a future investment for content generation as "transmedia".

S	Cauvain, SP	Hill, V			Cauvain, Stanley P.	Hill, V		The Bread VC: Its Health Impact and Structure in France and the US	KAIZEN APPROACH TO FOOD SAFETY: QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN THE VALUE CHAIN FROM WHEAT TO BREAD	Contributions to Management Science		English	Article; Book Chapter							GLYCEMIC-INDEX; DIETARY FIBER; METABOLIC SYNDROME; INSULIN RESPONSES; AMYLOPECTIN STARCH; FOOD STRUCTURE; WHEAT; AMYLOSE; GLUCOSE; MAGNESIUM	This chapter begins with a discussion of the concerns of U.S. consumers regarding bread, carbohydrates and obesity. Although French consumers haven't developed the same concerns about bread as U.S. consumers, French public health officials have undertaken a national campaign based on the GI/GL system to persuade consumers to forego white baguette in favour of breads with lower GI/GL levels to reduce risk of obesity and other serious health conditions. While U.S. public health officials have largely ignored consumers' health concerns associated with bread, bread producers have responded with a multitude of low-carbohydrate (or low GI/GL) products. These differences between consumer attitudes, public health strategies and bread producer response are discussed. The chapter continues with a comparison of the bread market and the three main bread value chain (VC)-industry segments-bakers, millers/grain processors and primary producers-in both countries. Although bakers in both countries receive the same training and use nearly the same ingredients in the same bread varieties, the differences in business management are stark. Likewise, millers/grain processors use similar processes in both countries but business structure is quite different. Wheat grower behaviour in the two countries showed the greatest differences; therefore, these characteristics are discussed in more detail. The chapter ends with an examination of: (1) the ingredients used in bread that may result in a beneficial or detrimental GI/GL value; (2) the production practices used by the baker, miller or wheat grower that could cause changes to protein quality characteristics (that in turn affect GI/GL levels); and (3) consumer behaviour related to bread consumption that could result in a high (i.e. detrimental) GI/GL value.

J	Chan, ALJ				Chan, Andy Lung Jan			Moving up the value chain? The economic theory of factor price equalization and its implications for the translation profession	TRANSLATION SPACES			English	Article						boutique translation company; international economics; factor price equalization; globalization; Heckscher-Ohlin trade model; outsourcing; transcreation; translation profession; value chain		In this age of globalization, and as a result of the advent of information, communication and translation technologies, translation tasks tend to be outsourced or even crowd-sourced to countries with lower wages, and translation fees seem to be on a downward spiral. Downward pressure on translation rates appears to confirm the factor price equalization theorem, a key derivation of the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model in economics. This famous theorem in labor and international economics argues that the prices of factors of production such as wage rate (or return on human capital) are equalized across countries as a result of international trade activities. This paper begins by presenting the theoretical framework of the factor price equalization theorem. It then examines how this theorem can be applied to analyze certain recently observed phenomena in the market for professional services in general and in the translation market in particular, and discusses implications for professional translators, language service providers and translator training institutions.

J	Farsi, JY; Zarei, B; Mahdi, L				Farsi, Jahangir Yadollahi; Zarei, Behroz; Mahdi, Lashgari			Value Chain analysis for opportunity exploitation in software industry	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW			English	Article						value chain analysis; critical success factors; opportunity exploitation; software industry		Competitive advantage defines a powerful tool that strategic managers need for recognizing and increasing company's competitive advantage, this tool is called the value chain. Famous software companies in the world have been able to capture the market of software products by good understanding of the market, value chain analysis and appropriate planning. Software value chain includes effective and important components in creating competitive advantage that should be analyzed. In this study the effective factors in competitive advantage and analysis of software value chain components are discussed. Research methodology is mixed of qualitative - quantitative and practical method. After reviewing the literatures and gathering researches since 2000 to 2012, using interviews and analysis of qualitative data with coding them, important and effective components of software value chain were identified and by the use of these components questionnaire was developed. After distributing the questionnaire, factor analysis was accomplished to identify the major components of the value chain in the software development. Finally, components analysis of the software value chain was done for enhancing competitive advantage compared with competitors.

J	Kam, AJY				Kam, Andrew Jia-Yi			Revisiting the productivity growth and spillovers debate: the case of Malaysian manufacturing sector	JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY			English	Article						productivity growth; spillovers; middle-income trap; industry dualism; manufacturing; Malaysia	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; TECHNOLOGY; ELECTRONICS; MIRACLE	Malaysia, a country which aspires to be an industrialised nation by the year 2020 is now facing the dilemma of industrialisation slowdown - 'the middle-income trap'. The search for sources of economic growth in this paper drew attention to the productivity growth debate a la Krugman's 'Perspiration vs. Inspiration' discussion. The paper hypothesised that increase in productivity growth is viewed as the key for breaking free from the middle-income trap. Based on Malaysia's early experiences in hosting multinational corporations, this paper also examines the incidence of spillovers from foreign to local industries as a way to improve productivity growth. Findings suggest that increase in skill intensity and capital utilisation may allow countries to move up the value chain and move out of the middle-income trap. Finally, evidence of spillovers may imply that the industrial dualism concerns may be less profound in the later years of a country's industrialisation phase.

J	Larsen, HB; Lindkvist, KB				Larsen, Heidi Bjonnes; Lindkvist, Knut Bjorn			Generating Generative Mechanisms: A Realist Approach to Recapturing a Seafood Market	JOURNAL OF CRITICAL REALISM			English	Article						generating generative mechanisms; seafood markets; deep structures; value chains; cultural strategy; salted fish		Based on the stratified ontology of critical realism, this paper identifies four decisive, lasting diachronic and synchronic deep structures in a traditional European seafood value chain and seafood market. Realist philosophy constitutes a platform from which to explore strategies and possible new mechanisms to overcome export barriers that Norwegian producers face, and to adjust the current causal deep structures in the value chain for salted cod between Norway and Spain. The paper is based on a thorough empirical study that investigates possible strategies by which Norwegian producers can create an interaction between production knowledge and market knowledge in order to sell products at a reasonable profit. This paper is an example of how research projects can be ontologically and methodologically based on critical realism, and how critical realism can support the search for an emancipatory strategy for a resource periphery.

J	Lategan, LOK				Lategan, L. O. K.			"RESEARCH EDUCATION": A CONCEPT WIDER THAN POSTGRADUATE SUPERVISION?	JOURNAL FOR NEW GENERATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Research education; methodological training; assessment; postgraduate supervision		This paper promotes the argument that although conventional postgraduate supervision is useful to address the research skills and competences of postgraduate students, a wider perspective is nonetheless required to educate and train any researcher (including postgraduate students upon their entree into the world of research) to comprehend the demands made by research and how best these demands can be addressed. It is in this context that a more comprehensive concept of research education is promoted. The argument is based on the perspective that methodological understanding alone is not sufficient to assist a researcher in meeting the expectations of a research project. Research education refers to the training of researchers to be responsive to the research value chain. This includes aspects such as the formal research process, the importance of research ethics and integrity regarding the research project, the imperative to promote scholarship in research and the application of research results through technology transfer, innovation and incubation. Research education sensitizes the researcher to look beyond the scope of the academic research project and to extend the research to activities such as technology transfer, innovation, commercialization and partnerships. The aim of research education is to promote the wide range of aspects contributing to the understanding of what counts as research and its application.	[Lategan, L. O.

J	Lazard, J				Lazard, Jerome			The diversity in world fish culture as illustrated by the cases of China and Nigeria	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Article						China; development dynamics; fish culture; intensive catfish culture; Nigeria; rice-fish culture	AQUACULTURE	World fish culture production has experienced a dramatic increase during the last 30 years (9% per year) and has reached the level of landings by capture fisheries in terms of contribution to food security. Fish culture displays a wide range of production systems which facilitate its development in all kinds of environmental situations, by all types of operators and for a variety of markets. Fish plays a key role as food for poor people but fish culture has not yet succeeded in becoming an efficient tool for alleviating poverty. Two examples are presented in this article: rice-fish culture in China and African catfish culture in Nigeria. The former is an extensive system consisting in cultivating a food crop and food fish together, emphasizing all the natural synergies occurring in a paddy field resulting in a high level of global efficiency. This heritage system, after having experienced a slowdown during the agricultural intensification of the "green revolution," is recovering a major role in the framework of an ecosystemic and socio-economical approach. The second system is the very first large scale aquaculture system ever developed in sub Saharan Africa. A market-oriented catfish value chain has been implemented by private entrepreneurs which should largely benefit in the future from a situation of fish food deficit encountered by Nigeria.

The Maputo Declaration in 2003 sanctioned that agriculture must become the economic engine driving development, and governments should consistently invest at least 10% of their total budget to this sector. However, not many African countries have achieved this target or have even gotten near it, as most countries have only obtained 5% of the target. Based on TechnoServe Zimbabwe's work with Better Agriculture Private Limited, a private Zimbabwe agribusiness company, this case study provides a clear testimony of how the private sector, can play a pivotal role in changing the lives of those who in desperate need.

As the smartphone ecosystem has evolved within the value chain of the ICT industry, smartphone manufacturers can benefit from open innovation, such as by making use of external resources and collaboration networks. However, most studies on smartphones have focused on aspects of product innovation, such as functional differentiation, usability, and market penetration rather than on innovation networks. The aim of this study is to examine how the open innovation approaches and strategic fit of smartphone manufacturers function in delivering innovation outcomes and business performance. This research examines the relationship between seven smartphone manufacturers and their collaboration partners during a recent three-year period, by analyzing four specific areas: hardware components, software, content services, and telecommunications.

J	Patel, DM				Patel, Disha Maheshkumar			The Export Trading Group: Unlocking Africa's Agricultural Potential	INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						Agribusiness; trading; small-holder; commodity; Africa		Export Trading Group (ETG), is an agricultural supply chain manager with operations along the value chain ranging from procurement of cereals, pulses and oilseeds; storage; processing; transportation, distribution and marketing. ETG is present in 41 countries globally and generated a turnover of $1.8 billion USD in 2012. ETG has built this business by linking small-holder African farmers to a diverse pool of global buyers and efficiently managing this value chain. Their success is also attributed to their ability to adapt themselves and operations to each new country, making the necessary infrastructure and logistics investments to support a commodity trading business and sound financial and risk management. The impact ETG has had in the African agricultural sector is phenomenal. Not only have they created value for farmers by enabling them to earn consistent incomes from agriculture but more importantly, instilled in them, a renewed optimism about the viability of farming and agriculture as a business.

J	Seke, D				Seke, D.			From Metal to money: the importance of reliable metallurgical accounting	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						metallurgical accounting; corporate governance; sampling; analysis		Metal inventories are usually reported in financial statements of mining companies. However, the value of these inventories can be reliable only if the metals in stock are measured within acceptable tolerances. Reliable metal balancing requires accurate mass measurement, sampling, and chemical analysis. Many mining companies are usually unable to validate the accuracy of metals in inventories at the end of their financial year. This is mainly due to poor mass measurement, sampling, and chemical analysis practices. This has an adverse impact on metallurgical accounting and metal valuation. In addition, it puts a lot of stress on external auditors, who have the duty to recommend the approval of the financial statements to the board of directors. Although a full value chain of metal reconciliation includes the accuracy of Mineral Reserve definition and grade control at the mine, this paper discusses the implementation of best practices for mass measurement, sampling, and chemical analysis at processing plants. This is an important aspect of sampling and reconciliation that is required in order to improve the reporting of inventories in the financial statements of public mining companies.

Cassava value chain and its products in Morogoro rural district, Tanzania	DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE			English	Article						Aid - Capacity development; Civil society - Participation; Environment (built and natural) - Food security; Labour and livelihoods - Poverty reduction		This study was conducted to examine the cassava value chain and determine strategies for enhancing farmers' profitable participation in the chain, to reduce poverty in Tanzania. Data were collected from 98 farmers from three villages of Morogoro rural district. Profit and marketing margins along the cassava value chain were computed. A linear model was estimated whereby farm size, experience, total family labour, group participation, non-crop livelihood sources, and food insecurity were the main determinants of profitability. The emerging recommendation was for farmers' participation in profitable cassava value chain strands by strengthened coordination, improved cassava varieties, and enhanced agronomic practices and processing technologies.

J	Smith, F				Smith, Freya			Asset protection in multinational enterprises - where to now? Implications for asset protection planning in multinational enterprises from the OECD's work on BEPS	MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						Multinational enterprises; Asset protection; Automatic information exchange; Base erosion and profit shifting	LIABILITY	Purpose - This paper aims to shed light on the potential implications for asset protection planning in multinational enterprises (MNEs) from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)'s work on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) and the global push towards increased transparency and automatic information exchange. Design/methodology/approach - An examination of the academic literature across a range of areas of the law relevant to MNEs and an analysis of the risks facing MNEs and the significance of asset protection in managing these risks. An examination of the OECD's work on BEPS and automatic information exchange and implications for asset protection strategies utilised by MNEs with a particular focus on the critical issues of disclosure, ownership and control. Findings - The full extent to which MNEs will be affected by the OECD's work on BEPS remains unknown. Early signs indicate a significant shift in the focus of tax rules away from the pricing of specific transactions between related entities to the total global value chain of an MNE opening the door for more widespread adoption of enterprise liability and for states to obtain a complete view of MNE tax and asset protection planning, potentially including previously impenetrable trusts and limited liability companies. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first to provide an analysis of the importance of asset protection to MNEs and the potential risks arising for asset protection planning in MNEs from the OECD's work on BEPS and automatic information exchange.

J	Velte, M; Dannenberg, P				Velte, Maria; Dannenberg, Peter			Export horticulture - empowering female small-scale farmers in Kenya?	ERDE			English	Article						Export horticulture; global value chains; gender roles; Global South; Kenya	VALUE CHAINS; GOVERNANCE; VEGETABLES	Export horticulture is one of Kenya's most dynamic sectors, with the Mount Kenya Region playing a crucial role as a result of its professional large-and small-scale production and marketing structures. The sector is consequently referred to as a "success story of African regional development" (Dolan and Sutherland 2002: 1). A qualitative case study was carried out to understand the impacts on gender inequality of the integration of horticultural smallholdings into the fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) supply chain to the European market. It will be outlined how export horticulture affects female small-scale farmers with reference to local distribution channels, the organisation of the farm as a group or an individual player, and the specific organisation of labour on the farm. The focus here is on the traditional division of labour, ownership and mobility patterns, as well as knowledge and income. The study shows that the influence of the integration in the FFV chain on gender inequality is conditioned by both the type of relations to the buyers and the internal and institutional organisation of the smallholding. Surprisingly, in some areas of the primarily male-dominated rural society, an integration in the form of outgrower schemes that resem-bles Gereffi et al.'s model of a captive value chain, with women farmers exclusively responsible for export production, can enhance gender equality, as women gradually gain more decision-making power and greater independence.

J	Vicol, M				Vicol, Mark			Potato contract farming and 'privileged spaces': preliminary insights from rural Maharashtra	ERDE			English	Article						Contract farming; India; rural livelihoods; global value chains; agriculture	FRESH VEGETABLES; CHAINS; SUPERMARKETS; LIVELIHOODS; GOVERNANCE; NETWORKS; AFRICA; TRADE; RISE	The emergence of modern value chain schemes such as contract farming in rural India are exposing households to new forms of agricultural production. Evidently, the spread of such schemes in India will have spatial implications for rural development. This short communication offers preliminary insights of the contours of these spatial implications from a case study of potato contract farming in three villages in Maharashtra, India. It is proposed that studies that combine a local-scale livelihoods approach with global value chain analysis can strengthen understanding of agricultural change and rural development by grounding value chain analysis in the place-based everyday realities of rural households. Using this approach to adopt an evolutionary view of livelihoods and value chains will lead to a much deeper understanding of possible future development pathways for rural households under conditions of agricultural transformation.

J	Young, S; Ross, D; MacKay, B				Young, Stephen; Ross, Duncan; MacKay, Brad			Inward foreign direct investment and constitutional change in Scotland	MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						Foreign Direct Investment; Scotland; Multinationals; Independence; Constitutional change		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to undertake an analysis of the implications of potential Scottish independence for inward foreign direct investment (FDI), multinational enterprise strategies and the local economy. Design/methodology/approach - This paper takes a multidisciplinary approach drawing on literature and evidence in the international business and management, political economy and economic geography fields to analyse the role and impact of inward FDI in Scotland following possible Scottish independence. Findings - Scotland continues as an attractive location for FDI, with greater diversity than hitherto. While the country's comparative advantages in immobile natural resources provide some protection from uncertainty, weak embeddedness is a risk factor irrespective of independence. A range of transition costs of independence are identified, which could be high and of indeterminate duration, and some will be sector-specific. There are also new possibilities for tailoring of policies and potential reindustrialization opportunities in renewable technologies. The foreign investors most vulnerable to political risks and uncertainties are those whose market scope is the rest of the UK (rUK) either as exporters or value-chain integrators, in addition to the high political risk industries of energy, banking and financial services and defence. Scottish subsidiaries' significance within their parent MNE groups will also be a major factor in determining responses to political risks and uncertainties. Originality/value - Specific focus on the impact of potential independence on the foreign-owned sector as a major contributor to the Scottish economy.

Modeling the Value Chain with Object-Valued Petri Nets	COMPUTATIONAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING	Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering		English	Article; Book Chapter						Value chain; Object-valued Petri nets; Cycle Petri nets; Simulation; Model validation		A substantial part of the economic theories is based on conversion and exchange process. These processes can be arranged in a value chain, which can be considered as a cyclic model with complex attributes. There is a serious problem how to express resources and their conversions in a complex cyclic model during the simulation and how to identify these converted resources in every step of the simulation. This paper introduces the Object-valued Petri (OV-PN) modification as a new formalism to create a cyclic model of the value chain. According to the modification we had to define a new path and pass of the OV-PN. We also had to determine new properties. Properties are based on the OV-PN and reflect needs of model requirements. A new formalism is verified on a common enterprise value chain.

J	Zdraveski, D; Janeska, M; Taleska, S				Zdraveski, Dejan; Janeska, Margarita; Taleska, Suzana			The UML Model of Business Intelligence System in Increasing Corporate Performance	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT			English	Article						UML; modelling; business processes; logistics; inventory; performance		In the new environment of open economy and high competitiveness on the market of products and services, the operation of companies must be based on information-based structure. To a large extent, of a company's performance depends on how well its business processes are conceived and coordinated. Business processes can be a source of competitive advantage if they allow the company to be more innovative or to perform the activities better than other competitors. Also, business processes can have negative effects if they are based on the traditional ways of working that impede the company's rapid response and efficiency. From that point, companies must evaluate their information systems: whether they represent a strategic business tool to achieve the main goal of the company, whether they only support or are an integral part of business processes, and so on. Modern-day information systems and information technology automate many steps in business processes and modify the flow of information, allowing parallel execution of multiple activities and efficiency in the decision-making process. The world has become a "small village" with a highly competitive environment that provides opportunities for rapid growth in profits, but also a quick way to failure. From that point, business intelligence is an important tool to support both functional and business and corporate strategy. In this article, a system for business intelligence based on UML language will be applied for inventory management process as part of the input logistics value chain in order to optimize corporate performance. UML modelling should allow tracking warehouse inventory, analysis and disclosure of the reasons for their effectiveness or ineffectiveness. In particular, it should enable top management to report on key performance indicators, such as: inventory accuracy, the accuracy of deliveries, the percentage of deliveries made on time, the time of execution of the order, the availability and turnover of stocks and so on. The main purpose of the application of modelling inventory is to adapt to the continuous changes in the environment and improvement and/or innovation of this business process.

J	Cave, M				Cave, Martin			Extending competition in network industries: Can input markets circumvent the need for an administered access regime?	UTILITIES POLICY			English	Article						Unbundling; Input markets; Access pricing; Opportunity cost; Effective competition		Unbundling bottlenecks in the value chain of network industries has made it possible to introduce retail and some upstream competition into the sectors, but access to the unbundled assets, and to certain natural inputs, is generally achieved by a command and control administrative process which defines access products and sets administrative prices for them. Yet this mode of price setting and allocation is contentious, difficult and fallible. The paper explores the alternative approach of using input markets. Six examples are reviewed: three relating to natural resources (spectrum, water abstraction rights and natural gas), and three to manufactured inputs (airport landing slots, trail paths and access to pipes and wires). The analysis shows that market design is crucial; that achieving effective competition without structural measures is problematic; and that some markets have to be built on regulatory underpinnings. However, the potential benefits are large and lessons learnt can be applied elsewhere. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Huacuja, FE				Echanove Huacuja, Flavia			Agricultural Policy and the Feed Industry in Mexico	MEXICAN STUDIES-ESTUDIOS MEXICANOS			English	Article						agriculture; agricultural policy; subsidies; price hedging; contract farming; grain producers; sorghum; animal feed; agribusiness; Mexico		Mexico is the fourth world producer of animal feed, a highly productive and dynamic sector in the last decades. This has resulted in a growing demand for grains used as inputs for its industrial processing (maize, sorghum and soybeans), which feed producers acquire as much from the US market as in the domestic Mexican market. In this article I analyze the supply mechanisms of feed agribusiness, particularly in the case of their national purchases of sorghum, as well as the role that agricultural policies play in those mechanisms. From 1994 to 2007 the Mexican government subsidized the imports of grains by the feed producer sector, while it recently implemented the program of "contract farming" to encourage the firms to acquire national grains and to support their producers. The objective of this paper is to analyze the characteristics and problems of this subsidy program, based on two changing variables (international prices of the grains and exchange rate), which makes it highly vulnerable. The article also analyzes the geographical setting where these firms and other participating agents operate in the value chain.

J	McCallum, D; Campbell, AM; MacRae, R				McCallum, Doug; Campbell, Alissa Mae; MacRae, Rod			Can large retailers localize supply chains? A case analysis of the challenges facing one Canadian retailer	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						localization; national food retailer; supply chain; value chain; Canada	FOOD SYSTEMS; RURAL-DEVELOPMENT; EMBEDDEDNESS; NETWORKS; PLACE	Extensive access to a major Canadian retailer (referred to as the Company) provided an opportunity to understand more fully its challenges when buying local food. Many of the Company volume and quality requirements of vendors are difficult to meet because they require a scale sophistication that is typically absent for local growers. Particularly challenging are the needs to lengthen product life, coordinate transport, and aggregate supply. Liability associated with spoiled product is especially onerous for small growers. Using a value supply-chain framework (Stevenson & Pirog, 2008), we conclude that the steps taken by the retailer toward localization will not be successful without significant investments in product differentiation, the financial health of their supplier base, strategic alliances, and shared governance.

J	Bergh, JP; Falcon, RMS; Falcon, LM				Bergh, J. P.; Falcon, R. M. S.; Falcon, L. M.			Techno-economic impact of optimized low-grade thermal coal export production through beneficiation modelling	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						coal beneficiation; techno-economics; thermal coal; dense medium processing; dry processing; fine coal processing; environmental impact		The advent of low-quality export coal demand has brought a new range of possibilities to the South African coal industry. Products that traditionally were only of value to the domestic or combustion industry sectors now have the potential to be exported, with only minor amounts of upgrading required through beneficiation. Comparatively high steam-coal export prices can be obtained for low-quality export coal, which enhances the economic feasibility of expanding low-quality thermal coal exports. There are, however, increasing concerns about the feasibility of lower quality thermal coal exports and the broader implications. These concerns relate to the environmental impact of low-quality thermal coal production for export and the inherent threat to the security of domestic thermal coal supply in South Africa. Against this background, this paper serves to explain the extended value chain in the production of export coal. The technical and economic advantages and disadvantages of low-grade exports versus coal production for domestic use are evaluated. The value chain estimation is calculated by the beneficiation modelling and characterization of two coals. Based on the value estimation, the low-grade export production scenario, and finally the modelling of potential pollutant distribution, are described.	[Bergh, J. P.; Falcon, R. M. S.; Falcon, L.

J	Bristol, J				Bristol, Joan			A Trail of Precious Goods: Colonial Latin American Commodity History	HISTORY COMPASS			English	Article								Products such as cacao, tobacco, sugar, cochineal, emeralds, and silver were produced or extracted and, in many cases, originated in the region now called Latin America. They became global commodities under Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule during the early modern period, roughly 1500 to 1800, when they were traded to Europe and Asia. In many cases, goods that were originally limited to elites and defined as luxuries were transformed into products destined for mass consumption. African and indigenous slavery and other forms of unfree labor were crucial in the production of colonial commodities. Commodity historians approach these goods in different ways, some taking a world systems approach to discuss the development of capitalism while others focusing on physical and esthetic taste, patterns of consumption, and social relations and status. Some commodity writers focus on consumption patterns in Europe and Asia while others focus on the production and labor side of the equation. Recently, scholars have used a commodity chain approach that looks at all stages of the process of production, commodification, circulation, and consumption.

J	Ferry, EE				Ferry, Elizabeth Emma			The Birth of the Mineral Species "Aguilarite" andWhat Came Next: A Twice-Told Tale	JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article								This article explores the emergence of the mineral species aguilarite, discovered by Ponciano Aguilar in Guanajuato, Mexico, in the early 1890s. In itself, aguilarite is not particularly significant-it is a dark, somewhat dull mineral that has no economic use and only moderate interest for collectors or mineralogists. However, the circumstances of its discovery, naming, and subsequent life lend themselves to two modes of analysis and types of insight-one coming out of the work of Bruno Latour and others in the field, known as "Actor Network Theory" (ANT), and the other influenced by political economy in anthropology, with particular emphasis on "commodity- chain studies." This work examines aguilarite's birth to look at some of the ways these two approaches treat the relationship between things and people, and the consequences of those treatments. What do these two ways of telling aguilarite's story reveal and conceal? How might they work together?

J	Lochner, F				Lochner, Ferdie			The concept of the functionality grid and technological literacy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						technological literacy; technological innovations; Chief Technology Officer; functionality grid; experimental design		Technological progress is fast-paced and complex, manifesting across the value chain for all business enterprises. Therefore, technology is a critical part of economic progress, but evidence shows a widespread lack of technological literacy in boardrooms and societies across the globe. In light of this problem, this article describes the basic essence of technology, and demonstrates with a controlled experiment how a toolset known as the functionality grid promotes technological literacy. From these results follows a set of practical recommendations for boardrooms to consider in order to promote technological literacy, to help organisations harness the full benefit of technological innovations and ultimately to help busy executives to comply with their governance obligations related to their business technologies.

This was in response to the fact that Sub-Saharan Africa's small-scale farmers seem to have been trapped in cycles of poverty, and that the regional economy has stagnated. Using a market baseline survey in Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Programme (SSACP) found that disorganised markets and marketing were major factors in perpetuating poverty cycles and subsistence agriculture. These markets are characterised, among others, by too many players within a value chain, a lack of collective marketing and collective purchasing, poor transport infrastructure, a lack of value addition, poor market information, poor access to market information or a total lack of market information, and unfavourable trade policies and/or a lack of any. Although smallholder farmers are the highest investors in terms of land, tools, time, labour, inputs and transport along the value chains, they benefit least when it comes to earnings. Hence it is not economical to produce surpluses in the absence of assured markets, good market policies and reliable marketing strategies. The results show that gender is an important component in the value chains, depending on the historical realities. In the DRC, for example, a country that has been in crisis for long, women have ventured into long-and short-distancetrade. In Uganda, a country that has been at peace for at least 20 years, men trade more and further away from home. In Rwanda, where there has been 15 years of peace, men and women seemed to share the trading space in the country equally. It was also observed that the IAR4D approach may be the most relevant and appropriate one for addressing poverty in SSA through its integration of markets as core ingredients in agriculture, and the formation of innovation platforms (IPs) with stakeholders interested in the plight of farmers in their localities.

This study was conducted in order to evaluate the socioeconomic and environmental impact of VOME sector in France in 2010 and to compare its impact to diesel sector's one in France, in 2010. The chosen approach is based on an evaluation of the sector all along the value chain in order to quantifying economic values (added value, global economic surplus, employment) and environmental externalities. It provides a picture of the French sector in 2010.

J	Stockwell, BR; Bradley, E; Davis, D; Smith, J				Stockwell, Brian R.; Bradley, Elaine; Davis, Deborah; Smith, Jonathan			Peri-urban food futures: Opportunities and challenges to reconfiguring sustainable local agri-food value chains on the Sunshine Coast, Australia	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						local and regional food; peri-urban; rural development; sustainable agriculture		A new rural development paradigm has emerged over the last decade. It is multifaceted by nature, connecting practices of landscape management, agritourism, organic and sustainable farming, and value-chain analysis and management. Increased food production in peri-urban areas in the developed world is typical of this new paradigm. Peri-urban areas are the transitional zones between rural and urban landscapes that experience constant population change and disturbance of traditional social, environmental, and economic characteristics. Sustainable community development initiatives are complicated in these fragmented and often contested landscapes. A case study on Australia's Sunshine Coast analyzes the challenges and opportunities of reconfiguring agri-food production systems to achieve the type of multifunctional landscape preferred by the community and primary producers alike. Scenario analysis, interviews, and surveys of traditional midscale farmers with more recent micro- to small primary producers and food artisans provide insight into the challenges faced at a grassroots level. The role of government in facilitating supportive policy and planning and connecting and building the capacity of key actors involved in local and regional food value chains is reviewed. The paper argues that the government is essential to the successful planning and management of peri-urban areas because of the fragmented and/or contested quality of this unique agri-food landscape. Without further investment in place-based collaborative research, planning, capacity building, and economic development, the local food movement in these peri-urban areas is likely to continue to occupy only a narrow "alternative" cultural and economic space.

Reducing this sector's 'carbon footprint' can help to meet targets set under the Kyoto Protocol. Carbon dioxide emissions reduction is now a legal requirement under the UK's Climate Change Act; infrastructure clients therefore require their supply chains to provide carbon footprint information. A new, more holistic, project-specific carbon footprinting approach is urgently needed to account for carbon in an integrated manner, identifying areas of carbon hot spots and developing a reduction hierarchy to support business decision making. In this paper a process-based carbon footprinting framework based on the PAS2050:2011 protocol is adopted. Results of case studies (focusing on the carbon footprint) of 'typical' UK highway maintenance processes are provided, namely pavement resurfacing, pavement marking, bulk lamp changing and grass cutting. These processes were selected across urban, semi-urban and rural site locations to investigate the significance of these locations on the carbon footprint. The results indicate the robustness of the PAS2050-compliant framework for highway maintenance carbon footprinting; areas of carbon hotspots and related reduction opportunities can be identified to inform the reduction hierarchy across the processes value chain. The research presented can be used as a framework to plan, evaluate and manage highway maintenance programmes and carbon budgets over the maintenance processes value chain.

Observations on fishery and biology of yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares (Bonnaterre, 1788) from Lakshadweep waters	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES			English	Article						Biology; Feeding; Fishery; Lakshadweep; Thunnus albacares; Yellowfin tuna		The yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares is a high value oceanic resource for which targeted fishing was initiated in 2008 in Lakshadweep islands. Pole and line, troll line and drift gillnet are the major gears operated in the islands using traditionally designed mechanised Pablo boats of 25 to 34 feet overall length. Fishing operation is mainly practised during September to May. The estimated landing of total fish from three islands of Lakshadweep (Minicoy, Androth and Agatti) during January December, 2011 was 1555 t, of which tuna contributed 83%. Maximum yellowfin tuna landing was recorded from Minicoy (84%) followed by Agatti (9 %) and Androth (7%). Smaller sized yellowfin tuna with fork length (FL) measuring 42-46 cm were observed throughout the year. Swarming crab, Charybdis smithii was the dominant food component with index of relative importance (IRI) of 87.5 followed by Auxis thazard (IRI - 5.3) and Cheilopogon sp. (IRI - 0.8). Since the inception of the World Bank aided National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), on 'Developing a value chain for oceanic tunas in Lakshadweep islands', targeted fishing for yellowfin tuna has resulted in 37% increase in the landing of this species.

In today's complex and dynamic business environment, companies are often prevented from effectively and efficiently evaluating relevant factors necessary for developing their core capability strategic systems. These systems, with inherent human decision-making processes, should be fully considered when creating a method for determining a firm's suitable or required core capabilities. It is helpful to implement IT-based group decision support systems (GDSS) with soft computing algorithms to assist managers in determining the appropriate core capabilities for the firm. Therefore, this study develops a holistic group decision support system in which similarity measures, fuzzy set theory, and fuzzy mathematics programming are implemented to facilitate managers in making decisions. Through evaluations done in actual cases, we have found that this system creates a flexible and user-friendly environment that aids top management and other relevant staff members in evaluating all relevant factors related to core capabilities.

J	Clay, T				Clay, Tiffany			New Venture: A New Model for Clean Energy Innovation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								The clean energy sector has been plagued by challenges and setbacks.Yet, some success stories are just beginning to emerge. Using two case studies and a number of other examples, the author identifies four core elements that have underpinned many of the most successful emerging clean energy enterprises: (1) close partnerships with large industrial companies; (2) the ability to integrate (actually or synthetically) across the value chain; (3) global focus; and (4) a drive toward cost-competitive economics without subsidies.The fact that most of these elements were also critical to the success of the wave of innovation spurred by the biotechnology revolution during the past three decades is cause for optimism about the potential for clean energy to develop similarly successful innovation models.

J	Wang, Z				Wang, Zheng (John)			Co-Curation: New Strategies, Roles, Services, and Opportunities for Libraries in the Post-Web Era and the Digital Media Context	LIBRI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION STUDIES			English	Article								The author reasons that libraries need to expand their traditional services in the Post-Web Era. A library's core values are reflected in the convenience it brings to users for quick access and consumption of content. The traditional value chain of libraries (acquisitions - catalog - discovery and access-based services) significantly lags behind the current times, and thus can no longer effectively serve the library's core values. It is critical for libraries to amend the value chain at the point of content use (acquisitions - catalog -discovery and access-based services - use). The new value chain incorporates co-curation services between library staff and users and among users themselves. Not only does the author discuss the significance for such an extension, but he also demonstrates possible new roles for libraries in content utilization through an innovative project of the Emory University Libraries, Readux (Read Edit Annotation Digital User Experience). By enabling co-curation (read, annotate, describe, collaborate, share, import, export, and publish), libraries will create new opportunities to support users and themselves in the digital media context.

The study of the value chain included interviews with producers, handlers, and fruit and by-product sellers. In order to evaluate the rehydration process of this fruit, marolo was dehydrated using a conventional procedure and freeze-drying. The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design and a triple factorial scheme (2 x 2 x 6). ANOVA was performed, followed by the Tukey's test (p < 0.05). Regression models were generated and adjusted for the time factor. The precariousness of the value chain of marolo was observed. The best procedure for marolo dehydration should be determined according to the intended use of the dehydrated product since the water-absorption capacity of the flour is higher and convective hot-air-drying is more effective in retaining soluble solids and reducing damage to the fruit. These results aim at contributing to the marolo value chain and to the preservation of native trees in the Brazilian savanna biome and can be used to analyze other underutilized crops.

J	Edgington, DW; Hayter, R				Edgington, David W.; Hayter, Roger			In situ dynamics of Japanese electronic subsidiaries in ASEAN countries: Reflections from a development perspective	ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT			English	Article						ASEAN; electronics industry; Japan; MNCs; subsidiary development	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ASIA-PACIFIC; REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS; FLYING GEESE; FIRMS; CORPORATIONS; ENTERPRISES; INVESTMENT	This paper contributes to the theory of subsidiary evolution in multinational corporations through utilising a value chain approach. It assesses the changing activities of the branches of Japanese electronics firms located in Southeast Asia (the ASEAN region) since the 19971998 financial crisis. In the paper, we argue that a modest development of Japanese subsidiaries has occurred in this region during the past 10 years or so. We connect models of subsidiary development to Michael Porter's value chain in the results of a set of interviews with 37 managers in the factories, sales offices and regional headquarters of Japanese subsidiary companies located in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. We show that decentralisation of management functions from Japan occurred in both primary and support activities of the value chain. However, corporate long-term research and development did not disperse to Southeast Asia and is unlikely to in the near future. The article interprets these results and highlights the need for further research relating to the evolving geography of Japanese electronics multinational corporations and their subsidiaries in Southeast Asia.

Although fishing tourism is widely recognized as an instrument for local economic development, the value added by the industry is low This results from the spatial organization of production, the knowledge bases surrounding the industry and the value chain coordination none of which, in their current format, are conducive to promoting regional development and developing an innovative milieu. Through an analysis of the value chain of fishing tourism, this article demonstrates that different, but relational knowledge, restructuring of the industry and new attitudes are needed, in order to develop a dynamic economic environment based on marine fishing tourism; one where a fishing destination is created around an existing fishing village, using tourism to boost the local economy in innovative ways.

J	Maine, E; Lubik, S; Garnsey, E				Maine, Elicia; Lubik, Sarah; Garnsey, Elizabeth			Value creation strategies for science-based business: A study of advanced materials ventures	INNOVATION-ORGANIZATION & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						science-based business; value creation; generic technology; radical innovation; technology entrepreneurship; advanced materials; technology commercialization; value chain positioning; uncertainty; nanomaterials; product and process innovation	TECHNOLOGY-BASED FIRMS; START-UPS; INNOVATION; GROWTH; RESOURCES; MARKETS	Science-based businesses have become the main drivers of commercialization for radical technological advances, but face high technology uncertainty over long time frames, the need for significant complementary assets and require substantial financing. Advanced materials ventures are a sparsely studied type of science-based business, though sufficiently different from others, such as biotech, to merit individual study. What strategies do advanced materials ventures use to overcome their daunting commercialization challenges? To address this question, this paper draws on literature on value creation and advanced materials commercialization, and presents new evidence from a sample of 43 advanced materials ventures from three countries. Through a hierarchical cluster analysis, the sample is subdivided into nanomaterials, performance materials, and fuel cell ventures and sub-group commercialization characteristics are described and compared. We find empirical support for an earlier model of value creation by advanced materials ventures, and identify successful commercialization strategies according to sub-group. Our findings suggest that embracing uncertainty enhances value creation for nanomaterials and performance materials ventures but can diminish value creation for ventures commercializing fuel cell technologies. Successful firms commercializing nanomaterials and performance materials leveraged the generic nature of their technologies to achieve higher value creation, but tailored the technology to each target market. In contrast, successful fuel cell firms integrated further forward along their value chains and standardized their products across target markets.

J	Rugraff, E				Rugraff, Eric			Why are spillovers through backward linkages from multinational corporations in the Czech motor industry still limited?	POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES			English	Article							FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; DOMESTIC FIRMS; FDI SPILLOVERS; NETWORKS	This article uses the AMADEUS firm-level database and annual reports of companies to study spillovers through backward linkages from multinational corporations onto indigenous suppliers in the Czech motor industry. We use financial and non-financial indicators of foreign-owned and indigenous suppliers to define quantitative indicators to evaluate the quantity and quality of backward linkages. We suggest that the impact of MNCs on the quantity of backward linkages is mixed: in our sample Czech-owned suppliers represent half of the companies but they contribute only little to the total turnover of the suppliers. The new position of follow-source suppliers in the motor industry value chain explains the fragile position of indigenous suppliers in small emerging economies. The presence of numerous foreign-owned affiliates belonging to global MNCs, with whom the manufacturers are engaged in relational linkages on a world scale, also explains the absence of interest of the MNCs in relational linkages with the indigenous supply base.

Franchising provides appropriate training and incentives to on-site personnel, and also offers backup off-site skills. Findings indicate that many opportunities lie in the franchising of suitable elements in the water services value chain, and a selection of these has been modelled. The franchising concept is being piloted with considerable success in the Eastern Cape province. Under the guidance of a franchisor, trainee franchisees are undertaking the cleaning and routine maintenance of the sanitation facilities at 400 schools. Irish Aid is funding the concept development, while the franchisees are paid by the provincial Department of Education from the normal departmental budgets for operation and maintenance. Services delivery has shown such a marked improvement that the Department is requesting rollout to a further 1000 schools.

J	Antero, MC; Bjorn-Andersen, N				Antero, Michelle C.; Bjorn-Andersen, Niels			Why a Partner Ecosystem Results in Superior Value: A Comparative Analysis of the Business Models of Two ERP Vendors	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Business Model; Ecosystem; Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Resource Based View; Value		The paper carries out a historical analysis of business conducted over 25 years by two enterprise resource planning (ERP) software vendors in Denmark-Maconomy and Navision-each employing its own business model. Maconomy adopted a business model where the company itself would develop, sell, and implement ERP packages directly to its customers; whereas, Navision adopted a business model which relied on an ecosystem of partners consisting of value added resellers (VAR) and independent software vendors (ISV). Using the Resource Based View (RBV), the paper compared and contrasted the capabilities and resources of the two companies. The key finding is that Navision provided superior customer value and, consequently, collected superior rent, as shown by its selling price of as much as 16 times the selling price of Maconomy. The analysis shows that the main reason for this huge difference is the value of Navision's ecosystem, which had enabled the company to achieve substantial economies of scale. This finding has implications far beyond the ERP field. The results of the study point to this direction: Technology will lead to more intermediation and the inclusion of more economic units in the traditional value chain or value network due to lower transaction costs and increased focus on core competences.

The Hansen (1992) parameter instability test and the Gregory and Hansen (1996) residual-based test are used for testing the structural break and determining the time of the regime shift. The results provide an indication that the avian influenza outbreak might have been the reason for the changes in the value chain. However, the changes in the second stage of the value chain could also be connected with the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU. The results show that the retailers increased their market power in the second period, i.e., after September 2004. The avian influenza could be a reason for the structural break, but other factors may work together. As a result of these changes, poultry processing companies have been losing their market position, and as a consequence, the production of poultry meat in the Czech Republic has been on the decline.

Design/methodology/approach - The literature review was based on searching in journal databases and in official web sites. To quantify value chain activities, a questionnaire was used to interview project leader. Besley's methodology was used to create the financial model and determine the net present value (NPV). Finally, the SWOT model summarized the analysis based on the results obtained. Findings - All the costs of the value chain were calculated and the results show that the greatest cost corresponds to the "internal logistical activity," with 74 percent of the total cost/liter. The NPV of the project was positive and the project was thus considered financially feasible. Practical implications - Biodiesel production plants must know the real costs of raw material (sewing and harvesting the seed) as well as extraction by farmers and regional producers in order to calculate their real profit margin and set competitive prices. Originality/value - The research responds to a specific demand by the State of Chiapas to assess the feasibility of its value chain by identifying the activities that do not create value.

This understanding has changed throughout the last few years. Today, outsourcing is seen as a method to increase performance in pharmaceutical R&D via leveraging of core competencies. Service providers are able to provide timely and efficient solutions to any given problem along the whole value chain of pharmaceutical R&D. Outsourcing enables pharmaceutical companies to gain access to new technologies such as biocatalytical reactions. Therefore, three very distinct co-operation models have been established.

LINKED DATA PARADIGM FOR ENTERPRISES: INFORMATION INTEGRATION AND VALUE CHAIN	BIZNES INFORMATIKA-BUSINESS INFORMATICS			English	Article						Linked data; tnterprise data integration; data WEB; linked open data; RDF; value chain		Data integration in enterprises is a crucial but at the same time costly and challenging problem. While business-critical information is stored in ERP, CRM, SCM and in Content Management systems the integration of such becomes even more critical when integrating with the growing information space on the Web. The IT industry has developed over the last decade integration solutions based on Master Data Management, Business Intelligence and the Service Oriented Architecture. However, we become increasingly aware that such technologies are not sufficient to ultimately solve all data integration challenges. Under the vision of context-aware services and integration we propose to apply the technology of the Linked Data paradigm. This approach seems to be promising, as scientists in the evolution of the Semantic Web have used it. We discuss Linked Data approaches in relation to the value chain and information integration of heterogeneous content and present an example of a CRM business process applying the Linked Data principles.

The agri-food retailing accounts for 18% of the organised retail today and is likely to have a lower share of 12% by 2020 (NABARD, 2011). Blocked by its major structural issues like inefficient distribution system and unscientific sourcing, there is a need to study the physical distribution model with the objectives of assessing its existing status as well the problems and prospects of the industry. The government has accorded it a soaring priority, with numeral fiscal reliefs, incentives and minimising pre/post harvest waste. Developing a revised model based on its core growth strategy of backward integration and progressing towards building an entire value chain starting from the farmers to the end consumers is the major focus area of the paper.

B	Li, GM	DePablos, PO			Li, Guangming	DePablos, PO		A Paradigm of Constructing Industrial Symbiosis and Coupling in China's County-Region Economic Sustainable Development	GREEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS PRACTICES: AN IT APPROACH			English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter introduces the sustainable development of county-region economy under the constraint of natural resources and environment in China when parts of classic industries along the south-eastern coast are shifting to the poorer mountain areas and middle-western areas. It argues that the county regional economic development at the stage should focus on the agricultural growing and breeding their processing sectors, natural resource exploitation and its processing, manufacturing, tourism, and ecological industrial (shift) park, according to the resource endowment. The local government should guide the scientific planning of county-region industries' layout, structure, symbiosis, and coupling relationships. By means of environmental cost internalization, region industries' symbiosis and coupling size, roles of social network, cultivation of innovative culture, guidance of government subsidy, pressure from public monitoring, the market mechanism, and economic incentives will play roles in resource allocation. In practice, the local government or industrial authority can design the "lack in" value chain parts and package them into some feasible and profitable projects open to the market investors, encourage firms to participate regional industrial symbiosis and coupling, and construct a complete industrial chain or network, in order to realize the integration of closed-circuit industry, higher value-added ecological agriculture, tourism and related service sectors, creative economic industrial park, urbanization, and ecological environment. This will avoid the heavy-damage from traditional industrialization and urbanization on county-regional ecological environment, and then realize the harmony development of county-regional recycle economy, society, and environment.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS CONSTRAINING PARTICIPATION OF SWAZILAND'S MUSHROOM PRODUCERS IN MAINSTREAM MARKETS: AN APPLICATION OF THE VALUE CHAIN APPROACH	AGREKON			English	Article						mushrooms; market participation; value chain; Swaziland	EDIBLE MUSHROOMS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ZAMBIA	Mushrooms have been cultivated in Swaziland since 2001 as part of a long-term programme that seeks to improve rural livelihoods through commercial production of non-conventional high-value commodities. Despite the availability of niche markets, and various forms of support received by producers, Swaziland is still a net importer of locally consumed cultivated mushrooms. This study uses a value chain approach to identify the underlying factors constraining local production and producers' participation in mainstream markets. Understanding the nature of these constraints and how they can possibly be alleviated is very important from a policy perspective as this process will inform the formulation of improved market access strategies required to achieve the programme's overall objective. The results indicate that availability of marketable surplus is affected by production constraints emanating from lack of access to key inputs and services, which are centralised and fully controlled by the government. While producers currently attain higher gross margins (in absolute value and as a proportion of consumer price) compared with other actors in alternative marketing channels, their efforts to participate more profitably in mainstream markets are hampered by poor value chain governance and lack of vertical coordination, subjecting both producers and buyers to various forms of transaction costs. In attempting to address the identified constraints, this study calls for privatisation of key services, allowing the government to assume a monitoring role. Further recommendations are also made towards institutionalising and strengthening collective marketing under different options, which reflect producers' socio-economic status and the prevailing institutional environment in Swaziland.

J	Melnyk, OV				Melnyk, O. V.			Formation of intangible assets and their impact on the market value of industrial enterprises	MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS			Russian	Article						intangible assets; valuation of intangible assets; enterprise value; market capitalization; intangible assets' strategically-oriented management		The aim of the article. The aim of the article is to generalize conceptual approaches to the peculiarities of formation of intangible assets of the company in the context of strategic management, aimed at their effective involvement into economic circulation, in turn, will promote the growth of the capitalization of the.ompany, having regard to the fundamental factors of the development of knowledge economy. The results of the analysis. In the context of deliberate influence formation (target management and strategic positioning and development) we suggest classifying IA on the basis of their structurization according to the criterion of distinguishing basic sources of their formation, namely, intellect, provisions of law, economic activity, business processes and value chain formation. Thus. we distinguish between IA of marketing type, technical and technological type and cognitive type, which, in turn, enables a systematic approach to the development of a model of strategic-oriented management of the IA company. This classification also makes it possible to focus on the role of intangible assets in the process of establishing the market value of the company. Marketing type IA for industries with a long term production cycle, characterized by the variable impact, do not create a key factor of the industry success. But, on the other side of the coin, marketing intangible assets have stable and direct effect on the food industry enterprises that show continuing update of their product portfolio and have short production cycle (product has been developed, advertised, loyalty system has been created and implemented with its supporting measures and finally the cost of the company has increased). The Mars, which was founded in 1911 can be served as an example of the IA sustainable impact. The key point here is that the main part of the firm's value consists of the range of seventeen brands. Technical and technological types of the IA require a long time period to develop, from the implementation of the idea into production model, according to the method, known as "intangible assets tangible assets". The main feature of the technical and technological intangible assets lies in the significancy of the investments needed to create or to buy those assets. Moreover, an implementation and usage of the such assets accompanied by considerable risk because of unknown efficiency. Cognitive types of the IA will serve as a function to support both other above highlighted types. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Summing up the results of the study, we need to emphasize that intangible assets will play a crucial role in ensuring long-term success of enterprises due to the current trends in the economic systems. To investigate the role of IA, which facilitate the growth of the company value, one has to take into consideration a number of factors of both external and internal environment. In order to optimize management efforts, attention should be focused on the investigation of the role of different types of IA in the transformation of products of intellectual activity into a strategic asset of high value with their further conversion into equity and financial capital.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the current situation of Internet usage and electronic commerce in agri-food cooperatives in the province of Lleida, Spain. To this end, a questionnaire has been completed by olive oil and sweet fruit cooperatives during 2010, addressing the following aspects: computer equipment, Internet connection and presence, and finally, the level of electronic commerce. The results provide information on aspects to consider for ensuring that agricultural cooperatives take full advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies, thus being a useful tool for the managers of these organisations as well as for policy makers concerned with encouraging and promoting the social economy.

J	Ojigo, DO; Daborn, CJ				Ojigo, David O.; Daborn, Chris J.			COMMUNICATIONS AND DATA COLLECTION: LESSONS FROM STUDIES IN THE EXTENSIVE LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION AREAS OF KENYA	JOURNAL OF EXOTIC PET MEDICINE			English	Article						fieldwork; information and communication technology; ICT; mobile communications; pastoralist areas		Two-way communication, a key component in the effective delivery of veterinary services to livestock keepers, has conventionally been difficult in the extensive pastoralist livestock production systems of Kenya. These difficulties lie in the challenges of the harsh terrain and poor road system, which exacerbate the problems posed by the large distances between frontline personnel and headquarters staff. Information and communication technology provides an opportunity for addressing these data communication challenges, facilitating rapid and broad-based sharing of information throughout the livestock value chain. The platform provided by the mobile technology enables early warning of impending disease events, essential for effective containment of outbreaks that result in knowledgeable interventions. The lessons learned in establishing mobile data communications for the extensive livestock production areas of Kenya are described in this article. The advantages of available technology are discussed and suggestions put forward on how the transmission of data from remote field locations to a central database can be extended for use in other related situations.

J	Park, YR; Song, S; Rhee, EK				Park, Young-Ryeol; Song, Sangcheol; Rhee, Eun-Kyoung			Do multinational corporations flexibly respond to exchange rate fluctuations? A tale of two Korean MNCs	JOURNAL OF ASIA BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						Multinational companies; Manufacturing industries; Production management; Operations management; Exchange rates; Korea; Multinational operational flexibility; Exchange rates; Production shifts		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether Korean multinational corporations (MNCs) in the electronics and steel industries do shift their production across their foreign subsidiaries, located in different countries, as exchange rates fluctuate in foreign countries. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was taken as a qualitative methodology to examine whether MNCs actually shift their production as multinational operational flexibility perspective predicts. Findings - From a case study of two Korean MNCs (LG Electronics and POSCO), it was found that even facing heightened production costs associated with host country currency appreciation, Korean MNCs do not shift their production to less costly locations due to industrial characteristics, limited capacity, and high tariff barriers. It was also found that they reduce the production costs internally and they also negotiate the costs with employees and suppliers to adjust the production costs associated with appreciated currency. Practical implications - Our findings imply that certain industrial and environmental constraints make it difficult for MNCs to take flexible actions as multinational operational flexibility perspective predicts. The findings also shed additional light on the less-explored argument over operational flexibility and vertical integration associated with cross-country shifts of value chain activities, including production or sales. Originality/value - Almost all literature taking the multinational operation flexibility view argues that MNCs are able to shift their productions for their own benefits. However, the authors of this paper find from their case studies that firms take advantage of other methods than production shifts in their responses to exchange rate fluctuations in their host countries. Thus this study gives an insight into when and how firms behave as the theory predicts.

Thereafter, this concept has changed and obtained new dimensions. The introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) brought more changes for this organisation concept, mainly after the internet advent. As these transformations took place in a short period of time, knowledge although comprehensive, remains diffuse. This theoretical study aims to consolidate virtual organisation concepts, analysing their development since the industrial model to one in which service companies predominate. Thus, it proposes a framework of how these virtual enterprises could organise themselves.

J	Sebastian, R				Sebastian, Rizal			Asset Management Business Model for Design, Realization, and Maintenance of Fibre Reinforced Polymer Bridges	ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper particularly addresses the market implementation of Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) for bridges. It presents the concept of demand and supply chain innovation as being investigated within two ongoing European collaborative research projects (FP7) titled Trans-IND and PANTURA. FRP has emerged as a real alternative structural material based on various sustainability considerations, among others the reduced life-cycle cost due to less maintenance needs, longer lifetime, and easiness to repair, replace, or recycle the components. The Trans-IND research project aims to develop and demonstrate new industrialized processes to use FRP for civil infrastructure projects at a large scale. In order to be cost effective, a new value-chain strategy for the design, realization, and maintenance of FRP bridges is required to replace the fragmented supply chain and the one-off approach to a construction project. This paper focuses on the development of new business models based on asset management strategy, which covers the entire demand and supply chains. Research on new business models is supported by the insight into the market and regulatory frameworks in different EU countries. This is based on field surveys across the EU that have been carried out as a part of the Trans-IND and PANTURA collaborative research projects.

The investigation was centered in the empowerment process of some of these women, in order to get to know the development of cognitive, procedural and attitude skills that would allow their insertion in the recycling industry's value chain. The sample included fifty young, adult and elderly women. The development of skills was carried out through personal development workshops, team work, design of business plans, and training on the organization and operation of solid waste management microenterprises. The development of procedural and cognitive skills increased the volume of collected residues, segregation and gathering of residues of better quality, thus allowing the women to become an intermediate link in the recycling industry's value chain.

The key to financial coordinated supervision is to make the information of 'business flow, governmental affairs flow, capital flow and logistics' be effectively integrated, and to make these information reliable clues to effectively identify suspicious financial transactions. Based on analysing the problems of existing payment models in China, we propose an industrial value chain model of financial coordinated supervision for online payment under paperless trade. Based on the model, we design a financial coordinated supervision platform for online payment under paperless trade. The framework design of the platform includes design objective and function module, and the detailed design of the platform consists of business process, data standardisation, and interface standardisation. We analyse the financial coordinated supervision strategy for online payment under paperless trade.

To achieve this goal, the study was divided into three steps. The development of a conceptual model that integrates the proposed CVCA + QFD tool for application in the health device development was done in the first step. The second step consisted of applying the proposed model, referring to the QFD method using 8 matrixes: quality matrix, product, characteristics of the parts, process, process parameters, human resources, infrastructure and costs matrix. The proposed conceptual model was employed fully in the third step, allowing the comparison between the methods. The results enabled to identify a discrepancy between the critical costumers in the use of mentioned methods. Customers were limited to the direct and indirect users in the QFD application: the patient, physician and physical therapist. This list got a considerable increase when CVCA was applied: the clinical engineering, product engineering, process and reliability engineering, project and product managers, financial sector, quality system and regulatory issues. These results show the importance of analyzing the supply chain systemically in order to consider all stakeholders to the CPM device development. Thus, needs and relationships delineation of all process customers can be done.

The proposed model is adapted for the Brazilian reality and has the scope and flexibility for use in academic activities and analysis of the healthcare sector in Brazil. It places emphasis on three components: the main activities of the value chain, grouped in vertical and horizontal links; the mission of each link and the main value chain flows. The proposed model consists of six vertical and three horizontal links, amounting to nine. These are: knowledge development; supply of products and technologies; healthcare services; financial intermediation; healthcare financing; healthcare consumption; regulation; distribution of healthcare products; and complementary and support services. Four flows can be used to analyze the value chain: knowledge and innovation; products and services; financial; and information.

The quantification and management of these costs can help industries to become more competitive in the market. In this context, the objective of this study is to estimate the cost of the raw milk supply by studying the situation in seven dairies located in the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais, Brazil. These costs were calculated from information provided by the industries related to fuel consumption, maintenance, manpower, depreciation, cleaning, insurance among others, distributed between fixed and variable costs of companies. The cost of milk supply in the seven companies varied in the range of R$ 0.023 to R$ 0.138 per liter of collected raw milk. These costs can be reduced by increasing the transport capacity and storage tanks within the properties, and by optimizing the collection.

J	Arens, L; Thulke, HH; Eisinger, D; Theuvsen, L				Arens, Ludwig; Thulke, Hans-Hermann; Eisinger, Dirk; Theuvsen, Ludwig			Administrative cooperation and disease control in cross-border pork production	FOOD POLICY			English	Article						Pork production; Commodity flow; Animal disease; Cross border cooperation; Disease spread analysis; Mechanistic model	CLASSICAL SWINE-FEVER; FOOD SAFETY; SIMULATION-MODEL; MOUTH-DISEASE; EPIDEMICS; CONSEQUENCES; NETHERLANDS; STRATEGIES; GERMANY; SYSTEMS	In recent years, the continuous structural change in the value chain of modern food production has been characterised by an increasing international division of labour among manufacturing companies. A regional specialisation of primary agricultural production is especially apparent in meat production. Thus, the German-Dutch border area has developed into a region of unprecedented intensive pork production. While The Netherlands specialises in piglet production, the production of fattened pigs continues to grow in northwest Germany. As a result of this increasing transnational value chain development, German imports of Dutch piglets have risen continuously since 2000. However, this structural interweaving of pork production between The Netherlands and Germany has resulted in many new challenges for the cooperation between the various participants and in particular for the administrative authorities in the field of food and feed safety as well as efficient animal disease control. The motivation for this exploratory study stems from the lack of scientific work on this topic to date. The aim of this research is to illustrate the relevance of functioning cross-border cooperation in the food sector, using commodity flow structures and disease spread analysis. Results indicate that cross-border cooperation between authorities during a CSF epidemic can reduce the risk of recurrence and the duration by 50%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding Consumer's Preference For Fresh Table-Ripe Papaya	PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						consumer preference; quality attributes; papaya		Papaya is one of the major fruits produced and consumed in the Philippines. The economic and market prospects for the fruit look bright with growing demand in domestic and international markets because of its health benefits. However, to capture bigger share and remain viable in today's competitive market, firms in the papaya value chain need to continuously innovate and understand consumers' demand and preferences. To prepare an action plan for improvement of the country's papaya value chain, a consumer survey was conducted to determine papaya consumers' purchasing pattern, their desired papaya quality attributes, and factors affecting purchase decision. A total of 232 papaya consumers participated in the study, mostly women and within the age range of 40-59 years. Respondents were residents and employees in Metro Manila and Laguna. Majority buy papaya for health and nutrition reasons. The external attributes consumers looked for in papaya are: medium sized-fruits, full yellow peel color, and blemish- and disease-free. For internal attributes, most prefer papaya with yellow orange pulp color and average sweetness and texture. Overall, respondents indicated that absence of decay and damage, sweetness, maturity, texture and price are the topmost considerations in purchasing. Majority (61.7%) of respondents are satisfied with the quality of purchased papaya. With the presence of other fruits, 91.7% of respondents are still willing to buy papaya mainly for its health benefits, and 87.3% will pay more for good tasting papaya. In their future purchase, consumers wanted papaya with guaranteed sweetness, not artificially ripened, with desirable texture even after refrigerated storage, with no bitter taste and more mature fruits. The survey had shown that a market exist for high quality, locally grown, blemish-free papaya even at a higher price. Thus, the future activities of the stakeholders along the chain should be towards the attainment of these qualities.

The Key Success Factors for Taiwan Semiconductor Enterprises Investing in China	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP			English	Article						semiconductor industry; domestic market; key success factors		The economy was towards recession under the invasion of financial crisis. Face of the global recession, Taiwan's semiconductor industry also suffered from the impact. The enterprises need to find the suitable strategies to overcome the problem of capacity utilization fell in the future. It is risky for the successful enterprises that invest only rely on the report. The enterprises must appraise the industry investment environment carefully by themselves. The loss of investment would be inestimable if they make any mistakes. This study attempts to find the important dimensions and factors, and induce critical factors when Taiwanese semiconductor enterprises invest in China by interviews and value chain analysis. In this study, we induce the key success factors of Taiwan semiconductor enterprises investing in China into nine key success factors. They are ability to control the product yield, ability of integration the cooperation between manufacturers, advantage of economies of scale, advantage of economies of scope, ability to integrate division of labor in Taiwan and China, financing capacity, high-quality R&D personnel recruitment and training, the ability to design components, and the ability to process development. The results could enhance the accuracy, reduced the risk and provide some references for the government, organizations and enterprises.	[Yuan, Benjamin J. C.; Kao, Hector K. M.; Hung, C.

J	Ivanenko, V				Ivanenko, Vlad			Modularity analysis of the Canadian natural gas sector	ENERGY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Natural gas; Canada; Commodity chain; Modularity; Risk	ORGANIZATION; MANAGEMENT	The paper describes the technological process presented as a chain of tasks that natural gas companies in Canada perform to move natural gas products from the geological formation to the final consumer. Investigating the norms the firms use to establish cooperation with clients and suppliers, it shows that the standardization of tasks facilitate arm's length interactions within the chain. The paper studies the distribution of risks in client-supplier pairs and concludes that their asymmetry in risk-taking may be indicative of relative importance that the risk takers assume within the pairs. Finally, the paper touches on the role that federal and provincial governments play in regulated segments of the chain and suggests that government-sponsored standardization may need to get reconciled with market practices.

J	Robins, JE				Robins, Jonathan E.			Slave Cocoa and Red Rubber: E. D. Morel and the Problem of Ethical Consumption	COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY			English	Article								Over the last two decades, consumption, consumerism, and the idea of consumer agency have attracted a great deal attention from scholars across a number of disciplines. Among historians, the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have been identified as a crucial period for consumption, one in which consumers emerged as an influential group of political, economic, and social agents. Historians of the English-speaking world have advanced bold claims about the prominence and impact of consumers during this period. Consumer movements were conspicuously absent in two major scandals of the early twentieth century, however. This article uses these commodity-centered cases of rubber in the Congo Free State, and cocoa in the Portuguese colonies of Sao Tome and Principe to question the salience of "consumerism" in turn-of-the-century political thought. By tracing the career of British journalist and humanitarian activist E. D. Morel through the "red rubber" and "slave cocoa" scandals, the article demonstrates that consumers were only one of many influences along the commodity chain of production and consumption.

Catalytic mechanisms for promoting ICT investment and use in cassava value chains in south-western Nigeria	INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						agricultural value chains; cassava; small and medium enterprises; transmission mechanisms; information and communication technology; south-western Nigeria	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; BUSINESS VALUE; PERFORMANCE	The transformation of African agriculture with modern technologies, including information and communication technology (ICT) has been proposed as the required strategy for improving agricultural and rural economies of African countries. In this direction, this study investigated the catalysts and impact of ICT investment, ownership and use in the cassava value chain in south-western Nigeria. The study used in-depth structured interviews to collect data from 139 cassava growers, processors and marketers. Snowball and random sampling were used to select the respondents. A model was articulated to capture the catalytic and transmission processes in ICT investment and use in the cassava value chain. It predicts that in value chains dominated by small and medium enterprises (SME), ICT investments are unlikely to progress beyond basic low-end ICT unless there is expanded market demand for output of the SME. The model highlights key process points that policy may target in order to improve the use of ICT by SME to leverage their value chain activities.

J	Gulati, A; Brouwer, F; Ganguly, K				Gulati, Ashok; Brouwer, Floor; Ganguly, Kavery			Indian Agriculture: Unfolding Structural Changes and their Relevance to the EU	EUROCHOICES			English	Article								India has emerged from the global financial crisis registering an estimated GDP growth of 8.6 per cent in 2010-11. Following a severe drought in 2009 agricultural growth bounced back to 5.4 per cent in 2010-11. Inter-state variations in agricultural performance Gujarat is a front runner - can be explained by differences in investments in infrastructure, irrigation, R&D etc. There is potential to improve performance sustainably, keeping in view increasing stress on water resources and other environmental issues. More than 52 per cent of the workforce depends on agriculture, which accounts for 17 per cent of GDP. Per capita food expenditure averages more than 50 per cent of total expenditure. Overall income growth is triggering a shift in consumption from cereals to high-value commodities. To meet demand shifts, India can either increase domestic production and/or participate more in world markets. The Indian agrifood system is being transformed: farming is becoming integrated with input supplies, warehouse/logistics, processing and retailing, and the entire value chain is being streamlined. This is stimulating increased trade and investment opportunities in India. EU Member States may find opportunities in niche markets e.g. cheese, wine, olive oil, which are still in their infancy, or to invest in food technology, irrigation, farm management practices (especially dairy) or the development of sustainable value chains.

However; marry SMEs have been slow in adopting the Internet and even those SMEs that have adopted the technology have not fully utilized it to support their business applications. The reason behind this scenario could be the lack of awareness concerning the necessity and possibility of adopting e-business for specific functions along the value chain. Thus, the aims of this study are to investigate the extent of Internet marketing practices to support business applications among SMEs in Malaysia as well as the outcome of Internet marketing implementations on the business performance of SMEs. The results indicate that the usage of Internet varies across the marketing practices and is likely to influence business performance.

J	Martin, SJ; Andee, P				Martin, Sarah J.; Andree, Peter			The "buy local" challenge to institutional foodservice corporations in historical context	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						ARAMARK; Compass Group; food value chain; industry opportunity structure; institutional foodservice; local food; political economy; social movements; Sodexo	FOOD NETWORKS; EFFICACY; ECONOMY; WORKERS; CANADA; SYSTEM; TIME	Public institutions such as universities and hospitals are being increasingly encouraged by social movements to direct their substantial foodservice budgets toward supporting local farmers and producers. This paper examines a key obstacle to the buy local challenge: the transnational corporations who are contracted by many public institutions in North America to provide foodservices. The institutional food sector is dominated by three large transnational foodservice corporations: Compass Group, ARAMARK, and Sodexo. It is their centralized supply chains and management structures, along with a dependence on prepared and "ready to eat" food, that are barriers to local food procurement. Up to this point, there has been little scholarly attention to the origin and organization of these corporations. This paper's examination of the history and political economy of the institutional foodservice industry illustrates a long association between these companies and public-sector goals over the last 70 years. Comparing past public-sector goals to contemporary campaigns directed at institutional foodservice is therefore instructive. We examine three different political economies that have fostered the development of these corporations: the Second World War, the post-war era from 1945 to the 1970s, and the neoliberal era beginning in the 1970s through today. While recognizing that the barriers to local procurement are real, we also argue that the structure and competitive dynamics of these corporations offer opportunities to make positive changes.

J	Hotaran, I				Hotaran, Ilinca			Possibilities to achieve Competitive Advantage through Quality Management	QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS			English	Article						continuous improvement; competitive advantage; total quality management; information; knowledge		The research is based on organizational necessity to obtain competitive advantage on the market and on the key factors necessary to reach this target. Methodologies and continuous improvement techniques of quality management are a starting point in this process. These are viewed from a dual perspective, both as classical methodologies with central elements known at organizational level as well as an innovative perspective that considers news in the field and methods proposed for increasing the competitive market position. Elements analyzed in this paper, the flow of information, methods of quality management implementation and new organizational learning skills consider the ultimate goal of any activity: the client. Customer's satisfaction levels the income, being as well the primary and the final element of extended value chain, as is discussed in the article.

J	Anderson, AR; El Harbi, S; Brahem, M				Anderson, Alistair R.; El Harbi, Sana; Brahem, Meriam			The Tunisian textile industry: local responses to internationalisation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						internationalisation; textiles; entrepreneurial orientation; innovation; cluster analysis; typology; multiple component analysis; Tunisia; international value chain; SME	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; INNOVATION; TRADE; COMPETITIVENESS; FIRMS	The continuing internationalisation of the textile industry has reduced the labour cost advantages of Tunisian clothing firms. These firms have a precarious position in the international value chain, often as subcontractors and only rarely contributing high value inputs. To remain viable in the hyper competition wrought by internationalisation, firms must cut costs further or adopt an entrepreneurial approach. We examined 103 small Tunisian textile firms to find how they have responded to international competitive pressures. Our conceptual framework is entrepreneurial orientation. Employing multiple correspondence analysis and typological analysis, we identify clusters of approaches. Our typology shows three distinctive types: innovators, potentially innovative, passive imitators and a further ambiguous group. Our results show that different small firms have responded in different ways to the threats and opportunities of globalisation. However, many Tunisian firms have improved their position in the international supply chain by innovation strategies, rather than simply focusing on cost reduction.

J	Chang, YS				Chang, Yu Sang			Strategy, structure, and channel for global leaders of industrial service: a flow chart analysis of the expanded value network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						industrial service; service leaders; expanded value chain; service portfolio; front-line service; back-up service; service strategy; service organisations		Services are gaining ever more importance in every economy in the world. In reflection of the overall trends, manufacturers are being advised to expand and integrate their service offerings to the core product offerings. However, the number of empirical academic studies on the topic is still limited in both number and scope. The objective of this paper is to answer the question, "What does it take to become a global industrial service leader?" Thus, case studies are undertaken on four global service leaders - Caterpillar, Johnson Controls, Pitney Bowes, and SKF. Findings in order of importance include the need to view one global service market, the completeness of the service leader's service portfolio, multiple independent service organisations in operation, modular organisational structure of service units, and the use by a service leader of its own combined sales and service channels. This report highlights several limitations of its research findings and concludes with some specific suggestions for future research.

J	Erickson, S; Rothberg, H				Erickson, Scott; Rothberg, Helen			Balancing Knowledge Management and Competitive Intelligence, Initial Insights	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE STUDIES IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Competitive intelligence; intellectual capital; knowledge management; strategy; SPF framework		This paper reports on a large-scale study of how industries balance knowledge development with knowledge protection. In particular, we look at specific industries and the competitive imperatives to increase knowledge assets (or not) and to conduct competitive intelligence activities (or not). This analysis is based on our previously established SPF framework, though we have developed new measures and a new database that more reliably establish industry conditions. The paper explains the different results seen in different industries by examining four markedly different SPF environments. Based on these different environments, we can begin to explore some of the possible explanations for the differences (characteristics of relevant knowledge, Value Chain insights, life cycle stage, etc.).

ANALYZING THE B2B BRAND VALUE CHAIN	BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING MANAGEMENT: STRATEGIES, CASES, AND SOLUTIONS	Advances in Business Marketing and Purchasing		English	Article; Book Chapter							TO-BUSINESS SERVICES; INDUSTRIAL-PRODUCTS; COMMODITY PRODUCT; MARKETS; EQUITY; IMAGE; MANUFACTURERS; DIFFERENTIATE; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS	This chapter examines the empirical evidence about business-to-business (B2B) brands and offers implications for value creation. Brand marketing texts typically emphasize the competitive advantage of strong brands but often assume a consumer branding (B2C) perspective. However some of the world's most valuable brands are predominantly B2B in nature, and the question arises regarding the importance of branding in B2B marketing. This chapter examines the following question. How do B2B brands create and deliver value for firms in interorganizational transactions? The chapter begins by examining the relevance of current theoretical frameworks of branding in the B2B context and the stages of the brand value chain. Next, the chapter considers extant research showing the impact of B2B branding at the various stages of the brand value chain. The chapter also suggests areas for future research in B2B branding and concludes with a reader case study.

Mobile economics and pricing of health care services	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Cost analysis; health economics; medical technologies; e-health		This paper presents tools and concepts to analyze the business environment of the biopharmaceutical industry. It was presented at MEDETEL 2010. Emerging paradigms appear in that industry and new ways to value life science technologies are developed especially using mobile economics analysis. At a time, mobile computing technologies revolutionize the field of health care, this paper contributes to show how the value chain concept can be useful to analyze the value system in a mobile computing environment. It is also a milestone for the designs of future technology platforms and of health care infrastructures in order to retain enough value between innovators, new and traditionnal players from life science, IT and other new comers, in a fragmented global competitive environment.

J	Mu, LJ; Cui, XG				Mu, Linjuan; Cui, Xuegang			An experimental research on governance mechanisms for cost of value chain	NANKAI BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Governance; Trust; Value chain; Incentive; Governance on cost of value chain; Experimental study		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the governance mechanism of overcoming or solving three problems: cooperation problem, coordination problem and appropriation problem. Also to raise the value chain cost efficiency and to elevate the value chain competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is the experimental study. The authors design an experience simulating the transaction process across firms to explore the separate and joint governance effects of trust and incentive on the cost of value chain. Findings - According to the experimental results it is found that the high level of trust between firms and the incentive based on the joint interests of value chain can effectively mitigate or avoid the cooperation, coordination and appropriation problems, and thus have significant governance effects on the cost of value chain. Incentive is out of effect when a much lower level of trust across firms exists, which reflects that there is a significant complementary relationship between trust and incentive mechanisms. Research limitations/implications - The research limitation is that the practical experience and the cognition of experimenters of the researchers will influence the conclusion of the experiment, so the research on the influences of other factors must be deepened. Originality/value - The paper's value is in setting out a value chain cost management theory frame, demonstrating trust and incentive as two kinds of governance mechanism in the value chain cost management mechanism, adopting experiment method to verify the above theory, and providing the relevant behavior evidence for future research.

Ten factors were considered, internal and external to the organization, composed by the combination of three subjects: value chain analysis, strategic positioning analysis and costs drivers analysis. The study has descriptive characteristics and a qualitative nature, carried out through a case study in which data collection relies on the use of semistructured interviews, survey and participant observation. The study was conducted in Eletrosul Centrais Eletricas S.A, in the "management of the GEC process" area. For this, it was performed a comparation between the content of the information gathered in formal documents and the practical process ( identified through the interviews). It was concluded that the GEC model has already been partially implemented in the company and there is some consensus among the respondents of the three hierarchical levels: i) the analysis of value chain focuses factors that facilitate and also hinder the implementation of the model; ii) analysis of strategic positioning focuses factors that are more structured; and iii) analysis of costs drivers focuses factors that hinder the full implementation of GEC.

J	Reys, A				Reys, Aurelien			The Brazilian commodity chain difficulties facing the new world trade organization of colored gemstones	CONFINS-REVUE FRANCO-BRESILIENNE DE GEOGRAPHIE-REVISTA FRANCO-BRASILEIRA DE GEOGRAFIA			French	Article						Brasil; Brazil; cadeia produtiva; colored gemstones; commodity chain; divisao internacional do trabalho (DIT); gemas de cor; International Division of Labour (IDL); pedras preciosas; precious stones		The colored gemstones commoditychains, as most of natural resources exploited, have long consisted as hierarchical trades dominated by the main Western powers. Along with the growing influence of Asian countries, they are now undergoing in a major restructuring and seem to operate more like multi-polarized markets. However, countries in charge of extractive operations aren't still realizing greatest benefits andappear to have significant troubles to participate in others processes than the ones strictly related to extracting activities. Brazil, considered as one of the world largest reserves of colored gemstones, displays an intermediate profile: it partially gets involved in the cutting stone processes but without increasing its influence or expanding its colored gemstones export revenue as it should do. In fact, local activities have now to face new competition coming from east Africa for extracting activities and Chine for cutting and trading activities. Nevertheless, with an increasing number of people reaching good standards of living through the world, the gemstones trade will probably continue to grow in the near future, keeping the door open to new opportunities for countries like Brazil, which one can count on a growing middle class that may represent soon a new chance for its gem industry.

S degree and upper took part in the statistical universe of this survey. 232 people were chosen by using systematic sampling method and the sample size formula. To collect data, two researcher-made questionnaires of KM and HRD have been used. Also content validity and face validity of questionnaires in this research were confirmed by experts. The validity of both questionnaires was estimated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient (alpha) which equals to 0.87 in KM and 0.83 in HRD. The result has shown that there is a relationship between KM and employee participation (r = 82%, alpha= 0.001), a relationship between KM and employee empowerment (r = 76%, alpha = 0.001) and a relationship between KM and employee training (r = 63%, alpha = 0.001).

The recession and the related financial sector crisis require a deep re-consideration of the business models and managerial approaches adopted to increase the organization's growth and value-creation. The effort of the modern management, along the twentieth century, had been aimed to develop a wide range of models to allow managers to control, understand and coordinate the functions of organization's value chain as well as their integration in accordance to a strategic perspective like the Balanced Scorecard model is. The paper is going to consider whether Balanced Scorecard is the appropriate model for banks performance measurement and what its advantages are in relation to the CAMELS model.

Digital technologies and the Internet have deeply changed the way researchers and scholars access and share information. Moreover new technologies challenge professionals involved in the publishing value chain and publication life cycle at various levels. The traditional scholarly communication model fails to meet researchers' needs and expectations. Initiatives such as the AlmaDL Journals seeks to provide alternative models that take full advantage of the digital environment and new media while ensuring quality requirements and the traditional functions of scientific serial publications.

Have the experts reached consensus?	NEW MEDIT			French	Article						agricultural policy; producer organizations; Common Market Organization; operational program; fruit and vegetables; Delphi; European Union	SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE	The aim of this article was to identify the main factors that favour and limit the strengthening of producer organizations (POs) in the fruit and vegetables sector, as well as farmers' adherence to these organizations and the future prospects with a view to the objectives set by the Common Market Organization (CMO) for 2013. The study was based on a Delphi-type questionnaire, applied in two rounds between April and July 2009. The most important results indicated the limited scope of the policies adopted under the CMO in fruit and vegetables and the weakness of the Fruit and Vegetables POs as regards the supply concentration (i.e. the volume traded through these organizations), a prerequisite to increase their bargaining power within the value chain, the single payment scheme, the operational funds and the crisis management funds will still be implemented beyond 2013 as a tool to support this sector.

JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Brazil; farming systems; food value chain; geographical indication (GI); sheep	CHEESE; SYSTEM; GOAT	Producing a local sheep meat product under a geographical certification label may enhance market competitiveness of smallholder farmers. This study focused on sheep farms in Ceara (Northeast Brazil); we explored their potential for adopting such a strategy, described the production chain of the salted, dried sheep meat product, and evaluated its potential certification. The study built on an existing unpublished dataset about the socio-economic conditions, production techniques, and commercialization characteristics of 129 sheep producers in the Taud municipality. Multiple correspondence analysis followed by a nonhierarchical cluster analysis resulted in five farm clusters. In-depth interviews about socio-economic and production characteristics were conducted with a subsample of 23 farmers. The production chain was evaluated by applying methodological and data triangulation. The dried mutton product showed potential for geographical certification. However, essential preconditions for establishing a successful and sustainable geographic certification system were currently lacking.

For profit continuity and creation of new wealth, all economic agencies may pay special attention to this phenomenon and enter into operational value chain. In this article, we tested the relation between intellectual capital and economic value added as the modern index for measuring the function in the framework of value creation thought. It was based upon management by Ethiner and Larker (2003) for all accepted companies in stock exchange companies for a 5-year period (2004 to 2008). From applicable goal and manner of performance, the research method of this study is explanatory - measuring based upon combination. In order to test any theories, we used T test and to estimate any regression model parameters we used minimum squares. We extracted all research data from financial statements and financial reports available in the archive of Tehran Stock Exchange Organization. The intellectual capital was measured according to four-fold financial patterns. According to the results, it was revealed that there is no meaningful relation between intellectual capital and economic value added. This relation is negative from validity point of view of regression model. Also, the results may reveal that there is no equal severity that means changes of economic value added out of intellectual capital on four-folded patterns.

As a result, an electronic market emerged and the majority of tourism suppliers developed interfaces to communicate directly and efficiently with their partners and customers. A new type of traveler emerged, more knowledgeable, experienced and looking for exceptional value for his/her trips. The interactivity developed between consumers, products and industry has encouraged changes in the tourism value chain, in the distribution channels and has motivated the emergence of new trends associated with this interactive medium.

This article covers concepts defining entrepreneurship, where personal and institutional elements converge, which, with laws, policies and programs, can build an ecosystem being favorable to the creation of newer and better companies. This research is performed by using secondary sources and applying surveys on different members of the ecosystem. As a result, different programs and actions become evident in Medellin and the Metropolitan Area, that have contributed to the improvement of the current entrepreneur ecosystem and of the entrepreneurs themselves, where today opportunities are created derived from different aspects of the value chain, which must be turn into articulated ones.

PRICE TRANSMISSION AND ADJUSTMENT IN THE ETHIOPIAN COFFEE MARKET	AGREKON			English	Article						coffee; Ethiopia; threshold vector error correction models; nonlinearity	COINTEGRATION	This study analysed the interrelationships among producer, auction and world prices. In so doing, it criticised previous studies and extended a technique developed by Hansen (1999) to handle inferential biases due to some specification errors. The results indicated that coffee growers benefit little from positive changes in the world price compared with participants in the auction markets. This is attributed to the presence of information asymmetry in the coffee value chain, created by an increased concentration of markets. In addition, domestic markets could play a role in this, as they are major outlets for the majority of the coffee produced.	[Alemu, Z. G.] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Worako, T.

EFFECTS ON BUSINESS DECISIONS MANAGEMENT IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY	ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA			English	Article						cost accounting; activity-based costing; automotive industry; supply chain network		This paper seeks to describe the role that activity-oriented cost accounting systems, i.e. US American and German activity-based costing, play in the establishment of supply-chain-networks in the modern automotive industry. These cost accounting systems are the subject of analysis for two reasons: they relatively successfully describe the causality principle between cost drivers and cost objects and represent two different approaches of cost calculation within the activity-oriented concept. Also, the paper attempts to show that the efficiency of these systems is contingent on the value chain activity to which the systems were applied. Although based on identical conceptual frameworks, these systems do not have the same cost allocation purposes in automotive industry.

J	Chollett, DL				Chollett, Donna			Renegotiating gender and class in the berry fields of Michoacan, Mexico	DIALECTICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						Gender; Class; Globalization; Transnational agribusiness; Non-traditional agricultural production		This article examines the renegotiation of gender and class in a rural Mexican community where economic crisis in the sugar industry led foreign agribusinesses to promote blackberry and raspberry production for export and hire primarily women as berry pickers. Analysis focuses on the transition from a sugar economy where mostly men worked in the cane fields to non-traditional agricultural exports when women entered agricultural waged labor in unprecedented numbers. This restructuring of the regional economy raises important questions regarding the marginalization of differentiated subaltern groups and the nature of new sets of power relations between transnational agribusinesses, berry growers, and waged workers. I analyze the contradictions of this changing social field that connects Northern consumers, transnational company executives, berry growers, and waged laborers in a web of differential power relations as they reverberate along the commodity chain from campesino households to the global market.

The traditional reporting system does not capture a valid measure of customer profitability. The reporting structure no longer captures how customers consume resources differently throughout the value chain. Their value chain begins in Asia and ends at the United States (U.S.) retail storefront. Management is searching for a better reporting solution in their efforts to increase shareholders' value. In this case, you make an important recommendation to Durable Glove's management. Should management decide to keep or to fire the Big Box retailer? You base the recommendation upon allocations and customer profitability reports that show how customers consume resources differently. The spreadsheet template 1 that complements this case provides a structure for the allocations and reports. The completed reports capture an approximation of Durable Glove's customer profitability. You evaluate the reports and make a recommendation to improve Durable Glove's customer profitability, which focuses on keeping or firing the Big Box customer.

Based on analysis and evaluation of project reports, the paper identifies key factors and checklists which need to be evaluated in embarking on projects which affect the development of HVAPs related projects. The main elements of the proposed framework include external factors, level of integration of the value chain project to traditional agricultural system of the beneficiary country, market analysis, how holistic is the approach and linkages of the projects to other projects. The paper provokes thoughts for the development of a holistic framework to analyse HVAPs projects in the PIDC in particular and developing countries in general.

Moreover, the groups of information, which - in authors' opinion should be given to each institution on energy market in communication process were characterized in the paper. In authors opinion, the problem of coordination is crucial on the regional and local level. Uncoordinated actions are the main reasons of lack of cooperation and ineffective and inefficient actions of different partners on energy market.

J	Rabayah, KS; Qalalwi, K				Rabayah, Khalid S.; Qalalwi, Khalid			THE IMPACT OF MOBILE TELEPHONY ON DEVELOPING COUNTRY ENTERPRISES: A PALESTINIAN CASE STUDY	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						mobile telephony; development; enterprises; developing countries; m-commerce; SMEs		This paper aims to explore the use and impact of mobile telephony on the performance of companies in developing countries, through a nationwide survey comprised of thousands of enterprises representing a true sample of the business sector in Palestine. This paper complements studies that make the linkage between mobile communications and economic activities at micro or enterprise level. It analyses the adoption patterns and rational behind these patterns as revealed by the business owners and managers of Palestinian enterprises. Porter's value chain is used as a framework to assess the impact of mobile telephony in work processes. The survey covered thousands of enterprises of all sizes and economic activities, selected to embody a representative sample of the Palestinian business sector. It further explores the views of the owners and managers of these enterprises regarding the use of ICTs. The study reveals that mobile phones have meaningfully enhanced internal processes and the overall value chain. Most notably, mobile phones were effective in bridging the information and connectivity gap businesses in developing countries ordinarily suffer. The study has also found that small and micro enterprises gain from the use of mobiles the same as what large enterprises do, especially in mainstream operations like marketing and sales, information flow, and provision of customer services. This is happening at the time when there is a huge difference in resources between the two categories of enterprises. The study came to conclude that mobile benefits are not favoring one business sector from the other, in the sense that all business sectors are capable of tailoring mobile phone services to suit their needs.

J	Lin, YC; Yeh, KS; Li, SM				Lin, Yu-Chuan; Yeh, Kuang S.; Li, Shaomin			Change of Governance in the Organization Value Chain: The Case of the High-tech Industries in Taiwan	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW			English	Article						Corporate Governance; Governance Environment; Organization Value Chain; High-tech Industries; Taiwan	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; HIERARCHY; NETWORK; MARKET	Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We study the evolution of the governance of the organization value chain in Taiwan's high-tech industry, whose pattern seems to defy the prediction of the well-established theories such as transaction cost, resource dependence, or network perspectives. Research Findings/Insights: Using the three most important sectors in Taiwan's high-tech industry as cases, we map out the evolutionary path each sector took, and demonstrate that the change of governance mode between upstream and downstream firms is shaped by the interaction of technology, capital munificence, and relative profitability throughout the lifecycle of these industries. Specifically, we find that at the beginning stage with high technology uncertainty and relatively high profitability, the governance mode in Taiwan's high-tech industries moves toward a network model. At the mature stage when technology is certain and capital is abundant, the governance mode moves toward the market model for technology complexity and high profitability or toward the hierarchy model if the complexity and profitability are low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our analyses suggest that the contingent approach based on the three key factors (technology, capital munificence, and relative profitability) is more suitable in explaining the change of governance mode in the value creation chain in a rapidly changing environment, and thus provides a better prediction on the changes of governance mode than the previously used theories. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study has managerial implications for firms that have evolved from small and medium-sized enterprises into large, integrated business groups. The latter cannot rely on traditional network relations for business management and have to move toward the market model or the hierarchy model.

J	Tous, R; Guerrero, M; Delgado, J				Tous, Ruben; Guerrero, Manel; Delgado, Jaime			Semantic Web for Reliable Citation Analysis in Scholarly Publishing	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES			English	Article								Analysis of the impact of scholarly artifacts is constrained by current unreliable practices in cross-referencing, citation discovering, and citation indexing and analysis, which have not kept pace with the technological advances that are occurring in several areas like knowledge management and security. Because citation analysis has become the primary component in scholarly impact factor calculation, and considering the relevance of this metric within both the scholarly publishing value chain and (especially important) the professional curriculum evaluation of scholarly professionals, we defend that current practices need to be revised. This paper describes a reference architecture that aims to provide openness and reliability to the citation-tracking lifecycle. The solution relies on the use of digitally signed semantic metadata in the different stages of the scholarly publishing workflow in such a manner that authors, publishers, repositories, and citation-analysis systems will have access to independent reliable evidences that are resistant to forgery, impersonation, and repudiation. As far as we know, this is the first paper to combine Semantic Web technologies and public-key cryptography to achieve reliable citation analysis in scholarly publishing.

J	Jackson, C				Jackson, Carol			TURNING DATA INTO ACTION	J-FOR-JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY FOR FOREST PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES			English	Article								Today's paper industry depends on a long integrated supply chain, starting in the forest and ending as products consumers use every day. The lead time across this supply chain is typically long and involves many steps performed by several companies. Knitting together manufacturing information that tells the true picture of product cost is complex and many gaps remain. This article will help the reader understand how the large amount of unutilized data can be used to make timely decisions and reduce overall variable costs across his value chain. Three case studies are included to illustrate different operational tactics to increase profitability.

J	Kinuthia, BK				Kinuthia, Bethuel Kinyanjui			Markets vs. Government Foreign Direct Investment and Industrialization in Malaysia	ECONOMIA MEXICANA-NUEVA EPOCA			English	Article						industrialization; import substitution; export orientation; foreign direct investment; government		This paper examines the changing role of government and foreign firms in Malaysia's industrialization process. Economists have held different views on the role of government in industrialization. Some believed that the developing world was full of market failures and the only way in which poor countries could escape from their poverty traps was through the forceful government intervention. Others opposed to this view argued that government failure was by far the bigger evil and that it should allow the market to steer the economy. Reality has been different from expectation for either side. From a country dependent on agriculture and primary commodities in the sixties, Malaysia has today become an export-driven economy spurred by high technology, knowledge based and capital intensive industries. The market oriented economy and the government's strategic industrial policy that maintain a business environment with opportunities for growth and profits have made the country a highly competitive manufacturing and export base. Multinationals have been at the forefront in this process and working hand in hand with the government through a process known as "hand holding". As firms move up the value chain their requirements change, and, to remain competitive in a global environment, the government has had to change its policies and approach to ensure that this objective is not compromised. In 2006 the government identified the service sector as the new driver for growth, which suggests a new era in industrialization. Based on this evidence we conclude that, for successful industrialization, developing countries will require flexible governments that facilitate the development of the private sector. This approach will generate greater benefits than would otherwise occur if developing countries were to adopt either government or market based development trajectories.

Accordingly, this study focuses specifically on shipment sizes, and the number of shipments made under a three-echelon model composed of a manufacturer, a distribution center, and a retailer. A joint model is proposed, in which the system relevant cost is significantly reduced. Each party's total relevant cost loss was calculated and compared with its optimal strategy. While the retailer was the focal company, the other parties' loss tended to be the largest. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kumar, CN				Kumar, C. Nalin			Agricultural Trade Facilitation in Asia: Prioritising the Invisible Infrastructure	MILLENNIAL ASIA			English	Article						Agricultural trade facilitation; SPS; capacity constraints; Asian agricultural trade		In the backdrop of the growing agricultural and food trade across Asia, this paper argues that the installed food safety and associated infrastructure could be seen as only necessary conditions whereas the sufficient conditions would be to make an enabling policy environment which would reduce the overall transaction costs of trade. Imports also assume equal importance and the arrival of duty-free raw materials for further processing and value addition enables more employment generation, higher income for stakeholders, and forward movement in the value chain. As tariffs do not account for a substantial influence on the course of trade and prices of many farm commodities, the attention has to turn towards the enabling policy regime specific to commodities and thereby the development of infrastructure which would encourage value addition and re-exports. Trade facilitation and infrastructure are often taken in the general sense at the policy level and only partly address the specific issues related to the reduction of risks and transaction costs in the context of agricultural trade, i.e. the invisible infrastructure such as easy documentation, customs procedures, regulatory regimes and mutual recognition. Different commodities have different requirements in terms of costs, time and reliability of logistics and trade facilitating policies are to be formulated taking into consideration a wider set of factors and indicators in the context of agricultural trade.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a new conceptual framework to analyze the role of states and enterprises in enhancing the industrial international competitiveness (IIC). Design/methodology/approach - Being a research-based paper, the topic is approached by theoretical analysis and conceptual development. The paper reviews IIC literature and argues for a rational study ICC in the context of global value chain. Next, the paper puts forward a two-dimensional governance model and five typical governance systems of the industries of developing countries. Examples of typical governance system are given based the practice of Chinese industries, such as appeal, rare earths, automotive, etc. Findings - This paper constructs an industrial two-dimensional governance model of the developing countries in the context of global value chain based on the interaction between industry governance and market governance, and also presents five typical governance systems - free to market, public governance, industrial governance, joint governance and network governance. Different governance system reflects different roles of states and enterprises played in the global value chains and result in different IIC in the end. Research limitations/implications - The limitation is based primarily on methodology. The two-dimensional governance model provides target-oriented guidance for foresting international competitiveness of different types of industries. Future studies should include more in-depth case studies on different governance system. Originality/value - The paper presents a framework of the industrial two-dimensional governance model, which emphasizes the important role of both states and enterprise in the IIC in the context of global value chain.

J	Makela, J				Makela, Jaana			Aspects of a Licensing and Pricing Model for a Multi-Producer pan-European Data Product	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURES RESEARCH			English	Article						geoinformation; competitive position; information policies; value chain; systems intelligence		A customer-driven pricing and licensing model is a prerequisite for the business success of EuroDEM. Additionally, the implementation of the pricing and licensing model underpins the goals of INSPIRE and PSI Directives. EuroDEM is a pan-European geoinformation product that covers 40 countries in Europe. National Mapping and Cadastral Agencies own the DEM but EuroGeographics, whose activities focus on promoting the European Spatial Data Infrastructure, represents it collectively. A systemic approach to the development of the pricing and licensing model is introduced. The customer's needs, competing products, national pricing and licensing rules and principles, and the European Union's information policies have an effect on the model. Furthermore, the will of human beings to act and contribute to common goals is crucial. As a result, a proposal for a new pricing and licensing model is presented.

Critical Issues of IT Outsourcing Vendors in India	COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						off-shoring; organization; success; empirical; survey; international	OFFSHORE; WORK; CAPABILITY; DISPERSION; KNOWLEDGE; QUALITY; MEMBERS	Global outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) has now become an accepted corporate strategy of a vast majority of firms around the world. The functions being offshored have increased in scope and magnitude and have climbed the value chain ladder. However, the literature has overwhelmingly focused on client-centric issues to the neglect of vendor concerns. There is a rich tradition of ranking critical issues confronting Information Systems executives, and some studies have even explored critical issues of outsourcing clients. These rankings have significant implications for both researchers and practitioners. Our study focuses on the nascent area of IT outsourcing vendors. We examine the issues from the standpoint of IT outsourcing vendors in India, currently the primary destination for IT offshoring. The results suggest that for the Indian vendors, the most critical issues are not related to cultural, language, and time-zone differences as suggested in many writings. Rather, the most critical concerns are issues dealing with work arrangements and relationships with the client, and issues related to the client's organizational readiness for offshoring. Clearly the understanding of such issues is important to the vendors, but also to the clients in order to maintain an effective dyadic relationship.

J	Goncalo, CR; Borges, MD				Goncalo, Claudio Reis; Borges, Maria de Lourdes			Healthcare Services Based on Knowledge Structure	JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge management; health services; service strategy		This article presents a conceptual structure for enabling knowledge creation and knowledge transference in the knowledge-intensive health services. Identifying the proposed critical elements in health management, it analyses the required organisational characteristics for the change from a traditional context to a complex context. The conceptual framework applied to the hospital management highlights the differences between 'structure based on information' and 'structure based on knowledge'. Hospitals which are focused on solving complex problems demand new service strategies for the creation and transference of knowledge. A qualitative research was applied in a in-depth case study and conducted as an exploratory investigation in the Vascular Medical Center, that includes neurology and cardiology services, and is a Brazilian hospital specialised in complex problems. By looking into the patient's adherence, two critical contexts were identified: one was the interaction between patients and healthcare professionals, and the second was the organisational behaviour regarding the patients' experiences. Knowledge structure demands the reconfiguration of the internal value chain of hospitals considering the results of the assistance process. The organisational context to promote knowledge for solving adherence problems was characterised as a facilitator environment that would be required to develop an educational process for both patients and healthcare professionals.

The model suggests that institutional efficiency and competition among countries and industries will facilitate important circular effects, propelling and shaping the arrangement and allocation of industrial clusters, establishing their position in the value chain, and, consequently, determining the status of economic growth. In particular, the improvements in institutional efficiency of economic and technology systems will expand the demand for transactions and network size, which, in turn, will determine the development of cluster and network scope, as well as the position in the production value chain.

J	Naeve, A				Naeve, AmbjRn			Opportunistic (L)earning in the Mobile Knowledge Society	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE AND BLENDED LEARNING			English	Article						Conzilla; Knowledge Manifold; Opportunistic Collaboration; Prosumer Value Loops; Semantic Web; Technology-Enhanced Learning		This paper discusses the concept of opportunistic collaboration within the emerging mobile knowledge society. The paper illustrates how opportunistic collaboration can be applied to the areas of learning and earning by demonstrating how to transform a traditional unemployment agency into an Opportunistic Collaboration Agency based on an entrepreneurial supply-support network structured in the form of a prosumer manifold. The OCA pattern provides ways to capture the dynamics of entrepreneurial work-relations in the emerging 'work-portfolio society', increase the transparency of the entire value chain of economic activities, and create prosumer value loops that can support multi-dimensional bartering and increase the opportunities for marginalized groups of people to create value together. The paper ends by demonstrating how to use the OCA pattern to transform a traditional educational institution into an Opportunistic Learning Activity Broker that could help to bridge the gap between formal and informal learning.

J	Scheuplein, C				Scheuplein, Christoph			VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND MACROECONOMIC GROWTH: THE CASE OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY	ERDKUNDE			English	Article						Vertical integration; steel industry; iron ore mining industry; theory of spatial economic development; ANDREAS PREDOHL		As a result of the rise in the raw materials market of 2007-08, steel-producing companies are re-thinking their purchasing of iron ore. Integration of upstream mining companies is one option for ensuring the supply of raw materials. This trend is being pursued mostly in the up-and-coming industrial companies of newly industrializing countries. In contrast, the steel companies of mature industrial countries are continuing to rely on the market This variation in company strategies cannot be explained by current theories of vertical integration such as the Transaction Cost Approach and the Global Value Chain approach. This only becomes possible by considering the diverse macroeconomic environment, which is characterized by high profit margins and high investment in the newly industrializing countries. Theoretically, this requires us to borrow arguments from FRANCOIS PERROUX'S Polarization Theory and arguments from ANDREAS PREDOHL'S Theory of Economic Area Development. This paper contains an empirical investigation of vertical integration based on the steel and iron ore industries, and uses an Indian and a Chinese company as examples.

We searched the products pasteurized whole milk long life (UHT) pasteurized whole milk and Type C (in bags). The research is a case study, in which the average values were used, paid and received for the month of January 2009. The data collection instruments used were a literature review, desk review of company documents, on-site observation and interviews with company managers. The results show that all stages of the value chain realize profits from the producer to the distributor, and the smaller portion was for the producer and the largest in the industry. It is concluded that the manufacturing industry contributed the largest share of final consumer price. It cost elements are the most representative raw material and transport (production costs), as well as in the case of long life UHT milk, the packaging, which accounts for 19% of the amount paid by the consumer. Moreover, it is suggested that the role of key players - producers' cooperatives, manufacturers and distributors - and the impact of their logistics costs in the final price targets of future studies.

J	Falkenberg, AW				Falkenberg, Andreas W.			An international perspective on the moral maturity of marketers	AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL			English	Article						International business; Institutions; Ethics; Moral maturity; Inadequate institutions; Justice; Utilitarianism human rights; Kleptocracy; Flourishing; Social responsibility; Stake holders		The value chain networks created by international marketers criss-cross cultures and jurisdictions across the globe. Some of these jurisdictions are plagued by inadequate institutions or behavioural traffic rules, which do not promote flourishing lives for affected parties. As marketers facilitate these exchanges, there is a temptation to take a limited view of one's responsibilities for possible adverse consequences of these exchanges. A primitive approach to responsibility would be an individual cost/benefit analysis of the sticks and carrots involved in the transaction and a move as close to the minimum requirement as possible. A more mature marketer may consider her own culture's conventions as well as the conventions of the local culture when considering the nature of the exchange. Finally, one can seek to apply basic ethical principles to the exchange, which would require an analysis that would be relatively free of cultural conventions and a short term sticks and carrot analysis. It is the purpose of this paper to present a framework for analysis that would be useful for international marketers as they seek to facilitate exchanges between jurisdictions with inadequate institutions.

Yet private sector value-added resellers (VARs) still face a number of barriers to using PSGI. Price is only one impediment. The complexity of licences and restrictive licence conditions of PSGI may be an even bigger obstacle. Especially when combining different datasets, VARs can face a quagmire of conflicting licence conditions. Batty (2006 Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 33 163 164) called for research that would stimulate value-added use of PSGI. However, inconsistent and intransparent licence conditions for PSGI are among the biggest obstacles of PSGI for VARs. This paper explores the current PSGI licences to assess the actual restrictions and how current obstacles can be levelled. The Creative Commons licensing concept was explored and adapted to make it suitable for licensing PSGI. The resulting concept of Geo Shared licences is a means to harmonise licence conditions for PSGI. Our research shows that the Geo Shared concept can be a valuable contribution to further harmonisation of PSGI licences and thus development of value-added chains. Furthermore, development of geographic information infrastructures will also be stimulated. Similarly, the concept can be considered as a serious option within the Infrastructure of Spatial Information for Europe (INSPIRE), as a way towards transparent harmonised licences in Europe and beyond.

CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Article						fair trade; partnership; North-South relationships; mediation		Studying the cases of Artisans du Monde and its importing business, this paper explores the importance and forms of how it conducts relational ethics With producers in a context of stronger market orientation of both organizations. The definition of relational ethics has 4 components: Mutual knowledge and personalization; mediation along the value-chain; coherence and negotiation of northern and Southern projects; and the nature of the relations between second-level organizations in the south and its members. The evolution of Solidar'Monde's supply chains is accompanied by an ambivalent movement clarified by the identification of the four categories of supply chains. Oil one hand, there is a tendency for deeper remoteness Of producers, depersonalization of relations and strengthened asymmetries in the relations between producers and FT organizations, all of which translates into poorer relational ethics. Oil the other hand, a few experiments in some supply Chains Show that it is possible to build relations based on dialog and negotiation along the chain, a way of working anchored in relational ethics.

J	Streck, S				Streck, St.			Vision statement for the construction value chain - the future of planning and building in Germany	BAUINGENIEUR			German	Article								Planning and building is a work-sharing process with many partners. Therefore, the new demands for the branch which arise from the structural change do not only apply to the single enterprises but to the cooperation of the whole value chain. Therefore, 11 associations, chambers and trade unions of the construction branch have united to formulate a common vision statement for the future development of the value chain. In the vision statement the whole value chain is included. It is mostly directed at the enterprises in the construction value chain. However, in addition, it is also directed at the customers and the public, at the employees of the value chain and the younger generation as potential employees as well as at the politics. The "Vision Statement for the Construction Value Chain" constitutes the industry's strategic framework; it contains both a declaration of objectives and a set of action-based guidelines derived from those objectives. Thus its function is to provide guidance, to foster integration by creating a sense of community, to provide assistance in decision-making and, through the development of common rules, to help the actors in the construction value chain in their efforts to improve coordination.

Next, it moves into the discussion of four key levers of institutional change: the role of structure, culture, leadership, and governance. The last section establishes the relationship between effective transformation and meaning. In this respect, meaning is presented as the highest stage of a value chain moving upward from raw data and information to knowledge, learning, and meaning-building.

Drawing from secondary sources complemented by primary field research, all the CIBER-suggested steps are followed. The results reveal that tax and credit regulations should be priorities to improve the competitiveness of the cashew business in Brazil, and that CIBER can be an effective tool to expand industry analysis and to design reform strategies towards improved competitiveness.

Assessing the Economic Viability of Organic Cotton Production in Uzbekistan: A First Look	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE			English	Article						alternative crops; organic cotton; sustainability; Uzbekistan	MANAGEMENT; PESTICIDE; CARBON; HEALTH; POLICY	Cotton in Uzbekistan is produced in rotation with winter wheat and rice according to national quotas. Production methods are unsustainable, economically and ecologically risky, contributing to soil degradation, water depletion, and poor health. To address this challenge, we compared a conventional production system with an integrated organic system in Western Uzbekistan. Results reveal higher profits under an organic farming system. Combined with policies to improve the existing cotton value chain, organic cotton production could result in higher revenue while reducing pressure on the environment and improving livelihoods.

It will first identify some major - market based - changes in the context of agricultural development. Next it will explain how this has modified the ideas about supporting innovation processes, defined here as the generation or application of new knowledge; it will then introduce the concept of 'new agriculture' and eight case studies in four countries that were undertaken to explore and better understand the potential of innovation systems theory to support sustainable development. The paper finishes with some selected conclusions that further highlight the interaction between knowledge generation and market development and that suggest the need to keep on investing in farmer organization.

Contrary to popular belief, capability-driven concepts of strategic renewal have been in application for a considerable time. The emphasis here is upon an approach used by several strategic consultancies: namely the Value Chain Redefinition (VCR) concept, which resembles a meta-capability that identifies firm capability levels and needs within specific parts of the organisation. Perhaps a surprising implication is that many of the difficulties associated with the operationalisation of the DCV have been independently resolved by practitioners, even though researchers are still looking for ways of translating and communicating their DCV findings. It can therefore be argued that gaining advantages through dynamic capability configurations is already a more deliberately managed stratagem than is often assumed.

Utility computing has drawn attention from enterprise customers who seek to reduce upfront IT investment and enhance computing agility. Major IT service providers envisioned that the commoditization and standardization of IT resources would usher in the shift of the IT paradigm towards utility computing. In this paper, a decision model is presented for determining the optimal capacity of a utility computing which maximizes the total profit for a utility computing service provider.

Even though Grid technologies have made progress within the context of large enterprises and academic projects, there has not yet been a widespread adoption by public institutions and small enterprises. One barrier to this adoption is the lack of economic paradigms which support the dynamic and efficient sharing of Grid resources by balancing resource scarcity and idle capacities. Economic algorithms promise to provide a good fit to the Grid's inherent strategic dimension by enabling users to express their valuation for computer resources. At the same time they provide incentives to contribute idle resources to the Grid in return for the market price. This paper presents a market-based approach for trading complex computational Grid services. The implemented combinatorial exchange aims at maximizing the social welfare of users. At its core, it provides a rich bidding language which is able to represent complex Grid services and simple workflows. The allocation mechanism is evaluated by means of a numerical experiment in order to gain detailed insights into the computational complexity of the underlying allocation problem. Our analysis provides input for the configuration of Grid markets.

J	Sokol, DZ				Sokol, Dan Z.			Improving the Supply Chain by Sharing Intelligent Technical Data Packages	SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE			English	Article								For many suppliers in the aerospace value chain, business commences when the customer shares the Technical Data Package (TDP) that defines the detailed requirements for a specific part. To convert the customer TDP into the necessary internal documentation, suppliers must expend large amounts of effort. This generally involves passing along copies of the TDP to each functional discipline, which not only results in redundant and laborious work, but it introduces technical risk. There are now software tools available that enable an intelligent TDP that provides more value than just sharing a 3D CAD model. These tools electronically organize and integrate all elements of the TDP independent of the PLM software in use. The application of the intelligent TDP has enabled a 30% reduction in supply chain inefficiencies.

J	Tian, X; Martin, B				Tian, Xuemei; Martin, Bill			Digitization and Publishing in Australia: A Recent Snapshot	LOGOS-JOURNAL OF THE WORLD PUBLISHING COMMUNITY			English	Article						Digital publishing; web-based survey; book publishing; Australia		In a government-funded research project into the implications of digitization for book publishing in Australia, the researchers tested for the presence of global issues and trends. With a focus specifically upon book publishing to the exclusion of newspaper and journal publishing these included: revenue trends; competition; outsourcing; potential benefits of digital publishing; critical success factors for digital publishing; supply chain issues; value chain issues, business models and expectations for the future. An online survey and follow-up interviews found that technologies such the Internet and the World Wide Web, along with those for production and rights management were playing a significant role in book publishing. However, the major focus among book publishers was on business and organizational issues. There was widespread realization of the need to respond to competition from inside and outside the industry, including competition for the leisure time of users, with direct implications for value chains and business models. Key organizational changes identified included changes in structures and strategies, in human resource practices, and in cultures. The main benefits anticipated from digital technologies were in the areas of new niche markets, repackaging and repurposing of existing content, consumer-generated content and the enhancement of value chains. It is therefore, imprudent to only consider the impact of emerging technology as the fundamental in the ongoing development of digitization in book publishing, as other considerations such as demographics, social and economic factors are also essential ingredients.

FOR POWER GENERATION PURPOSES AT THE ISABELA ISLAND (GALAPAGOS - ECUADOR)	JATROPHA CURCAS AS A PREMIER BIOFUEL: COST, GROWING AND MANAGEMENT	Energy Science Engineering and Technology		English	Article; Book Chapter								Nowadays the Ecuadorian Government is working on a series of projects to guarantee the environmental security of the Galapagos Islands. It is intended to change the power generation towards hybrid systems operated by renewable energies. In the frame of these projects, a low penetration hybrid system based on photovoltaic (400 kWp) and intern combustion engines (350 - 450 kWel) for the Isabela Island is investigated. It is intended to use vegetal oil as fuel derived from the Jatropha curcas seeds. This application could bring benefits for socioeconomically depressed rural areas at the Ecuadorian mainland by introducing them into the value chain of Jatropha oil production. More than 200'000 ha of marginal land suitable for Jatropha cultivation have been detected near the Ecuadorian coastal regions. The performed study covers social, environmental and technological aspects, ranging from the propagation of the Jatropha curcas tree in Ecuador, to the small scale production of the Jatropha oil in rural areas and the power generation with intern combustion engines at the Isabela Island. Properties of the Ecuadorian Jatropha curcas seeds, the technologies and its difficulties have been analyzed in order to quantify the Ecuadorian case.

Any generated knowledge has to be examined to achieve diffusion and commercialisation. The methods of examination, however, vary. Within aeronautics, original equipment manufacturers executed for a long time the function as knowledge examiners, while the further diffusion was mainly based on trust and social proximities. With global sourcing and the rising importance of system suppliers as integrators of new knowledge, examination has to be more formalised posing new challenges to incumbent SMEs. The paper investigates these challenges and consequences for the aeronautics value chain.

J	D'Aubeterre, F; Iyer, LS; Ehrhardt, R; Singh, R				D'Aubeterre, Fergle; Iyer, Lakshmi; Ehrhardt, Richard; Singh, Rahul			Discovery Process in a B2B eMarketplace: A Semantic Matchmaking Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						eMarketplace; Infomediary; Ontology; Semantic Matchmaking; Semantic Web		In the context of a customer-oriented value chain, companies must effectively address customers changing information needs during the process of acquiring a product or service to remain competitive. The ultimate goal of semantic matchmaking is to identify the best resources (supply) that fully meet the requirements (demand); however, such a goal is very difficult to achieve due to information distributed over disparate systems. To alleviate this problem in the context of eMarketplaces, the authors suggest an agent-enabled infomediary-based eMarketplace that enables semantic matchmaking. They extend and apply the exact, partial, and potential match algorithms developed in Di Noia et al. (2004) to show how partial and potential matches can become full matches. Specifically, the authors show how multi-criteria decision making techniques can be utilized to rank matches. They describe mechanisms for knowledge representation and exchange to allow partner organizations to seamlessly share information and knowledge to facilitate the discovery process in an eMarketplace context.

J	Gil, NDD				Diaz Gil, Nelson Dario			Standardized and complete costs of power supply services as a tool for making business decisions	ESTUDIOS GERENCIALES			Spanish	Article						Electricity sector costs; generation; transmission; distribution; marketing		The purpose of this paper is to discuss the calculations of costs of power supply utilities for internal management purposes. To this end, we analyze the major phases of the value chain in the electric power sector, i.e. generation, transmission, distribution, and trading. The author suggest ways to overcome the shortcomings and describe practical applications of the proposals. The methodology makes it possible to estimate the cost of each of these variables and then to aggregate them to show the costs per state and activity. Finally, a summary showing the operational performance in terms of revenue and costs per service, sales office, and estimated benefits paid, among others. The paper provides tools for recognizing departmental structures whose performance should be improved.

J	Hidalgo, A; Albors, J; Lopez, V				Hidalgo, Antonio; Albors, Jose; Lopez, Vicente			Design and development challenges for an E2E DRM content business integration platform	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Digital rights; Platform; B2B	INTERNET	Current studies on Digital Rights Management (DRM) have focused on controlling access to and copies of contents, centered exclusively on the end of the value chain (end users). This focus has been oriented towards security and encryption as a means of solving the issue of illegal copying by purchasers. in this paper, we propose End-to-End Digital Rights Management (E2E DRM) that involves the protection of the content throughout the entire value chain. This concept is given form in the new technologies for representing intellectual property (IP) which, in a secure and unequivocal manner, identify the content at each point in the value chain: from the author to the end user, the content is identifiable in any of the transactions and statuses through which it passes. The key concept which E2E DRM must provide is not only the governability of access and copying, but also that of all the processes associated with the content business. We establish an E2E DRM model and architecture, and propose the R&D management of its design and implementation that makes it possible to protect content from content creator to purchaser. Finally, the paper also analyzes their impact from a global perspective. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Catacutan, DC; Duque-Pinon, C				Catacutan, Delia C.; Duque-Pinon, Caroline			The Policy Environment of Vegetable-Agroforestry System in the Philippines: Are there incentives for smallholders?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Vegetable-agroforestry system; agroforestry; incentives; smallholders; policy instruments		Vegetable-agroforestry (VAf) is a viable farming system that integrates vegetables in tree-based system, or vice-versa. However, its viability is constrained by myriad factors, including farmers' inability to invest in the system, inadequate institutional structures to facilitate information flow, and lack of market incentives. Policy incentives are thus needed to stimulate smallholder investments in VAf. In the Philippines, the policy environment is supportive of VAf, but is insufficient in stimulating smallholder investments. Incentives for smallholders are limited while disincentives persist. Large farmers benefit more from national-level policies than smallholders because they have more access to information and can leverage the costs of implementation. Some issues are better resolved through national-level policies, while others can be effectively addressed through locally-formulated policies. For the vegetable sector, price regulation, commodity protection, cost reduction across the value chain, removing non-tariff barriers, and global trade issues can be addressed through national-level policies, whereas transaction costs, land tenure and resource rights, and domestic and international market incentives are for the tree sector. At the local level, promoting smallholder investments in VAf requires policies that address extension issues particularly on technology provision, market linkages and infrastructure support. Where nationallevel policies do not effectively address the needs of smallholders, locally-crafted policies are needed to offset this gap. Policy linkages between national and local levels need to be established, and policymakers need to mobilize adequate responses at both levels. Finally, the viability of VAf depends on a whole set of policies that government can provide. It is therefore a political imperative.

In such a value chain, the key role is played by logistic processes which condition the achievement of the value added both for the customer and the company. In the field of logistics, there are a lot of value added creation potentials, in the light of continually rising customers' requirements and competitors' behaviour. Making strategic decisions with regard to logistics, particularly in view of a longterm development of logistic processes and structures, should lead to continuous identification and development of logistic potentials for creation of value added for the customer and the company. These potentials may significantly contribute to a continual expansion of the logistic services range offered by the company, which in turn may lead to meeting customers' needs more effectively than before.

J	Chang, CY; Wang, FH; Fu, HP				Chang, Ching-Yi; Wang, Fanghua; Fu, Hsin-Pin			A strategic analysis of the mobile telephone industry in Mainland China	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mobile communication systems; Telephone; Competitive strategy; Telecommunications; China		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose some competitive strategies as a reference for domestic mobile phone corporations (DMCs) so that dominant mobile phone corporations can develop advantageous business strategies to effectively compete with international corporations within the China market. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes case studies and the analysis hierarchical process to analyze the competitiveness of the domestic mobile phone industry (DMI) within the China market from a value chain perspective. Findings - The study finds that the competitive strengths of the domestic mobile phone players lie in manufacturing and customer service, while the weaknesses are in research and development (R&D), distribution (DIST) and marketing and sales (MS) in terms of competing with international brands already within the Chinese market. Research limitations/implications - The paper samples experts familiar with the mobile phone market in the Shanghai area, and therefore may not be applicable to the entire Chinese market. A wider study is suggested, with samples sourced from the entire market, to fill in the remaining gaps. Practical implications - The surveyed experts emphasize that R&D, DIST and MS capabilities need to be addressed immediately. In turn, some competitive strategies are proposed for the DMI to employ, taking into account their individual features and strengths. Originality/value - The study assists the dominant corporations in the DMI to better understand their competitive weaknesses through the comments provided by the surveyed experts. Some competitive strategies are proposed as a reference for DMCs.

USING ACCOUNTING-Based PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO ASSESS THE BUSINESS VALUE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS	ECONOMICS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE: EMPIRICAL RESEARCH	Advances in Management Information Systems		English	Article; Book Chapter						Firm Performance; Firm Value; High-Tech Companies; Information Technology; Manufacturing; ROE Decomposition; Residual Income Model; Value Chain	VARIABLES	In this chapter, we apply contemporary financial analysis methods to the measurement of information technology (IT) business value. IT contributes to business value by changing and enhancing business processes. Embedding IT in business processes or more effective uses of IT should show up in improved accounting measures of performance, which subsequently affect financial market measures of firm value. Thus, an assessment of IT's impact on firm performance must consider IT's effect on specific business processes and how those processes affect overall firm performance. First, we propose value chain analysis to assess the impact of IT investments on business processes and the selection of appropriate accounting-based process measures. Then, we describe the link between process performance measures and overall firm performance measures such as return on equity (ROE). ROE decomposition provides further insight into the contribution of IT to business value. The residual income model is then used to link ROE directly to firm value. The framework is demonstrated using thirty-two high-tech manufacturing firms that adopted IT-based supply chain management systems. Our empirical contribution is to illustrate how ROE decomposition methodology can be used to find value from IT investments. In particular, this methodology integrates disparate parts of the business value framework into a comprehensive model for empirical analysis of the performance changes around the adoption of new IT investments.

An application to the Wine of Rioja	ECONOMIA AGRARIA Y RECURSOS NATURALES			Spanish	Article						Vertical integration; wine industry; transaction cost theory	BUY DECISIONS; APPROPRIABLE RENTS; INDUSTRY; COORDINATION; COMPETITION; FIRM; UNCERTAINTY; GOVERNANCE; STRATEGIES; ECONOMICS	This article develops and tests a model of integration of the first stage of the wine value chain, i.e. the viticulture activity. The model, derived from the transaction cost analysis developed principally by Williamson, is formulated as a tobit function, which is estimated with data from the wine industry in the Rioja's denomination of origin. The nature of the relationship between product quality and vertical integration is also established. Consistently with the transaction cost theory, integration is associated with increasing levels of asset specificity and uncertainty. Results also indicate that the winery size significantly affects make-buy choices. As expected, more vertical integration appears to be associated with higher product quality.

J	Forge, S; Blackman, C; Lindmark, S				Forge, Simon; Blackman, Colin; Lindmark, Sven			Plastic promises: the disruptive potential of OLEDs and e-paper for the European display industry	FORESIGHT			English	Article						Europe; Innovation; Communication technologies; Light-emitting diodes		Purpose - The paper aims to explore two developing display technologies, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and e-paper, with a view to assessing their potential to disrupt existing markets and thereby offer an opportunity for European firms to play a larger role in the Information and communication technologies (ICTs) sector. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on an extensive study including literature review and detailed desk research on the technologies themselves, their potential application and market analysis. Selected interviews with industry representatives were also carried out, which further informed a detailed value chain analysis and assessment of the EU position in these technologies. Findings - OLEDs and e-paper have the potential to disrupt current displays market and in so doing they may enable EU companies to enter at selected points in the value chain to compete with the Asian ICT industry. Originality/value - Although there is a huge literature on the technical aspects of these technologies, speculative market analysis and journalistic assessments, this paper brings all of these facets together in a sophisticated value chain analysis that indicates opportunities for Europe's ICT sector.

To enable SALE business processes, the US Army selected the SAP Enterprise Suite. To that end, the SALE vision must be aligned with US Army business processes in order to provide the planning and control mechanisms for successfully deploying such a system. We demonstrate how critical PLM components were designed for organisational innovation and business transformation using SAP NetWeaver technologies. Our main contribution is demonstrating the importance of designing integrated versus best-of-breed solutions when implementing complex solutions.

Instead of that, company has to find way to create quality management system in a multilayered supply chain. The problem can be solved by networking in the cluster. Cluster can be known as a competitive cooperation in the purpose to gain higher level of competitiveness and success. Bat there is another problem: Organization of the production process in a company is extremely complex process itself, and when we transfer it to the cluster level, we get a complex task which is difficult to solve. For that purpose, this paper analyses the conditions and possibilities that would enable those structures to adapt to changes in the surroundings - flexibility and management adequacy of production and organizational structures - by creating network value system.

The initiative succeeded in creating a commodity chain linking impoverished workers in Bahia's usinas with the traditional European working class in Paris, Lille, Glasgow and Liverpool. The output of sugar in Bahia increased markedly but it was sold in the protected markets of Brazil's Center-South.

Preservation and adding new value to native potatoes with small farmers in the province of Bolivar, Ecuador	REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE LA PAPA			Spanish	Article						native potato; food production chain		In the Alto Guanujo sector, province of Bolivar, Ecuador, the area cultivated with native potatoes has been reduced gradually, due to the substitution with improved varieties. Because of this, the National Agricultural Research Institute of Ecuador (INIAP) and the Consortium of Small Potato Farmers (CONPAPA) are conserving, characterizing and adding new value to native potatoes, by working with a value chain approach and developing new products. Thirty native varieties have been collected, conserved and characterized. With the participation of several actors of the value chain, 11 native varieties with market potential have been selected. An agreement with a supermarket in Quito has been reached to sell native potatoes for six months in five branches. Similar agreements are expected with two other supermarkets in Quito. To the moment, a commercial agreement in maintained with five gourmet restaurants in Quito and Riobamba, and it is expected to reach at least 50 restaurants. Taking into account that there is demand and interest for chips of colored-flesh native varieties and that CONPAPA has the machinery, it is expected to develop a project to produce such chips. CONPAPA can produce around 5000 30-g bags of chips each month.

B	Sundin, E		Sakao, T; Lindahl, M		Sundin, Erik			Life-Cycle Perspectives of Product/Service-Systems: Practical Design Experiences	INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCT/SERVICE-SYSTEM DESIGN			English	Article; Book Chapter						Life-cycle Design; Industrial Product/Service Systems; PSS; DfX		Many manufacturers are moving more and more towards the business approach of Product/Service-Systems (PSS) in order to achieve more revenues. The business approach of PSS puts new requirements on products in comparison to traditional selling. In order to achieve a PSS adapted for this business approach, the products and services used need to consider a life-cycle perspective. Having a life-cycle perspective on products and services in the business strategy of PSS is becoming increasingly important as the strategy emerges and more companies see the benefits of controlling a larger share of the product-value chain. The objective of this chapter is to elucidate how manufacturers have worked with, or could adapt their products for, PSS. Supporting this are results from several case studies, performed at companies that manufacture household appliances, soil compactors and forklift trucks. A key factor when developing products for PSS is to design the product from a life-cycle perspective, considering all the product's life-cycle phases, e.g., manufacturing, use, maintenance and end-of-life treatment. Several design improvements, all of which are fairly inexpensive and easy to implement, are described. Many of these improvements deal with the accessibility of parts and components during maintenance and remanufacturing operations, and several of the design improvements could reduce the need and cost for maintenance, repair and remanufacturing.

BUSINESS REGULATION AND PUBLIC POLICY: THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF COMPLIANCE	International Studies in Entrepreneurship		English	Article; Book Chapter								In this chapter, we explore the paper-based functional hierarchy (Mintzbergs' machine bureaucracy) as one of the important origins of the administrative burden. In such a functional hierarchy, the knowledge of the professionals on the one hand and the information of the clients on the other are two important resources. Both resources need to be managed for the organization to be effective and efficient. In the functional hierarchy the professional knowledge and the information of clients both are organized in stovepipes. Both resources have a low level of integration, intra-organizational as well as inter-organizational. We witness two trends. First, ICTs ('classical ICT' and internet technology) create an inter-organizational information infrastructure that is becoming interoperable. Second, professional knowledge is becoming modularized, with organizations starting to share their professionals and their knowledge in focusing on core competencies, outsourcing all other activities (and the relevant knowledge) and creating shared service centers. This results in a radical transformation of organizations. This transformed organizational infrastructure can deliver integrated services, by pooling different modules into one service delivery value chain and reusing all relevant information that is readily available in the interoperable, inter-organizational information infrastructure. This transformation of the organization results in potentially high levels of reduction of the administrative burden, without reducing the number and the level of norms and regulations.

Supply chain management involves a series of activities, which integrate purchasing, producing, distributing, and customer service. For the purpose of integrating all the resources and enabling each partner in the supply chain to cooperate to create customer value, enterprises integrate with each other from the suppliers to the end users by sharing information and processes management, so as to costing down operating expenditure and raising revenue of all the members in the supply chain. This paper discusses how the buyer in a military industry system call use the method of information processing to apply the SCOR model on the collaborative management of military logistics system, the internal logistics management integration and the sharing information of upstream/down stream organizations. A management model has been developed in this paper. This model can execute the electronic processes integration in the aspect of product development, manufacturing and distribution, and manage military logistics industry efficiently. Therefore, it can be a reference model for the collaborative management of logistics management systems in the defense industry.

The case facilitates a guided hands-on experience where students learn to analyze a business entity in the context of its environment; recognize what business processes comprise an entity's value chain; and develop, document, and implement a tailor-made IS to support the entity's operation. In order to keep the amount of development realistic and the system transparent for students, the case focuses on a small service company: a dental office. The case uses a resource-events-agents (REA) analytical framework for modeling and Microsoft Access for IS implementation. The case is structured modularly, enabling instructors to either explain material or demonstrate analysis/development of a segment of an IS in class and then challenge the students to complete the module's development following the instructor's example. Instructors have the flexibility to give students fewer (or additional) directions in developing the information system, depending on the students' backgrounds and abilities. Instructors also have a choice to limit the scope of the development and implementation to any number of four business processes.

Rice production in the country is characterized by a supply-driven production system that is rooted in subsistence model of farming. A commodity value chain development approach was recently put into use in the past two years to transform the rice agribusiness sub sector to satisfy consumer preferences in Nigeria. The model has been. The value chain approach is built on the efficiency of private-led business development encapsulated in a market-led model that drives input linkages and best agronomic practices. The model involves the production of high premium rice paddy, willingness of major input dealers to provide agro-chemicals to the farmers at affordable prices, use of private sector-led extension delivery system, project responsiveness to emerging opportunities including the establishment of spray-men, and appropriate use of improved agronomic practices. All inclusive participatory methods in project implementation further shaped the success of the intervention. Three major rice processing firms which provided a sustainable market outlet for the farm produce from a total of 4000 farmers were involved in the process. Investigations indicate that about 53% of the farmers were formed into farmers' cooperative groups and linked to a credit institution. The farmers (69%) adopted the package of practices on their farms and achieved an average yield of 4.9 tons per hectare, as against national productivity average of 1.7 tons/ha. Female farmers (71.4%) produced an average of 6.2 tons/ha. Two major rice processing firms generated a total gross revenue of USD1,017,162 while 34 newly established processing enterprises generated income valued at USD855,843 in 2006. Over 300 young people were gainfully employed as agrochemical sprayers. This paper therefore shows that a market-led demand-driven agricultural development approach by high value commodities can lead to efficiency in the agricultural sector and generate the employment for idle youths.

J	Denner, M; Oosthuizen, H				Denner, M.; Oosthuizen, H.			The strategic positioning and configuration of national mapping organisations as enablers of economic and social growth in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper explores the transferability and application of business-driven strategic thinking to that of a public sector context, namely national mapping organisations. These organisations exist throughout the world because the economies of the world require geospatial information to support economic and social growth. As such their strategic positioning within government is of prime importance. In South Africa, however, there is a paucity of knowledge in this regard and consequently triggered the research which forms the basis of this paper. A macro-environmental analysis suggests significant growth opportunities for the South African geospatial industry, fuelled by a micro-industry borne out of the 2010 Soccer World Cup event. A profile description of the characteristics of consequence, boundaries between the private and public the industry and expected changes reflect a large industry which is expanding at a rapid rate but is fragmented and displays a complex network-system of inter and intra-industry relationships. As such it is attracting increasing numbers of competitors but, as an industry, appears to be slow to adjust to technological advancement. An internal analysis of the value chain of the National Mapping Organisation (NMO), the single most important player in the local public sector geospatial industry, reveals significant value creation in its in-house activities. However, the external deconstructed operations, outbound logistics and procurement processes are not allowing the organisation to realise any benefits from efficiencies it may introduce. Key to achieving efficiencies lies in the human capital, which by all accounts, it is failing to retain. Future strategic thrusts for the NMO have been identified by constructing a SWOT model and by analysing its relative competitive strength. These thrusts were found to concentrate on actions and themes related to staff, communication, marketing, general management, production (cost and capacity) and product (quality and innovation). Interpreting and applying those themes on an interorganisational basis will enable the NMO to best position itself in the industry. In this regard sufficient related strategic fit is evident between the value chains of the NMO, The Satellite Application Centre (SAC) and Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), enabling the NMO to leverage on the sales, marketing and distribution activities of SAC and the financial leveraging capabilities of Stats SA. This paper has presented an example of how delivering an efficient and effective service delivery may be hampered through the inappropriate strategic configuration of South African public sector activities. It is therefore suggested that the government revisits the strategic positioning of public sector organisations engaged in the provision of geospatial information.

J	We, OG; Hun, BH				We, Oh Gie; Choi, Byung Hun			A Study on the Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) Reinforcement in China; Focusing on Chinese Automobile Industry	INTERNATIONAL AREA STUDIES REVIEW			English	Article						Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR); Sustainable Development; Strategic CSR; CSR Activity of China; Stakeholder Model		Currently the requirement for Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) is more and more growing in China. Chinese Government has tried to protect natural environment and lowincome employees' right by making new laws, and requires the state own enterprises(SOEs) and multinational enterprises(MNEs) do more investments for making a practical contribution to local society development, so called a quality oriented development rather than a quantity oriented one. Therefore this paper tried to examine the CSR trend change in China and to draw out its implication. Firstly this paper organized the CSR trend of China by three stages with the passage of time since the 'Open Door Policy'. Major approach for CSR in China has changed by the economic approach. institutional approach. strategic approach. The key issues for CSR have changed from the firm's profit maximization to the shareholders' value increase, and to the business & society integration. In addition this paper took the case analysis for Chinese automobile manufacturing industry in order to look at the recent condition of CSR activities in China. According to the result, more and more social issues of China are significantly affected by each firm's activities on value chain, and major issues of current Chinese society make much more effect on a firm's business activities than before.

Firms are able to develop and deploy better strategies if their competitors' responses can be analyzed or even predicted. However, a competitor may initiate certain strategic actions to improve its position. A strategic approach to analyzing competitor responses to a rival's actions in order to achieve a better position would greatly help in the formulation of a firm's business strategy. A DNA analogy shows the way.

J	Simard, A				Simard, Albert			Knowledge transfer services: A second-order communication process	REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH			English	Article						knowledge management; knowledge services; knowledge markets; communication; value chain		This paper describes a model intended to increase understanding of how content is transferred from its source to its use. A Natural Resources Canada task group explored the nature of knowledge transfer with a services paradigm to discover and understand underlying patterns and processes. Knowledge Services are programs that produce and provide content-based organizational outputs with embedded value that are intended to be used internally or transferred to meet external user wants or needs. Model design criteria include independence from content, an organizational focus, scalability, two drivers, and two levels of resolution. The model is based on a value chain in which value is embedded, advanced, or extracted. A knowledge services system comprises nine stages: generate, transform, manage, use internally, transfer, add value, use professionally, use personally, and evaluate. Knowledge services are delivered through a delivery spectrum ranging from rich to reach. Each region of the delivery spectrum has a set of attributes that influence how services should be delivered.				simarda@inspection.gc.ca					AMIDON D, 1997, INNOVATION STRATEGY, P136; BRYANT J, 2006, P HAW INT C SYST SCI, V39; *CHIEF INF OFF BRA, 2005, NEXT GEN PUBL  UNPUB; DAVENPORT T, WORKING KNOWLEDGE HA; Kay J., 1993, FDN CORPORATE SUCCES; Nonaka I., 1998, KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, P21; Simard A., 2007, UNDERSTANDING KNOWLE; SIMARD A, 2005, UN WORLD C DIS RED; Sinclair N., 2006, STEALTH KM WINNING K; Stewart TA, 1996, INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL; Weaver W., 1949, MATH THEORY COMMUNIC; [No title captured]	12	1	1	0	4	ARMAN COLIN	PARIS CEDEX 6	21, RUE DU MONTPARNASSE, PARIS CEDEX 6, 75283, FRANCE	0035-1121			REV GEOGR ALP	Rev.

J	Guzman, JLR; Valdes, AA				Ruiz Guzman, Jose Luis; Aguilar Valdes, Alfredo			Emotional Intelligence as a Key Factor for Competitiveness at SMEs	REVISTA VIRTUAL UNIVERSIDAD CATOLICA DEL NORTE			Spanish	Article						Articulation; Creativity; Competitiveness; Emotional Intelligence; Human Resource; History of Learning; Innovation; Learning		At the present time, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are circumscribed to analyze, grasp, exploit, and take advantage of the endless opportunities resulting from the local market and the competition increase as a consequence of the globalization process' commercial opening. In this context, the challenge is to provide the SMEs, through Productive Articulation Centers (Centros de Articulacion Productiva CAPs, a propositional private entity belonging to the SMEs Fund Fondo Pyme of the Secretary of Economy for Competitiveness in Mexico) with concrete actions promoting the emotional intelligence management. The objective of this effort is to lead these enterprises to consolidate an innovating culture aimed to achieve competitive advantages along the whole value chain through the harmonization of four factors: human resource, training, logistics and creativity. Such initiative is performed following the interpretative-exploratory research method and taking the history of learning as consultative element. The CAPs' great challenge is to guide the SMEs to take the initiative to promote a new entrepreneurial leadership culture focused on technological transference and appropriation. The macro concept initiative-insufficience- promotion-incentive-introspection-integration-impact sets the key ingredient for competitiveness, starting from emotional intentionality to innovation in processes and products through the mentioned stages. Insufficiencies, promotion and incentives mean the three basic actions for competition-motivation management. Introspection and integration work as commitments to guarantee the vision of the enterprise's local market support in a global competition context.

J	Burke, L; Phyne, J				Burke, Lenore; Phyne, John			Made in Japan: The Japanese market and herring roe production and management in Canada's southern Gulf of St. Lawrence	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						common property resources; resource management; global commodity chains	COMMODITY CHAIN; FISHERIES; CLUSTERS; INDUSTRY; SYSTEM	The herring roe fishery in Canada's southern Gulf of St. Lawrence is a productive fishery that lies outside the confines of privatized arrangements. Yet, this fishery is compromised by its dependence on the Japanese seafood market. Consideration of the efficiency of this fishery needs to account for the role assumed by this market in setting fishing practices. A more ecologically and economically efficient use of the herring resource requires greater attention to supply chain integration by local harvesters, processors and buyers prior to engaging with distant markets. This is necessary regardless of the property rights regime that is in place. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, the paper highlights the critical role of customer value in business to-business markets, focusing on the links between the company's ability to manage customer value-creation processes and the positive financial and economic out comes generated by loyalty effects. Secondly, the paper develops key analytical stages for an understanding of customer value. The focus is on the customer value-chain concept, including consideration of the customer information and acquisition process and its decision rules. Third, the paper illustrates the measurement process, offeringan organizational framework for selecting the most suitable method for measuring perceive dcustomer value. The methodological alternatives range fromdesk measures (e. g., technical computation of the total costof ownership( TCO)) to field analysis, like those considered under both compositional and the decomposition approaches (e. g., conjoint analysis). The paper concludes withr emarks on the managerial implications of these measures, as well as offering suggestions for further research on value for the customer.

A tale of two technologies: the financial chapter	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						disruptive technology; value chain analysis; life cycle costing; financing; corporate venturing; R&D partnership	VALUE CHAIN; INDUSTRY	Disruptive technology upsets the status quo by revolutionising the way customer needs are met. An intriguing aspect of this type of technology is that it is often developed and marketed by relative 'newcomers' to an industry and not by its leading firms. Researchers have proposed many strategic and marketing reasons for this pattern of innovation. In this paper, we explore how accounting standards and their consequent financial effects influence firms' decisions to invest internally in 'sustaining technology' and through joint ventures or research partnerships in 'disruptive technologies'. We illustrate that hi-tech companies use a combination of strategies for R&D investments.

J	Solinis, MAG; Munoz, RY				Gandarillas Solinis, Miguel Angel; Yaguee Munoz, Raquel			The role of local knowledge networks in territorial development in the countryside of Segovia	INVESTIGACIONES GEOGRAFICAS-SPAIN			Spanish	Article						Local Knowledge; Value Chain; Land Development; Sustainable Development; Rural Development; Social Capital		An analysis of present development needs and resources of a rural county, based on an integral approach including demographic, economic, and psychosocial domains, is presented here. We stated as a general hypothesis that both needs and resources are mainly explained by the degree socio-economical and psychosocial integration vs. fragmentation with land. Socio-demographic and economic statistical data analysis, ethnological interviews, and field research of selected places were carried out. After an analysis integrating results on social features, perceived needs, and identified resources, main hypothesis was supported, being local knowledge and affective binding to the rural context particularly affected by a increasing fissure between society and land. Community development based on local knowledge management within value network and chain systems is proposed as strategy to enhance social capital and fabric, through knowledge exchange, creativity, and interpreneurial innovation, and the role of companies as enginer of generation and development of local knowledge, aiming at a dynamic, flexible, differentiated, active and personalized relationship between the land origin of the product and the final demand, with the aid of new communication technologies In order to understand the land demographic dynamics of this study, a new population concentration index is introduced.

S	Hubner, U		Hubner, U; Elmhorst, MA		Huebner, Ursula			The Supply Chain Model of eBusiness in Healthcare	EBUSINESS IN HEALTHCARE: FROM EPROCUREMENT TO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT	Health Informatics Series		English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter aims at synthesizing a model of supply chain activities within the context of eBusiness. It builds on the practical experience and incorporates visions of how eBusiness in healthcare might look in the future. It is motivated by the understanding-expressed by all experts interviewed and highlighted by the case studies-that the essence of eBusiness lies in its ability to provide structured error-free data for business analysis, and ultimately for decision-making. It further recognizes that these data result from optimized processes, and at the same time that these data allow the processes to function smoothly. The model is developed taking the four behavioral components of eBusiness into consideration: information distribution and search, transactions, collaboration, and decision-making. Before formulating the model, two major process-oriented supply chain management models are presented and discussed in terms of their use in healthcare. It is concluded that they may provide a suitable framework, but focus too much on manufacturing and the classical supply chain perspective of a major manufacturer with its suppliers and customers. Instead, it is proposed to describe the supply chain in healthcare from the customer's point of view, as it is the customer (namely the healthcare provider) who makes this supply chain specific to healthcare. The supply chain model of eBusiness in healthcare that we present here integrates a process, a document, and a functional model that are all geared to the combined view of clinical and economic issues related to the procurement, provision, and use of medical supplies. To this end, the model description begins with a presentation of the healthcare value chain, supplemented by the information truck that is associated with the delivery of patient care, and that finally results in a clinical outcome analysis. The first of the three submodels, the supply chain process model, is split into two parts-the strategic model and the operations model-that both distinguish between healthcare-provider and supplier-specific processes. The second model, the document model, concentrates on data related to the product and shows the various data sources, namely the documents, that become relevant in the product life cycle. Again, these documents embrace clinical as well as economic, cases of use. The document model is structured according to the product life cycle, which starts with product development and clinical trials, continues with products being purchased and used, and finally ends wit-h the decision to replace a product. During this cycle, the main questions to be answered by the data in the various documents pertain to the quality, the costs, and the degree of innovation of the product. The third model, the function model, integrates the process and the document models. Similar functions are grouped into layers. The function model describes the following layers: Content, Contract, Order-to-Payment, Service, Clinical Process, Clinical Outcome, and Knowledge. These layers are arranged as a stack that roughly follows the product's path from the manufacturer to the healthcare providers, where the product is used and where knowledge is accumulated about the product's clinical usefulness and the cost-to-benefit ratio. The supply chain model of eBusiness in healthcare is meant to support practitioners in assessing how supply chain concepts and eBusiness can strengthen their organization and help them develop an appropriate strategy to achieve this goal. In applied sciences, the model is intended to stimulate further questions about what direction supply chain and eBusiness will take in the future.

J	Humphrey, J; Schmitz, H				Humphrey, John; Schmitz, Hubert			China - growth engine or obstacle for Asian developing economies?	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGRAPHIE			English	Article								Over the last 30 years. changes in the East and Southeast Asian region have been fast and deep. China is the growth engine of a new regional production system which in turn has provoked changes in many other parts of the world. For its own fast growth. China has relied heavily oil importing intermediate products from neighbouring countries, but this is changing with China now producing more of its own inputs and occupying also the more skill intensive parts of the value chain. Some Countries in the region trade relatively little with China, but the trade itself may undermine long-term growth prospects.

Internal environment of an agricultural farm	AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA			English	Article						analysis; internal environment; value chain; strengths; weaknesses; plant production; livestock production		Zemspol, Desna, Ltd is a large corporation engaged in various aspects of agriculture in the Czech Republic, including agricultural production, the assembly, maintenance and repair of agricultural machinery, the production of feed stuffs and feed mixtures,special agricultural services demanding special entitlement, business related matters and accounting. This paper focuses on agricultural production. The farm manages 2 100 hectares of agricultural land suitable for growing potatoes, although the largest area is used for growing wheat. The range of produce remains constant. Regarding livestock, the corporation specializes in cattle with the steady head count 250 for the past 15 years. These are predominantly red and white cattle, optimized for both milk and meat production. The average annual production is 1350 000 litres of milk and 250 tons of beef. The agricultural farm can be described as being a strong perfomer with a very stable base, good reputation and very attractive products, both of crops and livestock. in order to keep this enviable status, frequent internal and external environmental analyses are undertaken.

S	Prentice, R		DeNeve, G; Peter, L; Pratt, J; Wood, DC		Prentice, Rebecca			LOOPING THE VALUE CHAIN: DESIGNER COPIES IN A BRAND-NAME GARMENT FACTORY	HIDDEN HANDS IN THE MARKET: ETHNOGRAPHIES OF FAIR TRADE, ETHICAL CONSUMPTION, AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY	Research in Economic Anthropology		English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter concerns itself with a garment factory in Trinidad, West Indies, producing brand-name clothing for the Eastern Caribbean market. Workers in this factory not only stitch garments for an hourly wage; but also stealthily operate a secondary assembly line, creating precise duplicates of the factory's products for themselves to take home and wear. Manufactured on the shop-floor alongside "legitimate'' production, the copied garments are identical in every way to the genuine ones they mimic. In this chapter, I argue that workers have created a "loop'' in the value chain: a simultaneous moment in which they are both producers and consumers of the factory's products. While "genuine'' garments circulate through market-capitalist networks of exchange, copied garments only circulate through social networks - thereby accruing and representing forms of "value'' that are distinct from market value. By looping the value chain, factory workers create non-market values alongside market-oriented ones, showing both sets of values to be interdependent. Workers' own commentary on these processes offers a unique window onto contested meanings of "value'' at work on the shop-floor.

J	Markendahl, J; Johnsson, M				Markendahl, Jan; Johnsson, Martin			Ambient networking and related business concepts as support for regulatory initiatives and competition	NETNOMICS			English	Article						Regulation and licensing; Spectrum management; SMP; Business roles; Roaming		It is envisaged that future internetworking technologies would continue to further the openness of interfaces and open up new business opportunities for new business players. An increased cooperation between different types of providers will result in improved service availability for end-users and in a potentially larger market for operators. This paper investigates in what way regulatory support is needed to support new business models and value chains. It also discusses whether the deployment of ambient networking concepts is supported by current regulation and if features of Ambient Networks can be identified among emerging networking and business concepts. Our view is that Ambient Networks concepts like network composition, dynamic roaming and new interfaces will enable the de-coupling of business roles of the traditionally vertically integrated value chain. This will enable increased cooperation both between operators as well as between operators and end-users. Other benefits of this kind of cooperation are that the risk associated with investments in own networks can be reduced and that barriers for new market entrants are lowered, hence this will support an increased competition.

Thus, traditional thinking is proving futile and newer methods are substituting the older ones. If one has to achieve developmental goals, one has to build a knowledge repository. Success of any system today is defined by its knowledge capital. For example for a university, knowledge is a key sustainable edge and Faculty/students are their key assets. Knowledge management (KM) can provide a university with an opportunity to integrate processes, facilitate collaboration, and form relationship across traditional organizational boundaries. It no longer stands that the most knowledgeable only will conquer; it has become that one who actually uses that knowledge will get the edge. KM provides the opportunities to rethink, recast and re-engineer. Present communication tries to build a framework for open universities to effectively use KM to maintain relationships with existing students and attracting new students, build high-valued knowledge assets, build a knowledge based value-chain to respond to the changing demands for education	[Saxena, Anurag] Indira Gandhi Natl Open Univ, Sch Management, Block 1,Room 4, New Delhi 110068, India		Saxena, A (corresponding author), Indira Gandhi Natl Open Univ, Sch Management, Block 1,Room 4, New Delhi 110068, India.	s0anurag@hotmail.com					Bacon Francis, 1597, MEDITATIONS SACRAE; Heinrichs JH, 2003, DECIS SUPPORT SYST, V35, P103, DOI 10.1016/S0167-9236(02)00098-2; Khare P, 2003, INDIAN J OPEN LEARNI, V12, P29; Khare Pankaj, 2003, 17 ANN C AS ASS OP U; Khare Pankaj, 2004, INDIAN J OPEN LEARNI, V13, P29; Kidwell J.

Electronic-manufacturing has been evolving for some time, but currently an effective planning framework to assist managers with implementing electronic-manufacturing planning is still lacking. A framework, built around three elements: the Balanced Scorecard, Quality Function Deployment and Value Chain Analysis, is proposed here to assist SMEs in managing complexity in e-manufacturing planning. A case study, carried out in Singapore, demonstrates the practicality and utility of the framework in the context of a real business environment.

J	Richardson, K				Richardson, K.			A perspective of marine mining within De Beers	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Hydraulic Transport of Solids	MAY, 2007	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	SAIMM, UK BHR Grp				Although the De Beers group has a long history of placer mining on land, the group only became actively involved in deep water marine diamond exploration and mining in 1983 with the formation of De Beers Marine. Full-scale commercial mining commenced around 1991. Since then, the group marine mining capability has grown into a formidable fleet of 8 large deep water (>70 m) mining vessels, as well as other special purpose geosurvey platforms. Marine diamond production by the group is expected to be just short of 1 million carats in 2006. De Beers operates across the entire value-chain spectrum from geology and geosurvey, through sampling to mining, and finally ore processing into high value concentrate. Supporting these operations involves significant service activities such as maintenance, security, logistics and environmental management. Specific challenges exist in terms of developing or acquiring appropriate technology for marine mining. These challenges have resulted in De Beers operating extensive in-house R&D and projects departments, as well as drawing extensively from technology partners. An array of computational and test facilities is also available to support R&D and projects activities. Hydrotransport in various guises is key to the current approaches to marine mining and ore processing. Use is made of airlift and centrifugal pumping for hydraulic hoisting of very coarse gravel, while splitters, launders, dewatering, elutriators, jet pumps, centrifugal pumps, dense medium circuits, pipeline systems, and instrumentation for coarse abrasive particles are used extensively in the ore processing plant.

J	Baard, V; Watts, T				Baard, Vicki; Watts, Ted			Breaking the Paradox of Innovation in Small Businesses through Sustaining and Disruptive Reinvention	AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Small business innovation; reinvention; innovation paradox		In 2005 Deloitte Research released a paper examining the phenomenon they refer to as the 'innovation paradox': the inability or reluctance of manufacturing firms to pursue strategies that build the operational capabilities necessary for innovation that will provide both profitability and growth. The report claims that this is due to the rapidly increasing complexity of global markets and the lack of synchronising innovation efforts across their value chain, thus positioning the problem as an important contemporary issue. While the research did not specifically target small and medium enterprises, the implications for this business sector are considerable given their substantial contribution to global economies and their high failure rates in the first three to five years of operation. While not questioning the data in the Deloitte research, this paper does question the assumption that the phenomenon is irreversible and the apparent underlying self-fulfilling prophecy with respect to small to medium enterprises. To demonstrate this the authors draw on a case study of a small manufacturing company in rural New South Wales, Australia, which operated between 1889 and 1983, to show that the breaking of the innovation paradox was successfully achieved by this firm in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Applying the case study to the Deloitte model the study demonstrates contemporary similarities by overlaying the Laycock history on the successes / failures identified by Deloitte.

SERIOUS BUSINESS BEYOND TOURISM: ATTRACTING AND RETAINING HIGH VALUE LOW IMPACT INDUSTRIES TO REGIONAL ECONOMIES	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article								This paper identifies and discusses six challenges of a global knowledge-based economy for regional areas based on the experience of Noosa Shire in southern Queensland, Australia. The challenges pertain to: 1) realistic perspectives within the wider Australian and regional economies, 2) redirection away from traditional approaches regarding co-location and product orientation, 3) creation of crossindustry/sectoral innovations and networks, 4) building on current strengths and moving them upstream or downstream from the traditional value chain, 5) the advantages of highvalue/low-volume/low-impact/low-effort new business opportunities, and 6) building the evidence base that is required for high-value/low-volume/high-yield/low-impact economic growth. Networks of cooperation within and between regions are essential for provincial areas that are highly dependent on small business enterprises.

J	Carruthers, J; Rod, M; Ashill, NJ				Carruthers, Janet; Rod, Michel; Ashill, Nicholas J.			Purchaser-provider interaction in UK public health: improving stakeholder cooperation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND HEALTHCARE MARKETING			English	Article						Stakeholder analysis; Partnership; Health services; Suppliers; Public health; United Kingdom		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the bases of positive relations between suppliers and purchasers of healthcare services. In doing so, it examines the nature of cooperation between the providers of healthcare services (hospitals) and those who commission and purchase healthcare on behalf of patients (regional health authorities) and makes specific recommendations as to how cooperation can be better realized. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs a qualitative interview approach for gathering and analyzing major stakeholder (provider and purchaser) perceptions of their interorganizational relations and how these interactions impact on the quest of the healthcare provider to meet the needs of the community they serve. Findings - The paper identifies and groups relevant variables into four major themes or "core categories" that characterize purchaser-provider stakeholder cooperation. These themes represent provider and purchaser views on those factors characterising stakeholder relationships within the purchaser-provider dyad. This is followed by a number of suggestions as to how to improve the nature of cooperation between these stakeholders. Practical implications - Extending practitioners' understanding of the nature of these inter-related factors may lead to better insights of how interorganizational relations and partnerships might be managed more proactively throughout the healthcare value chain. Strategies to foster stakeholder cooperation are also suggested. Originality/value - In the extant literature, there is a paucity of research that has illustrated multi-stakeholder perspectives in the public sector. This paper explores the perceptions of two main stakeholders in public healthcare to map and assess management issues influencing purchaser-provider cooperation.

Lenny			A study on building of a common gateway for secure exchange and transmission of electronic business message	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Electronic commerce; Internet; Electronic data interchange; Value chain; Supply chain management		Purpose - To present a research model attempting to build an innovative common gateway complaint with Rosettanet Standards for the secure message exchange between electronic businesses under this age of internet economy. The use of Rosettanet Standards is to achieve the effectiveness and efficiency of message exchange and consequently gain mutual benefits by means of agile response for cross-organizational co-operation. Design/methodology/approach - The common service gateway is modeled by taking the advantages of transmission comply with the standard model specified by RosettaNet among business trading partners involved in supply chain system. A prototyping system compliant with the model presented is built and installed as a gateway interface of digital firms and seamlessly integrate to the firm's backend information system to conduct the message exchange with its business trading partners. The prototype is also implemented to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposal of innovative model. Findings - Through the practical experiment, the service model provided can really assist the firms using this service gateway to conduct its peer trading partners with having same gateway installed may streamline their flow of business data and create a higher value of supply chain between them in terms of communication and operation costs. Research limitations/implications - More experiments and trials of the prototyping system need to be conducted in different test cases in order to make a concrete conclusion of this paper. Practical implications - The adoption of international standard model is easier to implement a supply chain system and the business value is also can be achieved if the electronic data exchange is carried over the internet. Originality/value - The system model presented in this paper can be a valuable reference for further similar development to build an electronic business to achieve the low cost, high efficiency, high security message exchange for digital firms at this internet era.

In this context, Italy seems to be squeezed between these new competitors specialised on traditional sectors and the difficulties of entering new high tech industries. This paper focuses on the strategic industrial policy options that Italy may have to guarantee its future capacity of producing wealth by participating in the transnational value chain, without being progressively marginalised. With this premise, we present the case of the genetic research sector in the Emilia Romagna region (Italy). We focus on this sector firstly because of the great potentialities it has recently been showing; secondly because its development could be an example of how to encourage the structural adjustment of an 'Old Europe' region looking for answers to new international challenges; thirdly because the region has a latent knowledge pool in genetics that does not seem to be properly exploited.

The economic and financial problems in which B2B marketplaces occurred have stressed the difficulties of their transaction-based business models, while the low value of e-commerce over the years can be explained in terms of firms' indifference in using electronic networks as new commercial channels. Instead, such emphasis on emerging technology solutions, mainly based on the Web, to connect firms with its customers, suppliers and partners increases firm's opportunities of interaction within its value chain. From a knowledge-based perspective, firms are discovering a completely different scenario and new drivers for their competitiveness, based on a renovated use of ICT to manage distributed business processes. Opposite to the e-commerce value proposition focused on spot efficiency of electric transactions, firms refer to ICT to enhance their established networks of business-to-business relationships.

End-to-end reconfigurability will help operators better exploit their investments on infrastructures and terminals and should ensure that the infrastructure will be flexible and reconfigurable to accommodate evolving standards, applications, and end-user needs. End-to-end reconfigurability is seen by many in the wireless industry as a core technology to enable the full potential of beyond 3G systems. It has the potential to revolutionize wireless just as the PC revolutionized computing. This article introduces the overall End-to-End Reconfigurability ((ER)-R-2) project system research, then focuses on the business perspectives of end-to-end reconfigurability, introducing the Business Systems Architecture Process (BSAP) methodology and the business architecture model. The business use cases investigated by the (ER)-R-2 research project and, in particular, the flexible spectrum management scenario, are presented as well as the proposed architecture and device model. Finally, the unified business model (UBM) for reconfigurable systems and its main business roles are depicted.

However, the numerous possible configurations of mobile networks complicated the dynamic deployment of mobile applications. Therefore, research is intensely seeking a set-vice provisioning framework that is technology-independent, supports multiple wireless network technologies, and can interwork high-level service management tasks to network management operations. This paper presents an open value chain paradigm, a model for downloadable applications and a mediating platform for service provisioning in beyond 3G mobile settings. Furthermore, we introduce mechanisms that support a coupled interaction between service deployment and network configuration operations, focusing on the dynamic provisioning of QoS state to data path devices according to the requirements of dynamically downloadable mobile value-added services (VAS).

J	Trondsen, T; Matthiasson, T; Young, JA				Trondsen, T; Matthiasson, T; Young, JA			Towards a market-oriented management model for straddling fish stocks	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						fisheries behaviour; fisheries management; straddling fish stocks; market orientation; RFMO; law of the sea	ORIENTATION; FISHERIES; SURIMI	Management of straddling fish stocks has been noted for its political complexity. Negotiations frequently falter as each party seeks to focus upon their own individual and shorter-term, goals than the collective interest of the sector. Entrenched positions are often only deepened as new entrants participate to establish their own claims to any emergent share of resource. Unsurprisingly, deadlocks are common and typically compromises are reached only after the real period of biological then economic crisis has passed. Examples to illustrate this tendency can be found in most of the world's oceans and is writ large within the current impasse over blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) in the North Atlantic. The development of this fishery is discussed and it is shown that despite the scope to add value to the resource base through a pattern of exploitation focussed more upon human consumption than fish meal and oil, there seems little incentive to extricate participants from the cycle of demise that has engulfed negotiations so far. In an attempt to consider how such seemingly intractable problems might be resolved, attention is next turned to the construction of a new model for resource management specifically intended to contend with the problems thrown up by straddling stocks. Central to this is the need to ensure motivation and incentivisation of value chain members in both national economic zones and international waters. It is proposed that a Multinational Resource Cooperative (MRC) is established and would be the key element in the management model. The MRC, on behalf of the national stakeholders, would auction quota so that fish enterprises call purchase quota units defined in terms of species, quantity, catch area and the time of catch. The MRC would also be financed through a quota auction fee as explained below and arrange its own quota control and enforcement services. By auctioning rights to stakeholders the MRC will enable control and enforcement of the TAC; allocations of fair national shares of resource and critically, motivate fish enterprises to devise and implement market-oriented value adding strategies. Adoption of such a scheme should result in a more efficient use of the remaining straddling stocks whilst there is still time to do so. Importantly, the proposed rent distribution mechanism would also shift the focus of negotiations from being dominated by quotas and access rights to more evident pecuniary metrics.

Much of the focus of research to date has been on the individual firm. However, there has been a shift from interfirm competition to interdestination competition, resulting in a lacuna in the research and a need for more attention to be afforded to management of quality at the destination level. Given the fragmented and diverse nature of the tourism destination, many researchers have underlined the need for co-operation in any effort to improve quality at the destination. However, there is often a reluctance among tourism businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs) to cooperate. This paper sheds light on the impact of training on interfirm dynamics within a destination quality management network. The findings revealed that training of network members influenced the development of a referral system, which in turn helped to create a tourism quality value chain for the visitor.

J	Zademach, HM; Knogler, M; Haas, HD				Zademach, Hans-Martin; Knogler, Monika; Haas, Hans-Dieter			On the exploitation of modular production networks: Potential, limitations and spatial implications using the example of the semiconductor industry	GEOGRAPHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			German	Article								Against the background of Sturgeon's (2002) concept of value chain modularity, the paper explores the extent to which the ongoing transformation in the semiconductor industry is fostering a new model of industrial organisation. The empirical investigation focuses on (1) the governance structure of production networks; (2) the corporate strategic objectives of the firms involved, especially the management of innovation and standardisation processes including their spatial implications; and (3) the spatial and social embeddedness of the network partners. The findings indicate that at specific interfaces of the value chain, particularly between semiconductor design companies ('fabless' cooperations) and contract producers (foundries), modular characteristics are, in fact, a distinct feature of industrial organisation. Nevertheless, a paradigmatic shift as postulated by Sturgeon is not to be expected, since the actors insist on the advantages of spatial agglomeration when it comes to the coordination of complex processes; moreover, economic incentives were detected that encourage the rejection of standardisation as a key precondition of modularity.

The legislations and responsibilities of government, industry and consumer were discussed based on the balance of benefit and responsibility depending on the realization of their benefits in the whole life cycle of products and its status in the whole value chain. Not only the legislation and establishment of the so called "compulsory discarding system" will be a possible and effective solution to the difficulty of the obsolete collection and recycling for obsolete electric and electronic reclaiming industry, but also the education and dissemination. Education and dissemination were discussed as an important role which will emphasize the adjusting of policy and law on the development of electric and electronic industry production and its reclaiming. The education of stockholders' environmental responsibility and the advocating of responsibility sharing should be implement for industry and consumer. Chinese EEE industry should emphasize the control of natural source, and should implement the environmental benign design in their production, such as design for dismantling, no dismantling, thermal treatment and green design. The perspectives for the way to advocate a harmonic society for Chinese people were described.

Several opportunities related to health care exist for the IHS: potential public and private collaborations, continuation of the Clinton Administration's legacy of meaningful tribal consultation, and increasing the numbers of American Indian physicians, nurses, and other health related professionals. Modifications in federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid pose a serious threat to the IHS because the IHS relies, on these. programs to offset the overall lack of funding. This article provides a framework for identifying the ways in which the external environment affects and determines the IHS' strategic responses to ensure competitiveness within the U.S. health care market. Value chain analysis will be used to evaluate the competitive advantages and disadvantages of them current IHS internal environment.

However, effective information integration practices are not well understood; measures of information integration outcomes are not adequately presented either. This paper classifies effective information integration practices into technological and organisational aspects and identifies technological and organisational outcome measures that correspond to technological and organisational practices.

But in most cases, this effort is done to target a non-disabled population which ensures economical incomes for the content and service providers, content owners, manufacturers and other actors of the value chain of the Internet, mobile and TV services, forgetting the social benefits derived from the use of technologies to include all people. But on the other hand, disabled people require the same opportunities in this field - an equal access to the Information Society - as the non-disabled. This paper presents the difficulties of the disabled collectives to enter the Information Society - the Internet, mobile and TV services - focusing on the audiovisual services and the technologies and adaptations to ensure this inclusion. This paper also defines an accessibility reference model architecture, including the different technologies, to ensure an end-to-end accessible system in a convergent environment. This architectural model provides the means to integrate different technologies for tailoring the information and allowing interaction with the system for people with disabilities. The aim of this architectural model is to be a step towards an Information Society for all.

J	Nagy, E				Nagy, E			Transition and polarisation: Advanced producer services in the emerging regional (Market) economies	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article								This article is focused on role of advanced I producer services in regional development in emerging market economies. The starting point of the analysis is Porter's concept on competitive advantage of regions that rests on the performance of local firms. The APS sector is discussed as a significant element of the value chain, supporting the adaptation of local agents to the emerging system market regulations and the rapid structural changes of the national, regional and local markets in Hungary. Although, empirical studies as well as statistical calculations suggested that, flexible strategies employed by service providers contributed to economic growth in regions embedded in global production systems, the national economy was basically dichotomised by the spatial centralisation of APSs.

COLLABORATION IN E-BUSINESS: TECHNOLOGY AND STRATEGY	MANAGING BUSINESS INTERFACES: MARKETING AND ENGINEERING ISSUES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND INTERNET DOMAINS	International Series in Quantitive Marketing		English	Article; Book Chapter							SUPPLY-CHAIN	With constantly improving information technology, it has become feasible, and in many cases a competitive necessity, to outsource not only component and systems production, but also portions of design. This has led companies to narrow their focus on fewer business processes in a value-chain. To effectively manage the resulting globally distributed system, collaboration among supply chain partners is critical. Collaboration enables sharing of data, processes, and resources, enhancing compatibility between organizations. Some of the areas where companies may collaborate with suppliers are, information visibility, logistics management, production planning, product development, and resource sharing. Collaboration with customers, on the other hand, is largely aimed at revenue enhancement, demand management, order fulfillment, and customer acquisition. Technologies that enable different aspects of collaboration include, access, data sharing, application sharing, process sharing, and free-form interaction. In this chapter we discuss (1) how collaboration creates value in different business contexts with different strategic implications, (2) how online technologies facilitate collaboration, (3) how an optimal technology portfolio can be to chosen for investment, and (4) how a technology portfolio can be deployed. Our objective is to develop an approach for need based selective collaboration with partners.

S	Colombo, E; Mylopoulos, J; Spoletini, P		Benatallah, B; Casati, F; Traverso, P		Colombo, E; Mylopoulos, J; Spoletini, P			Modeling and analyzing context-aware composition of services	SERVICE-ORIENTED COMPUTING - ICSOC 2005, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing	DEC 12-15, 2005	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	IBM, Hewlett Packard, Univ Tilburg, Univ Trento, Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NICTA, ITC irst, ACM SIGWeb, SIGSoft				Service-oriented modeling and analysis is a promising approach to manage context-aware cooperation among organizations belonging to the same value chain. Following this approach, a value chain is modeled as a composition of services provided by different partners and coordinated in a way that their interactions can be reorganized according to changes in the environment. However, so far, most of the research work in this area has been focused on the design of architectures handling service discovery, compatibility and orchestration. Little attention has been given to the specification and verification of context-aware composition of services during the requirement engineering process. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap through a methodological approach based on the strict coupling between a social and a process model. The methodology is discussed through a simple example.

J	Corfu, A; Kastenholz, E				Corfu, Adriana; Kastenholz, Elisabeth			The Opportunities and Limitations of the Internet in Providing a Quality Tourist Experience: The Case of "Solares de Portugal"	JOURNAL OF QUALITY ASSURANCE IN HOSPITALITY & TOURISM			English	Article						Internet; website effectiveness; quality tourist experience; Portuguese manor houses		It is more than a decade since hyped stories about the impact of Internet Technology in the tourism industry have caused much of a stir in the minds of academics, practitioners and public policy makers, among others. Most of the discourses figured throughout around the theme painted pictures of a myriad shades and hues of the days to come. Internet-based marketing and e-commerce are two major, interrelated areas of development impacting the sector. The former reduces information asymmetry between tourists and ultimate service providers in destinations. The latter was predicted to eliminate intermediaries who are either information brokers or those guaranteeing services at the destination. This is true all the more in an environment where tourism is a global industry (with some part of the value chain in the country of origin of the tourist and the remaining in the countries that are destinations) and extremely dependent on information and communication industries. Today, the consumer has more information to make decisions and to access sellers globally, with almost real-time market information providing him with new quality service and experience. With this fundamental power shift of producers to consumers, the way in which marketers think needs to adapt (Corfu, Laranja & Costa, 2003). This paper is focused on the case-study "Solares de Portugal" and basically aims to find out: (1) the importance given by the manor house owners to specific features of travel-related websites' design and their global evaluation of the "Solares de Portugal" website; (2) the perceptions of Internet users on the before mentioned features' website effectiveness as well as their global evaluation of the "Solares de Portugal" website; (3) the correspondence between the two perspectives. The study has provided conclusive evidence about the relevance of efficient website services, as well as other practically employable findings. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that society is becoming more familiar with technology, in particular with the PCs and the Internet. This means that the travel industry has now the opportunity to deploy the Web in a more accurate, agile and innovative way. The tourist experience begins with its planning and anticipation stage (Liebman Parrinello, 1993) in the context of which the Internet may provide new quality experiences. From the perspective of the demand side, this may lead to new opportunities of improving the quality of operations and services through the Internet. However, further research will be necessary to dig deeper into those business implications. (C) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Thomas, R; Speight, R; Kennedy, P; Panck, K				Thomas, R; Speight, R; Kennedy, P; Panck, K			Design and manufacture of discrete components	PLASTICS RUBBER AND COMPOSITES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Biennial Polymer Process Engineering International Meeting	JUL 05-06, 2005	Univ Bradford, Bradford, ENGLAND		Univ Bradford	product lifecycle management; supply chain management; value chain management; real-time performance management		The use of computers in product design and manufacturing today is accepted as normal working practice, the benefits are very clear, as the present study will show, but often the solutions available have a high degree of fragmentation, and are often described as being 'vertically fragmented'. These systems are often supplied from many sources, with poor infrastructure for sharing information which contributes to the fragmentation. The present study presents a vision that provides solutions to design, process and production optimisation, and also provides a high level of integration that has often been the missing link between existing systems. This integration takes the form of sharing technology and information, thus enabling the decision process to be carried out in a well informed manner. Product conceptualisation, product design, component design and component manufacture are key stages in product development that should be considered as part of a product lifecycle management (PLM) plan. During these stages, it is important to consider the whole product life cycle: (i) customers, who will have to spend the most time with a product; (ii) manufacturing, people who have to fabricate and assemble the product, so 'design for assembly' is very important; (iii) maintenance, these people will be involved in preventive maintenance or repair work, either at the point of sales or on location, so ensure their processes and tasks are as easy as possible, avoid any obstacles; and (iv) recycle-ability, this is an important consideration; how a product can be re-used needs to evaluated in the design process, to meet the increasing demands of legislation. Competitive pressures, rising labour and material costs continuously force manufacturers to reduce time to market, decrease part cost, maximise capacity utilisation and production efficiencies while maintaining and improving product quality. These are just the facts of life in today's economy. The plastics industry faces the same constraints that impact all manufacturers. What differentiates companies now is how they respond to these constraints. The manufacturing process involves more than the immediate factory; the full supply chain management and resource management have to be considered. Automation and optimisation is the way forward. The present study will show that the manufacture of discrete components should be considered as a function of product development and not in isolation; there are many factors and people to consider in the design process. The technologies outlined in the present study are linked by a common vision and philosophy that is to facilitate the ability to manufacture products that are friendly to use, meet the economic factors, and are made by manufacturing processes that are easy to control. This is an approach towards product development that promotes and stimulates success.

The migration of telecom assets to the Internet redefines the value-chain of this industry. Upcoming separation of transport networks and services increases the value of ownership of the subscriberinformation-base and service authorization. Thus, we need to re-estimate the assets and in particular the value of the physical access line compared to the value of the subscriber-Information-base.

It discusses the development, the deployment and the use of an integrated mediation platform, within the context of digital television (DTV), able to support modern applications and innovative services, towards promoting an effective convergence effect between telecommunications, broadcasting and information technology (IT). The system solution transforms the traditional value chain of the media sector and introduces a new mediator role that will coordinate the whole market by reducing the current 'gap' between demand and supply forces. It promotes a new framework to sufficiently support the dynamic value constellation form or organisation. We also discuss the system architecture as well as the functional components and their particular role and functionalities. In addition, we investigate the arising opportunities for the provision of four different interactive multimedia services (that is, chatting/messaging, voting, alerting and content recommendations) developed according to the global Multimedia Home Platform (MHP) standard in parallel with the major original options promoted by the system itself. Furthermore, we evaluate possible business benefits for various categories of market players involved, and conclude with estimations for further future development.

J	Borman, M				Borman, M			Inter-organisational infrastructure and industry value: a case study of the Australian travel sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inter-organisational infrastructure; industry value; common activities; travel	INFORMATION	Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) have long been seen as a catalyst for organisational change. By enhancing the flow of information it becomes possible for an organisation to buy-in an increased number of activities rather than perform them internally. Moving beyond a focus on the individual organisation, it is argued here that ICTs also suport the provision of common applications, or services - referred to as inter-organisational infrastructures - to groups of organisations that operate at a similar point in the value chain. A case study of distribution in the Australian travel sector suggests that many such infrastructures exist and may have a potentially significant impact upon the distribution of value in an industry.

J	Lehtonen, J; Lehtonen, L				Lehtonen, J; Lehtonen, L			Differentiation in pulp and paper business	PAPERI JA PUU-PAPER AND TIMBER			English	Article								Pulp is not a commodity product. Each pulp has specific characteristics created by fiber morphology retained from the wood raw material. The increase in the amount of pulp wood species used in market pulp production has expanded the pulp fiber palette significantly. Today there are 4050 different market pulps, which represent significantly different fiber morphologies. Through the optimal use of the fiber morphology obtained from various globally available pulps, papermakers are able to significantly affect their cost, quality, and productivity. In addition, through the significant effect fiber has on the cost and quality of the paper products, the global fiber palette concept can also serve as an efficient tool for product differentiation in the market pulp business. An understanding of the quality and cost effects of their pulps on the whole papermaking value chain can give pulp producers the opportunity to target, various customer segments in which their fiber provides the best benefits, and ultimately use the full differentiation potential: "to persuade people to consume a product without having to lower its price."

J	Crane, JA; Fleming, GF				Crane, JA; Fleming, GF			Improving information flows in the sugar industry supply chain: The Mackay Sugar web portal	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article								In 2000-2001, Mackay Sugar adopted a multi-pronged strategy to rationalise its four mills' field operations, incorporating satellite estimating, a 'call centre' approach to field communications, and an interactive Internet web portal to facilitate information flow between growers, harvesting contractors and mills. This paper outlines the strategy and focuses on the design and implementation of the web portal. A web portal is a web site that provides a group of individuals sharing a common purpose with access to the tools, information, and communications they need. The Mackay Sugar portal performs these functions for the members of the sugar industry supply chain. Key processes in this development were: consultation with supply chain members for requirements definition; design and construction of the portal to meet performance targets; training; and facilitation and extension to gain acceptance of the technology. The portal has been operating for two seasons and now incorporates a sophisticated GIS-based interface. This paper analyses the benefits of the site and discusses its potential application to regional value chain management in the sugar industry.

J	Sun, TS; Li, GP; Lu, MH				Sun Tie-shan; Li Guo-ping; Lu Ming-hua			STUDY ON BEIJING'S EMERGING MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIAL CLUSTER AND ITS POLICY IMPLICATIONS	CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						industrial cluster; Mobile Communication Industry; multinationals; Beijing		This paper is a preliminary and illustrative case study of Beijing's emerging mobile communication industrial (MCI) cluster, which helps understand the cluster by qualitative analysis and description. Beijing's MCI cluster is emerging as far as the competence of the industry and its spatial concentration are concerned, although it is not the type of the cluster described by PORTER due to the low competence of indigenous firms. The formation of the cluster can be explained by means of the factor and demand conditions of Beijing. However, it is mostly determined by the multinationals that promote the growth of the industry and the formation of the cluster, and by the government that also plays a key role in many ways. As a matter of fact, the interaction between the multinationals and the local government is the key to understanding the formation of the cluster. All in all, Beijing's emerging MCI cluster is a value-chain, geographically concentrated but non-localized cluster, which is highly dominated by the multinationals and the local government. Its special characteristics bear some policy implications as to the change of the roles of the local government and the localization of muhinationals, etc.	[Sun Tie-shan; Li Guo-ping; Lu Ming-hua] Peking Univ, Sch Govt, Dept Urban & Reg Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China		Sun, TS (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Govt, Dept Urban & Reg Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.						*BEIJ MUN COMM S T, 2001, ANN REP BEIJ HIGH TE; Birkinshaw Julian, 2000, INT STUDIES MANAGEME, V30; FESER EJ, 2000, TARGETING OPPORTUNIT; [李国平 Li Guoping], 2002, [地理科学, Scientia Geographica Sinica], V22, P263; Li Guoping, 2002, GEOGRAPHICAL RES, V21; PORTER M.

DRL started its operation by leveraging strong process engineering skills. With India signing the WTO agreement and strengthening the IPR, DRL has firmed up its molecular discovery plans. The small size of the domestic market has made the company turn to the international markets through exports, acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures. The focus of DRL has been on achieving leadership in the Indian market through innovation and at the same time capitalising on the opportunities prevalent in the global market place. DRL has moved up the value chain by placing greater emphasis on its finished dosage market to gradually emerge as an important player in this segment. The major driver of growth has been the long term vision to dominate the market through innovation.

J	Kaderabkova, A				Kaderabkova, A			Structure and performance of technology intensive trade of candidate countries	POLITICKA EKONOMIE			Czech	Article						structural change; specialization; technology intensity; fragmentation of value chain		Trade performance of EU-candidate countries in 1996 - 2000 is assessed in terms of specialization deepening and widening. The process of technology catching-up is analyzed from quantitative and qualitative aspects. The former stresses the tendency towards increasing geography and product concentration, which brings higher sensitivity to industry specific external demand shocks, the latter points to the limited skills and technology intensities within the segments of international production value chains located in the EU-candidate countries. The remarkable technology catch-up visible in trade statistics therefore mostly relies on external sources of knowledge and technology, as the innovation capacity in transition economies remains low. Without an adequate development of national knowledge and technology base the potential of qualitative spillovers accompanying FDI remains limited and the (cost-based) comparative advantage turns out to be rather short-lived.

The success of this move depends on efficient and reliable management of the business processes that will drive the e-Market's value-chain. Efficiency can only be achieved through automation. Reliability will be achieved by reliable and dependable process management systems. These electronic trans-corporate processes cover the range from basic business transactions, workflows to sophisticated business processes that rely on a high level of personalisation. Management of these processes requires safety critical computer systems that can survive local catastrophes. Multi-agent systems have this level of dependability and personalisation. An analysis of the full range of processes is followed by an implementation framework for their management using a powerful multiagent architecture.

For doing this, the executives of 20 companies were interviewed and asked about the strengths and weaknesses they thought their companies had. The responses were classified according to the elements of the value chain and new sub-classifications were created. In this way, it was possible to discover the main concerns the executives had about their company and to see if there were some comonality in their responses. It was found that the main concerns were in the areas of Production and Sales, as opposed to Finances, Human Resources, Technology and Procurement. As a result, a proposition is made about the use of this value chain and its dimensions as a way for rapid internal assessment of a manufacturing firm. A case study is presented in which the developed tool was implemented. An internal analysis of a company was undertaken in few hours.

J	Milford, BJ				Milford, BJ			Value chains in the Australian sugar industry: An assessment and initial study	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article								This paper defines the concept of a value chain and looks at its applicability in the sugar industry. A value chain achieves vertical integration of businesses through joint strategic planning, transparency, trust and respect. Value chains have a number of benefits: they reduce transaction costs and allow businesses access to new resources. These have application in the sugar industry. Interviews were conducted with millers, growers and harvesters in a small number of mill areas, and with marketers and logistics providers to assess the current state of the sugar industry value chains. It was found that, compared with other Australian agribusinesses, the sugar industry scored lowly in the areas of awareness, trust, efficiency, transparency and rewards. Priorities for industry action are suggested if the benefits of value chains are to be realised.

The longitudinal study explains how the company developed quality improvement initiatives based on cooperation with customers and suppliers. The importance of the case is due mainly, to the original approach taken by the company, on turning its business around through quality improvement initiatives in the external value chain, especially towards direct customers. Data were collected during nine years, from the 1992 privatisation until early 2001. Data included interviews with managers, observations, and documents. The case provides empirical support for ideas underlying quality initiatives across the value chain, customer response strategies, and the use of knowledge as a source of competitive advantage.

J	Wright, JD				Wright, JD			No easy answers: Research and innovation for the forestry sector	FORESTRY CHRONICLE			English	Article						research and development; innovation; research institutes; forest sector; competitive advantage; pre-competitive research; platform technologies; government; highly qualified personnel		The Canadian Forest Sector is at a crossroads. Compared with its best global competitors, the sector's returns have been low. Its propensity to operate at the commodity end of the spectrum, coupled with an intense focus on cost cutting, has raised serious questions as to the long-term viability of research and technology as part of an innovation process. Stated provocatively, the question is "Does this sector need research? Why? For what?" And yet the evidence is clear. For sustainable growth and healthy balance sheets, more attention is needed on initiatives to add value, to move up the value chain, and to benefit from a more strategic focus on proprietary technological advantage. Too much reliance on suppliers, alone, for technology cannot yield sustainable leadership through innovation. Appropriate partnerships with technology providers ranging from universities, research institutes and suppliers, coupled with an in-house focus on innovative new products can lead to marketplace competitiveness. To balance needed industry investments, appropriate participation from governments at all levels can ensure that public policy-driven technology change can achieve societal goals in concert with achieving and maintaining industry competitiveness. Research institutes are key partners here with their focus on translating science into technology applied at the mill level. An environment that will attract highly qualified personnel into a sector often seen as less exciting than others more visibly tied to the information age will only occur when industry is seen to be highly supportive of innovation as a competitive force. The challenges are great but the potential returns are far higher if industry and government join forces to foster a truly innovative forest sector.

J	Waldman, JD; McCullough, G				Waldman, JD; McCullough, G			A calculus of unnecessary echoes: Application of management principles to health care	PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						learning curves; clinical pathways; reimbursement; pediatric cardiology		We studied the clinical utility of echocardiography in children and applied principles of business management to draw conclusions that are applicable to health care in general. A significant number (13% in this series) of expensive medical diagnostic tests could be avoided without harm to patients. Cost reduction in medicine is possible in many situations without compromising quality of care. Care pathways (i.e., practice guidelines or clinical algorithms) provide one useful modality. However, for the safety of patients, all cost reduction methods must start with practicing physicians (or involve them at conceptualization) and an escape clause must be available to the treating physician for the atypical patient. The analytic approach used-concurrent assessment of percentage cost, charge, and payor-is applicable to all components of the health care value chain. The use of "percentage of charges" as an indicator of collection effectiveness is unrealistic and should be changed to "percentage potential reimbursement" because health care is effectively a fixed-reimbursement industry rather than a system subject to standard microeconomic (supply and demand) forces. The current reimbursement structure provides conflicting incentives both to health care institutions and to providers, creating an insurmountable barrier to any effective incentive system. Colloquy between practicing physicians and experts in operations management will stimulate cost reduction and can optimize the delivery of health care.

J	Hamel, O; Eschbach, JM				Hamel, O; Eschbach, JM			Potential impact of the Clean Development Mechanism on the future of tree crops	OCL-OLEAGINEUX CORPS GRAS LIPIDES			French	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Tree Crops Under Threat	NOV 05-09, 2001	COTE IVOIRE			carbon; Kyoto; rubber; valorisation; heveaculture		For several years now, most policies hove tended to speak of "clean" and "sustainable" development. Of all the international agreements, only the Internation Convention on Climate Change, with its Kyoto Protocol, attempts to bring in original financial mechanisms based on market dynamics allowing the additional costs of such an approach to be covered. On the eve of COP 7, this paper describes the current state of the negotiations relative to procedures for implementing the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); then, taking an example from tree crops, it goes on to analyse the application of eligibility criteria to natural rubber cultivation, taking into account the carbon balance of the natural rubber commodity chain in relation to synthetic rubber production. The potential impact of utilizing carbon (be it sequestrated or not emitted) in the economic strategy of the natural rubber commodity chain is then discussed, Lastly, lessons are also drawn for the other tree crops.

J	Lim, SJ; Bae, YJ				Lim, SJ; Bae, YJ			Political economy of industrial transformation: The LCD and footwear industries in South Korea and Taiwan	ISSUES & STUDIES			English	Article						LCD (liquid-crystal display); footwear; commodity chain; industrial transformation; South Korea; Taiwan		This paper compares the industrial transformation processes of the LCD (liquid-crystal display) and footwear industries in South Korea and Taiwan by situating the state, local capital, and transnational capital on an equal footing and examining the relative strength of these actors across time. To understand the interplay of the three actors and their shifting balance of power, we follow the commodity chain perspective and define industrial transformation as a process of moving to a higher value-added chain in the global production network. The paper argues that statist arguments that privilege the role of the state vis-a-vis transnational and local capital in the process of industrial transformation need to be modified in order to incorporate a dynamic and changing power balance among the three actors, especially, in the current context of globalization and liberalization in world economic activities.

New players that offer integrated service packages without having a transport infrastructure provide the commercial drive towards integrated service packages of (converged) voice, data and multimedia services. Furthermore, it is realised that no single (vertically integrated) operator can offer the full range of services as the incumbent operators do today. Hence, a decomposition of the industry in (business) roles is envisaged in which numerous parties will each play a confined role in the value chain of the integrated service offering by providing communications services-on wholesale basis-to each other. The large impact that this new industry structure has on the network architecture is characterised by two network design principles: decoupling of responsibilities through the introduction of a telecommunication ecosystem of interacting business roles and decoupling of service intelligence and transport to enable separation between network and service provisioning. This paper describes how these new design principles lead to a framework for designing the new data/IP infrastructures. An example is demonstrated.									*TEL INF NETW ARCH, 1997, TINA BUS MOD REF POI	1	1	1	0	1	INST BRIT TELECOMMUN ENG	LONDON	POST POINT 2 D05, THE ANGEL CENTER, 403 JOHN ST, LONDON EC1V 4PL, ENGLAND	1470-5826			J INST BRIT TELECOMM	J.

J	Sanchez, FM; Doyague, MFM				Sanchez, FM; Doyague, MFM			Information technology as a source of competitive advantage in the glass container industry: the case of Spain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS & PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						information technology; competitive advantage; glass container industry; Spain		This article describes how information technology (IT) can be a source of competitive advantage in the glass container industry in Spain. To this end, the crucial structural features of the industry are first considered, showing that it is a mature, highly competitive industry in which there is a combination of continuous production and flexible (batch) systems. As a result, it is clear that there is a need to bring together principles traditionally seen as opposed, such as flexibility and low costs. Study of the value chain of the industry leads to the conclusion that the most crucial activity, because of its impact on costs, is operational activity (production). Concentrating on the impact of IT on this shows that it is a source of competitive advantage to the extent that it: (a) allows quality cost reduction by avoiding internal and external failures, through use of CAD in container design; (b) favours innovation and differentiation of container design; (c) reduces direct production costs (costs of raw material and energy for melting), through CAM; (d) permits integration of production and related activities in computing terms through CIM; and (e) allows the building up of specific internal knowledge, based on computing, which competitors find hard to imitate, leading to a greater competitive edge through internal know-how.

This article follows the theme that a large enough quantitative change becomes a qualitative change. The change will be felt in all sectors but this article focuses on the packaged consumer goods industry. Pressures on manufacturers to show real value for money have never been stronger. Brand loyalty is being eroded as buying power diminishes while store-brands and economy labels exploit increasing price sensitivity. In consequence, today's brand leaders must seek radical ways to differentiate their products, provide consistent quality, speed up product innovation, and target their markets. Such improvements will require greater customer intimacy, deeper understanding of the market and faster reactions. To achieve this, 'information intensity' will be applied to logistics, marketing, production and distribution. Low-cost, high-power computing is the enabler. It will catalyse new thinking about the core business processes and the frontiers of the value chain and herald the 'virtual company'.	CSC INDEX, PARIS, FRANCE								Armistead C.

Four linked objectives are identified - raising productivity, creating employment, reviving investment and improving trade performance. Meeting these objectives will require a change in strategic focus which will require industry to move up the value chain, to reduce the cost of its output, to target the determinants of competitive production and to redistribute income and power relations. Industrial policies are identified to assist this strategic restructuring by enabling markets to function more effectively and to build industrial capabilities in part through a process of institution building. The key roles of industrial relations and tripartite negotiations are identified as part of this process of institutional development.

The key strategic task is to reconfigure roles and relationships among a constellation of actors - suppliers, business partners, customers - in order to mobilize the creation of value in new forms and by new players. Normann and Ramirez's concept of the value constellation elicited a broad range of commentaries. In this issue's Perspectives section, nine experts consider this new model and comment on the authors' argument. Normann and Ramirez then offer a general response.

J	Zorrilla, M; Yebenes, J				Zorrilla, Marta; Yebenes, Juan			A reference framework for the implementation of data governance systems for industry 4.0	COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES			English	Article						Data governance; Data-Centric architecture; Industry 4; 0; Big data; IoT	BIG DATA	The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, represents a new stage of evolution in the organization, management and control of the value chain throughout the product or service life cycle. This is mainly based on the digitalization of the industrial environment by means of the convergence of Information Technologies (IT) and operational Technologies (OT) through cyber-physical systems and the Industrial IoT (IIoT) and the use of data generated in real time for gaining insights and making decisions. Therefore data becomes a critical asset for Industry 4.0 and must be managed and governed like a strategic asset. We rely on Data Governance (DG) as a key instrument for carrying out this transformation. This paper presents the design of a specific governance framework for Industry 4.0. First, this contextualizes data governance for Industry 4.0 environments and iden-tifies the requirements that this framework must address, which are conditioned by the specific features of In-dustry 4.0, among others, the intensive use of big data, the cloud and edge computing, the artificial intelligence and the current regulations. Next, we formally define a reference framework for the implementation of Data Governance Systems for Industry 4.0 using international standards and providing several examples of archi-tecture building blocks.

Reimagining global food value chains through effective resilience to COVID-19 shocks and similar future events: A dynamic capability perspective	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						COVID-19; Global value chains; Resilience; Competitiveness; Dynamic capabilities; Food industry	SUPPLY CHAIN; METHOD VARIANCE; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS; IMPACT; RISK; MICROFOUNDATIONS; COMPETITIVENESS; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT	The restructuring of global value/supply chains gained increasing attention as the unprecedented COVID-19 echoed around the world. Yet, the COVID-19 related theory-driven, large scale quantitative, and empirical studies are relatively scarce. This study advances the extant literature by empirically investigating how do firms in the global food value chains (GFVCs) re-imagine their businesses structure in response to the COVID19-becoming more resilient and competitive to the current pandemic and similar future events. We leverage a unique data of 231 senior managers of the Australian GFVCs and examine their firms' response strategies. Drawing upon key insights from the dynamic capability view, we find that GFVCs' competitiveness is achieved when exposure to COVID-19 shocks elicits dynamic capabilities-readiness, response, recovery-and these capabilities work jointly and sequentially to cultivate resilience. A key finding of this study is that firms with domestic plus global value chain partners are more resilient than those having only global business partners. This finding implies that excessive reliance on offshoring sometimes becomes lethal, especially amid unexpected and prolonged global shocks and, therefore, companies should strike a balance between domestic and global business partners to remain competitive. These findings offer important contributions to theory, practice, and UN sustainable development goals.

J	Gallemore, C; Jespersen, K; Olmsted, P				Gallemore, Caleb; Jespersen, Kristjan; Olmsted, Paige			Harnessing relational values for global value chain sustainability: Reframing the roundtable on sustainable palm oil's offset mechanism to support smallholders	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Relational values; RSPO; Global value chains; Private standards; Certification	CERTIFICATION; MARKET; EVOLUTION; BIODIVERSITY; PERFORMANCE; SCHEME; POWER	In credit systems, purportedly sustainable activities are undertaken in one place to compensate for unsustainable activities elsewhere. These mechanisms originated in pollution abatement systems but now are found in many sustainability programs, including supply chain certification. Credit programs are used in various sustainability certification programs to lower transaction costs, boost uptake, and direct more resources to small producers, but they are also controversial. The relational values framework argues that one way to motivate people to support sustainability efforts is to emphasize what behaviors are appropriate to specific relationships. We ask whether changing the way we think and talk about credits may be a way to direct more resources to producers or places willing to engage in sustainability certification. Using an embedded survey experiment, we test this reframing with a sample of representatives of member organizations of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We find that the relational values reframing of the RSPO's crediting mechanism is perceived to be less confusing and potentially damaging to the standard's reputation than the existing framing. This evidence suggests that relational values frames might be helpful tools as part of efforts to improve sustainability in global value chains.

Ozone gas (O-3) can be an alternative for the control of fungal diseases due to its high oxidizing potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of O3 exposure time on physiological and health characteristics of seed from three peanut cultivars. Seed from peanut cultivars Granoleico, IAC OL3, and IAC 503 were analyzed for their health (blotter test) and physiological potential (germination, first count, and seedling length) after exposure to O-3 for 0, 1, 8, and 16 h. Peanut seed physiological quality and health differed among cultivars. Exposure of seed from peanut cultivars IAC OL3, IAC 503, and Granoleico to O-3 at a rate of 600 mg h(-1) did not affect the development of normal seedlings as measured by the first count and germination, but seedling length increased, decreased, or was not affected in cultivars Granoleico, IAC 503, and IAC OL3, respectively. Also, O-3 did not eradicate fungal infections in peanut seed treated with O-3 at a rate of 600 mg h(-1) for up to 16 h, but the incidence of the fungus Rhizopus sp. in seed from cultivars IAC OL3, Granoleico, and IAC 503 increased, decreased or was not affected, respectively, after 8 h.

J	Seung, CK				Seung, Chang K.			Spatial distribution of the value added from seafood exports: A domestic value chain analysis for Korea	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Korean seafood industries; Domestic value chain; Input output model	TRADE	Production sharing (fragmentation) may occur to a much larger extent at the sub-national level than at the global level due to geographic proximity of firms engaging in trade among sub-national regions within a country. Yet, studies decomposing trade flows among sub-national regions within a country are rare, especially those decomposing the exports of natural resource products. This study decomposes the gross domestic exports of seafood by each of eight regions in the Republic of Korea (ROK), and examines (i) how much value added is created from a region's seafood exports, (ii) how it is distributed among different regions along the domestic value chains (DVCs), and (iii) how its spatial distribution changes over time. Tracing the value added along the DVCs for the inter-regional exports of raw and processed fish, this study finds, among other things, that some regions earn an enormous amount of value added through their active participation in the DVCs although they produce and export a very small quantity of seafood, and therefore do not earn much value added from their seafood exports.

E.; Chacartegui, Ricardo; Torres, Miguel			A biomass universal district heating model for sustainability evaluation for geographical areas with early experience	ENERGY			English	Article						Biomass district heating; Biomass; District heating; Stakeholder management; Project management; Rural bioenergy	ENERGY; SYSTEM; COGENERATION; REDUCTION; SUPPORT; FUEL; EU	Biomass district heating systems are an optimal economic and environmental solution for generating and distributing thermal energy. One of the main challenges for a broader development of these systems is the complexity of its implementation in the absence of established regulations in the legal, commercial, technical, or economic fields, a situation that occurs in geographical areas with early experience. This work proposes a model for the sustainability of biomass district heating systems, including the whole value chain, taking into account the role of the stakeholders. The design of this Biomass Universal District Heating (BioUnivDH) optimises the implementation and sustainability of the district heating system in geographical areas with early experience. It is conceived to identify implementation barriers and to contribute to their elimination. The model identifies the stakeholders of the project through the analysis of their relationships, objectives, and expectations. This model allows comparison between different systems, and it improves the decision-making process with a holistic approach that identifies strategies for successful implementation and operation based on economic, environmental, and social acceptance criteria. Finally, to show the application of the BioUnivDH model, it is applied in four heating system projects based on biomass and implemented in four Spanish cities. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, Y; Dave, D				Liu, Yi; Dave, Deepika			Beyond processing waste: Extraction of oil from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by-products using immobilized Alcalase on chitosan-coated magnetic nanoparticles	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Marine by-products; Atlantic salmon; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Immobilization; Alcalase	ENZYMATIC-HYDROLYSIS; FISH-OIL; PROTEIN; YIELD	Atlantic salmon (Salmon salar) aquaculture has been fully developed on a large scale worldwide. Currently in the Atlantic salmon processing industry, 40-50% of the fish body ends up as by-products, which contain a variety of nutrients and are mainly processed into functional ingredients for premium pet food and animal feed. With the global increase of interest in nutritional diets and supplements, more research has been performed for the valorization of salmon by-products into value-added food products for human consumption. In the present study, an immobilized protease was used for hydrolysis of Atlantic salmon by-products to extract salmon oil. Alcalase was immobilized on chitosan-coated iron (II, III) oxide nanoparticles via glutaraldehyde crosslinking. The immobilized Alcalase was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope. The optimum pH and temperature range for the immobilized Alcalase were determined as 8 and 55-65 degrees C, respectively. The salmon oil extraction process using the immobilized Alcalase was optimized through a factorial design, and the highest oil yield of 20.55% (88.30% recovery) was obtained from 1 h of hydrolysis at 65 degrees C. The oil recovery using the immobilized Alcalase was comparable to the use of free Alcalase. The low levels of oxidation and hydrolysis indicated the high quality of the extracted oil, which is promising to be processed into high-value products such as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. The immobilized Alcalase was collected using a magnet and reused at least three batches without a significant decrease in oil yield, indicating its potential for effective and consecutive oil extraction from salmon by-products. The present study would promote the production of value chain products from unutilized Atlantic salmon resources and achieve sustainable development of the blue economy.

Assessing the feasibility of archetypal transition pathways towards carbon neutrality - A comparative analysis of European industries	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Transition pathways; Sustainability transitions; Socio-technical analysis; Decarbonisation	TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; BRANCHING POINTS; STORAGE CCS; ENERGY; CAPTURE; EFFICIENCY; BARRIERS; POLITICS	Analyses of the future for manufacturing and heavy industries in a climate constrained world many times focus on technological innovations in the early stages of the value chain, assuming few significant changes are plausible, wanted, or necessary throughout the rest of the value chain. Complex questions about competing interests, different ways of organising resource management, production, consumption, and integrating value chains are thus closed down to ones about efficiencies, pay-back times, and primary processing technologies. In this analysis, we move beyond this to identify archetypal pathways that span across value chains in four emissions intensive industries: plastics, steel, pulp and paper, and meat and dairy. The pathways as presented in the present paper were inductively identified in a multi-stage process throughout a four-year European research project. The identified archetypal pathways are i) production and end-use optimisation, ii) electrification with CCU, iii) CCS, iv) circular material flows, and v) diversification of bio-feedstock use. The pathways are at different stages of maturity and furthermore their maturity vary across sectors. The pathways show that decarbonisation is likely to force value chains to cross over traditional boundaries. This implies that an integrated industrial and climate policy must handle both sectoral specificities and commonalities for decarbonised industrial development.

A common way to organize such a collaboration is the use of technology roadmaps, which act as an industry-wide long-term planning tool. Technology roadmaps are used to identify industry needs, estimate the availability of technological solutions, and identify the need for innovation in the future. Roadmaps are inherently both time-dependent and based on uncertain values, i.e., properties and structural components can change over time. Furthermore, roadmaps have to reason about alternative solutions as well as their key performance indicators. Current approaches for model-based engineering do not inherently support these aspects. We present a novel model-based approach treating those aspects as first-class citizens. To address the problem of missing support for time in the context of roadmap modeling, we introduce the concepts of a common global time, time-dependent properties, and time-dependent availability. This includes requirements, properties, and the structure of the model or its components as well. Furthermore, we support the specification and analysis of key performance indicators for alternative solutions. These concepts result in a continuous range of various valid models over time instead of a single valid model at a certain point of time. We present a graphical user interface to enable the user to efficiently create and analyze those models. We further show the semantics of the resulting model by a translation into a set of global constraints as well as how we solve the resulting constraint system. We report on the evaluation of these concepts and the IRIS tool with domain experts from different companies in the automotive value chain based on the industrial case of a smart sensing electrical fuse.

J	Ceyhan, V; Turkten, H; Yildirim, C; Canan, S				Ceyhan, Vedat; Turkten, Hatice; Yildirim, Cagatay; Canan, Selime			Economic viability of industrial hemp production in Turkey	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS			English	Article						Industrial hemp; Productive efficiency; Economic viability; Turkey		Recent developments in industrial hemp sector have resulted in several differentiations in production, marketing, logistic and consumption pattern of industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.). Therefore, the study examined the economic viability of industrial hemp production in Turkey. Research data were collected from industrial hemp producers by using structured questionnaire and from Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and other stakeholders such as merchants, retailer, and e-marketing platform through semi structured interview. Efficiency measures generated by data envelopment analysis (DEA), strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and profitability measures were used to explore economic viability of industrial hemp production. Research findings showed that hemp stalk production cost per kilogram of only hemp fiber growing and dual-purpose growing were US $0.29/kg and US $0.41/kg, respectively. Dual-purpose growing model had the highest net revenue per hectare. Industrial hemp had the competitive advantage over fiber flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), while reverse was the case for cotton fiber and seed production (Gossypium sp.). Based on the findings of efficiency analysis, the mean economic, allocative, and technical efficiencies were 0.77, 0.92, and 0.84, respectively. Productive efficiency level of dual-purpose growing was higher comparing with other growing models. Research findings also showed that farm level hemp production and processing hemp by modern technology was economically viable, while the viability of processing hemp by conventional technology was not profitable in Turkey. The results of SWOT analysis revealed that lacking data, problems related mechanism of hemp markets, hemp value chain, production, lacking research and development (R&D), and legislation problems were main issues in Turkey. The study suggests encouraging the R&D activities and investments in hemp breeding and genetics, and developing processing facility of hemp farms to produce fiber and seed-based product.

J	He, XH; Ping, QY; Hu, WF				He, Xinhua; Ping, Qiuyun; Hu, Wenfa			Does digital technology promote the sustainable development of the marine equipment manufacturing industry in China?	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Marine; Equipment manufacture; Digital technology; Digital trade; Sustainable development; Heterogeneity	ECONOMY; TRADE	Along with the rapid development of information and communication technology, the digital economy has affected all industries and digital trade has become the main way of international trade. This paper adopts an entropy weight method to measure the sustainable development of the Marine Equipment Manufacturing Industry (MEMI), developing an econometric model with the digital trade as a mediating effect to investigate how digital technology promotes the sustainable development of MEMI. After reviewing the sustainable development performance of 11 coastal provinces in China from 2006 to 2016, this paper reveals their regional heterogeneity and shows that digital technology has greatly promoted the sustainable development of China's MEMI. Digital technology has a positive impact on China's MEMI and Digital trade plays a part in the mediating effect. China's MEMI lacks high-end professional and technical personnel in general, but the application of digital technology is unbalanced and inadequate across regions, which is grouped into three echelons. Digital technology is fully developed in the first and second echelon, and digital trade has an obvious mediating effect in the first echelon. In the third echelon, digital technology is applied slowly and the digital trade has produced a masking effect. In light of the position of MEMI in the view of the value chain, the regional authorities should adopt proper policies according to their conditions.

J	Lahiri, S; Karna, A; Kalubandi, SC; Edacherian, S				Lahiri, Somnath; Karna, Amit; Kalubandi, Sai Chittaranjan; Edacherian, Saneesh			Performance implications of outsourcing: A meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Outsourcing; Firm performance; Meta-analysis; Core activity; Location choice; International; Industrial sector; global value chain (GVC)	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; TRANSACTION COST; PUBLICATION BIAS; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; AGENCY THEORY; FIRM; SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	Although outsourcing remains a dominant strategic choice for managers, the understanding of its implications on the firm remains inconclusive. In this paper we focus on empirical evidence around contingencies that determine whether and how outsourcing impacts firm performance. Specifically, we examine how type of value chain activity (core vs. non-core), industrial nature of activity (manufacturing vs. services), and provider's location (domestic vs. international) impact performance. We conduct a meta-analysis of 121 samples from 106 primary studies spanning over 28 years (1992-2019). We find that outsourcing-firm performance relationship is positive. But more importantly, our results demonstrate that the association is stronger for non-core outsourcing than core outsourcing. Interestingly the outsourcing-firm performance relationship does not meaningfully vary across manufacturing and services outsourcing. Our results further indicate that the positive relationship is stronger for international outsourcing than domestic outsourcing. We discuss implications of our findings and present opportunities for future research.

It is commonly used to estimate the distribution of facies-types and fluids in reservoirs across the value chain from exploration to development. However, the low vertical and spatial resolution of seismic data leads to large uncertainties in these estimations, which makes direct use of inversion results challenging. The objective of this study was the estimation of a 3D volume of Gamma Ray data from pre-stack seismic reflectivity partial angle stacks based on the Convolutional Neural Network architecture by representing data through the Continuous Wavelet Transform. The proposed methodology used 132 deviated wells from the Azeri and Chirag parts of the Azeri - Chirag - Gunashli field in the South Caspian Basin as training data. Blind tests show promising Gamma Ray predictions. To optimize the predictions, sensitivity analysis was performed on the Continuous Wavelet Transform parameters (wavelet types, range of pseudo-frequencies, etc.), the Convolutional Neural Network architecture (number of convolutional and pooling layers, dropout, activation functions) and the network parameters (batch size, number of epochs, optimizers, etc.). Due to the vast amount of data required to speed up the learning process, simulations were performed on a Graphics Processing Unit based on the Compute Unified Device Architecture platform.

Previous studies have focused on identifying the key features of one 'ideal' multinationalization approach but shed less light on the potential alternative approaches that firms can use in different situations. Based on an empirical multiple case study of eight SMEs, this study identifies four alternative multinationalization strategies that SMEs can use (resource seeking, hub reaching, serendipitous resource leveraging, and controlled expansion) and illuminates their specific characteristics. The findings of this study demonstrate that instead of one 'ideal' approach, there are multiple strategies that SMEs can adopt for multinationalization and suggest that each strategy is characterized by different FDI goals, timing, organizational structure and value chain activities. Overall, this study contributes to contemporary international business research by advancing theorization on SME multinationalization.

J	El-Sayed, AFM; Nasr-Allah, AM; Dickson, M; Gilmour, C				El-Sayed, Abdel-Fatah M.; Nasr-Allah, Ahmed M.; Dickson, Malcolm; Gilmour, Caitlin			Analysis of aquafeed sector competitiveness in Egypt	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Egypt; Aquafeed industry; Value chain analysis; Competitiveness; Investment	RAINBOW-TROUT; AQUACULTURE; EXTRUSION	The aquafeed industry acts as a critical development driver along the entire Egyptian aquaculture value chain. This study aimed to analyze the competitiveness of the aquafeed subsector in Egypt, comparing its performance in 2018 with the results from an earlier study based on 2013 data. The current situation, the market and regulatory environment, key risks and potential mitigation measures were all assessed. The key private sector players and their competitiveness within the aquafeed value chain were also identified. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a desk review of existing information on the sector, followed by a structured questionnaire that was drafted and distributed to a targeted number of fish feed mills, representing large-scale, medium-scale and small-scale companies, covering different geographical and production regions. The results revealed that the Egyptian aquafeed subsector faced dramatic changes over the five year period from 2013 to 2018. The number of feed mills increased by 67% from an estimated 60 mills in 2013 to around 100 mills in 2018. As a result, Egyptian aquafeed production increased over 77%, from an estimated 800,000 mt to 1,419,000 mt over the same time period. There has been significant local and foreign investment in the fish feed industry in recent years, especially in aquafeed extrusion technology. The sector is dominated by medium-scale (42.6%) and small-scale (33.3%) enterprises. The results also revealed that the aquafeed market in Egypt is highly competitive, and there are clear opportunities to expand both domestic and international aquafeed markets, and export feeds to Africa and the Middle East. However, in the short-term, increased feed production capacity will place financial pressure on existing aquafeed companies, which may render smaller producers unable to compete in the market. Therefore, all companies will have to improve their efficiency and secure their market share; mainly through the investment in other parts of the value chain. International companies have advantages of global sourcing, economies of scale, reputation and research support that will help them through this challenging period. Well-resourced Egyptian companies will also be able to compete and thrive in a future market with fewer, but larger players. Some feed companies already provide credit for operating costs and technical support to their clients. Extending this to include capital investment for modernization of fish farming systems could be possible, where the feed companies act as credit guarantors. The study demonstrates the need of feed companies to improve production efficiency to be able to be competitive in the market.

The objective of this work is to environmentally analyze the bio-production of SA from residual sugar-based streams from the pulp and paper industry (SSL). In this study we have complemented Attributional life cycle assessment (A-LCA) with Consequential life cycle assessment (C-LCA) analyzing the effect of mass versus economic allocation in the first method, and the potential of net reductions of carbon emissions in the chemical industry in the latter. The results present an analysis of the environmental effects of producing SA with two operation modes: fed-batch and continuous fermentation as well as the influence of assuming different geographical locations of the bio-SA production plant through the assessment of the effect of the electricity mix. On the other hand, utilizing the facultative anaerobic and capnophilic bacterium Basfia succiniciproducens in the fermentation and thus being CO2 an input, brings up the opportunity of assessing the carbon capture and utilization potential of the bio-SA value chain. An assessment of the upstream section and origin of CO2 was performed by studying the effect of capturing CO2 from industrial static point sources (cement industry and bioethanol production from fermentation). The carbon footprint attributional results suggest that SA from SSL provides a reasonable substitution for the SA fossil alternative although not reaching the same results when comparing against first generation SA produced from sorghum, which is 62% better. From the consequential perspective, substituting the current market of SA (fossil and 1st generation SA) by SA from SSL will provide improvements of up to 1465% by 2060.

Despite the immense potential of aquaculture for food and livelihoods, only seaweed farming has so far established into commercial-scale production. This activity is dominated by women and became widespread in the early 1990s as a small but regular source of income. However, seaweed farming constraints such as frequent seaweed die-offs, as well as economic and institutional constraints inhibit its development. Other types of aquaculture activities such as fish farming, mud crab fattening, half-pearl farming, sea cucumber farming and sponge and coral cultures are under development with limited production or in experimental stages. Common constraints among these activities are economic limitations, lack of technical infrastructure and skills, small and irregular production, and limited trade and market availabilities. At the same time, there is a lack of sufficient management and monitoring systems, while there are no formal regulations or clear strategies to boost aquaculture at the national level. In addition, new aquaculture initiatives are often dominated by donor-driven projects instead of local entrepreneurships. This situation does not encourage engagement in aquaculture and thus such activities are outcompeted by other already established sectors (e.g. agriculture and fisheries). We conclude that aquaculture has great potential to evolve due to high environmental capacity. Nevertheless, achieving profitable production and a stronger commitment within local communities, as well as developing effective mariculture governance through support mechanisms and clear strategies to boost the sector at the national level, are essential for sustainable mariculture development in Zanzibar.

It is therefore essential to explore the livelihood conditions, health status and care-seeking behavior of the fishermen in these communities during the ongoing pandemic. This study was carried out by applying mixed methods, including interviews and focus group discussion (FGD), in the three sub-districts of Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat, which are in the southwestern region adjacent to the Sundarbans mangrove forest (SMF) of Bangladesh. Quantitative data were collected from 76 fishermen through telephone interviews, while 24 fishermen participated in three distinct focus group discussions. The findings suggest that the fishermen have experienced a reduction of income, as they have been barred from entering the SMF during the pandemic, which has gradually affected their number of trips to and stays at the forest as well as their catch of fisheries resources. The decline in demand in both regional and international markets has left the fishermen with only a handful of alternative ways to adjust to these unprecedented circumstances, such as borrowing money, selling household assets, and in some extreme cases marrying off young children to reduce the financial burden, as many are now jobless. Their financial hardship during the pandemic has affected their households' capacity to afford basic household necessities, including food, fuel, education, and health expenses. Subsequently, when these fishermen suffer ailments such as fever, cough, headache, and cold - the general symptoms of COVID-19 - they cannot seek medical assistance from trained doctors. Their financial constraints have compelled them to rely on indigenous knowledge, in particular village quack doctors, or in some cases to seek help from local pharmacies for modern medicine. Thus, the government should provide financial support and strengthen the local market value chain so that disadvantaged fishermen in SMFRDCs can adopt alternative livelihood opportunities. Furthermore, longitudinal research on the impacts of COVID-19 on livelihood, local adaptation strategies, health status, and care seeking behavior is also strongly recommended.

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the importance of farmers' participation in strategic decision-making regarding poplar tree farming development. Given the high potential for poplar farming development in Urmia County in northwestern Iran, this region was selected for a case study. Internal and external factors were determined using Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis. These factors were then evaluated using a 10-point Likert scale questionnaire to determine the average score and an independent t-test to compare the differences between the two responding groups of 153 farmers and 61 members of the local government. The findings show that there were significant differences of opinion in 18 of the 37 factors, which include four economic factors, seven social factors, and seven technical factors. There were also significant differences of opinions in three of the six defined development strategies. The overall conclusions were that decision-making should involve all the key stakeholders whose attitudes towards decision-making may vary, and poplar farmers' participation in decision-making can lead to more accurate decisions and more effective results by implementing these decisions.

J	Abebe, GK; Traboulsi, A; Aoun, M				Abebe, Gumataw Kifle; Traboulsi, Andrew; Aoun, Mirella			Performance of organic farming in developing countries: a case of organic tomato value chain in Lebanon	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						Agro-tourism; costs of production; guarantee system; organic farming; profitability; sustainability	PARTICIPATORY GUARANTEE SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; AGRICULTURE; FOOD; FARMERS; PROFITABILITY; CERTIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR	The future of food value chains has increasingly been reliant on the wider adoption of sustainable farming practices that include organic agriculture. Organic farming in developed countries is standardized and occupies a niche in agro-food systems. However, such a standard model, when transferred to developing countries, faces difficulty in implementation. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the expansion of organic agriculture in Lebanon, a Middle Eastern context, and analyzes the economic performance of organic tomato among smallholder farmers. Accordingly, the study was able to determine the production costs, map the organic value chain and assess the profitability of organic tomato by comparing it with the conventional tomato in the same value chain. The study finds organic farming being increasingly expensive primarily due to the inherently high cost of production in Lebanon and the inefficient organization of the organic value chain. As a result, we suggest a blended approach of organic farming with other models, in particular agro-tourism, as a local solution to the sustainability of organic farming in developing countries with limited resources (land and labor) and characterized by long marketing channels. In countries such as Lebanon, a country endowed with rich cultural heritage and natural and beautiful landscapes, the agro-tourism model can harness organic farming and tourism activities. We also propose the adoption of local collective guarantee systems for organic production as a way to alleviate the costs of third-party auditing in Lebanon.

We combine GVC measures of global import intensity of production, upstreamness and the length of the value chain with micro-data on workers. We find that the wages of Central and Eastern European countries workers are higher when their industry is at the beginning of the chain or at the end than in the middle. Secondly, wage changes depend on the interplay between upstreamness and GVC intensity. In sectors close to final demand, greater production fragmentation is associated with lower wages.

J	van Dijk, MP; Limpens, G; Kariuki, JG; de Boer, D				van Dijk, Meine Pieter; Limpens, Gigi; Kariuki, Julius Gatune; de Boer, Diederik			Telephone farmers and an emerging ecosystem are unlocking the hidden middle of agricultural value chains in Kenya through innovation	JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES			English	Article; Early Access						Telephone farmers; Ecosystem; Hidden middle; Innovation; Value chains; Kenya	FOOD SYSTEM; AFRICA; RISE; REVOLUTION; EAST	Purpose This article explores the potential of an emerging group of farmers in Kenya, namely the growing segment of urban-based medium-size farmers, often called "telephone farmers". To what extent do they benefit from an emerging ecosystem to support them in operating their farms, and what does that mean for the Hidden middle of agricultural value chains, the actors between the farmers and consumers? Unlocking the potential production of telephone farmers will require more services from collectors, traders, transport firms, the storage facilities, wholesalers and processing units and retailers. Ultimately, optimized telephone farm production benefits the business of Hidden middle value chain actors, increases incomes and jobs and improves food security. Design/methodology/approach Based on a survey and in-depth interviews a profile of the telephone farmers is given and their role as innovators is analyzed. The Latia Resource Centre (LRC) provides assistance to medium-size farmers, like the telephone farmers, helping them to prepare business plans and use modern technology and contributing to an emerging ecosystem providing support to all farmers. Findings The article analyzes the medium-size telephone farmers. It documents the contributions of this new agricultural actor to developing value chains and a dynamic ecosystem. The paper profiles the telephone farmers first and then identifies what they need and the support they receive. The emerging innovative ecosystem impacts agricultural productivity and production and hence the development of value chains. Small farmers gain access to opportunities offered by telephone farmers, working for them as outgrower or farm worker. Research limitations/implications The authors used a small sample of 51 farmers and covered only a two-year period. Social implications Small farmers are being helped through the emerging eco-system and farm labor acquire skills, which they can also you on another or their own farm. Originality/value Based on the analysis an even more effective ecosystem is suggested and policy recommendations are formulated before the conclusion is drawn that these medium-size farmers contribute to innovation diffusion, inclusive value chain development and food security and are becoming part of this expanding, innovative ecosystem. Following the debate on food security the results suggest to pay more attention to the development of telephone farmers given their role in developing agricultural value chains and innovative ecosystems.

J	Spicka, J				Spicka, Jindrich			Cooperation in a minimum-waste innovation ecosystem: a case study of the Czech Hemp Cluster	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS			English	Article; Early Access						Case study; Qualitative research; Sustainable development; Innovation ecosystem; Ecosystem guilds; Minimum-waste strategy	DYNAMICS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; UNIVERSITY; LINKAGES; ECONOMY; FIRMS; SMES	Purpose Innovation ecosystems face many environmental challenges. The literature review shows that innovation ecosystems accelerate innovation activity, but empirical studies have not provided enough case studies focusing on the minimum-waste business strategy as one aspect of the circular economy. Various forms of interaction between members occur in the innovation ecosystems, which determines the level of cooperation. This paper aims to show the structure and forms of cooperation in an innovation ecosystem using the Czech Hemp Cluster (CHC) and its surroundings and suggest research directions in the field of interaction between members in an innovation ecosystem. Although hemp is associated with the production and distribution of narcotics, it is a versatile plant supporting the minimum-waste business strategy. Design/methodology/approach The research is based on a theoretical part of a literature review of major scientific articles on innovation ecosystems from 2016 to 2021. The case study of the CHC and the hemp ecosystem is based on qualitative research in the form of a content analysis of the mission of the cluster members. In addition to content analysis, the classic multidimensional scaling method and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to reveal ecological guilds. Findings The case study highlighted the specific relationship between the cluster and the ecosystem. The cluster does not determine the ecosystem boundaries, but the ecosystem is a much broader system of cooperation and interaction between organisations. Clusters emerge after an ecosystem has existed for a particular time to coordinate collaboration and information between organisations and stakeholders. The analysis of the CHC revealed the specific role of non-profit organisations (NPOs) in the innovation ecosystem. NPOs are not engaged in primary functions in the value chain, but they provide supporting activities through coordinated networking, disseminating information on innovation, awareness-raising and stakeholder education. Compared to natural ecosystems, innovation ecosystems are typically characterised by higher forms of collaboration between members. Research limitations/implications An exciting opportunity for research on innovation ecosystems is the ecological guilds taken from natural ecosystems and whose identification can help define the boundaries of innovation ecosystems. An opportunity for further research is the comparison of NPO-based and government-based clusters playing a central role in developing innovation ecosystems. Regarding the problematic generalisability of the case study to the entire agricultural production, a challenge is a search for minimum-waste business models in agriculture characterised by the biological nature of production. Originality/value Theoretical and empirical studies have not yet considered innovation ecosystems in the minimum-waste context to a sufficient extent. The paper builds on previous scholarly studies focusing on innovation ecosystems and, for the first time, discusses the role of NPOs in the innovation ecosystem. The CHC case study adds a suitable minimum-waste business model to the still very scarce literature on sustainable innovation ecosystems. The article discusses the purpose and forms of cooperation in an innovation ecosystem, identifies a complementarity of roles in the innovation cluster and describes the interrelationship between the cluster and the ecosystem. Discussion of the ecosystem leader in the cluster-based innovation ecosystem shows the differences between Czech, Polish and German life science ecosystems.

J	Bam, WG; De Bruyne, K				Bam, W. G.; De Bruyne, K.			The product space, sustainability, and GVC oriented industrial policies: The case of iron and steel in the SACU	AFRICA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						GVC; sustainability; industrial policy; product space; SACU; iron and steel	NETWORKS	This paper develops, and then applies, a holistic framework that supports industrial policy decision-making at the global value chain (GVC) level, with the aim of stimulating sustainable development in developing countries. Notwithstanding the importance of economic growth for development, industrial policy decision-makers are also concerned about social and environmental objectives when setting industrial policies. We develop a framework that allows for a trade-off between economic growth, social objectives, and environmental goals. We do so by building on the established product space literature, and its extensions, and applying it to the value chain level using the input-output product space approach. By including emerging environmental and green metrics, we manage to identify Pareto-optimal industry targets, taking the economic, environmental, and social objectives simultaneously into account. At the same time, expected required government investment is minimized. Finally, we apply our new framework to the specific case of iron and steel in the Southern African Customs Union, and draw lessons for future work from this example.	[Bam, W.

J	Awafo, EA; Owusu, PA				Awafo, Edward A.; Owusu, Prosper Achaw			Energy and water mapping of the cocoa value chain in Ghana	SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION			English	Article						Cocoa production; Cocoa value chain; Water mapping; Energy mapping; Ghana	INCENTIVES	The cocoa sub-sector in Ghana is an economically active sector, serving as a major export earner for the country and contributing up to 7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The cocoa value chain in Ghana includes pre-harvest, post-harvest and processing stages, which consist of activities such as seed production, nursery, replanting, cultivation, harvesting, fermentation, drying, scaling and sale, certification and bulking, export or processing. Along the entire chain for all these stages is the intensive use of water and energy, although intensities vary for the different stages. An energy and water mapping was therefore conducted to analyse the energy and water usage along each value chain activity. The studies indicate that mainly rainwater and a little stream and dugout water are used in the pre-harvest stage for nursery activities. The main energy used here is direct sunlight for drying the cocoa beans, manpower used on the farm and about 10% of total petrol and diesel usage along the entire value chain used for transportation during field visits and in tractors for land preparation. During the post-harvest stage, 75% of fossil fuel is used in vehicles and trucks for transportation. The processing stage of the value chain is where the bulk of energy is used, largely from the national grid and about 15% diesel/petrol used in small backup generators and for running processing machineries and equipment. Energy and water estimation and requirements used along each stage in the value chain was conducted. The processing companies, undertaking activities in the processing stage, pay commercial tariffs for water usage (approximately US$1.82 per 10 0 0 litres) and US$0.14 per kWh of electricity usage. The studies showed that besides these high tariffs, which affect production and profits, efficiency levels are very low. The paper concludes that despite the numerous challenges with high cost of production and low efficiencies, there are many opportunities and strengths that can be harnessed to bring about innovation, efficiency and increased productivity along the value chain of cocoa in Ghana. Key amongst these are; collaborating with the vibrant private and public sectors involved in the value chain; harnessing the abundant and high solar radiation to improve drying activities; using the existing regulatory and institutional frameworks to introduce innovative initiatives in the value chain, for example converting the large quantities of organic waste generated from cocoa products production to produce bio-energy; introducing energy efficiencies measures, etc. These, amongst many others, are recommended as opportunities that can be harnessed, together with the enabling environment in the country, to add value to the cocoa sector.

However, current solutions suffer performance deficiencies, or often disregard legacy devices still in operation. We propose a blockchain system built upon an IoT architecture that is secure, modular, easily scalable, and deployable for fast certification of manufacturing data, compatible with current industrial landscapes. First, the proposed architecture is presented along with elements required to manage network functions. Second, easing integration with existing manufacturing solutions, custom APIs are created and subsequently explained. This grants the platform plug-and-play capabilities, requiring minimal hardware and software configuration for deployment. Lastly, a prototype is designed to validate the solution, concluding the viability of the proposed architecture as a fast and secure certification method of manufacturing data.

However, issues of data management, data integration, trust and collaboration in this complex ecosystem remain under-explored. We suggest that Digital Passports and mandatory reporting could provide a way to audit and incentivise reuse of packaging, allowing gov-ernments to focus on prevention and to frame packaging as an asset, rather than inevitably turning into waste after a short single-use cycle. Digital Passports can address business' concerns (or excuses) for not investing in reusable packaging from helping with determining affordability through measuring packag-ing lifespans; meeting health and safety standards through batch coding and evidencing cleaning checks; addressing reputational concerns through clear documentation on the environmental impact of reusable items; and making reusable packaging competitive through waste taxation that actually measures reuse. We explore Digital Passports, not simply as a technical intervention but as boundary objects that are useful in supporting collaboration, identifying points of miscommunication between key actors along the value chain, from misconceptions of health and safety regulations to a distinction between retailers' and manufacturing brands' willingness to invest in reuse. Thus, we provide a solid foundation for future re-search on Digital Passports, the digital circular economy and reusable packaging. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

A Kenyan case study	SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH			English	Article						Sheep; Goats; Productivity; Breeding; Gender; Arid and semi-arid lands	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; BREEDING PROGRAMS; PRODUCTION OBJECTIVES; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; DAIRY PRODUCTION; LIVESTOCK; GOATS; WOMEN; SHEEP	A major constraint faced in implementing sheep and goat improvement programs in low input systems is the limited involvement of the pastoral livestock keepers. Gender dynamics represent strong determinants of pastoral livestock management practices but are however very rarely integrated in livestock improvement programs. This research adopts a gendered lens to explore sheep and goat breeding management, ownership and trait preferences. Using a qualitative approach ten gender disaggregated focus group discussions with 121 participants were conducted with beneficiaries from a USAID supported Accelerated Livestock Value Chain Development Project for livestock improvement in Kenya's low input systems. The results show that availability of sheep and goat breeding stock are directly influenced by gendered allocations of management activities. Despite women's contribution to sheep and goat management, men were perceived to exercise a greater variety of ownership rights compared to women, especially regarding decision-making over sheep and goat breeding. While sheep and goat trait preferences were similar for men and women the order of trait prioritisation was gendered according to divisions of labour and decision-making opportunities and constraints. The results demonstrate that gender dynamics in specific areas of sheep and goat husbandry in low input systems can influence breeding outcomes in different ways. Contributing to filling an important knowledge gap and supplementing existing literature, the study recommends the adoption of a gendered approach when introducing or strengthening productivity improvement practices. Strategies to ensure that sheep and goat improvement practices are not only relevant but compatible with the preferences of men and women are therefore considered more likely to improve technology adoption rates.

In parallel, they can also constitute pathways of zoonotic pathogen transmission to humans. This risk is aggravated by limited disease monitoring and poor control systems with regards to biosecurity and public health. The aim of this study was to investigate the risks for spread of zoonotic diseases in Zambia's two largest informal small ruminant markets, located in Lusaka and Kasumbalesa, through combining seroepidemiology with interviews and observations. In April, May and September 2018, serum samples (n = 237) were collected and analysed for antibodies for the zoonotic pathogens Brucella spp., Coxiella (C.) burnetii and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), using commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In addition, slaughterhouse activities were observed and semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions held with slaughterhouse workers and small ruminant traders, focusing on the handling of animals and meat, and the perceptions of zoonotic disease risks at slaughter and consumption. The study found seropositivity rates of 10.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.60-14.7) for Brucella spp., 5.9% (95% CI 3.27-9.71) for C. burnetii, and 0.8% (95% CI 0.10-3.01) for RVFV. Interviews with value chain members and observations at the slaughterhouse revealed unsanitary procedures and multiple occupational hazards for slaughterhouse workers. This study showed that the Zambian informal small ruminant trade system poses risks to public health, and that these risks are exacerbated by a lack of information about food-borne diseases and how associated risks can be mitigated amongst value chain actors. The results of this study can be used to formulate preventive measures to improve informal meat markets and reduce the risks to public health.

J	Mano, Y; Njagi, T; Otsuka, K				Mano, Yukichi; Njagi, Timothy; Otsuka, Keijiro			An inquiry into the process of upgrading rice milling services: The case of the Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kenya	FOOD POLICY			English	Article						Rice quality; Rice milling; Destoner; Kenya; Sub-Sahara Africa	PERSPECTIVE; MARKETS; IMPACTS; DEMAND; INCOME	Countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) rely heavily on imported rice from Asia that is of superior quality relative to local rice. The objectives of this study are to assess the impacts of the adoption of improved milling technologies and the associated structural transformation of the rice value chain from 2011 to 2019 using the original census of the rice millers in the Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kenya. Our empirical analysis uses the doubly robust method and the endogenous switching model, which collectively reveal that the adopters of improved milling machines successfully improved the quality of local milled rice to allow it to compete with imported rice, thereby increasing the amount of domestic rice sold to supermarkets as well as to urban traders and consumers. It is also found through probit regression that a few educated, entrepreneurial rice millers operating in rice milling clusters adopted large-scale improved milling machines that included destoning ability, importing them from China around 2010. Later, smaller-sized improved machines were also introduced and more widely adopted in the rice milling clusters. In contrast, the many other millers that did not adopt improved machines were forced to down-size their business or exit the industry. These results imply that adopting improved milling technologies, including destoners, is critical to improving the competitiveness of SSA's domestic rice against imported rice.

J	Mohring, N; Finger, R				Moehring, Niklas; Finger, Robert			Pesticide-free but not organic: Adoption of a large-scale wheat production standard in Switzerland	FOOD POLICY			English	Article						Pesticide; Pesticide-free; Sustainable agriculture; Adoption; Wheat; Public-private; Sustainability standard; Switzerland	FARMERS WILLINGNESS; FOOD SECURITY; PARTICIPATION; DETERMINANTS; AGRICULTURE; ATTITUDES; IDENTITY; BEHAVIOR	The sustainable intensification of agriculture requires solutions for a large-scale reduction of pesticide use while sustaining agricultural yields. Pesticide-free production standards, which bring together the strengths of all the food value chain actors, could be a cornerstone of this transformation. In Switzerland, a non-organic, private-public standard for pesticide-free wheat production is currently being introduced by the producer organization IP-SUISSE. It is the first of its kind in Europe and may reach a market share of 50% of Swiss wheat production. We here assess the determinants of farmers' participation and willingness to participate in the future. For our analysis, we combine a survey of the entire population of IP-SUISSE wheat producers (4749 farmers, 23.3% response rate) with data on historical farm-level wheat yields, soil properties, weather, climate, weed pressure, and spread of herbicide resistance. Our results indicate that a large-scale establishment of pesticide-free wheat production in Switzerland is possible. We find that farmers' perceptions of positive environmental effects of the production program are key for adoption. Moreover, farmers' expectations of the program's production effects play a central role. Farmers perceiving large yield losses and increases in production risks are less likely to enter the program. Based on our results, we discuss implications, leverage points, and challenges for designing and implementing large-scale pesticide-free production programs.

However, long-term storage and long-distance transportation of hydrogen are challenging owing to its low energy density, which can be effectively enhanced via liquefaction, an energy- and cost-intensive process. Commercial hydrogen liquefaction processes exhibit specific energy consumptions in the range of 12.0-15.5 kWh/kg with an exergy efficiency of 19.0%-23.6%. This study presents an energy-efficient and cost-effective process configuration for producing liquid hydrogen through stepwise cooling and subsequent ortho-para conversion. The energy intensive precooling cycle is divided into two sub-cycles employing carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. This process exploits the benefits of carbon dioxide in a simple yet efficient configuration. A specific energy consumption of 7.63 kWh/kg was achieved, along with an exergy efficiency of 31.4%. The coefficient of performance and figure of merit of this study was 0.16 and 0.31, respectively. Economic evaluation yielded total equipment and total annualized costs of $12.3 million and $24.2 million/year, respectively. The proposed process can assist in achieving a sustainable and green energy economy by enhancing the overall hydrogen value chain through competitive and efficient hydrogen storage and transportation.

J	Seyfert, R; Maibaum, M; Kroll, S				Seyfert, Roberto; Maibaum, Markus; Kroll, Susanne			RFID Data Storage and Their Key Role in Exploitation of Metallic Second Life Materials	IEEE JOURNAL OF RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION			English	Article						Metals; Steel; Recycling; Europe; Industries; Automotive engineering; Memory; Radiofrequency identification; tags; data storage; RFID; end-of-life; EOL; exploitation of metal; second life material; value chain; circular economy; remanufacturing; refurbish; reuse		Steel is one of the most important technical resources in the world and already consists of a large proportion of recycled scrap metal. The automotive recycling industry also contributes to this material recycling or the circular economy and has so far run as a high energy process chain starting with dismantling and shredding and ending with the sorting of heavy and light fractions. Different physical principles like magnetic, mechanical, aerodynamic or optical separation are used. The high energy and logistics costs of material recycling offer potential for optimization in terms of the CO2 balance. The manufacturing chain of metallic vehicle components produces such high-quality products that questions inevitably arise about alternative component utilization such as reuse, refurbish and remanufacturing. Based on this key question, the following article is about novel technologies for exploiting steel from end-of-life vehicles. In detail, the fabrication of brake covers from roofs of end-of-life vehicles and the brazing and desoldering of structural joints in the vehicle body were explored. In addition to the technical requirements and feasibility of the innovative manufacturing technologies, the need for information and data from product manufacturing for product utilization was also investigated. The use of special RFID data storage devices that can provide utilization processes with important parameters and properties of the original product was examined. The use of RFID data storage has been identified as a necessity for future "second-life-material" processes, especially because of its ability to increase efficiency and economy of processes.

A case study based on combining split-plot design, principal component analysis and partial least squares predictions	FOOD CONTROL			English	Article						Fish spread; Sea farming; Value chain; Eating quality; Split-plot design; Time series	QUALITY; PACKAGE	As part of an extended fish product (mixed salmon spread) value chain involving multiple treatment procedures and mixing processes, oxidation and microbial spoilage can be initiated at any number of steps and go on to accelerate product deterioration. This may occur, for example, when salmon rest raw materials are processed to form mixed emulsion products. To investigate the effect of selected variables in the value chain, a model experiment was designed and implemented, consisting of a chain divided into four steps involving fish feed composition, fish processing, fish spread production and storage. By using this case, the objectives of the paper are to 1) show how a complex split-plot design can be analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate statistical analyses, 2) show how an interplay of the methodologies can contribute to improvement in the interpretation and validation of results, and 3) identify the quality markers most affected by the design variables, and then use these to optimise response measurements for different raw material properties. We also propose some new monitoring and control strategies based on the PCA and results obtained. The analysis has indicated in this case that it may be beneficial for the long shelf-life of the spread to use fresh and lean salmon cuts, to store the product under superchilled conditions and to avoid the addition of secondary seafood ingredients. Salmon feed variables do not affect the eating quality of the spreads. The early addition of a smoke component and the rigor status of the salmon at the time of processing had little effect on eating quality. The variables that did not affect eating quality or shelf-life can be optimised based on aspects such as nutritional or health benefits, or production costs. This article demonstrates that PCA is a useful method both for the monitoring of eating quality with storage time, the definition of control limits for product acceptability, and the statistical validation of split-plot ANOVA results.

J	Strecker, K; Bitzer, V; Kruijssen, F				Strecker, Klara; Bitzer, Verena; Kruijssen, Froukje			Critical stages for post-harvest losses and nutrition outcomes in the value chains of bush beans and nightshade in Uganda	FOOD SECURITY			English	Article; Early Access						Post-harvest losses; Loss hotpots; Value chains; African nightshade; Bush beans; Uganda; Nutrition-sensitive	PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L.; LEAFY VEGETABLES; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; VITAMIN-C; FOOD LOSS; COOKING; AFRICA; WASTE; SECURITY; QUALITY	The reduction of post-harvest losses (PHLs) has been identified as a key pathway to food and nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa. However, despite policy prioritisation, knowledge about the severity of PHLs remains scant, especially when it comes to nutrient-dense crops such as African nightshade and bush beans. Therefore, this paper identifies loss hotspots, causes and effects throughout the value chains of nightshade and bush beans in eastern Uganda. Primary data collected following the Informal Food Loss Assessment Method, combined with small-scale load tracking and secondary data, allows for an analysis of physical, economic, quality, and nutritional losses throughout the value chains of both crops. Results show that in the bush bean value chain, severe physical and quality losses occur during post-harvest handling by farmers, leading to high economic losses at this stage of the chain. Nutritional losses are not expected to be significant in the bush bean value chain. By contrast, due to the shortness of the nightshade value chain, where produce is moved from harvest to consumption within one or two days, physical losses in most parts of the chain are relatively minor. Only at consumption stage, high physical losses occur. This is also the stage where economic losses and potential nutritional losses are most pronounced. The results of this study offer a deeper understanding of the value chain dynamics of bush beans and nightshade, including underlying gender relations, and identify concrete loss hotspots, upon which further research and practical interventions can build.

Since lead firms select their suppliers for a given deployment project, national governments can set incentives for these firms to opt for local suppliers. We use the case of offshore wind in Europe to quantitatively measure the origin of suppliers across three global value chain governance modes: market, modular and relational. Suppliers can originate from the windfarm country, the lead firm's country or the global market. We test supplier selection across the modes of governance, domestic market size and local content push using a database of over 12,000 supplier contracts. The results indicate that lead firms mostly draw from the global market for market-coordinated segments, while favoring local suppliers under local content regulations. Local lead firms have a higher tendency to source locally for both market and relationally coordinated suppliers. However, local content push reduces the tendency of local lead firms to select local relational suppliers. Therefore, local content requirements seem to be broadly successful to stimulate locally sourced suppliers of the market-coordinated type; on the other hand, our results show that national governments should have local lead firms commission projects without imposing local content regulations to increase the odds that local relational suppliers are selected.

Recently, however, an emerging literature on the 'servicification' of manufacturing in GVCs has evolved, most of which involves aggregate-level analyses of countries and sectors based on trade statistics. Previous studies have thus failed to explore whether and how local firms in developing countries may capture value and upgrade through their insertion into GVCs as service suppliers. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by analysing the development of an industry supplying wind-turbine services in South Africa. We draw on in-depth fieldwork, including fifty-two interviews and five case studies of firms operating as suppliers of various types of 'embedded' services to wind-power projects constructed in South Africa. We show the significant economic value in terms of the employment thereby created and the upgrading pathways of five local service-suppliers in knowledge-intensive and high value-added service activities. Our findings point to the benefit of devoting attention to the role of services in relation to upgrading in GVCs.

J	Marques, R				Marques, Rita			Restart tourism | build the future	WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES			English	Article; Early Access						Portuguese tourism; Tourism indicators; Sustainability in tourism		Purpose This viewpoint aims to explore the question: How can we restart and monitor the path towards the tourism of the future? Design/methodology/approach This paper identifies the progress made at scientific, institutional, political and technological levels, and how it is possible to foresee that we will enter in a new era of tourism indicators. Findings A significant body of literature clearly demonstrates that tourism cannot be viewed simply from an economic point of view as it has a great influence on sociocultural and environmental dimensions. The impact of tourism and how to ensure its long-term success has been invoked for the last few decades, leading to the direct consideration of sustainability indicators in a wide array of scientific publications. However, despite significant advances, the lack of funding, lack of support or interest from the political community, bureaucracies or lack of methodological guidance and of technical skills along the entire value chain pose clear challenges to the development and adoption of wide data systems to support sustainable tourism policies. Originality/value The paper sheds light on the Portuguese position regarding the recovery of the tourism sector in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also highlights the commitment to knowledge and monitoring of sustainability in tourism, articulated at international level, and how this is essential in order to make progress and to overcome the challenges facing the sector. At the same time, it demonstrates how fundamental it is to identify solutions to boost the potential of tourism as an economic, social, environmental and cultural phenomenon.

J	Wang, Y; Mao, XY; Zameer, H				Wang, Ying; Mao, Xiangyu; Zameer, Hashim			Designing benefit distribution driven innovation strategy for local enterprises under the global value chain system	MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access							FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; LOOP SUPPLY CHAIN; TECHNOLOGY SPILLOVERS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PROFIT ALLOCATION; PARTICIPATION; FDI; PERSPECTIVE; ALLIANCE; INDUSTRY	The threat from multinational enterprises to local enterprises in developing countries is increasing with the in-depth development of global value chain cooperation. To increase the profit distribution of local enterprises in global value chain, it is necessary to analyze the cooperation strategy between local enterprises and multinational enterprises. In this paper, cooperative game theory is applied to form a better understanding of cooperation between local enterprises and multinational enterprises. The Shapley values under different cooperative models are analyzed. Based on the analysis, the paper provides some suggestions for local enterprises to enhance the profit distribution of cooperation with multinational enterprises.

Relational contracts and value chain governance: exporter approaches to overcoming transaction costs in Rwanda's coffee sector	JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES			English	Article; Early Access						Africa; Coffee; Rwanda; Global value chain; Relational contracts	TRADE	Purpose In developing countries, local buyers often rely on relational contracting based on reciprocity and trust. This paper analyzes relational contracting and global value chain (GVC) governance by focusing on how domestic and foreign coffee exporters in Rwanda confront challenges. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 representatives of Rwandan private, Rwandan cooperative-owned and foreign exporters, and four coffee sector stakeholders. Findings Foreign firms export most Rwandan coffee, and local exporters express concerns about their ability to compete. Rwandan exporters face challenges accessing capital, competing with foreign firms and managing high transaction costs. They use relational contracts to reduce transaction costs, and they benefit from a monopsony zoning regulation that reduces competition. Foreign exporters face regulatory challenges: a government-set coffee price and the zoning regulation. They vertically integrate to reduce costs and lock in suppliers through prefinancing. Research limitations/implications Future research should analyze differences between local and foreign exporters in other contexts to advance understanding of the different challenges faced and contracting approaches used. Originality/value Few GVC governance studies address the role of relational contracts in contexts where enforcement is costly. Considering relational contracts within GVCs can improve value chain analysis, specifically in the developing countries where many GVCs start.

Artisanal refining of crude oil in the Niger Delta: A challenge to clean-up and remediation in Ogoniland	LOCAL ECONOMY			English	Article; Early Access						artisanal refining; crude oil; oil spills; environmental remediation; Ogoniland; value chain		While the activities of multinational oil corporations contribute significantly to oil pollution and environmental degradation in most oil-producing countries, the extent to which illegal artisanal refineries contribute to the environmental problems in Niger Delta remains unclear. Extant literature attributes this to the expanding activities of the artisans as well as the use of crude technology in illegal oil refining. Given the widespread nature of the artisanal oil-refining economy in the Niger Delta region, we assess its contribution to the growing environmental pollution in the region. By artisanal oil refining, we mean small-scale crude oil processing or subsistent distillation of petroleum that is often outside the boundaries of the state law. This study links the continual failure of the clean-up programme in the Niger Delta to the booming artisanal crude oil-refining economy in the region. Using predominantly qualitative methods of data collection and content analysis, we adopted the enterprise value chain analysis to underscore the underlying local economic interests and external economic opportunities that sustain oil bunkering, oil theft and petro-piracy. We conclude that these illegal refining processes significantly undermine the Ogoniland clean-up project and make the remediation programme unsustainable in Nigeria.

J	Kopp, T				Kopp, Thomas			When switching costs cause market power: Rubber processing in Indonesia	AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Bertrand paradox; law of one price; oligopsony; rubber; switching costs; value chain analysis	PROFILE LIKELIHOOD; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; COMPETITION; POLICIES; FARMERS; SEARCH; LAW	Suppliers of agricultural output incur switching costs (SCs) when choosing new buyers, allowing buyers to exercise oligopsonistic market power, as SCs help buyers to mark down prices for incumbent suppliers. This article conceptualizes the idea of SCs and suggests an empirical strategy for quantifying them through an estimation of farm supply to specific buyers. The model incorporates price differences between buyers, revealing buyers' anticipations of suppliers' SCs. The approach is applied to the Indonesian rubber market, employing a data set of daily purchasing prices and less frequent quantities of individual sales instances. Results indicate that SCs exist and are at about 3% of the farm gate price, leading to substantial redistribution from suppliers to buyers of agricultural output.

The findings from the descriptive case study's primary survey data indicated that the informal recycling economy in these regions has little to no barriers of entry. Initiatives to absorb individuals into this economy could potentially help decrease the unemployment level of unskilled and lowly educated people. On average, SWPs earn about R155 for a day's waste and R632 for a week's waste. The econometric results revealed that SWPs from the coloured population group who do not have access to trolleys yield statistically significantly lower earnings.

J	Afsahhosseini, F; Al-Mulla, Y				Afsahhosseini, Fatemehalsadat; Al-Mulla, Yaseen			Smart, hybrid and context-aware POI mobile recommender system in tourism in Oman	JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Tourism; Oman; ICT; Smart; Recommender system; Sustainable development goals	LOCATION; GUIDE	Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the knowledge gap and future opportunities for developing mobile recommender system in tourism sector that lead to comfortable, targeted and attractive tourism. A recommender system improves the traditional classification algorithms and has incorporated many advanced machine learning algorithms. Design/methodology/approach Design of this application followed a smart, hybrid and context-aware recommender system, which includes various recommender systems. With the recommender system's help, useful management for time and budget is obtained for tourists, since they usually have financial and time constraints for selecting the point of interests (POIs) and so more purposeful trip planned with decreased traffic and air pollution. Findings The finding of this research showed that the inclusion of additional information about the item, user, circumstances, objects or conditions and the environment could significantly impact recommendation quality and information and communications technology has become one part of the tourism value chain. Practical implications The application consists of (1) registration: with/without social media accounts, (2) user information: country, gender, age and his/her specific interests, (3) context data: available time, alert, price, spend time, weather, location, transportation. Social implications The study's social implications include connecting the app and registration through social media to a more social relationship, with its textual reviews, or user review as user-generated content for increasing accuracy. Originality/value The originality of this research work lies on introducing a new content- and knowledge-based algorithm for POI recommendations. An "Alert" context emphasizing on safety, supplies and essential infrastructure is considered as a novel context for this application.

We have five main findings. (1) The initial lockdown regulations declared as "essential" the product (vertical) value chains but left as "inessential" the important "lateral" value chains delivering labour, materials, and logistics to the segments of the vertical value chains. This hurt the three vertical value chains as constraints in the laterals choked key segments of the verticals. (2) Vulnerability of the whole value chain emanated from vulnerability to shocks of critical "hotspot" linchpin segments (such as livestock auctions) or infrastructure (such as at ports). (3) Collective, industry-level "pivoting" was crucial both to organize the private sector response and to interact with government to course-correct on COVID-19 policies. (4) Responses to pre-COVID-19 challenges (such as drought and international phytosanitary rule changes) had prepared the beef and citrus value chain actors to respond collectively to the pandemic challenges. (5) Individual firm- and segment-level "pivoting" was also crucial for resilience, such as cattle auctions going on-line with the help of e-commerce firms.

J	Masoumi, H; Farahani, B; Aliee, FS				Masoumi, Hadi; Farahani, Bahar; Aliee, Fereidoon Shams			Systematic and ontology-based approach to interoperable cross-domain open government data services	TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT- PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY			English	Article; Early Access						Ontology; Open data; Open government data; Data interoperability; Government data publishing; Semantic data; Data quality; Semantic data	PUBLICATION; GENERATION	Purpose Open government data (OGD) has emerged as a radical paradigm shift and endeavor among government administrations across the world mainly due to its promises of transparency, accountability, public-private collaboration, civic participation, social innovation and data-driven value creation. Complexity, cross-cutting nature, diversity of data sets, interoperability and quality issues usually hamper unlocking the full potential value of data. To tackle these challenges, this paper aims to provide a novel solution using a top-down approach. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors propose a systematic ontology-based approach combined with a novel architecture and its corresponding processes enabling organizations to carry out all the steps in the OGD value chain. In addition, an OGD Platform including a portal (www.iranopendata.ir) and a data management system (www.ogdms.iranopendata.ir) are developed to showcase the proposed solution. Findings The efficiency and the applicability of the solution are evaluated by a real-life use case on energy consumption of the buildings of the city of Tehran, Iran. Finally, a comparison was made with existing solutions, and the results show the proposed approach is able to address the existing gaps in the literature. Originality/value The results imply that modeling and designing the data model, as well as exploiting an ontology-based approach are critical pillars to create rich, relevant and well-described OGD data sets. Moreover, clarity on processes, roles and responsibilities are the key factors influencing the quality of the published data services. Thus, to the best of the knowledge, this is the first study that exploits and considers an ontology-based approach in a top-down manner to create OGD data sets.

In assessing Industry 4.0 technologies, this study found that buyer-supplier visibility and buyer-supplier integration matters more than the digital technologies used.	RESEARCH-TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Digital technologies; Supply chain; Buyer-supplier relationship; Industry 4; 0	CHAIN INTEGRATION; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; RFID ADOPTION; BIG DATA; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT; ANALYTICS; INTERNET	Overview: Business leaders often consider digital technologies an enabler of new business models and market opportunities, but they often overlook their potential impact on the entire value chain. Considering three Industry 4.0 technologies-big data analytics and cloud computing, track and tracing, and simulation and modeling software-we identify the opportunities and challenges that emerge in the context of managing supply chain relationships. This study uses data from an international survey to test how these three Industry 4.0 technologies increase visibility and integration between buyers and suppliers and how they impact supply chain performance. Our results show mixed evidence: although all three technologies directly improve supply chain performance, big data analytics and cloud computing and simulation and modeling also fully support collaborative supply chain models, while track and tracing tools create more visible supply chains but are detrimental to obtaining higher process integration with suppliers. Surprisingly, buyer-supplier collaboration, in terms of visibility and integration, matters more than the technologies themselves.

Contract farming has extended the footprint of commodity production and integrated land and labour not otherwise captured in forms of direct production and marketing. 25 years after the publication of Living Under Contract: Contract Farming and Agrarian Transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa, a foundational collection edited by Peter Little and Michael Watts, it is necessary to take stock of the most prominent developments in the practice of contract farming and in the political economy literature studying it. The ultimate contribution of Living Under Contract was framing contract farming as expressing the unevenness of power relations in agriculture and grounding it in specific political, historical and social contexts that were not examined in the mainstream accounts. This introduction to the special issue revisits the questions that have remained relevant or re-emerged in the political economy literature on contract farming; it raises new questions that reflect contemporary developments and it explains how the papers in this collection contribute to the expansion of the theoretical and empirical horizons of the research on contemporary contract farming in low and middle-income countries.

J	Havardi-Burger, N; Mempel, H; Bitsch, V				Havardi-Burger, Nirit; Mempel, Heike; Bitsch, Vera			Framework for sustainability assessment of the value chain of flowering potted plants for the German market	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Agriculture; Floriculture; Horticulture; Indicators; Ornamental plants; Supply chain	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; JOB-SATISFACTION; INDICATORS; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; TOOLS	The value chain of flowering potted plants (FPP) is associated with environmental, social and economic sustainability challenges. Indicator-based assessment methods can provide insights into sustainability performance of agricultural value chains. The FPP value chain is not comparable to other agricultural systems and therefore cannot be assessed with existing indicator-based tools. In this study, a framework was developed for sustainability assessment of the FPP value chain, from breeding to distribution. The development of the framework involved defining sustainability themes and subthemes based on the characterization of the value chain and the investigation of social, environmental and economic sustainability challenges. The generic sustainability assessment tools, Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) and Response-Inducing Sustainability Evaluation (RISE), provided the foundation for indicator selection and development. The current study emphasized the need for a system-specific view, especially in unique systems such as the FPP value chain, because generic assessment tools, such as SAFA and RISE, do not cover all sustainability subthemes. Most of the indicators missing from generic assessment tools were environmental indicators. Environmental assessment is closely related to value chain stages and product-specific processes, therefore indicators were allocated according to the value chain stages, breeding, production and distribution. Social sustainability themes are influenced by national and regional socio-economic conditions, such as government provision of healthcare and a social safety net. Therefore, indicators are allocated based on geographical regions and stakeholder groups. The economic subthemes are determined by industry structure and sector-specific conditions. The ornamental sector is characterized by low margins and high uncertainty, related to profitability and vulnerability. Despite the initial evaluation performed in the current study, in the next step, industry actors need to determine the feasibility of the indicators. The implementation of the framework developed in the current study will provide further insights into the value chain, which will guide actors in taking actions for performance improvement and provide guidance for policy-makers in setting sustainability targets.

The conservation of coffee genetic resources is essential to provide the raw materials for breeding and improvement of the crop. Many genetic resources of wild arabica coffee have been collected in the second half of the 20th century by several international collecting missions, including by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, ORSTOM (now IRD), Centre de cooperation internationale en recherche agronomique pour le developpement (CIRAD), and IPGRI (now Bioversity International), and are conserved in several national genebanks and at the CATIE International Coffee Collection (CICC) in Turrialba, Costa Rica. Over the past decades, many of the original accessions of the CICC have become threatened due to age, pests and diseases, inadequate management, and waterlogging. There is thus an urgent need to rejuvenate and rationalize the collection to ensure the long-term maintenance of the genetic diversity of the original accessions. Here we present the methodological approach we followed to carry out an in-depth assessment of the status of the coffee collection at CATIE and to prioritize accession-specific actions for the rationalization of the collection. This can be used as a model for other collections to assess and rationalize their own field genebank, with a view to improving their management in the most cost-effective way. The study identified many discrepancies between the number of accessions in the field and genebank records and revealed that 80 accessions have been lost from the collection since 2014 and that approximately 80% of the accessions were threatened and in need of intervention. Furthermore, the in-depth study identified the most diverse and valued accessions for the rationalization of the CICC field genebank and those that are in urgent need of safety duplication.

J	Forslund, H; Mattsson, SA				Forslund, Helena; Mattsson, Stig-Arne			Strategies for achieving customer order flexibility - supplier perspective	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Customer order flexibility; Order-to-delivery process; Enabling strategies	VALUE CHAIN FLEXIBILITY; MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY	Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a framework of strategies to achieving customer order flexibility in and related to the order-to-delivery (OTD) process. The purpose is also to investigate how companies prioritize various strategies to achieve customer order flexibility. Design/methodology/approach Based on a literature review, pre-tests and conceptual reasoning, a conceptual framework of strategies related to the order-to-delivery process was developed. The strategies were linked to the order quantity and delivery lead-time flexibility dimensions. This structure resulted in six groups covering enabling as well as remedial strategies. An empirical interview study of ten customer-supplier relationships was conducted. Findings The interviews identified additional strategies, thereby expanding the framework. The enabling strategies with the highest median values were "have continuous contact with the customer's purchaser" and "use safety stock of raw materials/semi-finished products". The remedial strategy with the highest median was "re-plan/re-prioritize the order backlog". In the delivery sub-process, it was more common to apply remedial strategies for delivery lead-time than for order quantities. Research limitations/implications The developed framework is a contribution to the literature on operational flexibility in and related to the OTD process. It complements existing knowledge by taking a supplier perspective. Practical implications Suppliers can use the framework as a tool to understand and systematically achieve better customer order flexibility in and related to the OTD process. Customers can use the framework as a checklist for supplier evaluation and supplier development. Originality/value Few identified studies include empirical data on customer order flexibility.

Ethical opportunities in deep-sea collection of polymetallic nodules from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Deep-sea mining; Ethical opportunities and choices; Metals for renewable energy; Planetary perspective; Polymetallic nodules	ECOSYSTEM; RESOURCE; SERVICES; OCEAN; AREA; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; ENVIRONMENT; DISTURBANCE; IMPACTS	Infrastructure supporting the transition of human societies from fossil fuels to renewable energy will require hundreds of millions of tons of metals. Polymetallic nodules on the abyssal seabed of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), eastern North Pacific Ocean, could provide them. We focus on ethical considerations and opportunities available to the novel CCZ nodule-collection industry, integrating robust science with strong pillars of social and environmental responsibility. Ethical considerations include harm to sea life and recovery time, but also the value of human life, indigenous rights, rights of nature, animal rights, intrinsic values, and intangible ecosystem services. A "planetary perspective" considers the biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, extends beyond mineral extraction to a life-cycle view of impacts, and includes local, national, and global impacts and stakeholders. Stakeholders include direct nodule-collection actors, ocean conservationists, companies, communities, interest groups, nations, and citizens globally, plus counterfactual stakeholders involved with or affected by intensification of terrestrial mining if ocean metals are not used. Nodule collection would harm species and portions of ecosystems, but could have lower life-cycle impacts than terrestrial mining expansion, especially if nodule-metal producers explicitly design for it and stakeholders hold them accountable. Participants across the value chain can elevate the role of ethics in strategic objective setting, engineering design optimization, commitments to stakeholders, democratization of governance, and fostering of circular economies. The International Seabed Authority is called to establish equitable and transparent distribution of royalties and gains, and continue engaging scientists, economists, and experts from all spheres in optimizing deep-sea mineral extraction for humans and nature. Nodule collection presents a unique opportunity for an ambitious reset of ecological norms in a nascent industry. Embracing ethical opportunities can set an example for industrial-scale activities on land and sea, accelerate environmental gains through environmental competition with land ores, and hasten civilization's progress toward a sustainable future.

J	Lopez, T; Riedler, T; Kohnen, H; Futterer, M				Lopez, Tatiana; Riedler, Tim; Koehnen, Heiner; Fuetterer, Michael			Digital value chain restructuring and labour process transformations in the fast-fashion sector: Evidence from the value chains of Zara & H&M	GLOBAL NETWORKS-A JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article; Early Access						digital Taylorism; digitalization; fast-fashion; global value chains; labour process; value chain restructuring	APPAREL; GOVERNANCE; INDUSTRY; PLACE; WORK	In this article, we combine a workplace-centred Labour Process Theory approach with a multi-level Global Value Chain perspective to link digital labour process transformations in the fast-fashion value chain to broader dynamics of digital value chain restructuring. Drawing on a case study of H&M and Zara, we show how these retailers' digital supply chain management strategies are linked to the de-skilling, standardization and rationalization of tasks and to the emergence of new digital forms of labour control in production, logistics and retail. At the same time, we find that the effects of these transformations on working conditions are mediated by workers' position in the value chain as well as by gender and capital-labour power relations. The article contributes to debates on value chains and digitalization by revealing how, under digital capitalism, the ability to control and digitally integrate labour processes in complex store, logistics and manufacturing networks represents a key source of power in buyer-driven value chains.

J	McGrath, D; Plummer, R; Bowen, A				McGrath, Darby; Plummer, Ryan; Bowen, Amy			Cultivating our urban forest future: a value-chain perspective	FACETS			English	Article						resilience; biodiversity; species richness; climate change; tree selection; urban forest	GREEN SPACE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NURSERY PRODUCTION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; NORTH-AMERICA; TREE CANOPY; BENEFITS; CHALLENGES; DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS	For cities to grow their urban forest canopy the formula appears rather straightforward: the right trees, plus the right conditions, plus the right care equals success. These simplified "tree chain of custody" steps, however, represent activities within a complex value-chain in Canada. Given that there is heightened demand for urban tree planting as natural climate solutions become the norm, how can we prepare the value-chain to meet these demands? To answer this question, we outline the pathways by which trees presently go from nurseries into urban and peri-urban areas. Delineating the actors, roles, and present barriers to success exposes the complexity of the process and relationships in the value-chain, as there are distinct phases with multiple actor groups involved who influence, and are influenced, by one another. We explore the issues that pose prominent challenges to, as well as opportunities for, the value-chain. Emergent themes include communication, forecasting demand and timing, underpricing and undervaluing tree establishment, lack of awareness on the importance of soils, juvenile tree health, species selection, and gaps in evidence-based decision support tools. The touchstones of science and innovation, collaboration, and knowledge mobilization are pertinent for the value-chain in Canada to draw upon to navigate the future.

Holistic Valorization of Hemp through Reductive Catalytic Fractionation	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						Hemp hurd; Lignin; Biomass valorization; Reductive catalytic fractionation; Organosolv pulping; Dissolving pulp; Nanocellulose; Monophenolic compounds	LIGNOCELLULOSE FRACTIONATION; LIGNIN DEPOLYMERIZATION; COTTON; PLATFORM; ENERGY	Despite the increased use of hemp fiber, negligible attention has been given to upgrade the hemp hurd, which constitutes up to 70 wt % of the hemp stalk and is currently considered a low-value byproduct. In this work, valorization of hemp hurd was performed by reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) in the presence of a metal catalyst. We found an unexpectedly high yield of monophenolic compounds (38.3 wt %) corresponding to above 95% of the theoretical maximum yield. The high yield is explained by both a thin cell wall and high S-lignin content. In addition, organosolv pulping was performed to generate a pulp that was bleached to produce dissolving-grade pulp suitable for textile fiber production (viscosity, 898 mL/g; ISO-brightness, 90.2%) and nanocellulose. Thus, we have demonstrated a novel value chain from a low-value side stream of hemp fiber manufacture that has the potential to increase textile fiber production with 100% yield and also give bio-oil for green chemicals.

J	Sidarto, LP; Hamka, A				Sidarto, Larissa P.; Hamka, Aditya			Improving Halal Traceability Process in the Poultry Industry Utilizing Blockchain Technology: Use Case in Indonesia	FRONTIERS IN BLOCKCHAIN			English	Article						blockchain; decentralization; halal traceability; poultry; transparency; supply chains		Demand for Halal food has significantly increased with the growing Muslim population and society's interest in sustainable food production. However, there has been an increase in concerns regarding the Halal food labeling transparency process, with misleading labels found across the world. Blockchain-based traceability systems are a potential solution for current limitations in monitoring the production process of food due to its inherent decentralization and immutable nature. The technology allows stakeholders, including consumers, to promote farm-to-fork transparency, where traceability is a core component. This paper will explore the blockchain-based traceability system use case implemented by the Indonesian poultry player PT Sreeya Sewu Indonesia Tbk. Utilizing a blockchain-based system as a foundation for traceability shows promising results: data throughout the process is recorded permanently and difficult to tamper. Although the system does not eliminate the possibility of incorrect information being recorded, the same immutability characteristics will keep the new knowledge of fraud permanent if found during the audit. This layer of accountability contributes to the transparency that benefits both the consumers and stakeholders of the value chain.

Precisely, although the literature suggests that firms are pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are limited insights on their strategy to implement them in the context of developing countries. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive large-scale investigation of 2030 Agenda adoption by Brazilian companies. Accordingly, the analysis of our multicase study reveals (1) variations on the business opportunities brought by the SDGs depending on the firm position in the value chain, (2) which SDGs and target stakeholders are addressed through corporate policies and practices, (3) the different ways firms embrace the SDGs to pursue ambidexterity. Our findings clarify how firms in the developing countries interpret the institutional pressures and assemble their internal resources to respond to the SDGs challenges. Boundary conditions and policy implications are further discussed.

J	Phan, QA				Phan, Quang Anh			Operating and localising online games in Vietnam: the industry's perspective	CREATIVE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Entrepreneur; localisation; operation; online game; Vietnam	CHINA SOFT POWER; LOCALIZATION	This paper examines the experience of Vietnamese game companies in operating and localising online games in Vietnam. The findings were retrieved by analysing the interview results with leaders and experts of notable game companies in Vietnam who know profoundly and broadly about the industry. The main themes include the operational flow of the industry and the localisation process. The analysis reveals that another factor that can be added to the value chain in the current intra-Asian market is Vietnam since this country has deeply engaged with the process of producing and distributing online games. Their operational procedure and localising process also display some distinctive patterns that are analysed in depth.

Within agriculture, which is the focus of this paper, AI is working with converging technologies, particularly data optimization, to add value along the entire agricultural value chain, including procurement, farm automation, and market access, Our key takeaway is that, despite the promising opportunities for development, there are actual and potential challenges that African countries need to consider in deciding whether to scale up or down the application of AI in agriculture. Input from African innovators, policymakers, and academics is essential to ensure that Ai solutions are aligned with African needs and priorities. This paper proposes questions that can be used to form a road map to inform research and development in this area.

Constructively Engaging Exploitive Waste Management in India: The Case of Paryavaran Mitra and its Justice Motivated Effort at Empowering Rag-Picking Women	JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING			English	Article; Early Access						constructive engagement; integrative justice model; waste management; poor consumer; subsistence consumers; bottom-of-the pyramid; social enterprise; India; poverty; justice	CIRCULAR ECONOMY; SYSTEMS; MODEL; POOR	Constructive Engagement (CE) aims at developing sustainable and equitable marketing systems that ensure collective well-being. This paper reflects on an initiative that constructively engages with impoverished market actors, i.e., rag-picking women in India. It is endeavored by operationalizing Integrative Justice Model (IJM) principles while trying to tackle the issue of solid waste management. Our findings suggest that CE across the spectrum in the value chain is required to alleviate the conditions of disadvantaged market actors and improve their well-being. Our qualitative inquiry in rag-picking women's lives and an initiative of social enterprise contribute to the ongoing conversation in macromarketing literature- (1) by empirically evidencing how the CE operationalizes the IJM and help redress the issues of social traps and internalities; (2) by uniquely connecting the macro issues of waste management with the issues of honesty, fairness, dignity and deserved justice in the neglected market transactions; (3) that IJM principles guide the constructive engagement process.

Drawing on the strategic view of CSR and global value chain (GVC) perspective, we argue that the outward internationalisation of emerging market firms (EMFs) may impede their home donation, partly because as they internationalise, they are mainly embedded in the low-end positions of the GVC, which negatively affect the motivation and capability of their donation to the home market. Such a relationship is even stronger for EMFs with a lower level of R&D intensity, possibly indicating these firms may be more deeply embedded in the low-end position of the GVC. We tested our theory using data collected from public-listed firms in China, and our results can thus help us understand why some EMFs tend to not make home donations from the consideration of GVC embeddedness. Contributions towards GVC embedment and stakeholder considerations are discussed.

Tuna is women's business too: Applying a gender lens to four cases in the Western and Central Pacific	FISH AND FISHERIES			English	Article; Early Access						equality and equity; gender division of labour; gendered value chains; inclusive fisheries policy; just work in fisheries; tuna industries		The USD6 billion Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) tuna fisheries produce over half the world's tuna and are important for coastal countries. Tuna fisheries policy, management and research currently focus on fisheries resources and industrial fishing on offshore vessels with all male crews, although women, as much as men, are employed in tuna processing and trading in domestic, informal and export value chains. We apply a gender lens to four WCPO case-study tuna industries: Suva and Levuka in Fiji, Bitung in Indonesia, General Santos City in the Philippines and Western Province including Noro in Solomon Islands. The gender divisions of labour, livelihood opportunities and social impacts vary greatly across the value chain nodes, depending on the size, quantity and quality of fish handled, and the scale of operations. The gender lens also reveals the social impacts of fishing when husbands/fathers/sons are killed or injured, absent for long periods and engage in sex, drugs and alcohol behaviours in port. Despite the centrality of women in tuna industries, and the gendered social impacts, regional and national policies largely omit gender. The tuna discourse should be broadened from that of male-dominated industrial fishing to whole of value chains including domestic and informal enterprises in which women are equally involved. Progress on gender equity needs collaboration by multiple stakeholders including industrial firms employing people in factories, offices and on fishing vessels, regional bodies and national governments responsible for policy, monitoring and regulation, and research agencies to build knowledge.

J	Grisaffi, T				Grisaffi, Thomas			Why Is the Drug Trade Not Violent? Cocaine Production and the Embedded Economy in the Chapare, Bolivia	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article; Early Access							MORAL ECONOMY; ERADICATION; REPRESSION; POLITICS; GANGS	Bolivia is a centre for drug production and trafficking and yet it experiences far less drug-related violence than other countries in Latin America that form part of cocaine's commodity chain. Drawing upon more than three years of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2005 and 2019, this article presents evidence from the Chapare, a coca-growing and drug processing region in central Bolivia, to consider why this is the case. Building from the literature on embedded economies and the subsistence ethic of peasant communities, the article demonstrates that the drug trade is part of a local moral order that prioritizes kinship, reciprocal relations and community well-being, facilitated by the cultural significance of the coca leaf. This has served to limit possibilities for the violence that is often associated with drug production and trafficking.

J	Toure, JMF; Chevalier, P; Bourgoin, J				Toure, Jean Marie Fode; Chevalier, Pascal; Bourgoin, Jeremy			Territorial embeddedness of the Senegalese rice value chain contractual model: geographical and relational perspectives	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Article						Senegal; agricultural value chains; contract farming; value chain governance; rice		To meet the challenges of African agriculture, particularly food self-sufficiency, job creation and wealth, the agricultural contract model is being promoted by some governments and international donors in the framework of a performative discourse on the virtues of partnerships between agro-industries and producers. However, agricultural contracts give rise to contradictory interpretations. Some see it as a model that would have spillover effects on the rural economy, while others see it as a strategy of predation of agricultural resources, which is harmful to local communities. On both sides, analyses remain focused on ethical and sometimes ideological issues. The operating conditions of the contracts and their impacts in terms of development are little addressed. Our contribution, based on sociological surveys conducted in Senegal, aims at objectively characterizing the forms of interaction (positive or negative) between agricultural contracts and the development of the territories where the rice sector is located. On the basis of these issues of articulation between agricultural development and territorial development, we are proposing a methodological approach to carry out this type of diagnosis. At the scale of the regions dominated by rice growing, we highlight that the territorial trajectories are contrasted in relation to the interaction between the agricultural model and territorial development. This diagnosis is interpreted through the knowledge of the systems of actors, in particular with the help of two indicators, namely centrality, which gives an indication of the issues of territorial governance, and the density of social relations, which provides information on the importance of the agricultural contract in relation to other modes of relationship building. With regard to the insertion of agricultural contracts, the structure of the networks of actors makes it possible to identify a centralized mode of governance at the level of the national agricultural bank and a few agro-industrial enterprises. Nevertheless, informal relationships and traditional local structures (families, friends, neighbors) persist and function in parallel with the agricultural contract, calling into question the political discourse regarding the transformative potential of agricultural contracts.

Fisheries in developing nations are one such sector where the complexity is not only due to the produce being perishable but also due to the livelihood dependence of others in the coastal regions that belong to the section of economically disadvantaged. This paper explains the contextual challenges of fish supply chain in a developing country and describes how integrating disruptive technologies can address those challenges. Through a positive deviance approach, we show how firms can help unorganized supply chains with economically disadvantaged suppliers by carefully redesigning the supply chain through the integration of satellite imagery and blockchain technology. With COVID-19 in the backdrop, we highlight how such technologies significantly improves the supply chain resilience and at the same time contributes to the income generating opportunities of poor fisherfolks in developing nations. Our study has important implications to both developing markets and food supply chain practitioners as this paper tackles issues such as perishability, demand-supply mismatch, unfair prices, and quality related data transparency in the entire value chain.

However, much less attention has been given to the socio-economic considerations of dietary transitions. This study analyses the socio-economic performance of innovative legume-based food prototypes, developed in the Protein2Food research project, and conventional animal-based products (chicken meat and dairy milk). We implement a social life cycle assessment (sLCA) to quantify and compare their potential socio-economic impacts along the entire life cycle. RESULTS Findings from this analysis show that legume-based prototypes and their respective animal-based counterparts have, overall, a comparable socio-economic performance. Looking at the disaggregated life cycle stages, socio-economic hotspots (points of most negative impacts) were mainly identified at the production stage in legume-based products. Farm-level net margin and profitability are low when compared with their animal equivalents. However, at the processing stage, there are socio-economic gains for plant-based products regarding lower unemployment rates. Finally, at the consumption stage, there are mixed results. Plant-based products show worse protein affordability but better nutritional contents (lower saturated fat and cholesterol) than their animal counterparts. CONCLUSIONS To improve socio-economic performance of legume-based foods, greater emphasis should be placed upon developing improved processing technologies and supply chains. This would broaden the supply of sustainable protein-rich food options and make these products more economically attractive. The research illustrates that policies should be targeted to the different stages of the food value chain to optimize the development of innovative plant-based foods. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The current demand for milk in Zimbabwe stands at 130 million liters, and there is a national capacity for processing 400 million liters per annum. This study used literature, stakeholder inputs and expert knowledge to provide a perspective on practical options to reduce the national milk deficit and, simultaneously, accelerate the transition to a sustainable dairy value chain in Zimbabwe. Following a discussion on the key barriers and constraints to developing the milk value chain, we explored opportunities to improve the performance of the underperforming smallholder and medium-scale dairy farmers. Specifically, we discussed innovative management, creative policy instruments and alternative technological options to maximize milk production in Zimbabwe. We also highlight the need for an inclusive and creatively organized dairy value chain to optimize stakeholder linkages and improve information flow and equity. Examples of crucial investments and incentive structures for upgrading the existing value chain and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and carbon uptake are discussed. Furthermore, the socio-economic effects (i.e., profitability, women empowerment and employment creation), milk quality, safety and traceability issues linked to a better organized and performing dairy value chain are highlighted.

Operational and strategic change during temporary turbulence: evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic	OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						COVID-19; Environmental turbulence; Operational change; Strategic change; Temporary turbulence	VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS; ENVIRONMENTAL TURBULENCE; BUSINESS MODEL; ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CAUSAL TEXTURE; MANAGEMENT; POWER; EXPLORATION; GOVERNANCE	Environmental turbulence is a well-studied contingency of relationships involving firm strategy, structure, and performance. However, it is invariably regarded as a present condition of indeterminate duration. Indeed, some industries are regarded turbulent by their nature with little regard for past, present, or future. What of environmental turbulence which is high in level but short in duration? An empirical study is conducted in the COVID-19 context to investigate how firms respond operationally and strategically to what is perceived to be temporary turbulence. Predictors of both operational and strategic change are found to include the level of turbulence and the firm's prior experience making changes. The types of operational change associated with performance improvement are adjusting production levels and budgets/spending. The type of strategic change associated with performance improvement is targeting new customers or markets. A conceptual framework incorporating both the level and duration of turbulence is proposed for future study.

Such certification may help to secure the competitiveness of smallholder farmers in domestic markets for staple crops in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in the face of rising competition with high quality imports. Yet, while frequent in high value export crops, quality certification is still rare for staple crops. To understand why this discrepancy persists, we develop a model with four sufficient conditions for the functionality of certification in a value chain-willingness to pay for quality by downstream agents, upstream competition among traders with pass-through of quality-price premiums to farmers, existence of cost-effective certification, and farmers' capacity to respond to certification by enhancing quality. We show that if these conditions hold, certification should theoretically lead to farmers receiving higher prices for higher quality goods, increasing investment in quality-enhancing inputs, and experiencing welfare gains in response to this quality enhancement. To see if these conditions and results hold in practice, we turn to evidence from a country-level diagnostic survey and from results obtained by others. We find that while certification systems exist in most countries surveyed, evidence of downstream willingness to pay for quality and of price premiums paid to farmers for quality is uneven. However, in cases where quality price premiums do exist, we find evidence that producers respond by enhancing quality. We conclude that policymakers can promote quality certification in staple chains by first ensuring that the four conditions we identify hold.

The proposed framework was developed by applying the systems engineering six-step method and validated through empirical findings from the NSVC. The framework's application highlighted and analyzed the presence of the SDGs in corporate sustainability reports, academic curriculum, research, and governmental policies. This study uncovered the complexity-reduction elements within the system that drive SDG integration and assure their progress. The SDGs provide a global context for sustainability endeavors in the NSVC. A globally expanded value chain has an organic relationship with global sustainability terms and schemes. The existing practice of corporate sustainability annual reporting was found to be a significant channel for SDG communication. The novelty of this study was that it proposed a mind-map to understand SDG integration within an industrial value chain abstracted into three concepts: commitment, communication, and performance measurability.

The general objective of this study is to demonstrate how knowledge management is related to the level of academic performance in students of the Tourism Career of the Universidad Regional Autonoma de Los Andes, Ecuador. The dimensions of knowledge management are established as the acquisition of knowledge and the use of knowledge, although the rest of the processes of the knowledge management value chain (knowledge organization, knowledge dissemination and knowledge measurement) are also considered. The research presented is non-experimental, cross-sectional, has a mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative) and its scope is correlational, since its objective is to identify the relationships between two variables. It works with a sample of 49 students of the Tourism Career; a questionnaire is applied that has as precedents the study of 18 questionnaires of knowledge management audit; and, the academic performance is evaluated, according to the forms of evaluation developed in the career. Among the main results, the influence of adequate knowledge management on the academic performance of the students of the Tourism Career is evidenced.

Global Value Chains of COVID-19 Materials: A Weighted Directed Network Analysis	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						global value chain; complex networks; weighted directed networks; COVID-19 goods; personal protective equipment; degree; entropy	GOVERNANCE; TRADE	The COVID-19 pandemic caused a boom in demand for personal protective equipment, or so-called "COVID-19 goods", around the world. We investigate three key sectoral global value chain networks, namely, "chemicals", "rubber and plastics", and "textiles", involved in the production of these goods. First, we identify the countries that export a higher value added share than import, resulting in a "value added surplus". Then, we assess their value added flow diversification using entropy. Finally, we analyze their egonets in order to identify their key affiliates. The relevant networks were constructed from the World Input-Output Database. The empirical results reveal that the USA had the highest surplus in "chemicals", Japan in "rubber and plastics", and China in "textiles". Concerning value added flows, the USA was highly diversified in "chemicals", Germany in "rubber and plastics", and Italy in "textiles". From the analysis of egonets, we found that the USA was the key supplier in all sectoral networks under consideration. Our work provides meaningful conclusions about trade outperformance due to the fact of surplus, trade flow robustness due to the fact of diversification, and trade partnerships due to the egonets analysis.

After several years of growth however, since 2013 seaweed production has declined. Malaysia's research and development has developed a strong understanding of the biological and macroeconomic aspects of seaweed cultivation, but research has focused less on socio-economic aspects of the carrageenan value chain, including its labour force. Previous studies have provided insights into the contribution of migrants to seaweed production in Malaysia. To further understand the constraints faced by seaweed farmers' and examine why seaweed production is currently declining, this study uses an intersectional lens to document farmers' experiences based on their citizenship status and the impacts their status has on seaweed production. It relies on a mixed-methods analysis of key informant interviews, questionnaire surveys and document analysis, as well as on the conceptual framework of VCA-New Institutional Environment-Structure (NIES). Findings suggest that migrants have a significant role in upstream activities, contributing substantially to seaweed cultivation, yet, they face a number of legal, financial and institutional constraints that restrict their productivity and participation in marketing activities. To recognise and support migrant seaweed farmers would not only improve the accuracy of official statistics, it would also support policymakers to strengthen the seaweed industry through adequate regulations and tailored incentives.

In the context of globalization and interstate and regional economic unions, this will lead to achieving the maximum end-to-end integration of digital platforms. Based on the analysis, the article presents the integration of digital logistics and marketing approaches with the mathematical models of the ecosystem organization of economic relations. The features of the organization of economic relations between contractors involved in the execution of virtual transactions and the material movement of resources were analyzed. The researchers considered prerequisites for the analytical description of interconnections between the participants of digital platforms in cross border e-commerce. The authors' approach is based on the idea of both a sales funnel in marketing and a conversion funnel in digital transformation. Considering the integration of logistics and marketing, authors offer the definition of business echelons as stages of the consumer value creation. The theoretical contribution of this article consists in constructing a mathematical description of business echelons along the entire value chain. The developed analytical description of business echelons is acceptable both for embedding a digital management support system into various software products, and for conducting in-depth analysis and finding optimal solutions.

Several stakeholders in the construction value chain can contribute to this effort. Therefore, this work quantifies the influence of various decisions made by different stakeholders on the global warming potential (GWP) of a reinforced concrete structure. These decisions include the structural design, material embodied impact, transportation distances, and construction practices. Herein, each decision is modelled as an uncertainty source and its contribution to the total uncertainty of the structure's GWP is assessed. Two scenarios are considered: businessas-usual, which only considers conventional concrete mix design, and an innovation scenario, which also considers the option of high-filler low-water concrete. In the business-as-usual scenario, the structure's GWP varies from 162 t CO2e to 324 t CO2e, and the most influential decision is the structural design, which accounts for 59% of the total uncertainty, followed by decisions associated with materials production and supplier selection. Meanwhile, in the innovation scenario, the structure's GWP varies from 124 t CO2e to 324 t CO(2)e(,) wherein the choice between conventional and the innovative concrete mix design is the most influential decision, contributing 59% of the total uncertainty. Overall, the relative importance of stakeholders can be identified to prioritise improvement measures, including implementing innovative technologies.

Sectoral interactions are crucial and dependent on contextual and technological factors, as well as firm-specific characteristics. This paper examines the determinants of firm diversification towards a new technology and their role in sectoral interactions. We combine concepts from technological innovation systems (TIS), sectoral innovation systems and organization studies to examine the drivers of actors' entry as well as their impact on systems' formation, through the effect on intersectoral relations associated with technological variety and relatedness. The development and demonstration of marine renewable energy technologies (MRET) in Portugal over the past two decades provides the empirical case. A database of 237 companies includes responses from a survey of a large part of the actors involved in MRET and potential entrants. A standard binary logit model estimates the effect of a set of drivers of firms' entry in MRET. Firms are more driven by variety-led factors and technology maturity, than by their technological capacity and sectoral proximity. We derive implications for policy and theory, namely for the conceptualization of inter-sectoral relations in TIS.

Ex-ante evaluation of interventions to upgrade pork value chains in Southern Myanmar	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Spatial group model building; Poverty alleviation; System dynamics; Agribusiness value chain; Myanmar	POLICY OPTIONS; COOPERATIVES; AFRICA	CONTEXT: Myanmar has made rapid economic progress since the country began its transition to a more integrated market economy in the late 2000s. Although these gains are led by positive developments in the agricultural sector, agricultural productivity and profitability are among the lowest in Asia with high rates of poverty especially in rural areas. Small-scale farms dominate rural livelihoods in Myanmar, especially for the 87% of Myanmar's poor who live in rural areas. Hence, these small-scale farms are critical development leverage points as they are an important source of rural incomes to both farm and non-farm households. OBJECTIVE: This study is part of a larger, five-year agricultural research and development project intended to upgrade pork and rice value chains and strengthen rural livelihoods in southern Myanmar's Tanintharyi Region. We evaluated producer-focused interventions to upgrade the pork value chain using tools that consider the dynamic , complex nature of the chain. METHODS: This research used systems thinking and participatory methods to develop a system dynamics model of the pork value chain in southern Myanmar. The model integrated modules of animal production, marketing, investment, finance , collective action. Scenario analysis with the model guided recommendations for pro -poor interventions for implementation within the five-year development project. RESULTS , CONCLUSIONS: Simulation results indicated that a mix of technical interventions implemented by functional producer groups showed promise in delivering sustained financial benefits to the target community and outperformed the short-term gains generated by these interventions in the absence of collective action. The model also highlighted specific interventions, such as improved financial services, animal health workers, and training that enabled poorer households to benefit from pig livelihoods while reducing risks from environmental and economic shocks. Within complex agri-food systems such as the pork value chain in Tanintharyi, a multi -pronged intervention strategy is recommended to address problems faced by small-scale agribusiness value chain participants. SIGNIFICANCE: Development interventions tend to be implemented in complex environments, often with scarce data to inform decision-making. This research shows how system dynamics tools and spatial group model building processes could help overcome these inherent challenges by creating virtual laboratories where plau-sible project interventions can be tested and modified, bringing increased confidence to implementation choices.

The knowledge loss phenomenon caused organizations to face enormous risks which affect performance. KR frameworks and models are made available beyond research and development (R&D) organizations, to address knowledge retention strategies for administrative, operational, and manufacturing organizations. For research-intensive portfolios within R&D organizations, using the available KR frameworks requires fitting. The difficulty to address knowledge loss due to the uniqueness of the R&D organization's knowledge artifacts requires an extended KR framework. Before designing the extended KR framework, it is crucial to determine the framework's additional criteria. The paper reports the use of value chain mapping to determine the extended criteria of the KR framework fit for R&D organizations. The value chain mapping method identifies the knowledge activities in the R&D using Porter Value Chain (PVC) as the reference model. The output is a Knowledge Chain Model (KCM) that defines the critical points of knowledge loss in the R&D value chain. These critical points are project-based expert critical knowledge focus, project-based tacit knowledge transfer, and project-based knowledge repository which are nominated extended criteria of the KR Framework fit for R&D organizations.

VC participation entails a number of challenges for smallholders. Limited access to land, technology and inputs, inadequate knowledge of market functioning, insufficient access to credit and extension services, combined with more general problems of poor infrastructures, often prevent smallholder farmers from accessing profitable market opportunities. The effectiveness of national policies (e.g., public extension service support, inputs subsidy system) oriented to increase smallholders' market access is often constrained by inadequate financial capacity, an inefficient public extension services system and limited involvement of privates in the extension services scheme. VC interventions should distinguish between VC-ready farmers, namely those provided with the minimum conditions of external and internal factors, and non-value-chain-ready farmers. Market-based interventions (e.g., enhancing VC coordination) are needed for enhancing market access of value-chain-ready farmers. Conversely, while non-market-based interventions (e.g., investments in basic infrastructure, increasing extension services, credit and inputs access) prove necessary to build the minimum asset thresholds for non-value-chain-ready farmers' participation in the market. A smallholder-friendly VC development relies on the role played by VC actors and the need to harmonise and improve existing policies to remove inadequacies, conflicts and overlaps in the various institutions charged with implementation.

This study addresses current and advanced options for biomass-based electricity generation integrated to a sugarcane ethanol distillery in Brazil and polices that would foster its deployment. The typical combustion and steam cycle system and the integrated gasification combined cycle are the options considered for lignocellulosic biomass conversion into heat and power, associated with carbon capture and storage technologies. Besides conventional sugarcane, eucalyptus and energy-cane are also examined as promising feedstocks to extend operational days and/or increase biomass yields. The considered biomass-based electricity options are able to mitigate climate change impacts and depletion fossil resources. However, decreasing costs is a challenge to overcome for its broader implementation. The assessed strategies may help to guide policymakers on how to feasibly deploy advanced technologies for electricity production from biomass, meeting the future demands for sustainable electricity. The choice of larger processing scales shows an important effect on reducing costs, as well as choosing energy-cane as feedstock, which is also favorable for reducing climate change and land use impacts. Likewise, government policies that reward climate mitigation, as RenovaBio in Brazil, have a prominent role to foster advanced biomass-based electricity production technologies.

Over the decades, several tests have been adapted from common to durum wheat, and new approaches have been proposed to meet the needs of the players of the durum wheat value chain. Breeders are looking for reliable methods to test the functional quality of wheat lines at early stages, where there are limited amounts of sample; millers need fast and reliable methods for checking wheat quality right at the point of the receiving station; and pasta-makers are looking for suitable methods to predict end product quality. This review provides an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the rheological tests currently used to evaluate the quality of durum wheat semolina, with the emphasis on Europe. Moreover, the relationships among the parameters obtained from different rheological approaches are extrapolated from the literature and integrated with the data obtained from 74 samples of durum wheat semolina. Although numerous efforts have been made to propose rapid and reliable tests for semolina characterization, the ideal test has yet to be proposed, indicating that researchers and pasta companies need to focus on perfecting the way to assess the quality of durum wheat and pasta.

These services can be ranked among intangible outputs as a part of the recreational function of forests. However, their social value is only partially captured in non-forest activities. We used a Choice Experiment to explore individuals' preferences towards NWFPs and associated services in Italy, Sweden, and Czechia. We estimated the individual marginal willingness to pay for the supply and maintenance of NWFPs. In addition, we analysed the determinants of people's choices using the framework of the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). The results show that people collect NWFPs mostly for self-consumption and recreation, rather than for livelihood or to sell them on the market. Despite this, they are willing to pay for sustainable forest management practices that favour NWFPs supply, as well as for forest conservation. Additionally, Care and Fairness traits in the MFT determine people's willingness to pay for NWFPs. The results from this study highlight the value of the social component of non-wood forests products and the expenses related to picking. This is a first step towards a value chain analysis of the NWFPs.

However, a large amount of residual lignocellulosic biomass is generated during its production and is currently undervalued. These residues have the potential to be used as feedstock in bio-based processes with a biorefinery approach. This work is based on the valorization of banana leaf and has the following objectives (i) to determine the effect of certain physical and environmental factors on the concentration of glucose present in banana leaf extract (BLE), using a statistical regression model; (ii) to obtain Bacterial Nanocellulose (BNC), using BLE (70% v/v) and kombucha tea as fermentation medium. In addition, the physicochemical properties of BNC were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicate that storage time, location, leaf color, and petiole type are factors related to BLE concentration, which is reduced by approximately 28.82% and 64.32% during storage times of five days. Regarding BNC biosynthesis, the results indicate that the highest yield, 0.031 g/g, was obtained at 21 days. Furthermore, it was determined that the highest production rate was 0.11 gL(-)(1)h(-)(1) at 11 days of fermentation. By FTIR, it was determined that the purification step with NaOH (3M) should be carried out for approximately two hours. This research supports the development of a circular bioeconomy around the banana value chain, as it presents a way of bioprocessing residual biomass that can be used to produce bioproducts.

J	Gunther, G; Clemen, T; Duttmann, R; Schuett, B; Knitter, D				Guenther, Gerrit; Clemen, Thomas; Duttmann, Rainer; Schuett, Brigitta; Knitter, Daniel			Of Animal Husbandry and Food Production-A First Step towards a Modular Agent-Based Modelling Platform for Socio-Ecological Dynamics	LAND			English	Article						multi-agent-simulation; pastoralism; human impact; grazing; landscape	LAND-USE; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; PASTORALISM; CLIMATE; SYSTEMS; SHEEP; EROSION; FUTURE; GOATS	Agent-based models provide detailed, bottom-up approaches to investigate complex socio-ecological systems. This study presents a first step towards a modular agent-based simulation that is based upon empirical data, as well as environmental suitability maps and an assessment of livestock units. To illustrate the capabilities of our simulation, we use a geographically explicit approach to simulate a component of the production of animal products of a rural settlement in the lower Bakircay catchment, western Turkey. The model structurally couples various agent types representing several elements and processes of the animal husbandry and food production value chain, such as sedentary herders-practising daily, short-distance pastoralism-and their flocks of goats and sheep, as well as milking and slaughtering. The modelling tool captures the fundamental socio-ecological dynamics of animal husbandry and food production in rural settlements. Therefore, the tool is valuable as a basis to discuss hypotheses regarding the number of animals that are needed to cover the requirements of different growing populations.

J	Guerin, TF				Guerin, Turlough F.			Tactical problems with strategic consequences: A case study of how petroleum hydrocarbon suppliers support compliance and reduce risks in the minerals sector	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Environmental performance; Suppliers; Minerals; Hydrocarbons; Risk management; Transitioning	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CHAIN MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; INDICATORS	While there are tactical problems arising from using petroleum hydrocarbons, the strategic issues are considerably more material for the mining sector and society more broadly through their contribution to climate change. The supplied petroleum hydrocarbon life-cycle for refined products is a framework that enables structured engagement between supplier and customer on a range of sustainable development issues because it is an example of an input into the mining industry that affects the entire mining and minerals processing value chain. To support a transition to alternative energy sources on mine, mining and minerals processing companies are seizing the opportunity that petroleum hydrocarbon suppliers offer to their own businesses by engaging with them proactively. This study reports a case study of a mining company in eastern Australia that engaged with its petroleum hydrocarbon supplier using an engagement process based on human-centred design. The results illustrated the use of a human-centred design approach to supply chain engagement which re-oriented the supplier to take increased responsibility for fuel and lubricants impacts at the mine, and find alternative energy solutions. This study is an example of how industry self-regulation can be harnessed to drive incremental change at an operational level in the mining sector. In conclusion, the mining operation harnessed an existing supplier relationship to raise challenges posed by sourcing hydrocarbons, and to secure commitments from the supplier to improve their environmental performance in relation to supplied fuels and lubricants. Recommendations arising are for mining companies to capitalise on existing relationships with hydrocarbon suppliers to drive greater shared ownership of liabilities, as well as leveraging supplier capability to secure sustainable energy sources for mining operations. The case study illustrates the value of the time investment with proactive supplier engagement.

J	Halpern, N; Mwesiumo, D				Halpern, Nigel; Mwesiumo, Deodat			Airport service quality and passenger satisfaction: The impact of service failure on the likelihood of promoting an airport online	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Airport service quality; Service failure; Online ratings; Airport value chain; Passenger satisfaction	TOURIST SATISFACTION; MODEL; EXPERIENCE; CONSUMERS; AIRLINES; RECOVERY; COMMUNICATION; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTIONS; COMPETITION	Based on the analysis of 2278 online passenger ratings of airports worldwide, this study uses a standard multinomial logit model to determine the likelihood of a passenger being a promoter of an airport when a service attribute has failed, controlling for several passenger and airport characteristics. Results show that failures associated with airport staff and queueing times are most likely to reduce the probability of a passenger being a promoter of an airport. Failures associated with airport shopping and wifi service are least likely to do so. More importantly, the failure of any service attribute in this study significantly reduces the probability of a passenger being a promoter of an airport. This suggests that all parts of the airport value chain are likely to suffer when a service attribute fails. Passenger and airport characteristics included in this study do not add significant explanation to whether a passenger becomes a promoter.

J	He, SB; Yao, HL; Ji, Z				He, Shengbing; Yao, Huilin; Ji, Zhou			Direct and Indirect Effects of Business Environment on BRI Countries' Global Value Chain Upgrading	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						business environment; FDI; BRI countries; status elevation the global value chain	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; PRODUCTIVITY; INVESTMENT; GOVERNANCE; FIRMS	This study incorporates business environment, foreign direct investment (FDI), and the global value chain upgrading into a unified analysis framework to unravel the effects of business environment and FDI on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries' status elevation on the global value chain. The panel data of 112 BRI countries from 2007 to 2017 are employed for empirical tests on the trilateral relationship through the panel data regression model. The results show: (1) business environment improvement and FDI inflow significantly promote BRI countries' status elevation on the global value chain. Business environment not only elevates BRI countries' status on the global value chain directly, but indirectly lifts their status through the intermediate effects of FDI; (2) business environment and FDI significantly promote the status elevation on the global value chain for industries that are intensive on varied factors, especially for labor-intensive industry; (3) the test results of the panel threshold model further verify the positive effect of the business environment and FDI inflows on BRI countries' status elevation on the global value chain.

J	Herb, C; Neiberger, C				Herb, Christopher; Neiberger, Cordula			Intermediation, Disintermediation und Cybermediare: Zum Einfluss der Digitalisierung auf Wertschopfungsketten in der Schuhbranche	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGRAPHIE			English	Article						Global Value Chains; Digitization; Governance; Disintermediation; Footwear sector	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; FRESH VEGETABLES; GOVERNANCE; TRADE; INFORMATION; STANDARDS; NETWORKS; IMPACT	Global value chains (GVC) are currently being restructured to a particularly high degree as a result of the new technical and organizational possibilities offered by digitization. Previous research has largely focused on the effects on suppliers in countries of the global South. This article, however, focuses on the distribution part. Using the German footwear sector as an example, the effects of digitization are examined in two parts: The governance in the focused part of the value chain and the accompanying relationships between the players and between the different value chains within the sector. Due to the high degree of digitization in (manufacturing,) communication, and distribution processes, sports goods manufacturers and online platforms in particular have been identified as central players (lead firms). As a result, this paper aims to raise awareness of the fact that the progress of digitization of companies should be taken into account as a critical determinant for participation in GVCs and for the negotiation of governance types between actors.

J	Hoang, V				Hoang, Viet			Modern Short Food Supply Chain, Good Agricultural Practices, and Sustainability: A Conceptual Framework and Case Study in Vietnam	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						short food supply chain; good practices; sustainability; vegetable; Vietnam	LOCAL FOOD; PRODUCERS; CONSUMPTION; GOVERNANCE; LOGISTICS; FARMERS; AREAS; MILK	The rapid increases in environmental pollution, urbanization, health concerns, and technological progress enhance the demand for greener, healthier, and fairer food production and consumption. The short food supply chain (SFSC) becomes one of the crucial solutions for these issues. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework of the SFSC, assess the short vegetable supply chain (SVSC) in Vietnam, identify its barriers and challenges, and explore interventions and support as key success factors of the SVSC by using both qualitative and quantitative methods. This study initially proposes the SFSC framework with six pillars and 28 indicators, this model is used to assess the SVSC. The results show that the SVSC brings various social, economic, and environmental benefits: First, it can increase farmers' income, employment, fairness, and health. Second, the SVSC can decrease environmental pollution, food waste, and energy consumption. Third, it can improve food quality and consumers' health. Fourth, the SVSC enhances on-farm education, agricultural tourism, local livestock farming, and traditional culture and relationship. However, the SVSC encounters various barriers and challenges impeding its performances and benefits. The vegetable value chain gains several interventions and support from the government and the project to overcome these barriers. Overall, the SFSC, good agricultural practice, and sustainability are strongly associated: good agricultural practice and sustainability are inherent in the SFSC.

Valorization of Wine-Making By-Products' Extracts in Cosmetics	COSMETICS			English	Article						cosmetics; grape pomace; phenolic compounds; antioxidants; extracts; natural active ingredient; sustainable development	VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES; DEEP EUTECTIC SOLVENTS; PHYSICAL PRETREATMENTS; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; GRAPE SEEDS; POLYPHENOLS; SKIN; ANTIOXIDANT; FORMULATION; EMULSION	The increased demand for conscious, sustainable and beneficial products by the consumers has pushed researchers from both industries and universities worldwide to search for smart strategies capable of reducing the environmental footprint, especially the ones connected with industrial wastes. Among various by-products, generally considered as waste, those obtained by winemaking industries have attracted the attention of a wide variety of companies, other than the vineries. In particular, grape pomaces are considered of interest due to their high content in bioactive molecules, especially phenolic compounds. The latter can be recovered from grape pomace and used as active ingredients in easily marketable cosmetic products. Indeed, phenolic compounds are well known for their remarkable beneficial properties at the skin level, such as antioxidant, antiaging, anti-hyperpigmentation and photoprotective effects. The exploitation of the bioactives contained in grape pomaces to obtain high value cosmetics may support the growing of innovative start-ups and expand the value chain of grapes.

One such process that is technoeconomically feasible and eco-friendly is waste pyrolysis. The utilisation of its major product (pyrolysis oil) is however hindered due to low heating value, low chemical instability, high oxygenated compounds content, high water content and high sulphur content. Its positive influence of the circular economy initiative can be improved by reducing its sulphur content by regenerative desulphurisation. This study aimed to review the research efforts on the regenerative desulphurisation of pyrolysis oil. There are various approaches such as adsorptive desulphurisation, extractive desulphurisation, bio-desulphurisation, hydrodesulphurisation, oxidative desulphurisation and precipitative desulphurisation to diminish sulphur content in fuels. Looking at the percentage sulphur reduction, all techniques had wide variations based on the nature of the employed technique and the effect of the process factors. Desulphurisation of pyrolysis oil will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as a major source of energy for transportation and industrialisation. It will lead to a rapid increase in plastics and municipal solid waste recycling. This is because higher pyrolysis oil usage will result in need for more wastes to be pyrolysed. The review recommends that improved government participation, industry partnership, improved waste collection systems and better data retrieval systems are new areas that can be focused on to help in the achievement of the circular economy initiative in this regard.

J	Jadhav, MH; Mannar, MGV				Jadhav, Meena Haribhau; Mannar, Marthi Gurunath Venkatesh			Uptake of Encapsulated Ferrous Fumarate Double Fortified Salt in the Public Distribution System in India: A Value Chain Analysis	GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article							CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NUTRITION; IRON	Food fortification is a powerful strategy to reach large populations with multiple micronutrients added to a single food vehicle. The impact depends on the sustained provision and utilization of adequately fortified food by a large population (mainly in lowincome and food-insecure settings). We apply a value chain (VC) analysis framework to diagnose and address the barriers to the uptake of encapsulated ferrous fumarate double fortified salt (DFS) distributed through public-sector-led DFS interventions in India. We adapt the VC requirements framework proposed by Henson and Humphrey to identify and categorize barriers along the DFS VC as technological, market-related, and policy-related. We conducted a desk review of published and unpublished literature on DFS and information available in the public domain, semi structured interviews with VC stakeholders from the private sector, program data from implementing organizations, and participation in multistakeholder consultations on DFS. Major supply-side barriers were under-developed private markets, inconsistent demand from public markets, unpredictable returns on-investments, and inadequate business incentives to invest in DFS. The product's weak consumer orientation, uncreated consumer demand, low awareness of fortified foods, inadequate nutrition signaling were significant demand-side barriers. Technological barriers related to the requirement of high-grade salt for DFS production and residual organoleptic property of mild discoloration of food. Policy barriers related to inadequate and irregular financing for distributing subsidized DFS through the public distribution system; insufficient policy support for risk-sharing and managing costs associated with fortification; and a weak institutional environment for sustaining DFS interventions. Building an enabling institutional environment, demand creation through consumer awareness, strengthening institutional markets through public financing, managing cost and risks through public-private partnerships, and assuring quality during commercial scale-up are critical interventions necessary to ensure impact at scale.

Due to their benefits, DMFCs could play a substantial role in the future, specifically in replacing Li-ion batteries for portable and military applications. However, the critical concern with DMFCs is the degradation and inadequate reliability that affect the overall value chain and can potentially impede the commercialization of DMFCs. As a consequence, a reliability assessment can provide more insight into a DMFC component's attributes. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is the integral component of the DMFC stack. A comprehensive understanding of its functional attributes and degradation mechanism plays a significant role in its commercialization. The methanol crossover through the membrane, carbon monoxide poisoning, high anode polarization by methanol oxidation, and operating parameters such as temperature, humidity, and others are significant contributions to MEA degradation. In addition, inadequate reliability of the MEA impacts the failure mechanism of DMFC, resulting in poor efficiency. Consequently, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of several factors leading to the MEA degradation mechanism in order to develop a holistic understanding.

FOODS			English	Article						cultured meat; cultivated meat; cellular agriculture; alternative protein; meat substitute; plant-based meat; food production; sustainability; consumer behaviour; India	CELL-BASED MEAT; REGULATORY CHALLENGES; FUTURE; INDIA	The dietary protein requirements of almost 9.8 billion people need to be fulfilled in a healthy and sustainable manner by 2050. Meat consumption contributes to 35% of the total protein requirement of the Indian population. Meat intake needs to be sustainable and economical without causing food security and production issues. Consumption of meat in India is projected to rise with an increase in consumer incomes. Hence, novel alternative proteins, including cultured meat (CM) and plant-based meat (PBM), are being developed to satisfy the demand for meat-derived proteins in the diet. This involves the creation of novel PBM/CM products with a similar taste and texture as conventional animal meat with tailor-made nutritional attributes. In this article, we provide critical insights into the technical and business aspects of relevance to production and sustainability encountered by the Indian CM industry at a series of stages that can be termed the CM value chain comprising upstream and downstream processes. We shed light on the need for regulatory authorities and a framework. Consumer concerns towards CM products can be alleviated through effective scientific communication strategies, including prior familiarity, narrative building and transparency, and labelling aspects of CM products.

J	Konig, PD				Koenig, Pascal D.			Citizen-centered data governance in the smart city: From ethics to accountability	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Smart city governance; Data value chain; Data ethics; Accountability; Democratic legitimacy	CITIES; PRIVACY; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK	The concept of a smart city is tightly linked to the promise of using data as a resource to create value for citizens. The present paper systematically examines how such data-based value creation generates challenges for decision makers in the smart city and how they can deal with these challenges. It formulates a coherent data governance framework that comprehensively covers ethical and legitimacy challenges which can arise over the various stages of data-based value creation. The framework translates abstract ethical requirements into a set of systematically derived governance mechanisms which are at the same time anchored in the concept of democratic accountability. This guiding principle does not demand that citizens necessarily become active themselves to realize citizen-centric data governance for socially sustainable smart city development. Rather, it demands that data governance comprises a suitable set of accountability measures that put the purposes of any data use center stage.

J	Kulej-Dudek, E				Kulej-Dudek, Edyta			Ecolabnet service packages as a response to the needs of manufacturing enterprises in the SME sector of the Baltic Sea Region	PRODUCTION ENGINEERING ARCHIVES			English	Article						eco-innovations; service packages; Ecolabnet	ECO-INNOVATION; DESIGN	Nowadays, the competitiveness of the economy, which is determined to a large extent by the innovative activities of enterprises and institutions, is of great importance for economic development. An important type of innovation is eco-innovations. Eco-innovations are currently a very timely topic undertaken by researchers, but also an important element of the activities of many companies. As a network of service providers for eco-innovations in small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, ECOLABNET fits perfectly in this trend. It aims to support, enable and empower companies to undertake sustainable eco-innovation activities in the Baltic Sea Region and beyond. The aim of this publication is to present the results of research on the eco-innovation needs of SME enterprises of the Baltic Sea countries and potential collaboration in this field with external entities. The services developed as packages of eco-innovation services in Ecolabnet that can meet the identified needs were indicated. The survey was conducted between March and May 2019 and covered SMEs in six countries: Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. The subjects of the study were manufacturing companies that improve their products or services. The aim of the research was to gain an understanding of the needs and challenges related to eco-innovation in the context of sustainable development, to identify the future eco-innovation needs of manufacturing SMEs and collaborations with external actors, and to determine how and through which services the Ecolabnet can meet these needs and contribute to the growth of the enterprise. The manufacturing enterprises in this survey were motivated to eco-innovate. However, they lack knowledge on eco-innovation in its broadest sense, and therefore, urgently need the help of external experts, business partners, and networks in this area. The survey covered three areas: Business, Development, and Technology/Production. Business topic areas that entrepreneurs placed a high emphasis on were: branding and communication, supplier relations, customer insights and financial aspects. Within the needs in terms of development put most emphasis on product design, process development, bio-based materials and biodegradable materials.

China has envisioned achieving a carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), an emerging technology, is capable of reducing carbon emissions. Existing theoretical research has paid little attention to comprehensive risk assessments for CCUS projects from a sustainability viewpoint. Therefore, this study formalizes an integrated decision-making model for the risk assessment of CCUS projects. An indicator system consisting of environmental, social, economic, governance and technological sustainability dimensions was developed to assess the risk of CCUS projects. Furthermore, a multiattribute group decisionmaking process was modeled in intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) and linguistic (LIN) environments, both of which are interconvertible. To automate the risk assessment process for different CCUS project contexts, an integrated decision prototype programmed in Microsoft Excel 2016 was designed. Then, two case studies from the Shengli Power Plant CCUS project were conducted to validate the integrated decision-making model. A risk assessment table and risk assessment chart were leveraged to analyze, visualize, and rank the decision alternatives according to their risk performance. The results show that the post-combustion capture technology is selected as the optimal alternative option in three capture technologies; Of the four storage sites, site A is selected as the optimal alternative option. The result of carbon capture technology is in line with the real decision made by Shengli Power Plant, which proves the validity of the model. The optimal option is the same in both IF and LIN environments, which shows the consistency of the model. Theoretically, an integrated decision-making model not only contributes to assessing the risk of CCUS projects through the lens of sustainable development but advances group decision-making modeling by identifying experts' preferences for obtaining effective evaluation results. Practically, this study could help stakeholders comprehensively and promptly evaluate the risk performance of CCUS projects before making development decisions regarding sustainability.

Some of the alterations have negative impacts on the environment, while some have positive impacts. By understanding the positive and negative impacts related to closed mines in Inner Mongolia, this research aims to seek advantages of the positive impacts on the environment and reduce the harm of the negative impacts, extending the mining value chain. The paper reviewed four main negative environmental impacts (NEIs) of closed mines and proposed four positive environmental impacts (PEIs) which include ecosystem services, cultural services, land resources and underground space resources, and energy sources and mineral resources. The paper focused on the environmental problems and the PEI utilization of closed mines in Inner Mongolia with 20 representative cases. It carefully studied the Minda Mine which is a good example to combine several PEI utilization objectives. Multiple PEI objectives, as well as the correlations among different objectives, can benefit closed mines ecologically, economically, and socially.

J	Liu, MQ; Anbumozhi, V				Liu, Minquan; Anbumozhi, Venkatachalam			Application of supply chain approach to improving hazard-resilient health services: framework analysis for ASEAN and options of implementation	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Supply chain of healthcare services; Hazard-resilient healthcare system; International humanitarian assistance; Disaster and pandemic response capability		Infectious diseases such as SARS and COVID-19, like other natural hazards, underline the interconnectedness of the countries. Both manufacturing and services sectors in the economies of Asia have outsourced supplies from different countries in order to gain a competitive advantage through effective value chain management. The motivations for this outsourcing are to achieve technological innovations, reduce end-product prices, and strengthen strategic competitiveness. This paper applies a supply chain approach to develop the concept of a hazard-resilient healthcare system (HRHS) and to explore ways how this might be achieved. After reviewing the current international thinking on HRHS, which has narrowly focused on building national capacities with national capabilities, it argues that a supply chain approach may provide a better, more robust, and in many ways more realistic, approach to enhance the hazard resilience of national healthcare systems. Within such an approach, capabilities of the local actors (local health authorities and healthcare providers) in a pandemic or disaster-prone situation remain important and should be further strengthened, but international support and assistance in times of emergency should also be a key plank of the system. In a changing world with more frequent high-impact pandemics and disasters, such international support need not be one way, but both ways. A system of mutual support may be developed by forming an effective international common pool of capability in responding to the health needs when a major disaster occurs anywhere in a region or globally. Even though serious limitations exist in the current thinking on HRHS, significant progress has been made on the international humanitarian assistance front, especially in the ASEAN region. While developments on this front have not been a part of the purview of the current international thinking on HRHS, it is argued that they may well form an important corner stone in a typical future national HRHS.

J	Liu, Y; Zheng, ZY; Zhao, L; Wang, Z				Liu, Ying; Zheng, Zhiyuan; Zhao, Lu; Wang, Zhen			Quality assessment of post-consumer plastic bottles with joint entropy method: A case study in Beijing, China	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Plastics wastes; Recycling; Mixture; Waste management; Circular economy	COLLECTION SYSTEM; PRODUCT DESIGN; VALUE CHAIN; WASTE; MANAGEMENT; CYCLE; LOOP; PET	Recycling of plastic bottles is a fundamental strategy to reduce the need of fossil resources and protect global environments. The collection of post-consumer plastic bottles (PCPBs) is a key node of the recycling of plastics due to its influences on the subsequent life cycle stages. However, there is still a lack of quantitative assessment on the quality of PCPBs, especially considering the contamination and the mixture of different plastics in the collection stage. This study provides an indicator based on the joint entropy method to evaluate the quality of PCPBs in collection stage, which includes components, polymer types and colors three levels. This indicator (Quality-value) is applied to evaluate the quality of PCPBs' collection system in Beijing city, China, which is based on an on-site survey including 27 samples gathered from 4 distribution centers and 5 collection sites. The results showed that the quality of PCPBs decreased through the collection system of Beijing, which degraded from post-consumer bottles (0.320<Q<0.325) to pre-production bottles (0.311 <Q <0.312). The type of residential area is identified as a key factor of the PCPBs' quality in collection sites. There is no obvious difference between formal and informal business models in the surveyed area. Providing three levels of quality equally weighted, colors sorting had the greatest potential to improve the quality of PCPBs compared to components and polymers sorting. We suggest that joint-entropy based quality assessment can help to manage waste collection system in an efficient way to meet the need of circular economy.

J	Luna, JK; Hernandez, BC; Sawadogo, A				Luna, Jessie K.; Hernandez, Becca Chalit; Sawadogo, Abdoulaye			The paradoxes of purity in organic agriculture in Burkina Faso	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Cotton; Organic certification; Inverted quarantine; Global race theory; Whiteness; West Africa	COMMODITY CHAIN; FOOD; COTTON; TRADE; JUSTICE; INEQUALITY; WHITENESS; SYSTEMS; GENDER; FAIR	For decades, critical agri-food scholarship has sought to evaluate the outcomes of alternative agri-food systems such as organic. Two key critiques have emerged: the first focuses on the limitations of certification-based systems that rely on a neoliberal model of consumer concern; the second critique highlights the Whiteness of alternative food movements and the persistence of racial exclusions. In this paper, we draw these critiques together and extend them through an ethnographic case study of organic cotton in Burkina Faso, West Africa. We explore contradictions in the win-win-win discourse of organic cotton, which promises ecological sustainability, improved livelihoods for producers, as well as pure products for consumers. We argue there is an implicit prioritization of consumers within several organic cotton regulatory rules that focus on ensuring final products free of contamination from pesticide residues. We contend that these rules create difficulties for producers and obstacles for the expansion of sustainable agriculture. Further, the focus on "purity for the consumer" may actually reproduce and transmit (historically fraught and colonial) racialized imaginaries of purity. Some Burkinabe` producers see organic as prioritizing purity for an imagined White consumer. Organic's call to "get back to the dirt" also clashes with a cultural context where aspiration for development is often expressed as "getting out of the dirt." This paper thus raises new questions about the implications of organic agriculture's intense focus on purity for a) the full realization of the promise of organics and b) residual racial imaginaries embedded within the idiom of "purity" itself.

The main goal of this study was to provide a critical analysis of the oil and fat sub-complex for deep walnut processing, to determine and compare the profitability of enterprises' activities under different business models for implementation in the agro-food value chain. The latter was considered as an important factor for the development of the domestic market of walnuts and export opportunities. Business modeling of the enterprise activity in the oil and fat sub-complex for deep walnut processing was carried out. The stages of production and marketing activities of the enterprise from the garden planting or the purchase of the processed raw materials to the sale of the processed raw materials and products obtained from walnut processing depending on the chosen business model were considered. A comparative analysis of profitability of the enterprise activity and absolute values of income and profitability indicators under various business models of the enterprise activity were shown. The most cost-effective business-model entailed the combination of walnut production and its processing, which will provide profitability of up to 4640.32% in the 20th year of the project implementation. The results of the given study are intended for the agricultural enterprises of central region of Ukraine.

Given this externality, this article contributes to the state of the art by proposing reuse EPS as a raw material valuable to the process of manufacturing hats in a Mexican company. The SCAMPER technique is used to formulate a hardener, which is optimized with a Taguchi design. Statistically, there is no difference between the quality of the conventional hardener and the mixture based on post-consumer EPS to make hats based on the standards defined by the company; a subjective analysis supported by the judgment of experts validates the quality of the hats. A contour graph and response surface reflect different combinations of solute and solvent to formulate the glue for the doping of the hat, with the same hardness results. This allows the artisan to assess the formulation from an economical point of view, as well as with respect to the arrangement of materials. These results specifically propose the sustainable alternative of integrating waste from the post-consumer EPS chain into the artisanal hat value chain, and are replicable to other similar products.

Measures to monitor meat substitution are being put in place in many developed countries. However, information about similar efforts in sub-Saharan Africa is sparse. We used PCR coupled with high-resolution melting (PCR-HRM) analysis targeting three mitochondrial genes-cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1), cytochrome b (cyt b), and 16S rRNA-to detect species substitution in meat sold to consumers in Nairobi, Kenya. Out of 107 meat samples representing seven livestock animals, 11 (10.3%) had been substituted, with the highest rate being observed in samples sold as goat. Our results indicate that PCR-HRM analysis is a cost- and time-effective technique that can be employed to detect species substitution. The combined use of the three mitochondrial markers produced PCR-HRM profiles that successfully allowed for the consistent distinction of species in the analysis of raw, cooked, dried, and rotten meat samples, as well as of meat admixtures. We propose that this approach has broad applications in the protection of consumers against food fraud in the meat industry in low- and middle-income countries such as Kenya, as well as in developed countries.

Serious bottlenecks however exist for subsistent farmers in the cultivation of these valuable plants. It was pertinent to probe whether the cultivation of medicinal plants provides feasible solutions to rural poverty, while effectively conserving threatened indigenous biodiversity. The paper employed a comprehensive review of existing literature to explore issues constraining smallholder farmers from involvement in a potentially lucrative plant value chain. Findings indicate challenges such as inadequate domestication of valuable plants species, continued over-harvesting from wild populations, poor knowledge of required agronomic practices, low efficacy perception regarding derivatives from cultivated plants, among others. These constraints occur alongside the conservation-oriented strategy driven by international conservation agencies and wholly adopted by the South African government. Recommendations to improve smallholder involvement in the cultivation of medicinal plants include support to research and extension, targeted inducement to smallholders, contracting and off-take agreements, aimed at promoting an alternative poverty-alleviation-focused economic development strategy. The review adds to the conceptual discourse related to plant diversity, resource conservation, poverty alleviation, and economic development	[Nwafor, Ifeoma; Manduna, Idah] Cent Univ Technol, Ctr Appl Food Sustainabil & Biotechnol, Private Bag X20539, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Nwafor, Christopher] Cent Univ Technol, Dept Agr, Private Bag X20539, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa		Nwafor, I (corresponding author), Cent Univ Technol, Ctr Appl Food Sustainabil & Biotechnol, Private Bag X20539, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.	manchrizzo@hotmail.com			Central University of Technology, Free State [RGS/PDF/ICNwafor/02]	This research was funded by the Post-Doctoral Research Grant of the Central University of Technology, Free State, grant number RGS/PDF/ICNwafor/02.

Milk quality and hygiene: Knowledge, attitudes and practices of smallholder dairy farmers in central Kenya	FOOD CONTROL			English	Article						Dairy; Fresh milk; Food safety; Food security; Value chains; Good agricultural practices (GAPs)	FOOD SAFETY; ADOPTION; NAIROBI	Milk production is an important livelihood source for smallholder dairy farmers in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Kenya. However, milk quality and safety are a challenge due to unhygienic handling and non-adherence to food safety standards. The objective of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and adoption of milk quality and food safety practices by smallholder farmers in Kenya. Ten Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), involving 71 smallholder farmers, were held to collect qualitative data on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of smallholder dairy farmers in Laikipia, Nakuru, and Nyandarua counties. Additionally, data were collected through a cross-sectional administered to 652 smallholder farming households. The results of the study revealed low knowledge level and negative attitudes towards respecting antibiotics treatment withdrawal periods, milk quality standards and food safety regulations. Farmers stated they had received low levels of training on milk quality and safety standards. The majority of farmers adopted animal health measures and hygienic measures such as hand washing and udder cleaning. However, unhygienic milking environments, the use of plastic containers, the use of untreated water, and lack of teat dipping compromised milk quality and safety. Currently, milk production, handling and consumption could expose actors along the dairy value chain to health risks. The adoption of milk quality and food safety practices was influenced by farmers' knowledge, socioeconomic characteristics, and choice of marketing channel. There is a need to improve farmers' knowledge and attitudes and implement hygienic control, disease control and antibiotic residue control practices in the milk production process to meet required milk quality and food safety standards. Awareness campaigns and training programmes for smallholder dairy farmers could foster behavioural change and lead to an improvement in milk quality in Kenya.	[Nyokabi, Simon; Boer, Imke J.

Despite the efforts that Uganda's local and central governments have invested to reduce livestock diseases, ASF outbreaks still persist in the country. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of community-led initiatives in the control of ASF in Mukono District, central Uganda. In Mukono district, a community-led pilot program was initiated where stakeholders in the pig value chain organized themselves into an ASF control task force to enforce on-farm and pig value chain activities intended to limit the spread of ASF. Semi-structured interviews with pig famers (n = 211) were conducted in two areas with contrasting practices: one with active community-initiated and monitored ASF control initiatives since 2016 (Kasawo and Namuganga) and the other without such initiative as the control (Mpunge and Ntenjeru). A significant decline (Wilcoxon ranked sign test: Z = - 5.412, p = 0.000) in the annual frequency of ASF outbreaks in both Kasawo and Namuganga sub-counties was observed after the implementation of community-led initiatives. The level of practice of most ASF control measures was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in sub-counties that instituted community-led ASF control initiatives than in the control sub-counties. The results of this study demonstrate the power of community-led initiatives in reducing ASF disease outbreaks in endemic areas.

It is a highly ranked indigenous fruit based on the nutrition and sensorial properties, which make it an important food source for the marginalized rural people. On the basis of the high vitamin C, iron, and zinc content, it has the capacity to improve the food- nutrition and the socioeconomic status of individuals, especially those in the rural areas of the developing nations. The nutritional composition of Strychnos spinosa compare favorably with many of the popular fruits, such as strawberries and orange. Additionally, Strychnos spinosa has antioxidant activity similar to well-known antioxidant fruits, which keeps it in the class of the popular fruits, giving it added nutrition-health-promoting benefits. In order to improve the availability of Strychnos spinosa, more research on the domestication, processing, preservation, value chain, and economic potential need to be further explored. Therefore, we recommend more concerted efforts from relevant stakeholders with interest in Strychnos spinosa fruit production as a possible sustainable solution to food shortage, food-nutrition insecurity, malnutrition, and austerity, mainly in the rural communities of the developing countries.

The study sites included two large lakes and both semiregulated and unregulated fish value chains. A total of 328 bacterial isolates belonging to 11 genera were evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method. The bacterial species were tested against 12 different antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ampicillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, cefuroxime, and kanamycin). Data analysis was done to assess the heterogeneity in proportion of resistant bacterial species within and between the two value chains using a random-effects model proposed by DerSimonian and Laird (Control Clin Trials 7:177-188, 1986). Statistical heterogeneity within and between groups was estimated using the Cochran chi-square test and the Cochrane P index. The overall proportion of bacterial species resistant to antimicrobial agents in semiregulated and unregulated value chains ranged from 0.00 to 0.88 and 0.09 to 0.95, respectively. Shigella spp. had the highest proportion of bacteria that were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents used. The bacterial species were highly resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin, and the highest multidrug resistance capacity was observed in Shigelia spp. (183%, n = 328), Vibrio spp. (18.3%), and Listeria monocytogenes (12.2%). We observed strong heterogeneity within and between the two value chains regarding proportion of resistant bacterial species. Sun-dried fish in both value chains had significantly high proportions of resistant bacterial species. Comparing the two value chains, the unregulated value chain had a significantly higher proportion of bacterial species that were resistant.

Economic Analysis and Improvement Opportunities of African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) Aquaculture in Northern Germany	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						aquaculture; aquaponics; economies of scale; RAS; profitability; ROI; value chain	VALUE-CHAIN ANALYSIS; STOCKING DENSITY; SYSTEMS RAS; FEASIBILITY; GROWTH; PROFITABILITY; MANAGEMENT; BURCHELL; WELFARE; SECTOR	A farmland based African Catfish recirculation aquaculture system with a production volume (PV) of 300 m(3) was modelled under realistic market conditions in order to analyse the impact of price fluctuations on profitability. As a monoculture recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) for whole fish and the wholesaler's market, the model northern German catfish aquaculture is currently gainless, but the production is sufficient to cover all costs. The most decisive economic parameter is the low selling price (2.20 EUR/kg whole fish), which affects the returns by +/- 70,463 EUR/year for every ten percent (0.22 EUR) price change. Among the variable costs, feed has by far the largest impact with a share of 61.4% (42.1% of total costs). Based on the initial model every ten percent price variation of this variable input factor changes the returns by +/- 29,691 EUR/year, followed by energy (+/- 5913 EUR/year), fingerlings (+/- 4804 EUR/year), wages (+/- 3972 EUR/year) and water (+/- 2464 EUR/year). Larger system sizes (600 m3 PV) significantly save costs due to economies of scale and achieve returns of 175,240 EUR/year and an ROI of 11.45%. Increasing max. stocking density from 450 kg/m(3) to 550 kg/m(3) improves returns and ROI (40,379 EUR/year; 4.40%), but also involves higher production risks. An own fingerling production with a production of 300% above the own requirements improves returns and ROI (39,871 EUR/year; 3.57%) and leads, above all, to independence from foreign suppliers. Aquaponic integrations can generate profits, but are associated with high investment costs and the challenges of entering a new business sector. Product diversification into fillet (50% of the production) and smoked fillet (30%) generates lucrative returns and ROI (212,198 EUR/year; 20.10%). Profitability is further increased by direct marketing in the form of a farm store and the establishment of a regional "producer organisation". Our results demonstrate that under current market conditions northern German catfish aquaculture covers all costs, mainly increasing profitability through altered sales prices and feed costs. Retaining a larger part of the fishery value chain within the farm through additional benefits, further processing and product diversification improves profitability, making African catfish RAS a sustainable and economically profitable aquaculture business in Germany.

Determinants of the division in strategic sales decisions within the MNE	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						MNEs; Subsidiary networks; Subsidiary performance; Strategic sales activities; Decision-making structures; Subsidiary importance	FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES; MAKING AUTONOMY; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; EMBEDDEDNESS; INTEGRATION; INNOVATION; IMPACT; RESPONSIVENESS; FIRM	Extant international business (IB) literature on Headquarter (HQ)-subsidiary relationships has established that where decision-making occurs, it influences a firm's performance. Existing studies propose that the degree of autonomy in decision-making at subsidiary level is not the same for all value chain activities, paying more attention to upstream activities. This paper contributes by exploring decision-making autonomy in downstream strategic sales activities. Sales has rarely been centre stage in IB investigations and we therefore lack thorough understanding of its role and importance within the MNE decision-making processes. Conducting a mixed methods exploratory study in the fast-moving consumer goods sector in Germany, we test for antecedents and outcomes of subsidiaries' strategic sales decision-making autonomy. Results confirm external and internal embeddedness as antecedents, and the dominant role played by the local context, but provide insights into potential risks of internal embeddedness. Results challenge existing theory inasmuch as subsidiary importance is not a significant driver. A critical implication of this finding is that, compared to upstream activities, the HQ may not have the option of mandating a subsidiary to transfer sales strategy skills and knowledge across the network. Our results show that, in an era of globalisation of sales, and internationalisation of retailers, HQ managers must pay heed to directly interacting with subsidiaries and to sharing strategic sales decision-making across the network to consolidate the MNE's global sales strategy.

J	Ribul, M				Ribul, Miriam			Regenerative Textiles: A Framework for Future Materials Circularity in the Textile Value Chain	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						textile value chain; textile processes; interdisciplinary collaboration; materials circularity; circular economy; regenerated cellulose		Materials science breakthroughs have regenerated high value fibres from end-of-life cellulose-based textiles that can be introduced into existing textile fabrication processes from raw material to textile product in established textile value chains. Scientific developments with regenerated cellulose fibres obtained from waste textiles suggest their potential to replace virgin resources. The current scale-up of regeneration technologies for end-of-life cellulose-based textiles towards pilot and commercial scales can potentially achieve a future materials circularity, but there is a lack of a long-term view of the properties of materials after consecutive recycling stages take place. Cellulose-based materials cannot be infinitely recycled and maintain the same quality, a factor which may provide new challenges for future textile processes in the context of the circular bioeconomy. This paper maps collaborative design and materials science projects that use regenerated cellulose obtained from waste feedstock according to materials in the value chain they seek to substitute. It also presents four new processes that use regenerated cellulose materials in relation to their intervention in the value chain (as determined in a PhD investigation). A framework is presented to demonstrate how these circular material design processes take place at earlier stages of the textile value chain after subsequent regeneration stages.

J	Sadik-Zada, ER				Sadik-Zada, Elkhan Richard			Political Economy of Green Hydrogen Rollout: A Global Perspective	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						green hydrogen; green hydrogen value chain; developing countries; renewable energy sources; hydrogen strategy	GAS	The present paper dwells on the role of green hydrogen in the transition towards climate-neutral economies and reviews the central challenges for its emancipation as an economically viable source of energy. The study shows that countries with a substantial share of renewables in the energy mix, advanced natural gas pipeline infrastructure, and an advanced level of technological and economic development have a comparative advantage for the wider utilization of hydrogen in their national energy systems. The central conclusion of this review paper is that a green hydrogen rollout in the developed and oil-exporting developing and emerging countries is not a risk for the rest of the world in terms of the increasing technological disparities and conservation of underdevelopment and concomitant socio-economic problems of the Global South. The targets anchored in Paris Agreement, but even more in the EU Green Deal and the European Hydrogen Strategy will necessitate a substantial rollout of RESs in developing countries, and especially in the countries of the African Union because of the prioritization of the African continent within the energy cooperation frameworks of the EU Green Deal and the EU Hydrogen Strategy. Hence, the green hydrogen rollout will bridge the energy transition between Europe and Africa on the one hand, and climate and development targets on the other.

J	Santucci, FM; Callieris, R; del Bello, D				Santucci, Fabio Maria; Callieris, Roberta; del Bello, Delizia			Organic olive oil in Italy: a missed opportunity?	BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Common Agricultural Policy; marketing; value chain; rural development; group certification		This paper analyses the status and evolution of the value chain "organic olives and organic olive oil" in the 20 Italian Regions, to understand two contemporary phenomena. First, since many landholders (about 43 000) receive the CAP decoupled subsidy for conversion to organic methods and then for maintenance, on about 238 000 ha, we have quantify a potential output of 125 000 - 162 000 tons of organic oil, but only about 40 000 tons are certified. This means losing the opportunities linked with market valorisation, namely the premium prices. Second, there is an unquantified number of tiny producers, whose number and output remain unknown, who do not even apply for the organic area subsidy and consequently lose both this subsidy and the premium price. In both cases, the market potential of the organic olive oil, with its positive impacts on the firms contributing to the added value, is lost. Also lost is the potential impact on the diversification of rural economies, namely agriand rural tourism. This means less incomes and jobs, especially in the southern Regions of Italy, where most of the potential organic EVO oil is located. The Authors suggest further research on the organization of the value chain, to understand better the difficulties and bottlenecks which limit the exploitation of the organic EVO oil. The Authors also propose a more integrated approach, for the value chain and for linkages with rural development actions, with the involvement of the different stakeholders, to favour the creation of more added value and the recognition of the small organic producers.

This situation hampers the creation of conditions to develop and strengthening the Mexican biofuel market, although some recent efforts have been oriented in terms of quality regulations, and the production of pure biofuels. Promoting the production and consumption of biodiesel in Mexico requires addressing various challenges, involving technology development for biodiesel production, selection of best raw materials, regulation of the distribution, and commercialization of this biofuel. Here, the legal, institutional, technological and fiscal obstacles to establish a successful biodiesel market are analyzed in this paper, exploring the regulation for biofuels in Mexico, the national production and consumptions of biodiesel, and the value chain and production cost of biodiesel. This investigation is supported by the analysis of 150 interviews conducted with stakeholders in the energy sector.

J	Teisserenc, B; Sepasgozar, S				Teisserenc, Benjamin; Sepasgozar, Samad			Adoption of Blockchain Technology through Digital Twins in the Construction Industry 4.0: A PESTELS Approach	BUILDINGS			English	Article						blockchain; PESTELS; construction; built environment; mining; BIM; IoT; digital twin; industry 4; 0		The key challenges of the building, engineering, construction, operations, and mining (BECOM) industries are the lack of trust, inefficiencies, and the fragmentation of the information value chain into vulnerable data silos throughout the lifecycle of projects. This paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a technological framework-namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle (DDTC)-that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency, traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects' lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability, energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects' lifecycles. The model also considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works. Finally, the paper provides an industry-specific analysis and technological approach facilitating BCT adoption through DT to address the key challenges and improve sustainability for the BECOM industry 4.0.

The paper also examines the effects of economic shocks on the productive performance of firms in terms of access to linkages, spillovers, and ownership structures in terms of foreign and domestic firms. The economic shocks such as global financial crisis tend to have greater impact on domestic firms and SOEs. The findings suggest that the local private enterprises did not receive positive foreign horizontal and backward spillovers from the MNEs. The results also indicate that trade policies (effective rate of protection) that protect domestic firms tend to have a negative impact on their productive performance of firms during economic crisis.

This paper augments previous research by exploring the productive and reproductive roles that men and women have in fishing communities and how this shapes women's access and control over fisheries resources. Contributing to advancing the understanding of how to strengthen women's roles in the fisheries sector, this paper reports on a qualitative assessment conducted in seven Malawian lakeshore districts. Data collected via focus group discussions, which included gendered resource mapping exercises, revealed belief systems and gender norms that shape men's and women's access to and control over lacustrine resources. While both men and women have access to lake and land resources, their roles differ. Men dominate fishing resources whereas women dominate resources that are tied to household management. While all value chain nodes are open to men, women tend to be concentrated in lower-value processing and trading activities. Social norms and values shape people's access and control over communal resources. It is noteworthy that women who earn an income from the fisheries value chain have more access to savings and credit and have more equal household bargaining power.

The Delphi analysis concluded that companies in Mexico and Spain adopt CSR measures and standards mainly at the request of destination supermarkets in the US and Europe, which hold the greatest power in the global value chain. In addition, it is identified that with the adoption of CSR, companies seek to improve their image in the field and gain competitive advantages in the market. Among the limitations are the lack of business culture, ignorance of the protocols, and high administrative burden, especially among smaller production companies. Experts consider that CSR measures and standards have a positive impact on the field. The research is completed with a SWOT analysis (Weaknesses, Threats, Strengths, and Opportunities), providing a ranking list of great interest for the design of competitive improvements.

J	Vadana, II; Kuivalainen, O; Torkkeli, L; Saarenketo, S				Vadana, Ioan-Iustin; Kuivalainen, Olli; Torkkeli, Lasse; Saarenketo, Sami			The Role of Digitalization on the Internationalization Strategy of Born-Digital Companies	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						born-digital; SMEs; value chain; digitalization; internationalization strategy; bricolage; innovation	BRICOLAGE; TECHNOLOGY; FIRMS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; INFORMATION; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; SERVITIZATION; EFFECTUATION; SATURATION	Digital technologies have led to born-digital companies, defined by their highly digitalized value chains, designed at their inception. Born-digital (BD) companies leverage digitalization across their value chains in the internationalization path. However, despite this emergence, very few empirical studies in international business literature have explained the impact of bricolage in conducting value chain activities and exploiting the internationalization strategy of BD companies. The present study responds to these omissions of how the digitalization of the value chain activities and the internationalization strategy enhance companies by allowing them to reach customers (users) and partners with available resources and less time. The results indicate that the digitalization of value chain activities facilitates the re-use and mixing of the resources at hand to overcome challenges, innovate solutions, or create new opportunities for international growth, in line with the bricolage theory. Overall, this study contributes to international business literature regarding, specifically, the behaviors of born-digital companies as they strategically approach internationalization efforts.

J	van Balen, M; Haezendonck, E; Verbeke, A				van Balen, Mitchell; Haezendonck, Elvira; Verbeke, Alain			Mitigating the environmental and social footprint of brownfields: The case for a peripheral CSR approach	EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Plant closure; Internalizing externalities; Corporate social responsibility; Brownfield; Mitigating environmental footprints; Core CSR; Peripheral CSR	CORPORATE; RESPONSIBILITY; INNOVATION; PHILANTHROPY; BUSINESS	Industrial plant closures create a largely unexplored challenge for corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Such plant closures lead to brownfield sites: economic assets and large pieces of land that often cannot be redeployed for alternative purposes, except by incurring significant costs. The direct effects of plant closures typically include a rise in unemployment and value chain disturbance (or dismantling), but brownfields are usually also associated with additional social effects and environmental pollution. Here, a proactive CSR strategy means reducing or mitigating the joint, negative social and environmental footprint of industrial plant closures beyond what is mandated by law (which has tended primarily to address direct effects). We assess the various strategies firms can pursue to mitigate negative, post closure footprints and we distinguish between two alternative strategic options beyond the 'legal obligations' approach, namely the 'core business related' (core) CSR approach, and the 'peripheral CSR' approach. We explore the case of a plant closure by Bekaert S.A., a large, Belgian industrial firm, which adopted a peripheral CSR approach to manage and redevelop a brownfield site. In this context, we identify four enabling conditions for peripheral CSR to be implemented effectively. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, this is far from being the case. This study investigates two cases of important crop country combinations in organic agriculture, namely perennial ryegrass in South-West England and durum wheat in Italy. A novel multi-agent value chain approach was developed to assess public and private-sector interventions aiming at increasing organic seed use. Phasing out of derogations for non-organic seed comes with 2-7% gross margin losses at the farm level. Seed producers and breeders profit by 9-24%. Mitigating measures can be subsidies of 28 euro/ha or price premiums of 12 euro/ton at the farm gate for durum wheat, in the case of durum wheat in Italy, and subsidies of 13 euro/ha or price premiums of 70 euro/ton for lamb meat, in the case of perennial ryegrass in England. Further mitigating measures are the promotion of farm-saved durum wheat seed and investments in breeding for better nitrogen efficiency in organic perennial ryegrass seed production.

Its fruit pulp is commonly used in South America in several food products, such as beverages, ice cream and candies. Only the pulp of the fruit is used, and the peels and seeds are considered waste from these industries. As a trioxygenated xanthone source, this species is of high interest for bioproduct development. This work evaluated the mesocarp and epicarp of bacuri fruits through different extraction methods and experimental conditions (pH, temperature and solvent) in order to determine the most effective method for converting this agro-industrial waste in a value-added bioproduct. Open-column procedures and HPLC and NMR experiments were performed to evaluate the chemical composition of the extracts, along with total phenols, total flavonoids and antioxidant activities (sequestration of the DPPH and ABTS radicals). A factorial design and response surface methodology were used. The best extraction conditions of substances with antioxidant properties were maceration at 50 degrees C with 100% ethanol as solvent for mesocarp extracts, and acidic sonication in 100% ethanol for epicarp extracts, with an excellent phenolic profile and antioxidant capacities. The main compounds isolated were the prenylated benzophenones garcinielliptone FC (epicarp) and 30-epi-cambogin (mesocarp). This is the first study analysing the performance of extraction methods within bacuri agro-industrial waste. Results demonstrated that shells and seeds of bacuri can be used as phenolic-rich bioproducts obtained by a simple extraction method, increasing the value chain of this fruit.	[Yamaguchi, Klenicy K.

J	Zhang, Y; Wang, SH				Zhang, Ying; Wang, Shuhong			Influence of marine industrial agglomeration and environmental regulation on marine innovation efficiency-From an innovation value chain perspective	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Innovative value chain; Marine innovation; Marine industrial agglomeration; Environmental regulation	EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; PORTER HYPOTHESIS; KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE; GEOGRAPHY	Innovation is an important driving force for realizing high-quality green development of the marine economy. Based on the innovation value chain, this study incorporates three marine waste pollutants into the two-stage marine innovation efficiency research framework and uses the super-efficiency DEA model to measure the overall efficiency and sub-process efficiency of the marine innovation of China's coastal regions from 2006 to 2016. We apply the dynamic panel model and the threshold effect model to empirically test the impact of marine industrial agglomeration and environmental regulation on the efficiency of two-stage marine innovation. We find that (1) during the inspection period, the overall efficiency average of China's marine innovation was 0.99; the marine green R&D efficiency average was 0.67; and the commercialization efficiency average was 1.31. At this stage, the improvement of marine innovation efficiency depends on commercialization efficiency and is restricted to green R&D efficiency. (2) An obvious inverted U-shaped relationship exists between marine industrial agglomeration and marine innovation. Environmental regulations play a significant positive role in promoting marine innovation. (3) An environmental regulation threshold exists in the process of marine industrial agglomeration that affects both the overall and the commercialization processes.

A strengthening of the diversity, sustainability, resilience and connectivity of food systems is increasingly seen as a key leverage point. Governance arrangements play a central role in connecting sustainable, resilient farming with healthy nutrition. In this article, we elaborate a framework for assessing, monitoring and improving the governance of food systems. Our focus is on food chains in six peri-urban and urban regions in SSA. A literature review on food chain governance and a mapping of current agri-food chains in the six regions provide the basis for the elaboration of an indicator-based assessment framework. The framework is adapted to the specific conditions of SSA and related goals. The assessment framework is then used to identify the challenges and opportunities in food chain governance in the six regions. The first testing of the framework indicates that the approach can help to identify disconnects, conflicting goals and tensions in food systems, and to formulate strategies for empowering agri-food chain actors in transitioning toward more efficient, equitable and sustainable agri-food systems. The article is concluded with a brief reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of the framework and suggests further testing and refinement.

JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Business and human rights; regulation; Modern Slavery Act; Rajasthan; sandstone; quarry workers; informal work	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; LAW	Some of the worst human rights conditions globally are found in Rajasthan's sandstone quarries. This paper asks if state-based regulation in the economic-North advanced under the Business and Human Rights agenda: disclosure-based regimes, due diligence compliance regimes and trade-based regimes, could advance efforts to improve respect for human rights in this sector. It adopts fields of struggle lens and global value chain theoretical approaches to business power and governance to understand the challenging political and economic dynamics that entrench harm within sandstone quarrying in Rajasthan. This analysis suggests that company-based disclosure and due diligence regimes will struggle to ameliorate these dynamics whilst trade-based approaches hold some potential to generate meaningful change.

This exploratory research investigates if, why, and with whom entrepreneurs in micro and small enterprises engage in innovation activities during the atypical context of the COVID-19 crisis in the tourism sector. The multiple case study with three German entrepreneurs in the tour operator market shows that micro and small enterprises despite their size hold the capacity to initiate and manage several innovation projects of different types and in different stages of the innovation value chain simultaneously during a crisis. To do so, the entrepreneurs preferably engage participants with strong social ties, independent from a place. The perceived benefits are both related to the innovation output (e.g. generate income), and the innovation activities (e.g. increased motivation of staff, increased trust of customers during the crisis). Further research is encouraged on the long-term effects of innovations resulting from a crisis.

J	Monteiro, NBR; Neto, JMM; da Silva, EA				Reis Monteiro, Nathalie Barbosa; Moita Neto, Jose Machado; da Silva, Elaine Aparecida			Life cycle management in bakeries: a proposed roadmap towards sustainability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Environmental sustainability; Life cycle; LCM; Bakery	GOVERNANCE	Purpose Some commercial/industrial sectors have increased their interest in sustainability, in some cases changing their business focus, from a profit-centered approach to a more balanced view, including environmental and social factors. It means that the interest in sustainability is increasing. Life cycle management (LCM) is a methodology/concept that can contribute to this paradigm shift. In this research, the potential application of LCM in the bakery segment was investigated, considering the entire value chain related to the sector (inputs, packaging, suppliers, customers, waste management). Methods Bakeries were visited, in Teresina, Piaui, Brazil, to learn about the products, services, production processes, and the socio-environmental and economic sustainability practices, aiming at identifying bottlenecks and to propose alternatives based on LCM. Besides the field approach, the study was structured based on the literature that brings the concepts and potentialities of applying LCM in various economic/industrial sectors. The PDCA cycle and the SWOT Matrix were also used to assist the implementation of LCM. A roadmap was proposed aiming at the LCM implementation in bakeries. Results The results show that although the sector has some environmentally sustainable practices (waste separation, energy savings, reuse of products, inputs purchased locally), the primary intention is to reduce costs and not to mitigate environmental impacts. Regarding social responsibility, they donate bread to institutions. This is an important attitude, but not the only one for fulfilling the social role within the value chain. They do not consider suppliers that show concern for the environment (certified companies), and both marketing and product labels do not evoke these issues too. Conclusions and recommendations Thus, there is the possibility of implementing LCM in bakeries if there is a concern with sustainable production and consumption. A roadmap for implementing LCM in bakeries was proposed including some steps: mapping the life cycle of products/processes/services associated with the sector; analyzing factors that can influence the actions towards sustainability; disseminating life cycle information to the entire value chain; efficient waste management, including the partnership with recycling companies; and treatment of the collected data and improvement proposal, using management tools such as the PDCA Cycle, the SWOT Matrix, and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aiming at the search for environmental and economic sustainability and social fair alternatives.

J	Lamghari, A; Dimitrakopoulos, R				Lamghari, Amina; Dimitrakopoulos, Roussos			An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic to optimize mineral value chains under metal and material type uncertainty	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING RECLAMATION AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Heuristics; adaptive large neighbourhood search; mineral value chain; mining complex; metal uncertainty; material type uncertainty; risk management	PRODUCTION SCHEDULING PROBLEM; GEOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTY; MINING COMPLEXES	This paper addresses the optimisation of mineral value chains under metal and material type uncertainty. A mathematical model to simultaneously optimise the extraction decisions and the destination decisions is proposed. A fix-and-optimise scheme that exploits the structure of the problem and uses relaxation and decomposition techniques is introduced to obtain an initial solution, and an adaptive large neighbourhood search heuristic is developed to improve this solution. The proposed solution approach is tested on a real copper-gold mining complex. The results of these experiments show the ability of the proposed solution approach to efficiently address large instances of realistic size and provide schedules where the most valuable material is mined and processed early in the life of the mine and where the risk of not meeting production targets is successfully managed.

Cork oak trees (Quercus suber L.) are characteristic features of these complex agro-silvo-pastoral agroforestry systems, delivering a globally important product, cork. The increasingly distant, global scale of decision making and trade can consequently be observed on the local, landscape, scale. In this study, we use a value chain approach to test the concept that landscape products can ensure sustainable management of the landscape of origin. We interviewed agents-cork producers, intermediaries, industrial transformers, and winemakers-about the challenges they perceived in the business and how these were connected to the landscape of origin. We illustrate the network of agents and sub-actors involved in the sector and highlight the most prominent concerns. We conclude that this approach can reveal the major points for determining the future of the montado, and we suggest that collaboration amongst value chain agents can be a pathway to landscape sustainability.

A new mining paradigm, small-scale "switch-on switch-off" (SOSO) mining, is based on the design of a flexible and modular mining plant (MMP) and aims at exploiting quickly and safely European small high grade deposits of raw materials, including critical. The goal of this study is to assess the social implications of this new mining paradigm on the value chain of the MMP. Methods A social hotspot assessment is conducted on pilot-scale operations of an MMP led in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the production of lead concentrate. The assessment is conducted using the performance reference point method. The background system is modeled through the PSILCA v2.0 database, while the foreground system is modeled using on-site data completed with PSILCA information. Results The assessment reveals six main hotspots induced by both the foreground and the background systems and occurring mainly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These hotspots can be divided into three groups: (1) local preoccupations within the community: "contribution to environmental load" and "public sector corruption," (2) measures that can be put in place by the MMP operator: "social responsibility along the supply chain" and "certified environmental management," and (3) the conditions prevailing in the country: "sanitation coverage" and "workers affected by natural disasters." Two sensitivity assessments are conducted in order to test the operating conditions of the MMP: switching from a diesel generator to a renewable source of energy supply and switching the country of operation to Greece, host of a similar deposit that could be potentially exploited thanks to the MMP. Switching the electricity supply system increases the overall risk due to the increase in potential impacts occurring on the renewable energy supply chain (e.g., battery manufacturing). When switching the country of operation to Greece, the overall potential impacts are predicted to decrease. Conclusions This study performed on pilot-scale operations provides information on potential social and socio-economic impacts and recommendations to limit these impacts in case of widespread use of the SOSO approach. In a broader perspective, having better knowledge of social implications linked to the mining and metals sector will help better understanding their implications in the various value chains they enter.

J	Wang, HC; Lim, G				Wang, Hongchuan; Lim, Guanie			Catching-up in the semiconductor industry: comparing the Chinese and Malaysian experience	ASIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION			English	Article; Early Access						Catching-up; foreign direct investment; industrial policy; China; Malaysia	FLYING GEESE; POLICY; INVESTMENT; STRATEGIES; GROWTH	This paper compares the paths of development taken by China and Malaysia in their attempts to pursue catching-up. While both China and Malaysia rely to a large extent on attracting foreign direct investment, China has, since its economic liberalisation in the late 1970s, implemented a more proactive set of industrial policy to embed foreign know-how and promote domestic technological deepening. This is illustrated through a comparison of the evolution of the Chinese and Malaysian semiconductor (upstream) industry. Although their progress remains tentative at this stage, China seems to be showing more concrete signs of technological and industrial sophistication than Malaysia. Such mastery is a useful platform for Chinese firms to progressively climb the technological ladder and to capture more value from the production and sales of increasingly complex goods and services. The principles discussed in this paper provide policy lessons, or at least some initial guidance, for other developing economies aspiring to move up the value chain.

J	Morris, M; Robbins, G; Hansen, U; Nygard, I				Morris, Mike; Robbins, Glen; Hansen, Ulrich; Nygard, Ivan			The wind energy global value chain localisation and industrial policy failure in South Africa	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS POLICY			English	Article; Early Access						wind renewable energy; global value chains; industrial policy; localisation; REIPPPP; green industrialisation	COMPLEX PRODUCT SYSTEMS; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIES; GOVERNANCE; COPS	This article utilises a GVC analytic framework to analyse the wind energy value chain in South Africa and its impact on localisation of goods and services. Its theoretical contribution highlights governance as dependent on system integration dynamics, with lead firms operating as system integrators. The empirical analysis focuses on the interplay between energy and industrial policy showing how policy failure, driven by coal-based vested interests, disrupted system integration and undermined the renewable energy programme. The failure to ensure continuity and predictability of the auction bidding process within energy policy cascaded down the wind energy chain negatively impacting industrial policy attempts to localise domestic and foreign enterprises. This also derived from the South African government failing to prioritise, develop, and embed renewable energy as a green economy strategy within its industrial policy framework. We conclude with the following lessons: (a) GVC dynamics and lead firms cannot be ignored if localisation is to take root; (b) green strategies should be mainstreamed within industrial policy; (c) localisation starts with lead firms encouraging follower sourcing of first tier suppliers; (d) localising domestic value-added services is just as important as developing manufacturing enterprises.

Export-Driven, Extensive Coastal Aquaculture Can Benefit Nutritionally Vulnerable People	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						nutrition sensitive aquaculture; n-3 fatty acids; polyculture; export and local food; fishery-aquaculture continuum	FOOD SECURITY; FISH CONSUMPTION; DIETARY PATTERN; NUTRIENT INTAKE; SHRIMP CULTURE; PORTION SIZE; VALUE CHAIN; VITAMIN-A; BANGLADESH; LAND	Export-orientated shrimp and prawn farming in coastal ghers has been associated with negative environmental, social, and nutritional impacts. This study challenges these perceptions based on field observations from four communities in South West Bangladesh. Most households observed (>60%) were either directly involved in seafood farming or engaged elsewhere in the seafood value chain. Our study set out to establish how the type and location of aquaculture impacted on access to and consumption of aquatic animals. Additionally, we assessed the effects of both household socioeconomic status and intra-household food allocation on individual diet and nutritional outcomes. We used a blended approach, including a 24-h consumption recall on two occasions, analysis of the proximate composition of aquatic animals and biomarkers from whole blood from a sample of the target population. The diverse polyculture systems generated broad social benefits, where "export-oriented" production actually supplied more food locally than to global markets. Key findings: (1) worse-off households achieved higher productivity of farmed aquatic animals on smaller landholding than better-off households with larger landholdings; (2) vegetable production on gher dikes was a significant source of nutrition and income in lower saline gradients; (3) more fish was eaten in lower saline gradients although fish consumption was highly variable within and between households; (4) intra-household allocation of specific foods within diets were similar across communities; (5) recommended nutrient intakes of protein and zinc exceeded daily requirements for adolescent females, but energy, calcium, and iron were below recommended intake levels; (6) n-3 LC-PUFA, expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, in whole blood samples of adolescent females declined with ambient salinity level regardless of household socioeconomic status; (7) analysis of aquatic animals consumed found that mangrove species and tilapia harvested from higher saline ghers contained high levels of desirable PUFAs. These findings suggest that export-driven, extensive coastal aquaculture can be nutrition sensitive when co-products are retained for local consumption.

A low-cost handheld NIR spectrometer (900-1700 nm) combined with multivariate classification algorithms was used for rapid differentiation analysis of organic cocoa beans' integrity. In this research, organic and conventionally cultivated cocoa beans were collected from different locations in Ghana and scanned nondestructively with a handheld spectrometer. Different preprocessing treatments were employed. Principal component analysis (PCA) and classification analysis, RF (random forest), KNN (K-nearest neighbours), LDA (linear discriminant analysis), and PLS-DA (partial least squares-discriminant analysis) were performed comparatively to build classification models. The performance of the models was evaluated by accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. Second derivative preprocessing together with PLS-DA algorithm was superior to the rest of the algorithms with a classification accuracy of 100.00% in both the calibration set and prediction set. Second derivative algorithm was found to be the best preprocessing tool. The identification rates for the calibration set and prediction set were 96.15% and 98.08%, respectively, for RF, 91.35% and 92.31% for KNN, and 90.38% and 98.08% for LDA. Generally, the results showed that a handheld NIR spectrometer coupled with an appropriate multivariate algorithm could be used in situ for the differentiation of organic cocoa beans from conventional ones to ensure food integrity along the cocoa bean value chain.

J	Liu, Y; Wang, C; Xia, ZZ; Chen, JW				Liu, Yan; Wang, Chao; Xia, Zhenzhen; Chen, Jiwang			Nondestructive evaluation of the biogenic amine in crayfish (Prokaryophyllus clarkii) by nearinfrared spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Nearinfrared spectroscopy; crayfish; biogenic amine; wavelength selection; partial least squares regression	UNINFORMATIVE VARIABLE ELIMINATION; LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; FISH; DERIVATIZATION; HISTAMINE; SELECTION; MEAT; FOOD	Biogenic amines are a group of nitrogen substances and widely adopted to assess the food safety, especially for the aquatic products. In China, crayfish (Prokaryophyllus clarkii) have become one of the most famous aquatic products and form a complete industrial value chain. To ensure the safety of the crayfish industrial chain, a rapid and nondestructive method for determining the biogenic amines of crayfish by nearinfrared spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics was proposed in this study. The quantitative models of histamine, tyramine, cadaverine, and putrescine were built by using the partial least squares (PLS) regression. The spectral preprocessing and the wavelength selection methods were adopted to optimize the models. For histamine, cadaverine, and putrescine in peeled or whole tails, reasonable quantitative results can be obtained by using the optimized models; the coefficient of determination (r(2)) are 0.88 and 0.90, 0.88 and 0.91, 0.89, and 0.84, respectively. As for tyramine in peeled or whole tails, the results are acceptable and the coefficient of determination (r(2)) is 0.83 and 0.74, respectively.

J	Adeosun, OT; Shittu, IA				Adeosun, Oluyemi Theophilus; Shittu, Ibrahim Ayodele			Business incubation initiatives and innovation capabilities of micro-sized enterprises: Exploring the software ICT value chain	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						innovative capabilities; global value chains; ICT; innovation; incubation hubs; SMEs	AFRICA	Promoting innovative capabilities in Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) is crucial if African countries are to progress in terms of being active in the Global Value Chain (GVC) and achieve inclusive development. Enhancing innovative capabilities in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector has been identified as strategic to Nigeria tapping into the GVC and deepening industrial sustainable development. Despite increasing awareness that enhanced innovative capabilities can foster the integration of SMEs into the GVC, there still exists scanty evidence of SMEs' innovative capabilities, especially in the ICT sector and software sub-sector in Nigeria. This paper broadly explores SMEs' innovative capabilities in the ICT-Software Incubator sub-sector in Lagos metropolis. Specifically, the paper seeks to understand what limits SMEs' innovative capabilities and the kinds of government support required to mitigate the effects of these factors. The study used 200 SMEs and 10 key incubator hubs operating in the sub-sector as a case study as well as in-depth interviews with the owners/managers. Our findings show that there is improvement in the software sector's knowledge and development and its value chain in the country; most businesses copy innovative concepts from abroad, adopting about 30% local innovation content due to the high demand for foreign software innovations by clients; overall most incubation hubs are underperforming in their core services to incubating firms; and poor educational infrastructure, brain drain and poor support from the government are key challenges facing the sector. We recommend a strong peer review among the innovation hubs and a check on the brain drain in the sector.

Organizational inertia becomes relevant as a factor that adversely affects organizational transformation; this study aims to examine how to overcome it and its consequences to firms. Design/methodology/approach The model estimation with seemingly unrelated regression and two-stage least square. The authors build a data set of years 2015-2019 from the Lima Stock Exchange firms to test the hypotheses. Findings In this research, using the evolutionary-ecological theory of Hannan and Freeman, the study shows the consequences of organizational inertia on marketing intensity and subsequently on firms' financial results. Originality/value This study presents an inter-functional model that links organizational behavior, marketing and finance functions, through the marketing value chain to overcome organizational inertia and create firm value.

J	Nguyen, TD; Phung, HT; Vo, NT; Tran, TC; Hoang, SC				Thanh Duc Nguyen; Hung Thanh Phung; Ngoc Tuan Vo; Thanh Chi Tran; Sa Cao Hoang			Level and Influencing Factors of Job Motivation Among Administrative Staff at Public Hospitals in Vietnam	INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING			English	Article						administrative staff; job motivation; influencing factor; public hospital		Administrative staff at healthcare facilities, who are not either doctors or nurses, coordinate, facilitate patient care, and account for 18-20% of human resources in hospitals. Their contribution to the value chain of healthcare service is crucial, but they are not well recognized either by hospital managers and healthcare staff or by patients. Low recognition may cause low job motivation and repeated tasks may cause boredom for them. Our study aimed to assess the level of job motivation among administrative staff in 2 hospitals of Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, and explore the influencing factors to job motivation. The exploratory mixed methods design was used in our study with an initial quantitative study with a designed questionnaire and then followed by a qualitative study with focus group discussions. The job motivation index of the administrative staff in our study was not high (4.0). Positive factors were extra income, higher education, healthcare benefits, and a good working environment. Negative factors were low salary index, less chance of higher education, and no separated key performance indicator criteria. The low job motivation index of the administrative staff at public hospitals in our study warns of the negative impact on hospital income in terms of patient satisfaction. In the future, hospitals should have a new strategy in human resource management specifically for administrative staff by maintaining the positive factors and step-by-step overcome the negative factors such as developing separated key performance indicator criteria.

Investigating the Socio-Economic and Livelihoods Impacts of African Swine Fever in Timor-Leste: An Application of Spatial Group Model Building	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						African Swine Fever; spatial group model building; Timor-Leste; value chain; livelihoods	VALUE CHAIN DEVELOPMENT; POLICY OPTIONS	Small-scale pig farming is highly important to the economic and social status of households in Timor-Leste. The presence of an African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreak in Timor-Leste was confirmed in 2019, a major concern given that around 70% of agricultural households practice pig farming. This research used a virtual spatial group model building process to construct a concept model to better understand the main feedback loops that determine the socio-economic and livelihood impacts of the ASF outbreak. After discussing the interaction of reinforcing and balancing feedback loops in the concept model, potential leverage points for intervention are suggested that could reduce the impacts of ASF within socio-economic spheres. These include building trust between small-scale farmers and veterinary technicians, strengthening government veterinary services, and the provision of credit conditional on biosecurity investments to help restock the industry. This conceptual model serves as a starting point for further research and the future development of a quantitative system dynamics (SD) model which would allow ex-ante scenario-testing of various policy and technical mitigation strategies of ASF outbreaks in Timor-Leste and beyond.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Performance; Governance; Knowledge acquisition; Global value chain; Apparel industry	KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT; EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; NETWORKS; FIRM; COLLABORATION; EMBEDDEDNESS; ANTECEDENTS; STRATEGIES	Purpose This study aims to integrate social capital theory and the knowledge-based view of firms to develop and test a theoretical framework of the mechanisms that explain the influence of relational governance (RG) on lead-time performance (LTP) of developing-country suppliers in global value chains (GVCs). The authors distinguish between the relational and structural dimensions of RG to explain how they interact to create knowledge and leaning opportunities that transform into performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses were tested using data collected from a sample of 321 Bangladeshi suppliers embedded in apparel GVCs by using structural equation modeling. Findings RG creates knowledge and learning opportunities that transform into LTP. Relationship quality (RQ) is found to contribute positively to knowledge learned (KL) contingent on relationship structure. KL is found to fully mediate the influence of buyer-supplier RQ on LTP of suppliers. Research limitations/implications The dyadic nature of buyer-supplier interactions calls for multisource approaches in measuring buyer-supplier RQ. The authors also recommend future research to test the model in other industries for greater generalizability. Practical implications Developing-country suppliers in low-technology labor-intensive GVCs can improve their LTP by strengthening their capabilities for internalizing external knowledge and developing and maintaining high quality relationships with wide networks of buyers. Originality/value The conceptualization of RG that explicitly distinguishes between the relational and structural dimensions is novel and should inspire future theoretical and empirical research on GVC governance and performance.

For this reason, a risk analysis of AIV prevalence was conducted accounting for all value chain factors. A cross-sectional study of poultry flock managers and poultry on backyard farms, commercial (high biosecurity) farms, LBMs and poultry delivery stations (PDSs) in four districts of Vinh Long province was conducted between December 2016 and August 2017. A total of 3597 swab samples were collected from birds from 101 backyard farms, 50 commercial farms, 58 sellers in LBMs and 19 traders in PDSs. Swab samples were submitted for AIV isolation. At the same time a questionnaire was administered to flock managers asking them to provide details of their knowledge, attitude and practices related to avian influenza. Multiple correspondence analysis and a mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression model were developed to identify enterprise and flock manager characteristics that increased the risk of AIV positivity. A total of 274 birds were positive for AIV isolation, returning an estimated true prevalence of 7.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.8%-8.5%]. The odds of a bird being AIV positive if it was from an LBM or PDS were 45 (95% CI: 3.4-590) and 25 (95% CI: 1.4-460), respectively, times higher to the odds of a bird from a commercial poultry farm being AIV positive. The odds of birds being AIV positive for respondents with a mixed (uncertain or inconsistent) level and a low level of knowledge about AI were 5.0 (95% CI: 0.20-130) and 3.5 (95% CI: 0.2-62), respectively, times higher to the odd of birds being positive for respondents with a good knowledge of AI. LBMs and PDSs should receive specific emphasis in AI control programs in Vietnam. Our findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that incomplete respondent knowledge of AI and AIV spread mechanism were associated with an increased risk of AIV positivity. Delivery of education programs specifically designed for those in each enterprise will assist in this regard. The timing and frequency of delivery of education programs are likely to be important if the turnover of those working in LBMs and PDSs is high.

J	Lanfranchi, D; Grassi, L				Lanfranchi, Davide; Grassi, Laura			Examining insurance companies' use of technology for innovation	GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE			English	Article; Early Access						Insurance; Innovation framework; COVID-19; Risk; InsurTech; Technology; Fintech; Business model	DEMAND-PULL; HEALTH-CARE; PUSH; SERVICE; RISK	The insurance industry is innovating. Business models, services and processes are rapidly evolving, largely backed by technological developments. The particular historical context of COVID-19 provides a suitable case to understand the relevance of exploiting technology to react quickly to traditional and emerging risks. Focusing on the initiatives put in place by the most influential insurance companies at the global level, we have framed the innovation mechanisms in the industry, highlighting four rationales underpinning these initiatives (Adaption, Expansion, Reaction and Aggression), which differ according to the relevance of the technology in use and innovation to the portfolio of risks covered. Overall, it emerges that insurance companies have the room and capability to innovate, in many cases using technological applications to cover new and existing risks. While the initiatives studied concern the entire value chain, basic primary activities, such as product development, sales and claims management, show that innovation based on new or existing technology determines the success and competitiveness of the business.

To this end, we merged detailed Belgian linked panel data, covering all years from 2002 to 2010, with a unique dataset containing accurate information on the yearly position of each firm in the value chain. We rely on the methodological framework pioneered by Hellerstein et al. (Journal of Labor Economics, 1999, 17, 409) to estimate panel data models at the firm level. Controlling for key worker and firm characteristics, our GMM-SYS and FE-IV estimates show that firms positioned more upstream (i.e. further away from the final consumer) create more value. Our results also indicate that the impact of firm-level upstreamness is stronger on productivity than on wage costs, which implies that profitability is fostered. More precisely, in line with Belgium's strong labour market institutions, our estimates suggest that the productivity gains associated with upstreamness are shared almost equally between wages and profits.

JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS			English	Article; Early Access						living wages; supply chains; sustainable consumption	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; SLACK RESOURCES; VALUE CHAIN; PERFORMANCE; CONSUMPTION; COMMITMENT; MOTIVATION; REPUTATION; CONSUMER	The sustainability of Fair Trade ultimately relies on consumers choosing fair-traded products. To date, research has tended to study consumer and producer engagement, and reactions to Fair Trade separately. These areas do, however, interconnect systematically through supply chains. In this paper, we introduce a self-catalyzing model of Fair Trade which acknowledges those interconnections, traces them along supply chains from producer to consumer and addresses different international development priorities articulated in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Its conceptual elements span (a) product quality, in this case, taste experience influenced by organoleptic properties and moral satisfaction; (b) organizational morality via corporate social responsibility and living wages; and (c) strategic management of slack farming resources-each catalyzed by, and catalyzing, positive emotions. Contingencies at each point in the model alter the likelihood that produce will be and feel fair and taste better to consumers.

J	Goldberg, ZA				Goldberg, Zachary A.			Development through commodification: exploring apple commodity production as pesticide promotion in the High Atlas	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article; Early Access						Pesticides; Commodification; Political ecology; Agrarian change; Africa; Plan Maroc Vert; Green revolution	VALUE CHAINS; FRUIT; AGRICULTURE; QUALITY; FOOD; ENVIRONMENTALISM; SUSTAINABILITY; NEOLIBERALISM; CONTAMINATION; EXPOSURE	Global development initiatives frequently promote agricultural commodity chain projects to improve livelihoods. In Morocco, development projects, including the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV), have promoted apple production in rural regions of the country. In order to access domestic markets, these new apple producers often use pesticides to meet market standards. Through situated ethnographic inquiry and commodity chain analysis, using a combination of surveys (n = 120) and interviews (n = 84) with apple wholesalers, government officials, along with farmers, this paper works to critique the PMV's development approach that implicitly values commodification. By exploring interconnected processes of commodification, I link subsidized apple saplings and cold storage infrastructure to the dependence on pesticide usage, which has become a part of daily village life. This has important implications for community health and riparian ecosystems. Alternatively, I propose how we can imagine different development trajectories that decommodify livelihoods by focusing on local knowledge creation and diversification strategies.

J	Marques, P; Barbera-Tomas, D				Marques, Pedro; Barbera-Tomas, David			Innovating but still poor: The challenges of regional development in regions with mature industries	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article; Early Access						firm innovation; less developed regions; mature industries; regional development	POLICY; STRATEGIES; GEOGRAPHY; GROWTH; WINE	The persistence of patterns of decline or stagnation in developed countries has led to a renewed interest in the study of less developed regions. This renewed interest is informed by a variety of approaches, which range from studies on the unequal distribution of economic power and resources to analysis of regional endowments, such as human capital or quality of institutions. However, a persistent misconception in some of this literature is that the primary factor explaining levels of development is innovation happening within firms. In particular, this narrative fails to consider the role of national and international agents and processes, the impact of value chain management on value appropriation, and the challenges to diversification within peripheral regions. This paper will contribute to this debate by developing these matters theoretically and by drawing on an analysis of three wine regions in Portugal.

In recent years, it has been widely used in various food items. The increasing demand for Cistanches Herba has led to problems such as overexploitation and quality deterioration. The quality and safety of herbal medicines are critical and have been shown to be affected by the value chain (VC). Using the VC framework, the study is embedded in a larger study aiming to investigate the effects of different VCs types on the quality and stakeholders of Cistanches Herba. In this study, 90 Cistanches Herba samples were collected during fieldwork. An additional 40 samples were obtained from the herbal markets and medicine purchasing stations. Semi-structured interviews and key informant interviews were performed to collect data on stakeholders in major production areas. These samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with the k-means clustering method; a targeted quality assessment strategy based on chemical analysis was adopted to understand the quality of Cistanches Herba. Based on market research, the collected samples were divided into different grades through k-means clustering analysis. Moreover, quality differences of Cistanches Herba in Alxa region were explored through DNA barcoding and chemical analysis. Accordingly, 10 different types of VCs were determined in the production of Cistanches Herba. The results show that there is a close relationship between the quality of Cistanches Herba and stakeholder benefits. Vertical integration at different levels was found for independent farmer-based VCs, horizontal collaboration was found in the cooperative-based VCs. The vertical coordination has led to a more consistent traceability system and strict regulation of supply chains. At the same time, the Cistanches Herba were divided into three grades. Through DNA barcoding and chemical analysis, we found that the quality differences between Cistanches Herba in the Alxa area were not significant.

Different polymers namely poly-vinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP) and low (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were mixed with homogenized fish and seafood samples. Homogenized samples were analyzed using MIR spectroscopy and classification models developed using machine learning algorithms such as partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The results of this study revealed that it was possible to identify between adulterated and non-adulterated samples as well as the different microplastic types added to the homogenized samples using ATR-MIR spectroscopy. This study confirmed the ability of combining machine learning methods with ATR-MIR spectroscopy to directly analyze microplastic adulteration in fleshy foods such as fish and seafood. This proof-of-concept study can be utilized and extended to monitor the presence of plastics either in a wide range of fleshy foods or along the entire food value chain. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The causal identification of the tax system reform and the sustainable export innovation behavior of firms are of great significance. This study uses the income tax sharing policy of China to examine the impact of fiscal centralization on the sustainable export innovation behavior of firms. We find that this tax reform has significantly inhibited the increase of the export value-added rate of firms, and has an increasing trend with the share ratio between the Central Government and the local government. Moreover, this effect mainly comes from the crowding-out effect of imported intermediate goods on domestic intermediate goods. The tests show that the above conclusions are consistent with the general logic of local governments. When they face greater downward fiscal pressure, they will further pass the tax burden on local firms and force the firms to promote their export performance to expand the tax base. This short-sighted behavior of replacing "quality improvement" with "quantity increase" is an important factor that affects the sustainable export innovation behavior of firms and the climb in the global value chain.

J	Wu, L; Liu, H; Bao, YC				Wu, Liang; Liu, Heng; Bao, Yongchuan			Outside-in thinking, value chain collaboration and business model innovation in manufacturing firms	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article; Early Access						Outside-in thinking; Business model innovation; Competitive intensity; Regulatory volatility; Customer interaction	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPEED; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE; ORIENTATION; RESOURCE; SERVICE; DESIGN; COOPETITION	Purpose This paper aims to explore how manufacturing firms pursue business model innovation (BMI) through their use of outside-in thinking. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected on 175 Chinese manufacturing firms. A regression model was used to verify the research results. Findings Manufacturing firms rely on outside-in thinking to develop BMI under different market and institutional environments. From a whole-value-chain perspective, interacting with customers and sharing information with suppliers are two key ways to develop BMI. Research limitations/implications Firms focus on customer needs, sense the dynamics of external markets and technology and seize market opportunities to measure outside-in thinking. Empirical results suggest using other measures of outside-in thinking. BMI itself can be multidimensional, so scholars could consider BMI's diverse dimensions and measurements, which may demand different kinds of outside-in thinking. Practical implications Manufacturing firms can use outside-in thinking to overcome inertia and rigidity and increase their knowledge, information and technology. Managers should develop outside-in thinking to respond quickly to emerging economies. Managers should use value chain collaboration and improve the firm's capacity to interact with customers and suppliers to apply the benefits of outside-in thinking to their BMI. Originality/value The study explores how outside-in thinking is a key driver of BMI. Applying the whole-value-chain view, it finds that interacting with customers and suppliers connects outside-in thinking with BMI. It also highlights the effects of intense market competition and volatile government regulation on BMI.

Our work deploys a unique feature of the CE indicator: it can be decomposed, allowing for matrix comparisons at various levels within one coherent framework. To illustrate the power of this approach, we apply the technique to five multi-region input-output (MRIO) tables for 2011, derived from the Eora, EXIOBASE, GTAP, OECD and WIOD databases. We make pairwise comparisons between MRIOs and between global value chain (GVC) computations based on these MRIOs. We find that answers to questions related to broader aggregates are generally quite similar, but that answers to questions at the level of single industries can be rather different across MRIOs.

J	Yu, G; Zhou, XB				Yu, Guo; Zhou, Xiaobo			The influence and countermeasures of digital economy on cultivating new driving force of high-quality economic development in Henan Province under the background of "double circulation"	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Double circulation; Digital economy; High-quality development; New driving force; Henan Province		This article focuses on the impact of the digital economy on cultivating new driving force of high-quality economic development in Henan Province and the countermeasures under the background of the "double circulation". Through the research on the status quo of Henan Province's digital economy and high-quality economic development, it is concluded that since the reform and opening up, Henan Province has achieved rapid and steady development at the macroeconomic level. Since the reform and opening up, the output value of the three main industries in Henan Province has continued to grow and the industrial structure has continuously optimized. However, in the domestic horizontal comparison, the economic development of Henan Province has not yet formed a prominent advantage. Henan Province still needs to further optimize the economic development structure and promote high-quality economic development. Through the theoretical and empirical analysis of the digital economy's high-quality economic development in Henan Province under the background of the "double circulation", this project found that the development of the digital economy promotes the cultivation of new driving force of high-quality economic development in Henan Province under the background of the "double circulation". Henan Province needs to make full use of the development opportunities of the digital economy under the background of the "double circulation", and adopts a variety of comprehensive measures to take advantage of the situation to promote the high-quality development of the province's economy. The research of this project believes that under the background of "double circulation", Henan Province uses the digital economy to cultivate New driving force for high-quality economic development. Although certain results have achieved, some problems have exposed, mainly including the lagging foundation of using the digital economy to cultivate high-quality economic development. Failed to make full use of the digital economy to cultivate leading companies that promote high-quality economic development, the government has not fully adapted to the digital economy's demand for cultivating new driving force of high-quality economic development, and companies lack the talents to use the digital economy to promote their own innovation and high-quality development. Further in-depth exploration found that the factors for the above problems mainly include not deeply the dual nature of production and consumption of digital infrastructure construction under the background of "double circulation", but ignoring the "pull the ox by the nose (grasp the key link)" status of leading enterprises in the cultivation of new driving force of high-quality economic development. The enthusiasm for the transformation of government functions and the adjustment of organizational structure is insufficient, and there are obstacles, and the introduction and training system of high-quality professionals in the field of digital economy is lacking. Through the mechanism analysis of the digital economy on the high-quality economic development of Henan Province under the background of the "double circulation", the analysis of development issues and causes combined with relevant literature analysis and field investigations. The project puts forward the use of digital in Henan Province Countermeasures for the economy to cultivate new driving force of high-quality economic development. Henan Province's digital infrastructure construction builds a solid foundation for high-quality economic development. The consumption upgrades as the engine used to cultivate a group of leading companies at the high end of the industrial value chain, improves the government support system, builds a support system for high-quality economic development in Henan Province, and strengthens the digital economy of enterprises by the use of professional talent team building.

Interest in the capacity of the dromedary species to enhance desert ecosystems and to be a potential lever of economic development of these marginal zones only started to grow in the last two decades. Based on an empirical survey of 179 stakeholders in four Mediterranean countries, we explored the links of the stakeholders in the dromedary sector in two dimensions: horizontal links with peers and vertical links along the value chain and in resource management. Both descriptive statistics and social network analysis highlight the original organization of the dromedary sector around herders and their social and cultural organization at the territorial level. Therefore, even if milk production and processing start to constitute an opportunity for the young generation who do not necessarily have the financial capacity to invest in a large dromedary herd, this change towards milk valorization can only happen if it is linked with the traditional system based on mobility. Using a systemic approach and working toward multiple valorizations of dromedary products instead of only targeting milk productivity should be explored.</p>	[Alary, Veronique; Amsidder, Lina; Faye, Bernard] MUSE Univ Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, INRAE, SELMET,CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Alary, Veronique] ICARDA, CIRAD, Tunis 1004, Tunisia; [Amsidder, Lina] IAV, CIRAD, UMR SELMET, Rabat 6202, Morocco; [Araba, Abdelilah; Boujenane, Ismail] Hassan II Agron & Vet Med Inst, Dept Anim Prod & Biotechnol, Rabat 6202, Morocco; [Capote, Cecilio Barba] Univ Cordoba, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Anim Prod, Cordoba 14014, Spain; [Bedhiaf-Romdhani, Sonia] Univ Carthage, Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie INRAT, Lab Prod Anim & Fourrageres, Tunis 1004, Tunisia; [Bensalem, Wiem] OEP, Off Elevage & Paturage, Tunis 1002, Tunisia; [Elena, Ciani] Univ Bari, Dept Biosci Biotechnol & Biopharmaceut, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Letaief, Neirouz] Natl Agron Inst Tunisia INAT, Tunis 1004, Tunisia; [Gaouar, Semir Bechir Suheil] Univ Tlemcen, Fac SNV STU, Lab Genet Appliquee Agr Ecol & Sante Publ, Tilimsen 13097, Algeria; [Pastrana, Carlos Iglesias; Baena, Sergio Nogales] Univ Cordoba, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Genet, Cordoba 14014, Spain; [Amine, Laridji] Univ Tlemcen, Fac FSEG, Lab MECAS, Tilimsen 13097, Algeria		Alary, V (corresponding author), MUSE Univ Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, INRAE, SELMET,CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France.; Alary, V (corresponding author), ICARDA, CIRAD, Tunis 1004, Tunisia.	veronique.alary@cirad.fr; lina.amsidder@cirad.fr; a.araba@gmail.com; cjbarba@uco.es; bedhiaf.sonia@gmail.com; bensalem.wiem@gmail.com; i.boujenane@iav.ac.ma; elena.ciani1976.ec@gmail.com; neyrouz2008@gmail.com; bjfaye50@gmail.com; suheilgaouar@gmail.com; ciglesiaspastrana@gmail.com; seio21@hotmail.com; laridjiaminmohammed@gmail.com	CAPOTE, CECILIO BARBA/Q-9574-2019	CAPOTE, CECILIO BARBA/0000-0001-8363-1673; Gaouar, Semir Bechir Suheil/0000-0001-8691-7116; IGLESIAS PASTRANA, CARLOS/0000-0003-3765-1627; faye, bernard/0000-0002-5762-5453; Alary, Veronique/0000-0003-4844-5423	national research agencies in the four partner countries involved in the CARAVAN project "Toward a CAmel tRAnsnational VAlue chain" (ARIMnet project) [FP7-ERANET-2013 RTD-KBBE.2013.1.4-0.3: 618127]; French National Research Agency (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR); Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary (IAV Hassan II, Morocco); National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRAT); University Abou Bekr Belkaid Tlemcen (UABT); University of Cordoba	This research was funded by the national research agencies in the four partner countries involved in the CARAVAN project "Toward a CAmel tRAnsnational VAlue chain" (ARIMnet project FP7-ERANET-2013 RTD-KBBE.2013.1.4-0.3: 618127, coordinated by the University of Cordoba), and the field study in Morocco was co-funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR) and the Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary (IAV Hassan II, Morocco), in Tunisia by the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRAT), in Algeria by the University Abou Bekr Belkaid Tlemcen (UABT) and in Spain by the University of Cordoba.

J	Alcalde-Gonzalez, V; Mozo, AG; Bustos, AV				Alcalde-Gonzalez, Verna; Galvez Mozo, Ana; Valenzuela Bustos, Alan			No clean rooms, no hotel business: Subversion tactics in Las Kellys' struggle for dignity in hotel housekeeping	ANNALS OF TOURISM RESEARCH			English	Article						Hotel housekeeping; Room attendants; Dirty work; Subversion tactics; Collective action; Dignity at work	5 STAR HOTELS; DIRTY WORK; EMPLOYMENT; ATTENDANTS; TOURISM; WOMEN; LABOR; INDUSTRY; HEALTH; WAGE	This article examines the struggle of room attendants in Spain for dignity in hotel housekeeping. We focus on Las Kellys' collective action to counter stigma as well as dignify the work of room attendants. To do so, we conducted qualitative, digital ethnography, comprising 40 semi-structured interviews, online observation and documentary analysis, and we based our analysis on the political notion of 'subversion tactics' and a multi-level conceptualisation of dignity in tourism employment. Our analysis reveals that Las Kellys deploys three subversion tactics that impinge on three different but interrelated levels: room attendant as a skilled and rewarding job (occupational level), housekeeping as the heart of the value chain (organisational level), and Las Kellys as a socio-political agent (socio-political level).

J	Anastasiadis, F; Alebaki, M				Anastasiadis, Foivos; Alebaki, Maria			Mapping the Greek Wine Supply Chain: A Proposed Research Framework	FOODS			English	Article						food supply chain; agri-food sector; sustainability; value chain	INDUSTRY; DESIGN	The wine industry involves both the production (i.e., from vine to wine) and consumption of wine (i.e., dining and tourism experiences). This results in a complicated system of intertwined product and services supply chains. Recent studies in the field suggest several key perspectives for future research, such as sustainability, resilience and circular economy. However, the complex nature of the sector which comprises numerous stakeholders and flows (i.e., products-services-information), entailing knotty interactions and interdependencies, makes any research direction questionable in terms of its effectiveness. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide a tool for designing targeted future research in such multiple environments. We employed an end-to-end mapping approach using data from the Greek wine supply chain, identifying essential insights for a compelling research agenda. The key output is a set of three supply chain maps revealing the structure, processes and actors from all the main angles: basic production, value chain and stakeholders. A synthesis of these maps supports an overall understanding of the sector, unmasking any interaction and hidden information holdups. The study thus aims to offer an integrated research framework that highlights the leading priorities of the Greek wine industry.

J	Appiah, MK; Sedegah, DD; Akolaa, RA				Appiah, Michael Karikari; Sedegah, Daniella Delali; Akolaa, Rosemary Anderson			The implications of macroenvironmental forces and SMEs investment behaviour in the energy sector: the role of supply chain resilience	HELIYON			English	Article						Downstream oil and gas; Ghana; Investment intention; Non-renewable energy PLS	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; INFORMATION; ENVIRONMENT	Following a theory of strategic positioning perspective, this paper aims to explore the operating context in which dimensions of the macro-environment factors are likely to enhance Small and Medium Enterprise's (SMEs) in-tentions to invest in the Ghana's' downstream oil and gas sector. Specifically, macro environment model has been developed wherein an important exogenous context (supply chain resilience) variable has been considered and studied its moderating effect on the relationship between macro environment dimensions and intentions to invest. The study also, examined the conditional effect of micro environment dimensions on intention to invest at different levels of supply chain resilience. Using Partial Least Square method we analyze cross sectional data across Ghana's SMEs spectrum between the periods 2017-2018. Our indicative evidence suggests that political factors, economic factors, environmental factors and technological factors are related to SMEs intentions to invest in the down stream oil and gas. Moreover, the research findings revealed that supply chain resilience moderated the relationship between macroenvironment dimensions and intention to invest. The link between macro envi-ronment dimensions and intention to invest was strengthened via the interaction effect of supply chain resilience. These robust results are consistent with the theory of strategic positioning. Overall, our results are akin to policy makers agenda to create enabling macro environment to improve local businesses participation in the Ghanaian oil and gas value chain. Besides, the findings will assist SMEs owners and managers in their decisi ons to invest in the downstream oil and gas sector by strengthening investment capability at different levels of Supply chain resilience.

The hypothesis of this study was the assumption that phenotypic evaluation of indigenous livestock may drive the establishment of breed standards and official breed recognition, and, therefore, promote more local business opportunities. On the basis of more integrative and participatory theoretical background to applying any decision based on phenotype, we designed this research to determine the most typical and unusual phenotypes of Pantaneiro sheep. Pantaneiro ewes (281 ewes from five conservation units in five counties) were evaluated, bearing in mind both conservation and development. Descriptive statistics were used to classify ewes into typical, intermediate, and unusual phenotypes. Chi-squared tests for association were performed to test if morphological variation in the different sampling sites occurred randomly (p > 0.05) or not (p < 0.05). Some results suggest some sort of diversifying selection pressure, i.e., distinct preferences among keepers. We observed considerable morphologic variation among ewes, but it was straightforward to determine the predominant phenotypes. The study evokes integrative agrobiodiversity by putting phenotypical characterization of indigenous livestock into perspective. Discussions coming from this study may support innovative governance and participative decision-making, allied with strategies that value the socioeconomic, biocultural, and adaptive aspects of indigenous livestock in tropical regions and developing countries. This is a challenge for government, rare-breed keepers, value-chain actors, and civil society.

J	Armijo, A; Elguezabal, P; Lasarte, N; Weise, M				Armijo, Alberto; Elguezabal, Peru; Lasarte, Natalia; Weise, Matthias			A Methodology for the Digitalization of the Residential Building Renovation Process through OpenBIM-Based Workflows	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						building renovation; BIM; interoperability; OpenBIM; BPMN; workflows; digital construction; retrofitting; IDS	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; DESIGN; INFRASTRUCTURE; FRAMEWORK	The European building industry is facing a strong increase in renovation processes, which are still non-cost-effective, involve unproperly coordinated stakeholders, are disturbing for the occupants, and cause important inefficiencies in the overall renovation process. In this context, digitalization and Building Information Modelling (BIM), as an enabler, is the key solution that may drive renovation interventions to ensure a more successful and leaner process, aiding the whole value chain of actors to achieve its full potential. This research describes the OpenBIM methodology applied in order to transform the implicit knowledge from the stakeholders involved in the building renovation process, not structured enough for automation, into an OpenBIM digital process based on the BIM standards. The outcomes of this research are the OpenBIM ready workflows that represent the renovation process and information requirements according to the involvement of different stakeholders rooted in the analysis of barriers, requirements, and needs. Those workflows are the basis for the future development of specific products and tools for boosting digitalization and interoperability in the renovation process.

This framework (i) describes the structural changes needed for a sustainable transition in food systems; (ii) assess their effects on employment at the farm and processing industry level; (iii) detect the political levers needed to make this transition a just one-that is, preserving jobs and livelihoods for communities. Using the decarbonation pathway for the agricultural sector issued from the French National Low-Carbon Strategy as reference, we developed two scenarios for the French dairy sector which have the same level of climate ambitious, but a different approach to reach the target. Aiming exclusively to achieve a greenhouse gases reduction, the first scenario relies only on supply side measures. This scenario has a negative impact in terms of employment loss at the farm level and in the agri-food sector. In contrast, a multifunctional scenario considering simultaneously climate, biodiversity, health, and employment issues, and playing with policy measures targeting supply, demand and market organisation can maintain jobs in the farm and agri-food sector, contributes to restore the agro-biodiversity and develops food products compatible with healthy nutritional guidelines.

However, it is still complex to define, understand, and assess it due to the multiple factors it involves, especially in the emergency services. Aims: To identify the main factors that influence the quality of the medical emergency services provided across the health care network of one of the Health Promoting Entities (abbreviated EPS in Spanish) in Medellin, Colombia. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted based on the foundations of the SERVQUAL model. A total of 511 people, selected by means of criterion-based nonprobability sampling, participated in this study. Results: Three key factors were found to influence users' perceived quality of emergency services in Medellin. The first factor corresponds to assurance and trust; the second, to institutional infrastructure; and the third, to responsiveness and its impact on expected and experienced service. This latter proves that patient follow-up is important to enhance user perception of such services. Conclusions: Service quality measurement models are a fundamental tool to identify the real variables that affect patients' perception of a service. In addition, they help to improve the value chain processes involved in providing a service that fully satisfies user expectations.

How Maize Seed Systems Can Contribute to the Control of Mycotoxigenic Fungal Infection: A Perspective	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						Fusarium verticillioides; mycotoxigenic fungi; mycotoxins; seed systems; sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays	FUSARIUM-VERTICILLIOIDES; AFLATOXIN CONTAMINATION; FUMONISIN CONTAMINATION; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; ASPERGILLUS-NIGER; TOXIGENIC FUNGI; STRAINS; FOOD; MONILIFORME; STRATEGIES	Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi on agricultural produce. Mycotoxins can be cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenic, and they are persistent threats to human and animal health. Consumption of mycotoxin-contaminated maize can cause cancer and even sudden death. Health hazards can also occur from consuming products from animals fed with mycotoxin-contaminated feed or forage. The main mode of spread of mycotoxigenic fungi is through air-borne spores originating from soil or plant debris, although some fungi can also spread through infected seed-to-seedling transmission, ultimately followed by contamination of the harvestable product. This perspective assesses opportunities to prevent mycotoxigenic fungal infection in maize seeds produced for sowing as an important starting point of crop contamination. A case study of Nigeria showed infection in all tested farmer-produced, seed company, and foundation seed samples. A schematic overview of the formal and informal seed systems is presented to analyze their contribution to fungal infection and mycotoxin contamination in the maize value chain, as well as to set criteria for successful control. We recommend an integrated approach to control mycotoxigenic fungal infection, including resistant varieties and other control methods during seed production, grain production, and grain storage, with an important role in maintaining seed health.

J	Bilbao-Ubillos, J; Camino-Beldarrain, V				Bilbao-Ubillos, Javier; Camino-Beldarrain, Vicente			Reconfiguring global value chains in a post-Brexit world: A technological interpretation	TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Brexit; Value chains; Uncertainty; Relocation of operations; Technological conditioning factors; Industrial policy		With the uncertainties that it may entail in terms of possible trade barriers between the UK and the EU, increased exchange rate risk, restrictions on the establishment of professionals and possible changes in regulations on the environment, tax and protection of competition, Brexit could exacerbate the process of re-localisation of operations that commenced to a small extent some years ago. This process was based on technological innovations under the heading of Industry 4.0, and more recently strengthened by the supply problems that came to light during the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the social, political and institutional context matters a lot, we believe that technology is going to be a conditioning element in the ability of businesses to reconfigure the value chains in which they are involved. We propose a typology based on this technological perspective that could have considerable potential impact in defining business strategies in numerous industries and in orienting industrial policy in countries striving to acquire a more central role or to prevent themselves from being cut out of the global value chain.

Eliza J.; Bax, Vincent; Ganzenmueller, Raphael; Francesconi, Wendy			Broadening the Perspective of Zero-Deforestation Interventions in Peru by Incorporating Concepts from the Global Value Chain Literature	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						agricultural commodities; supply chains; Peruvian Amazon; Zero-deforestation; value chains; climate action	TROPICAL FOREST; SUSTAINABILITY; INITIATIVES; POLICY	Global narratives around the links between deforestation and agricultural commodity production have led to the application of voluntary zero-deforestation agreements between companies, governments, and civil society. The continued tropical deforestation warrants a re-examination of this approach in order to customize its application for a particular location. Our paper contributes to this by exploring the spatial associations between deforestation and the production of cacao, coffee, and oil palm in the Amazon region in Peru. The geographical overlaps between deforestation, and the distribution of these commodity crops, indicate four types of spatial associations: (1) a high degree of deforestation and a high degree of commodity production (high-high); (2) a high degree of deforestation and a low degree of commodity production (high-low); (3) a low degree of deforestation and a high degree of commodity production (low-high); and (4) a low degree of deforestation and a low degree of commodity production (low-low). On the basis of these associations, we present four scenarios in which zero-deforestation supply chain interventions may operate in Peru and argue that broadening the perspective of such interventions by adopting a global value chain lens can improve the use of previously deforested lands, prevent unintended or future deforestation and, in turn, ensure that no forest area is left behind.

J	Creighton, R; Jestratijevic, I; Lee, D				Creighton, Rachel; Jestratijevic, Iva; Lee, Daton			Sustainability supplier scorecard assessment tools: A comparison between apparel retailers	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL FASHION MARKETING			English	Article						Scorecards; sustainability; suppliers; retailers; supply chain	SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY; CHAIN MANAGEMENT; FASHION BUSINESS; SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY	The purpose of this qualitative study is to evaluate and compare eight sustainability supplier scorecard assessment tools in use among five major international apparel retailers, Walmart, Eileen Fisher, Nike, H&M, and Gap. Inductive content analysis was used to study the raw textual data and make evidence-based inferences. Results showed that the field of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is subject to inefficiencies because there are inadequate standards for reporting information which would expose these inefficiencies. The investigated tools varied in terms of scope, performance measurements, and scoring methodologies, which had negative effects on their comparability. This obstacle, however, does not invalidate the major findings, which revealed an evident and concerning lack of information to support the practical application of the tools investigated. Because no retailer disclosed information about its lower tier suppliers' assessments, it is uncertain whether and how suppliers in lower tiers are engaged in sustainability assessments. Because sustainability violations occur at a higher rate within fragmented supply chains, it is critical to communicate supplier engagement throughout the value chain.

A general procedure for predicting the remaining shelf life of nectarines and peaches for virtualization of the value chain	POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Stone fruit; Ready-to-eat; Q10; Supply chain; Shelf life model	STORAGE-TEMPERATURE; COLD-STORAGE; FRUIT; QUALITY; EMISSIONS; OXYGEN	Decision-making along the supply chain requires accurate estimates of the remaining shelf life (RSHL) depending upon not only the initial storage conditions and duration but also aspects such as the variety or condition of the fruit at harvest. Offering ready-to-eat fruit on at the retail level, is a frequent marketing strategy in which management of shelf life is mandatory. The most widespread models, so-called generic shelf life models for estimating the RSHL gather the actual temperature series and the optimal storage temperature while assuming standard values for other parameters such Q10 or the reference shelf life. In this work, a general mathematical procedure, and corresponding algorithm are proposed to adjust the parameters of the generic RSHL model referring to several varieties of peaches and nectarines. Postharvest protocols are simulated to obtain ready-toeat fruit for recently bred varieties. To this aim, temperature was recorded continuously throughout the postharvest protocol, while instrumental and sensory evaluations were taken at the end of each stage of the protocol. Outputs of a principal component analysis based on instrumental data allowed to i) identify the instrumental variables most relevant to sensory evaluation and corresponding evolution under shelf life conditions and ii) define a multidimensional estimator of shelf life. The particular values of this multidimensional estimator together with the temperature series are the basis to solve the equation that lead to specific values of Q10 and reference shelf life for each variety in the study. The average reference shelf life of peaches is bounded to 24 d, 30 % shorter (10 d less) than the average shelf life of nectarines. The Q10 values are bounded between 1.5 and 2.8, highlighting the varietal effects. Generally, Q10 values for peaches are indicative of a higher susceptibility to the breakage of the cold chain compared to nectarines.	[Diezma, B.; Barreiro, P.; Baltazar, P.; Correa, E.

The extent of these impacts will largely depend on the level of political and structural adaptations. This study aims to evaluate the effect of increasing water shortages on agricultural income and employment. It also analyzes structural adaptation strategies implemented by farmers in response to this challenge. We have therefore developed a regionally disaggregated supply model to simulate three types of scenarios concerning (i) decreasing quantities of irrigation water at the regional level; (ii) enhanced irrigation water use efficiency; and (iii) higher production prices. Observed crop production data for 21 crops and 24 districts of Tunisia have been used. Districts have been aggregated into five regions based on bioclimatic homogeneity. Results show that climate change will lead to the reduction of irrigated areas and an increased importance of rainfed agriculture. It will also have a negative impact on farm income and employment. This negative effect can be fully mitigated by improving water use efficiency, at farm and perimeter levels, and can be reversed by offering more attractive producer prices to farmers through enhanced value chain integration.

J	Giuliani, A; Undurraga, JT; Dunkel, T; Aung, SM				Giuliani, Alessandra; Undurraga, Jose Tomas; Dunkel, Theresa; Aung, Saw Min			Access and Benefit Sharing and the Sustainable Trade of Biodiversity in Myanmar: The Case of Thanakha	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						ABS Institutional framework; BioTrade; Burmese thanaka; traditional knowledge; genetic resources; natural ingredients; value chain; Nagoya Protocol; <p>Hesperethusa crenulate/Limonia acidisssima</p>	NAGOYA PROTOCOL	The global demand for biological resources to use as natural ingredients in diverse products is rising rapidly. This creates investment opportunities for nature-based products, creating pressure on and threats to biodiversity and its associated traditional knowledge (TK). Myanmar's great biodiversity is attractive for scientific investigations searching for natural substances for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and other uses. Myanmar is amid profound political and economic changes, exposing the country to risks and opportunities. The recent opening to world trade put its rich biodiversity and TK under severe threat. One of the local natural biodiversity products is Thanakha, which is traditionally used for skincare. This study investigates the current and planned regulations and practices managing Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) in Myanmar, focusing on one of the potential BioTrade products: Thanakha. A qualitative and quantitative survey was conducted through in-depth interviews with 37 key informants and 35 Thanakha farmers. The results show that while the current research and development activities at the Thanakha manufacturing level could trigger ABS obligations, the low awareness about ABS requirements and the lack of traceability raise uncertainties for its potential implementation. The implementation of BioTrade principles and ethical sourcing to promote the sustainable trade of Thanakha, as well as the implementation of ABS, would lead to the protection of biodiversity and TK, and the improvement of local livelihoods.

However, in scenarios of less concern about crisis the leading paradigm is often that of efficiency. The current study shows how efficiency might have got on the way of achieving the necessary resilience to face the COVID 19. With the example of the German brown shrimp fishery in the North Sea the interaction between those two paradigms - efficiency and resilience - is shown in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic. For instance, the quest of efficiency for rationalisation may reduce the resources available to set aside buffers to resist shocks, and the standardisation key to efficiency may also hinder more diversity and hence open innovation for solutions to the crisis, all characteristics of resilient organisations. By making use of a literature review including peer reviewed, grey literature and web media as well as of interviews with experts and quantitative data the value chain of the German brown shrimp fishery is analysed under the conceptual framework of organisational resilience. Results: show that, despite being more oriented towards efficiency, the German fleets does not show particularly good results in selected efficiency indicators. Additionally, key stages of the value chain as processing and commercialisation together with the investment strategy fail to present some commonly accepted components of resilient organisations, such as redundancy, flexibility, adaptability, diversity, prudence and embeddedness. Despite developments in the direction of sustainability with the MSC certification, the German fleet should pay attention to its capacity to face disturbances, which should be supported by a more long-term, targeted, resilience-oriented policy support.

Many active compounds with biomedical and nutraceutical applications can be extracted by Fish Waste (FW), but few are the operating industrial plants. Quantification and mapping of the potential FW availability along the entire fish value-chain is crucial in fostering its actual valorisation. Apart at industrial processing, in the distribution segment the estimation of FW availability is absent. This paper aimed to quantify and locate FW generated by point sources such as supermarkets, fishmongers and restaurants as well as to establish the diffuse domestic FW production in a 4,5M inhabitants region. The study provides an exportable method and indications for comparable worldwide areas. A simplified valorisation scenario for equivalent biomethane production is also presented. Direct interviews and indirect approach based on fish consumption have been adopted and compared. Large supermarkets and medium-large restaurants are the main FW producers (239 and 125 kg/week, respectively) followed medium-large fishmongers and medium supermarkets (63 and 86 kg/week, respectively). In the investigated region the larger FW point sources are supermarkets (average 3000 Mg/y), while fishmongers are the smaller (average 750 Mg/y). Restaurants (average 1400 Mg/y) show the wider range of variability between 460 and 8000 Mg/y. The indirect methodology reveals that domestic FW production ranges from 2376 to 3961 Mg/y. Per capita estimations of FW ranged from 0.5 - 3 kg/y. The economic value of FW (biomethanation route) is 68 EUR/Mg. A qualification as "highly potential waste" would promote FW valorization.

Transition Pathways for the Farmed Salmon Value Chain: Industry Perspectives and Sustainability Implications	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						transition theory; multi-level perspective; governance; global value chain framework; salmon aquaculture; sustainable food systems	HYBRID GOVERNANCE; ECO-CERTIFICATION; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; SEA LICE; AQUACULTURE; FISH; INSIGHTS; IMPACTS; GROWTH; RECONFIGURATION	Salmon is the most consumed farmed seafood in the EU and there is no indication that demand will abate. Yet salmon aquaculture's environmental impacts are significant, and its future is likely to be shaped by demands of increased but at the same time more sustainable production. This study developed an integrated theoretical framework based on the multi-level perspective (MLP) and a global value chain (GVC) governance framework and applied it to the global farmed salmon value chain. The objective was to provide insights on the most likely transition pathway towards sustainability based on industry and expert perspectives. The perceptions on challenges and drivers of change, were gathered through focus groups and in-depth interviews, and fitted to the integrated framework to facilitate the transition pathway analysis. Viewing the qualitative findings in the context of the MLP framework provided information about the current workings of the system, the drivers of change in the socio-technical landscape and niche-innovations and their potential to challenge or enhance the current system and thus indicated possible system transitions. To emphasize the role of industry actors in shaping the future of the salmon value chain, the analysis was strengthened using the GVC model which added information about power relations, signaling the ability of system actors to motivate or resist change. The findings indicate that, due to resistance in the regime and the fact that niche-innovations are not yet sufficiently developed, the farmed salmon value chain will continue to be predominated by traditional sea-based aquaculture but that there will be a gradual shift towards more diversity in terms of production methods in response to landscape pressures. The discussion addresses sustainability challenges and policy implications for the farmed salmon value chain and highlights the need for a food system perspective.

In this study, Papaveraceae extracts (PE), as alkaloids (quaternary benzophenanthridine and protopine) source were incorporated into the diet of striped catfish, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, to assess their effects on growth, feed utilisation and digestibility, body composition, product quality and pathogen response. PE was supplemented at 0.7 g/kg (HLPE) and 0.35 g/kg (LLPE) in 30%-35% proteinous diet for 126 days, to determine the effects relative to control group (CC). Growth performance of P. hypophthalmus, measured by weight gain, was improved by 35 % and 25 % in LLPE and HLPE, respectively, compared to CC. The highest protein digestibility, thermal growth coefficient and feed conversion ratio was found in LLPE group. There were no significant differences to proximate composition and colouration of P. hypophthalmus fillets fed PE. After challenging with Aeromonas hydrophila, serum biochemical indices decreased significantly in HLPE treated group. To avoid deleterious effects on P. hypophthalmus fillets and nutritional quality, 0.35 g/kg PE can recommend as safe and economically viable dose for commercial pangasius farming, although curative action against A. hydrophila may require higher dose.

J	Hidayati, DR; Garnevska, E; Childerhouse, P				Hidayati, Dwi Ratna; Garnevska, Elena; Childerhouse, Paul			Sustainable Agrifood Value Chain-Transformation in Developing Countries	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						value chain transformation; sustainability; smallholders; agrifood; developing countries	AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS; FOOD VALUE CHAIN; GOVERNANCE; PERFORMANCE; DIMENSIONS; SYSTEM	To service high-value international markets, many agrifood value chains in developing countries are required to transform to meet the strict quality and safety standards. This transformation process has become further complicated by increased sustainability expectations. The key players in these countries, typically smallholders, are struggling to meet this new sustainability value focus. Economic drivers pervade in this context, whilst the lack of integration often decouples producers from the end market. To address these challenges, this paper develops a framework to enable sustainable agrifood value chain transformation in developing countries. A narrative review was used to analyse the major enablers and barriers in sustainable agrifood value chain transformation specifically in developing countries. The framework novelty lies in the synthesis and prioritisation of transformations actions, by integrating three central dimensions: sustainability, governance, and value addition. The incorporation of sustainability drivers into value chain governance provides a holistic approach that balances profit maximization with social and environmental impacts, thus enabling smallholders in developing countries to access higher value markets. The framework can assist these value chain actors in identifying their transformation trajectory and guide policymakers, along with the public sector, in prioritising their intervention to overcome barriers.

The characteristic approach of a CE assumes the minimisation of the amount of waste generated at the design level and, as a standard, includes innovations throughout the value chain. From an agricultural point of view, agricultural biogas plants are particularly important because they enable the management of all waste biomass and its conversion into useful energy and agricultural fertiliser. This paper presents methods for assessing the economic effectiveness of an investment in an agricultural biogas plant. The research goal was to develop a financial model. The authors of this study used available examples of the profitability of commercial ventures. We considered the investment aspects of agricultural biogas plants. Exemplary solutions are discussed, allowing the reader to become acquainted with various methods and proposals for thus far estimated investments. It may seem chaotic, but this is how the biogas market is characterised in the context of the implementation of biogas projects. Guidance is given regarding how to understand investing in this sensitive private farming sector. It is admirable that the renewable energy market has been systematised, and we hypothesise that it is necessary to develop an investment model in Polish conditions.

Vulnerability drivers for small pelagics and milkfish aquaculture value chain determined through online participatory approach	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Adaptation; Aquaculture; Climate change impacts; Fisheries management area (FMA); Milkfish; Small-pelagic; Value chain; Vulnerability assessment	SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES; GENERAL SANTOS CITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FISHING COMMUNITIES; TROPICAL CYCLONES; ECONOMIC-FACTORS; PHILIPPINES; ADAPTATION; IMPACTS; TUNA	Climate change impacts on the fisheries can be short-term or long-term, making them highly vulnerable. Fishers' vulnerability encompasses several factors and includes, among others, their sensitivity, exposure to the elements, and their adaptive capacity. The main aim of this study was to help develop a vulnerability assessment tool that can be applied in the various nodes of the fisheries and aquaculture value chains with a long-term view of enhancing the resilience of the fisheries and helping increase the adaptive capacity of the fishing communities. A participatory technique using online workshops was conducted together with various stakeholders (N = 214) who gave insights and suggested indicators that drive climate change impacts and vulnerability. Based on the online workshops conducted, the common hazards/drivers were increasing temperature, typhoons, flooding (sealevel rise), and the recent pandemic, which consequently destroy coral reef ecosystems, affect fisheries yield, increases fish mortality, damage boats, fishing gears, pens, cages, pond dikes, erode beach properties, and devastate houses. In association with these impacts, mobility, travel, processing, and logistic operations are severely reduced. In the human dimension, the fishers and fish farmers are directly affected in terms of income loss, destroyed fishing gears, nutritional deficiencies and health impacts, less fishing operations, early or reduced harvest yield, and low market value of products. In the adaptation options, the infrastructure, social, economic, awareness/knowledge, and relevant governance/policy dimensions are needed to address and help mitigate various climate change impacts.

J	Mellick, Z; Payne, A; Buys, L				Mellick, Zoe; Payne, Alice; Buys, Laurie			From Fibre to Fashion: Understanding the Value of Sustainability in Global Cotton Textile and Apparel Value Chains	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable value; sustainability; sustainable fashion; textile and apparel industry; value chain; cotton	SUPPLY CHAIN; INDUSTRY; LESSONS; SECTOR	Current sustainability frameworks and tools to assess and track social and environmental impacts of textile and apparel (such as life cycle analysis) along the chain, although important, provide a narrow focus on metrics (such as a reduction in inputs) or on economic value. This paper proposes a tailored method which combines value chain thinking with qualitative value mapping techniques to identify what sustainable value means and to whom, who benefits both in and beyond the chain (such as wider society, the environment, local communities), as well as opportunities to create sustainable value in the future. Results from interviews with stakeholders of a single connected cotton value chain demonstrate that this approach can identify sustainable value propositions specific to different actors in the chain, temperature-test whether stakeholders are willing to pay a premium price for sustainability efforts, and identify novel sustainable value opportunities that disrupt the chain. In addition to extending knowledge around sustainability in the textile and apparel industry, our contribution also lies in the development of a tailored tool which can be adapted and used for other value chains.

Their accessibility through trade plays a key role in health, economic and livelihood improvement. However, the traceability of the production process from their source in Tanzania is lacking. This study aims to depicture the production process of formulated products of medicinal plants. Design/methodology/approach The study applied the value chain theory using qualitative data from literature review and survey to practitioners of traditional medicine. Survey data were collected through 15 in-depth interviews and ten focus group discussions in five regions of Tanzania. Findings Input to output structure is performed through a five actors' value chain. The raw material is provided by harvesters who collected medicinal plants from wild. The processing is conducted by wholesalers and formulators. The wholesalers add value by drying, milling and bulk packaging of individual medicinal plants. Formulators mix different medicinal plants to create readymade products for specified diseases. Distribution is done by retailers and healers. There were six regulating and two supporting organizations. Private supporters were millers and transporters. Governance structure was deduced to be relational. Relational governance was a result of lack official standards along the value chain. Originality/value The described value chain can be used to guide investments in production of products of medicinal plants by improving formulation technology.

J	Olayungbo, DO; Iqbal, BA				Olayungbo, David Oluseun; Iqbal, Badar Alam			An empirical analysis of African trade blocs effects on the global economy: new evidence from the gravity model	FUTURE BUSINESS JOURNAL			English	Article						African trade blocs; COMESA; EAC; ECCAS; SACU; SADC; ECOWAS; Tariff; Gravity model	TIME-SERIES; CREATION; DIVERSION; COMESA	This study employs the gravity model to estimate the extent of the contribution of six African trade blocs to the global economy using the gravity model spanning from 1980 to 2018. The gravity equation that models the export contributions of the six selected African RECs to the global export is estimated. The estimated gravity model reveals that the long run estimations show that the coefficient estimate for SACU and ECCAS are insignificant in the long run while SACU, EAC and ECCAS as RECs, have insignificant contribution to export in the short run. Our findings, after establishing cointegration, on the other hand show that COMESA has the highest contribution to the global exports, followed by EAC, ECOWAS and SADC with ECCAS and SACU the lowest contributors. The highest contribution of COMESA followed by EAC may be due to the growing economy of member countries like Kenya and Rwanda, while that of COMESA and SADC may be as a result of the large economy of Nigeria and South Africa respectively. This study concludes that African countries are emerging with great export potentials, therefore, governments and private sectors should create the necessary incentives and export policies for the realization of these potentials to maximise the global value chain.

J	Serrato, D; Zapata-Mina, J; Restrepo, A; Torres, J				Serrato, David; Zapata-Mina, Juan; Restrepo, Alvaro; Torres, Jorge			Assessment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasified through gas interchangeability in energy consumption sectors	ENERGY REPORTS			English	Article						Liquefaction of natural gas; Regasification of liquified natural gas; Gas interchangeability; Liquified natural gas value chain	OPTIMIZATION; MARKET; FUELS; CYCLE; POWER; HEAT; PERFORMANCE; SECURITY; RECOVERY; SYSTEMS	Cusiana and Cupiagua fields represent 51% of Colombia natural gas production. However, some studies predict that in 2023, the reserves of the fields will decrease significantly causing an imbalance between supply and demand of natural gas within the country. Therefore, in order to face the situation, innovative strategies must be developed and implemented to provide energy security for the coming years. One of the strategies that has been applied in different countries is the incorporation and implementation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) technologies. However, it is necessary to evaluate the supply and demand of the country to determine the scale of LNG production and regasification technology, as well as the technical feasibility of its incorporation into the country's energy matrix, taking into account the main sectors of final consumption. Therefore, in this work an analysis of the supply and demand of natural gas in the country from different sectors of energy consumption is made. In addition, an analysis was made on the natural gas currently marketed in Colombia by means of a gas interchangeability methodology. A set of novel equations was presented to determine the mole fraction of propane and methane in the equivalent mixture considered by Dutton's method, as well as the number of moles associated with the hydrocarbon equivalent in methane and propane, parameters required to establish the mole fraction of nitrogen and inert chemical species such as carbon dioxide in the equivalent mixture and the percentage of propane and nitrogen equivalent. It was determined that the LNG regasified at the SPEC-LNG plant is an interchangeable gas from a conventional point of view mainly with the gas produced at Cusiana.

Owing to the expansion of economic globalization and the resultant global trade liberalization, the geographical isolation of production and consumption has resulted in the transfer of polluting emissions from advanced economies to developing states. Developing economies, falling in the middle and low end of the GVC, have to strive hard to expand their production in the GVC, while simultaneously addressing the consequent environmental damage and attending to the core environmental concerns of sustainable growth, energy preservation and drastic cuts in CO2. This paper addresses how manufacturing subsidiaries can improve their low-carbon innovation ability and help to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through the embedded GVC. Data were gathered employing interview and survey methods, 31 manufacturing companies and 56 enterprise groups across 16 Chinese provinces were selected as the case study. A partial least square structural equation modelling was adopted to analyse the responses. The results indicate that the embedded GVC significantly enhances low-carbon innovation capability and promotes a sustainable competitive advantage. This study proposes that companies should continuously identify high-quality resources from the GVC and discover ways of integrating internal and external carbon innovation resources to form innovation capabilities.

J	Sun, JZ; Lee, HJ; Yang, J				Sun, Jiaze; Lee, Huijuan; Yang, Jun			The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Global Value Chain of the Manufacturing Industry	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						global value chain; manufacturing; COVID-19; global trade analysis project		This paper adopts the GDYN model to estimate the dynamic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global manufacturing industry and the value chain. Our simulation finds that (1) In the short run, the low-tech manufacturing industries will suffer greater shocks, with a decline of output growth in 2021 by 6.0%. The growth rate of the high-tech manufacturing industry showed an increasing trend of 3.7% in 2021. (2) In the post-epidemic period, the total manufacturing output will return to the baseline level, from which the growth rate of low-tech manufacturing will rebound, demonstrating a V-shaped development trajectory. (3) From the perspective of Global Value Chain (GVC), the participation in GVCs of manufacturers in countries along the Belt and Road, the European Union and the United States will weaken, while China's manufacturing industry has witnessed an obvious improvement in export competitiveness. The import added value of China has decreased, which shows that its ability to meet domestic demand has been improving. This indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic is providing a crucial opportunity for China to upgrade its manufacturing value chain, which contributes to the accelerated construction of a new dual-cycle development pattern.

This has incentivized smallholders to convert arable lands to Eucalyptus plantation. Given the limited attention and availability of empirical evidence, this study examined the Eucalyptus wood products value chain in terms of the actors engaged, the type and importance of channels, margins analysis and the overall value chain governance in the main Eucalyptus growing areas of the Blue Nile highlands of Northwestern Ethiopia in 2019/2020. Sources of data were randomly selected 388 Eucalyptus grower households and 166 Eucalyptus wood traders, complemented by an interview with key informants, group discussions and direct observations. The results reveal that a total of 2,051,114.75 m(3) of Eucalyptus wood was produced in the study area and Eucalyptus plantations are expanding over crop lands at a rate of 102.35 ha a year on average. Many actors involved handle a large volume of wood in eight main channels with a high disparity in the shares of the margins. We found that Eucalyptus is the main source of cash earning, contributing about 45.76% to the total annual income of smallholder growers. Little policy attention, a lack of sectoral integration, missing infrastructure and an absence of modern wood processing factories are among the key challenges impeding the performance of the wood sector value chain. There are however existing opportunities for the development of the wood sector value chain such as favorable growing conditions and the spectacular growing demand for wood products. The study provides valuable insights about the wood sector value chain and actions towards ensuring sustainable value chains and the commercialization of the sector.

J	Traivivatana, S; Wangjiraniran, W; Piyavee, S				Traivivatana, Suthee; Wangjiraniran, Weerin; Piyavee, Sudatip			Standardized the natural gas data for Thailand's sustainable goal	ENERGY REPORTS			English	Article						Natural gas; Energy balance; Thailand; Supply chain; TIEB		The Thailand Integrated Energy Blueprint (TIEB), launched in 2014, has been updated to TIEB 2018 and approved by the Thailand's cabinet in October 2020. The Thailand's Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) in 2019 was 140,027 ktoe. One-third of the TPES is natural gas, which is expected to increase around 2% annually. The proportion of natural gas used for power generation will reach 53% and the total consumption will meet 5,348 MMSCFD in 2037. For the aforementioned reasons, it is the best to focus on the whole supply chain of the natural gas. The key factor to sustain the energy sector in Thailand according to the TIEB is the energy data standard which shows the value chain of all energy sources in the form of energy balance. Nonetheless, there are the complications of the classification, definitions, and processes. Therefore, international standards and manual shall be applied to ease these complications. Two new terms, Feed Gas and Sale Gas, are created and used to clarify the uniqueness of the Thailand's natural gas flow. This flow is one of the most complete versions illustrating the whole supply chain of natural gas in Thailand from the domestic supply to the total demand and to the final consumption.

J	Traversa, E; Timmermans, B				Traversa, Edoardo; Timmermans, Benoit			Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Sustainability in the European Union: A Radical Proposal Design Issues, Legal Aspects, and Policy Alternatives	INTERTAX			English	Article						VAT; EU harmonization; environmental taxation; sustainability; life-cycle assessment		This article aims to examine how the implementation of environmental taxes could build on the success of value-added tax (VAT) to become more efficient and consistent. This is not to increase the overall tax burden on citizens but to reorganize existing indirect taxation differently by better taking into account European Union (EU) environmental objectives, in particular regarding the circular economy. With its broad tax base, its systemic structure based on neutrality (which does not exclude differentiation), its wide acceptance among taxpayers, and its proven compliance process, the VAT has some features that could inspire environmental policymakers. It indeed impacts consumer choices at the broadest possible level while avoiding distortions. The authors begin by identifying the reasons for the success and robustness of VAT. A new concept of 'green VAT' will then be proposed based not on the classical instrument of reduced rates for specific transactions as is already done and advocated by EU institutions (European Commission, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, A new Circular Economy Action Plan. For a cleaner and more competitive Europe, COM(2020) 98 final (11 Mar. 2020). See also Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions - New Circular Economy Action Plan (2020/C 440/18), OJ C 440/107 (18 Dec. 2020), para. 23.) but on a coherent life cycle approach to all goods and services. This new approach identifies negative externalities by following the same value chain as the VAT. It aligns as much as possible with the administration and compliance methods already implemented by the VAT. Finally, a possible virtual use of the new green VAT concept will be presented. It does not require any legislative changes. It takes the form of a 'virtual tax' that appears on the price tag of every product without being effectively paid and may be used as an indicator for the actual environmental cost of production.

Value Chain Structure Analysis as A Starting Point for Bamboo Enterprise Development: Lessons from Gunungkidul, Indonesia	FOREST AND SOCIETY			English	Article						bamboo; value chain; structure; policy; Gunungkidul	TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS; INCOME GENERATION; RURAL-DEVELOPMENT; LIVELIHOODS; NTFPS; MANAGEMENT; CERTIFICATION; VALUATION; COUNTRIES	The economic contributions of rural enterprises in Indonesia are significant to support local people's livelihoods, although it remains at micro to medium levels. One small-scale enterprise, which remains understudied and receives little policy attention, is the bamboo enterprise. Gunungkidul Regency in Yogyakarta Special Province, a central region in Java Island, Indonesia, have many bamboo enterprises, creating various products that support some 6,500 jobs. This research is conducted as a case study of the Gunungkidul Regency. A value chain perspective was used to study three bamboo-based enterprises' value chain structure: kitchen utensils, bamboo toy handicraft, and chemically treated bamboo. The snowball concept was used until the data was saturated. In total, 86 respondents were interviewed. The traditional chain was dominant. The longest value chain and the highest number of actor levels were bamboo toy handicrafts, and the shortest and smallest actor level was the chemically treated bamboo. Most channels were in the toy handicraft chain in the production flow, then kitchen utensils, and chemically treated bamboo. The credit payment method is prevalent in financial flow, and trust has been widely established between actors. The information flow related to price was imbalanced. In each chain, collaboration in the raw material segment was weak. The lack of willingness of artisans to be more productive and the weak cooperation among artisans, coupled with the lack of support from the government seems to be obstacles to the development of bamboo as a small to medium enterprise in Gunungkidul.

J	Elijah, TV; Makungo, R; Ekosse, GI				Volenzo Elijah, Tom; Makungo, Rachel; Ekosse, Georges-Ivo			Effective Mainstreaming of Agricultural Emissions into Climate Action Agenda: The Case of Institutions and Smallholder Dairy Production Systems, Western Kenya	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						agricultural emissions; adaptation-mitigation dualism; carbon transitions; climate smart agriculture; effectiveness; greenhouse gases; institutions; small-scale farmers; shifting vulnerabilities	CHANGE ADAPTATION; ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; SMART AGRICULTURE; CHANGE MITIGATION; VALUE CHAIN; SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; RISK; INTENSIFICATION; DYNAMICS	Small-scale farming production systems are integral drivers of global sustainability challenges and the climate crisis as well as a solution space for the transition to climate compatible development. However, mainstreaming agricultural emissions into a climate action agenda through integrative approaches, such as Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), largely reinforces adaptation-mitigation dualism and pays inadequate attention to institutions' linkage on the generation of externalities, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This may undermine the effectiveness of local-global climate risk management initiatives. Literature data and a survey of small-scale farmers' dairy feeding strategies were used in the simulation of GHG emissions. The effect of price risks on ecoefficiencies or the amount of GHG emissions per unit of produced milk is framed as a proxy for institutional feedbacks on GHG emissions and effect at scale. This case study on small-scale dairy farmers in western Kenya illustrates the effect of local-level and sectoral-level institutional constraints, such as market risks on decision making, on GHG emissions and the effectiveness of climate action. The findings suggest that price risks are significant in incentivising the adoption of CSA technologies. Since institutional interactions influence the choice of individual farmer management actions in adaptation planning, they significantly contribute to GHG spillover at scale. This can be visualised in terms of the nexus between low or non-existent dairy feeding strategies, low herd productivity, and net higher methane emissions per unit of produced milk in a dairy value chain. The use of the Sustainable Food Value Chain (SFVC) analytical lens could mediate the identification of binding constraints, foster organisational and policy coherence, as well as broker the effective mainstreaming of agricultural emissions into local-global climate change risk management initiatives. Market risks thus provide a systematic and holistic lens for assessing alternative carbon transitions, climate financing, adaptation-mitigation dualism, and the related risk of maladaptation, all of which are integral in the planning and implementation of effective climate action initiatives.

J	Wang, WX; Thangavelu, S				Wang, Wenxiao; Thangavelu, Shandre			Trade and Human Capital in Global Value Chain in Developed and Developing Countries*	ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS			English	Article							WORLD	This paper investigates the effects of human capital on bilateral domestic value-added trade in global value chains (GVCs) for 43 countries and 56 sectors. In contrast to previous studies, this paper estimated an approximate gravity model of value-added trade to capture the role of human capital in determining the cross-border production linkages via value-added trade. The results show that the domestic value-added trade flows depend critically on human capital development in both exporting and importing countries. The results indicate a positive effect of skilled intensity on bilateral domestic value-added trade in GVCs. We also observe a larger positive effect of skills on the GVC value-added trade for the developing economies. The paper highlights the importance of trade liberalization and forward-looking human capital development policies for the competitiveness of the developing countries in the value-added trade in GVC.

J	Warren, G; Dilmperi, A; Dinnie, K				Warren, Giannina; Dilmperi, Athina; Dinnie, Keith			Power struggles and playing politics: An application of Bourdieu's cultural intermediation theory to place marketing	ANNALS OF TOURISM RESEARCH			English	Article						Place branding; Place promotion; Governance; Legitimacy; Stakeholders	CITY; TOURISM; LEGITIMACY; IDENTITY; STRATEGY; BRANDS; GAP	Place branding strategies contribute to policy decisions that shape a city. Little research, however, investigates how place marketers influence the decision-making of those higher up in the value chain. Drawing upon Bourdieu's theory of cultural intermediation, we identify where these professionals exhibit influence in a city branding endeavour and what impact they have on policy decisions. We report results of semi-structured interviews with senior place marketers at 13 cities around the world and find that policy decisions are influenced in unofficial, hidden and non-systemic ways, including identifying and working with key stakeholders behind the scenes, playing politics, and applying a promotional lens to policy endeavours. We discuss these findings and their implications on theory and practice. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Xu, XH; Arshad, MA; Ali, U; Mahmood, A				Xu, Xianhang; Arshad, Mohd Anuar; Ali, Ubaid; Mahmood, Arshad			The GM-BP Neural Network Prediction Model for International Competitiveness of Computer Information Service Industry	ALGORITHMS			English	Article						computer information service industry; international competitiveness; BP neural network; grey relational degree; high-quality development		The computer information service industry is closely related to the fourth industrial revolution and stands at the core of the global value chain. It has become an essential engine for developing industries in various countries, and its scale is constantly expanding. In the critical period of global economic transformation and development, the use of mathematical models to predict its international competitiveness will help scientifically evaluate the development level of the industry and accelerate the adaptation to the needs of the fourth industrial revolution. In this article, a prediction model is proposed for the international competitiveness of the computer information service industry. First, we used the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index to measure the international competitiveness of the computer information service industry. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of the industry and high-quality development theory, we constructed the evaluation indicator system of influencing factors and used the grey relational analysis method to screen key indicators. Then, we combined the Grey model and BP neural network algorithm to construct the GM-BP prediction model. Finally, China is used as an example to predict the international competitiveness of its computer information service industry, and suggestions are made for industrial development. The results show that the grey relational analysis method can genuinely reflect the impact of different aspects on the international competitiveness of China's computer information service industry and better determine the key indicators of influencing factors. The GM-BP model has minor errors and excellent simulation results and can accurately predict the future status of international competitiveness. The applicability and reliability of the model are reasonable.

J	Jain, M				Jain, Monika			Was India Right in Not Joining RCEP? A Cost-Benefit Analysis	INDIA QUARTERLY-A JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article						RCEP; FTA's; trade deficit; China; trade agreements; ASEAN; trade liberalisation; protectionism		India dropped out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which included the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, China, South Korea, New Zealand, Japan and Australia, after negotiating for almost seven years in November 2018 on the grounds of national interest and also that free trade agreements (FTAs) did not amount to free trade and led to more trade diversion than trade creation. The cost and benefit of a regional agreement depend on the amount of trade creation with respect to trade diversion (Panagriya, 2000). This study tries to examine India's concerns and at the same time, highlights the cost of not joining RCEP. India's trade deficit with 11 out of the 15 RCEP nations has been a major cause of concern. Unfavourable trade balance, concerns about the impact on dairy sector, economic slowdown, past experience with FTA's, China factor, data localisation, rules of origin, the experience of ASEAN countries with Sino-FTA have been some of the reasons behind India's decision to opt-out of this mega multilateral agreement. Also, bilateral trade agreements with some RCEP countries such as Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and South Korea were operational. A multilateral trade agreement with ASEAN countries was very much in place. So, trade between India and 12 of the RCEP member countries would not have changed much after India's inclusion in RCEP. The impact of lower tariffs would have been evident for the remaining three countries: China, Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, there was fear of a massive surge in imports of manufactures from China, dairy imports from Australia and New Zealand. This study also examines the long term impact of this decision and if India has missed out on becoming a part of the global value chain and gaining greater market access in the Asia Pacific region. India's policy of import substitution and protectionism did not capitulate desired results in the past. Hence, a critical evaluation of India's decision and some validation on her concerns and fears have been done.

J	Gopura, S; Payne, A; Bandara, D; Buys, L				Gopura, Sumith; Payne, Alice; Bandara, Deepthi; Buys, Laurie			Sri Lankan Fashion Designers: Self-Directed Learning in the Apparel Industry	CLOTHING AND TEXTILES RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						apparel industry; apparel design; design process		The Sri Lankan apparel industry is currently in transition from apparel assembly to manufacturing original designs as a value addition. Design teams work closely with Western brands, buyers and designers to offer advanced creative and technical design services. The purpose of this article is to investigate how Sri Lankan designers acquire personal, high-value fashion knowledge and design skills in this crucial time of industry transition. The study adopts a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews conducted with 28 fashion design and product development professionals in the industry. Based on an inductive thematic analysis, the study finds that Sri Lankan designers' acquisition of high-value fashion knowledge and skills comes primarily through their self-directed learning. This study proposes the Designers' Self-Directed Learning Cycle to illustrate how designers' learning happens and is applied in their professional practice. The findings are significant in understanding the designers' practice in the export-oriented apparel value chain.

Therefore, governments are implementing regional policies that support a circular economy (CE). But how do we know whether these developments will lead to a shift toward a CE on a regional scale? How can we identify hotspots in a value chain and regional economy to support decision-makers and to develop regional policies? We propose an integrated assessment method that considers indicators for environmental impacts and economic benefits by combining Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with Input-Output Analysis (IOA) as the connecting element. It provides the necessary data and indicators for a holistic and comprehensive evaluation of a region or industry. We demonstrate its benefits and limitations taking the Swiss canton of Aargovia as an example. We analyze which processes in the material flow system of construction minerals are decisive for formulating mass-related or financial policies encouraging a CE. We show that a shift toward a CE can only be captured by combining material and money flows in a joined model, because a significant increase of services-mainly waste management-is a core element in this development. It can only be covered sufficiently by combining environmental and economic assessment. Our model captures the degree to which a regional economy is advanced in the transition toward a CE to compare different regions or analyze scenarios of future developments.

Digital technology aims to improve linkages along the agriculture value chain, thereby enabling farming communities and systems to recover from stresses and to absorb shocks to which farmers are exposed. However, there is the concern that digital technologies have not benefited the agricultural sector in a sustainable way. Stakeholders along the agriculture value chain need significant amounts of information to which they do not have access. In Mali, smartphones and earth observation data are used to support the development of land tenure information services and to improve agriculture statistics. To multiply business opportunities, the scope of the use of these technologies is being expanded to include agronomic advisory next-gen, franchised farm extension services. This article aims to evaluate these initiatives to further understand the way digitization could contribute to sustainable agricultural development and food security. In addition, it aims to determine how effective these technologies are under different conditions and how they can contribute to better sustainable development outcomes. Most evaluation studies of agriculture technology place emphasis on the economic aspects of productivity, profitability, and technical efficiency of the technology and the implications for users' livelihoods. This study considers technology as a socio-technical phenomenon to understand the underlying processes that may enable or constrain the takeoff and the sustainability of technology. Furthermore, understanding these processes provides valuable theoretical and methodological insights to stakeholders for necessary adjustments of technology to given biophysical, socioeconomic, cultural, and cognitive conditions.

Women's work in small-scale fisheries: a framework for accounting its value	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article; Early Access						Fish processors; fish traders; gender; India; Mexico; small-scale fisheries; value chains		Women play an important role in small-scale fisheries around the world. Their work along the entire fish value chain contributes to the productivity of the sector and enhances household income. But this work remains unrecognized and undervalued, and women continue to be excluded from decision-making in fisheries management and policy development. This study aims to construct a theoretical framework for analyzing how women's fish processing and trade activities create value and enhance competitive advantage along the fish value chain. It asks how the value of fish is generated by women's labor in processing and trade and how we might construct a theory of value that better accounts women's contributions to fish economies. The framework combines the Resource-Knowledge-Based-View, which considers situated knowledge as a source for capability creation, and Feminist Commodity Chain Analysis, which describes and assesses how the activities performed by women create value within and across value chain nodes. Applying this framework to three fish economies in Mexico and India, findings emphasize that a) valuable assets emerge from women's work in small-scale fisheries; and b) to make gender visible, it is necessary to identify how and where value and profit are created by women in each node of the fish value chain. Recognizing the value of women's work is a key element to empower them and to make visible an invisible workforce.

An Assessment of the Economic Impacts of the 2019 African Swine Fever Outbreaks in Vietnam	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						African swine fever; economic impact; multi-market model; social accounting matrix; value chain; Vietnam	MOUTH-DISEASE; STRATEGIES	The 2019 African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks in Vietnam imposed considerable impacts on the pig sector in Vietnam, resulting in the death or culling of nearly six million pigs, or more than 20% of the country's pig population. In order to assess the magnitude of the outbreak at sector level (both on farm and at value chain level), on livelihoods, and on the broader national economy, a comprehensive impact assessment was conducted using a mixed methods approach that integrated a value chain assessment with the use of quantitative modeling tools at sector and national levels. The results showed that the outbreak caused severe direct and indirect economic losses among farmers, particularly medium- and large-farmers whose livelihoods are largely derived from pig production. The outbreaks also affected other value chain actors due to a halving in the volume of pigs traded. At sector level, the outbreaks posed adverse impacts on the domestic supply and demand for pork, especially in the traditional sector. Meanwhile, the modern sector with higher levels of biosecurity and high technology growth was less likely to be affected and even benefited from the outbreak, which was evidenced by increased supply and income throughout the simulation period in this sector. At national level, different model simulation scenarios showed a sharp reduction in total gross domestic product (GDP) and a substantial loss of jobs. Improvements in the system of ASF compensation scheme are needed, both in terms of its administration, but also in its targeting, with greater emphasis needed on developing improved risk-sharing and funding mechanisms across national and local levels.</p>	[Thinh Nguyen-Thi; Sinh Dang-Xuan; Lee, Hu Suk] Reg Off East & Southeast Asia, Int Livestock Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Linh Pham-Thi-Ngoc; Que Nguyen-Ngoc; Thuy Nguyen-Thi; Thang Tran-Cong] Inst Policy & Strategy Agr & Rural Dev, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hung Nguyen-Viet] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Padungtod, Pawin] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Thuy Nguyen-Thu] Minist Agr & Rural Dev, Dept Anim Hlth, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Rich, Karl M.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Dakar, Senegal		Nguyen-Thi, T (corresponding author), Reg Off East & Southeast Asia, Int Livestock Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam.	t.t.nguyen@cgiar.org		Rich, Karl/0000-0002-5581-9553; Dang-Xuan, Sinh/0000-0002-0522-7808	Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [LOA-FAVIE.2019.12-TCP/VIE/3604]; Australian Center for International Agricultural Research [C001752]	This research was funded by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO-Contract number: LOA-FAVIE.2019.12-TCP/VIE/3604) and the Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR-Contract number: C001752).

The trend is driven by the recognition that wood, as an environment friendly material, can contribute bioeconomy development and the achievement of sustainable development goals. In Lithuania, multi-storey wood-based building is still at the level of policy and political discussions. Therefore, the presented research focuses on quantification and comparison of the sustainability impacts of both wood- and concrete-based building materials value chains and provides applied scientific knowledge relevant to decision makers and in this way contributes to mitigation of the climate change. In detail, study covers the production value chain - from raw material extraction to manufacturing using the same method, while documenting and assessing the material sourcing stages transparently and consistently. In our study glue laminated timber and sawn timber building materials represented renewable material value chains, while site-cast concrete and precast reinforced concrete building materials represented non-renewable materials value chains. In discussion with study partners in the BenchValue project and during a project stakeholder workshop, twelve environmental, social and economic indicators were selected to perform the sustainability impact assessment of selected building materials. Building materials were compared by using a decision support tool ToSIA. The relevant data was gathered from local, well-known companies in the national and international arena. Our results revealed that glue laminated timber and sawn timber value chains compared to site-cast concrete and precast reinforced concrete value chains have more positive sustainability impacts. This is especially true when analysing environmental indicators: GHG emissions, Energy use, Generation of wastes and Water use. Analyses also revealed more positive socio-economic impacts of wood-based building materials. The socio-economic advantage of wood could increase competitiveness of the regions and contributes to their sustainable development. Our paper is in line with the applied research. Since it is a case study, the presented results are country specific, because the estimation of indicators was done by applying local data. The presented research is relevant to policy experts and decision makers in the context of the reduction of CO2 emissions. Also, this paper is relevant to the companies and architects who want to build and compare various building materials. Partially, results of this paper could be applied in other countries with comparable to Lithuania economic development level, having in mind the possible shortcomings already highlighted.

Some types of backsheets are known to develop cracks because of an aging-induced change in the mechanical characteristics of the material during operation in the field, which result in a loss of insulation resistance. In this work, we present a solution for repair and preventive maintenance based on a single component flowable silicone sealant. The method fills the cracks present in the backsheet with an insulating material, restoring insulation resistance, and provides a protective layer to avoid subsequent degradation. The solution was successfully implemented on the back of PV modules with co-extruded polyamide backsheet ('AAA'), which showed deep cracks following degradation 5-7 years of operation in a solar park. The repaired modules had a restored insulation resistance of several hundred M omega as observed with wet leakage testing and maintained a high resistance after accelerating aging. This repair technology can be done in the field and is an alternative solution to module replacement.

J	Hu, SL; Wang, XH				Hu, Shilei; Wang, Xiaohong			IT Usage and Innovation Performance of SMEs in China: A New Perspective	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; ICT; PRODUCTIVITY; EMPLOYMENT; KNOWLEDGE; SERVICES; PARADOX; GROWTH	Existing studies on the information technology (IT) usage of firms are constrained within the perspective of "IT tool" or "IT investment." Few studies have analyzed the IT usage of firms from a new perspective. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the impact of IT usage on the innovation performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from the perspective of the product value chain (PVC). A research model integrating IT usage width, IT usage frequency, manufacturing flexibility, human capital quality, and firm innovation performance was proposed for this analysis. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis was performed on a sample of more than 1300 Chinese manufacturing firms using the newest data provided by the World Bank. Results validate that IT usage width and IT usage frequency have a significantly positive impact on the innovation performance of SMEs. Manufacturing flexibility plays a partially mediating role between IT usage frequency and the innovation performance of SMEs. Moreover, human capital quality has a significantly positive moderating effect on IT usage width and the innovation performance of SMEs. IT usage width and IT usage frequency appear to be important predictors of the innovation performance of SMEs, whereas there are substantial differences in the influencing mechanism of IT usage width and IT usage frequency on the innovation performance of SMEs.</p>	[Hu, Shilei; Wang, Xiaohong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China		Wang, XH (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.	wangxh@hit.edu.cn	Hu, Shilei/AAZ-1350-2020	Hu, Shilei/0000-0002-8098-3240	National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71874042]	AcknowledgmentsThis research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant no. 71874042).

AREA DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY			English	Article; Early Access						developmental regionalism; global value chain; Factory Asia; regional integration; regional value chain	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; TRADE; NETWORKS	There is growing scepticism about global value chains because of their association with an unequal global trading system. Regionally coordinated and integrated production in Asia appears to have served as a better mechanism for promoting economic prosperity than direct integration into global markets. This is founded upon regional cooperation on investment, trade and value chains. This research note distinguishes different forms of these chains, discusses the conditions for their emergence and sheds light on some of their effects - for both individual firms and entire continents. Asia's experience is compared with Africa's and Latin America's.

J	Chang, KF; Hsu, M; Swanson, S				Chang, Kuei-Feng; Hsu, Maxwell; Swanson, Scott			How to decode the value-consequence-attribute relationship: the application of TISM and ANP techniques	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Statistics; Strategy; Total interpretive structural modeling (TISM); Analytic network process (ANP); Holarchy; Customer desired values; Positioning; Strategy	MEANS-END CHAIN; CUSTOMER VALUE; VALUE CREATION; BRAND VALUE; MODEL; ISM	Purpose This paper aims to facilitate positioning strategy formation by decoding the relationship between consumers' desired values, service attributes and expected consequences. Design/methodology/approach Key informant depth interviews are followed by a questionnaire of self-cause-and-effect assessments. Total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) is used to identify hierarchical structures via pair-wise preference comparisons. The analytic network process (ANP) is used to compute relative weights to evaluate the overall image of identified alternatives. The feedback feature in the ANP is enabled to obtain objective assessments. Findings With the help of both TISM and ANP techniques, the hierarchical and interactive relationships among consumers' desired values, expected consequences and service attributes are revealed in the context of international airline services. Research limitations/implications The approach presented can help organizations to identify which attributes influence consumer evaluations of a company/brand; obtain the hierarchical and interactive relationships among service attributes, expected consequences and desired values; assess consumer preferences toward identified service attributes; and obtain an objective assessment of the competitive landscape, which can facilitate the development of effective positioning strategies and associated tactics. Practical implications Organizations adopting the methods presented in this study can have a better understanding of the consumer value chain and deliver better customer experiences. Originality/value The current study provides an innovative application of the TISM in conjunction with a feedback-enabled ANP technique to address brand positioning challenges. Future studies may consider adopting the TISM-ANP method as a foundation whenever one attempts to explore the values-consequences-attributes hierarchy.

How China's consumption-based CO2 emissions have plateaued	ISCIENCE			English	Article							STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS; FOSSIL-FUEL COMBUSTION; CARBON EMISSIONS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXPORTS; ENERGY; DRIVERS; GROWTH; 80-PERCENT	The shift of China's economy since 2013, dubbed the "new normal", has caused its production and consumption emissions to plateau, with the country seeming to embody the tantalizing promise of decoupling its economic growth from carbon emissions. By using multi-region input-output analysis, we find that China's relative decoupling in the new normal is technology driven, evidenced by the narrowing gap between its technology-adjusted and non-adjusted consumption emissions. By applying structural decomposition analysis, we further explore the driving forces behind the slowdown in China's imported emissions growth, finding that it is attributable to restructuring of import patterns resulting from changes in the structures of domestic demand. These changes could have been caused by China moving along the global value chain and rebalancing its industrial linkages toward trade in carbon-efficient goods to avoid transferring emissions intensive production to other regions, indicating a shift to less emissions -intensive trade rather than pure outsourcing.

Achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the cement industry via value chain mitigation strategies	ONE EARTH			English	Article							LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CO2 EMISSIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; RECYCLED CONCRETE; CARBON EMISSIONS; FLY-ASH; ENERGY; SUSTAINABILITY; CAPTURE; FABRICATION	Cement is used globally in construction materials for nearly all civil infrastructure systems supporting improved quality of life, and there is currently no substitute that can meet its functional capacity. The magni-tude of cement production leads to more than 7% of annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, resulting from both energy use and chemical reactions, which imposes a notable barrier to reach net zero emissions by 2050. This barrier is exacerbated by the interconnectivity of industries responsible for cement consumption. Here, we articulate current emission reduction challenges facing industries responsible for the production and use of cement and its products, and propose a compilation of solutions that focus on miti-gating emissions from cement production at various stages along its value chain. We present frameworks for design within a circular economy and for policy decisions. We anticipate that these strategies can deliver cement production with zero GHG emissions and alleviate other environmental impacts.

J	Wang, SH; Chen, HX; Yin, KD				Wang, Shuhong; Chen, Hanxue; Yin, Kedong			The employment effect of Chinese industrial enterprises embedded in environmental cost-adjusted global value chains	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Global value chains; Employment; Environmental costs; Enterprise; Influence mechanism	TRADE; EXPORTS; PRODUCTIVITY; TECHNOLOGY; POLLUTION	The employment effect of enterprises embedded in global value chains (GVCs) has important theoretical value, but existing research has ignored the impact of environmental costs on employment under the division of labor system within the value chain. By constructing a GVC-embedded index considering environmental costs, this study investigates the impact of Chinese industrial enterprises' embedding into GVCs on employment at both the theoretical and empirical levels. It is found that when the environmental cost is considered, the improvement of GVC embeddedness has a significant inhibiting effect on employment, especially for female laborers, lower-skilled laborers, state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and enterprises in the eastern region of China. The research also shows that when considering environmental costs, the labor cost increase effect enhances the negative effect of increased GVC embeddedness on employment, while the innovation promotion effect and the foreign direct investment effect serve to mitigate the negative effect. The results provide a reference for developing countries seeking to effectively protect people's livelihood and employment while achieving a leap in the division of labor along the green value chain.

J	Lemay, MA; Radcliffe, J; Bysouth, D; Spring, A				Lemay, Margaret A.; Radcliffe, Josalyn; Bysouth, David; Spring, Andrew			Northern Food Systems in Transition: The Role of the Emerging Agri-Food Industry in the Northwest Territories (Canada) Food System	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						agri-food industry; transitions; food security; economic development; poverty reduction; northern food systems; Northwest Territories (Canada)	LAND-USE CHANGE; SOIL CARBON; NUTRITION TRANSITION; SUSTAINABILITY; AGRICULTURE; SECURITY; RESILIENCE; HEALTH; STOCKS	This paper reports the findings of an ethnographic study that involved working with local organizations, food advocates, and communities to develop strategies for expanding the nascent Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada agri-food industry. The NWT represents a unique case study in that the fledging agri-food industry has been recognized for its promise in contributing to the core goals of the transitioning NWT food system. The study is guided by two research questions: (1) How is the promise of the emerging NWT agri-food industry framed within the context of the broader food system? (2) Given this framing of the NWT agri-food industry, how can it contribute to the sustainability of the NWT food system and to the goals of food security, poverty reduction, nutrition, and economic development? Grounded in a food systems approach, we used a correlative, evolutionary SWOT analysis to profile the nascent NWT agri-food industry within the context of the existing NWT food system. Through further thematic analysis, we identify and describe two dominant narratives (agri-food industry business case narrative and agri-food industry implications narrative) and key themes within the narratives based on an adapted food systems framework. The agri-food business case narrative highlights discourse articulating the business or commercial viability for a local agri-food value chain to function, evolve, and expand. The agri-food industry implications narrative envisions the ways in which the emerging NWT agri-food industry may interact within the existing NWT food system, highlighting potential environmental, social, cultural, and political implications of an expanding commercial-based agri-food value chain. Within the two narratives, certain subcomponents of the NWT agri-food system appear to be more prevalent, including climate, soil, and ecosystems, policy/regulations/governance, socio-cultural norms, knowledge, inputs, finance, production, and consumption. We make policy and practice recommendations for co-designing an agri-food industry that serves the multiple goals of the NWT food system. As an exploratory, descriptive-structural analysis the study provides a critical empirical basis for future in-depth, fully integrated synthesis of the complex social, cultural, economic, political, and ecological dynamics shaping Northern food systems in transition.</p>	[Lemay, Margaret A.] Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Radcliffe, Josalyn] Univ Waterloo, Sch Publ Hlth Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Bysouth, David] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Spring, Andrew] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Ctr Sustainable Food Syst, Waterloo, ON, Canada		Lemay, MA (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON, Canada.	lemaym@uoguelph.ca			Climate Change Preparedness in the North (CCPN); Climate Change Health Adaptation Program (CCHAP); Government of CanadaCGIAR [1819-NT-000101, 1920-NR-000646]	We gratefully acknowledge funding from the Climate Change Preparedness in the North (CCPN) and Climate Change Health Adaptation Program (CCHAP), both grands received by the Government of Canada (#1819-NT-000101 and #1920-NR-000646).

It has opened new ways to achieve industrial upgrading. However, some theoretical models suggest that not all countries will upgrade through participation in GVCs. Using panel data from the World Input-Output Database, we examine the effects of backward and forward GVC participation on three dimensions of industrial upgrading (process, product and skill upgrading). We find that backward GVC participation provides more upgrading opportunities for developing countries as it enables a less developed country to import sophisticated inputs. This activates learning through embodied knowledge. In contrast, forward participation has higher level of upgrading effect on developed countries.

J	Vieira, DLM; Sano, EE; Silva, TR				Vieira, Daniel L. M.; Sano, Edson E.; Silva, Tamilis Rocha			A classification of cultivated pastures in the Brazilian Cerrado for sustainable intensification and savanna restoration	AMBIO			English	Article; Early Access						Ecological intensification; LULC; Pasture degradation; Savannas; Secondary savannas; Silvopastoral systems	LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; LAND-USE; REGENERATION; INDICATORS	The Brazilian Cerrado, with over 200 million hectares, has approximately 28% of its area occupied by cultivated pasturelands and 39% of them are degraded. In this study, we propose a new classification of the Cerrado pastures and recommendations for sustainable intensification and savanna restoration. We propose seven classes of pastures based on the ground cover proportions of exotic grass, bare soil, and native vegetation. These lands need to be acknowledged for their biodiversity conservation and potential for sustainable intensification and restoration. In order to make ecological intensification available for the ranchers, research and technology transfer have to embrace native tree species-based silviculture, native-grass-based forage management and enhancement, and value chain of biodiversity-friendly products. The pasture management proposals of this paper are based on a concept of biodiversity as an ecosystem service, promoting local productivity and global ecosystem services.	[Vieira, Daniel L.

J	Lahane, S; Gupta, P; Kant, R				Lahane, Swapnil; Gupta, Prakhar; Kant, Ravi			Evaluating the benefits of circular economy due to adoption of its enablers	MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article; Early Access						Circular economy; Enablers; Benefits; Sustainability; PF-AHP; PF-TODIM	PYTHAGOREAN FUZZY AHP; SUPPLY CHAIN; PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES; DRIVERS; BARRIERS; BUSINESS; FRAMEWORK; CONTEXT; MODEL	Purpose This research aims to identify and prioritize the circular economy (CE) benefits (CEBs) due to the adoption of CE enablers (CEEs) in the Indian manufacturing organization context. Design/methodology/approach This research proposes a hybrid framework of Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multicriteria Decision-Making) techniques. It identifies the CEEs and CEBs based on literature review and validated through industrial experts. Further, this research conducts an empirical case study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. Findings The result shows that CE enabler SE1 (clear vision, support and commitment from top management for CE adoption) is the most critical enabler for CE implementation. The CE benefit CEB1 (improves the value chain of products and mitigating environmental damage during product life cycle phase) is the most significant benefit derived from the adoption of CEEs. The proposed framework will provide a more accurate, structural and systematic approach to the business organizations for achieving the CEBs in a stepwise manner through the effective adoption of CEEs. Research limitations/implications The findings of this research are nation-specific and based on a case study of single manufacturing industry. Thus, the result obtained can vary from case to case and nation to nation. Originality/value A deep understanding of each CEEs and CEBs would help build confidence among decision-makers and industrial practitioners to eliminate the risks associated with CE implementation.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Sustainability; Competitive advantages; Pandemic; Electronics	MARKET ORIENTATION; BUSINESS STRATEGY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CONTENT VALIDITY; CAPABILITIES; ANTECEDENTS; FRAMEWORK	Purpose This paper aimed to validate the sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) measures in Malaysian electronics manufacturing organizations' context after the post coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Post pandemic sustainability in competitive advantages have become a buzzword for Malaysian electronics industries in facilitating the value chain generation to consumers, besides enhancing profitability to the organization. SCAs are important when the manufacturer can provide something valuable to the market, and it differs from the competitors, especially during the crisis. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted the quantitative research approach in validating the SCA variables. The questionnaires were self-administered and randomly distributed among the electronics manufacturing organizations across Malaysia, with a total of 207 responses. Concisely, this research theoretically conceptualized SCAs as a multidimensional construct containing two dimensions: lower cost advantage (LCA) and differentiation advantage (DFA). Findings Besides, the findings ascertained the strategies to sustain the competitive advantages within an organization, which is underpinned by resource-based theory. In short, findings of this research would be an imperative implication for academicians and organization's policymakers to move forward towards advanced economy and Industrial Revolution 4.0 in the current global competitive environment. Originality/value There is no prescription of attaining competitive advantages that suits all conditions in Malaysian electronics industries; this implies that the literature gaps existed, and further research shall be conducted on SCAs.

The Societal Economic Impact of Secukinumab in First-Line Treatment of Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis in Germany: An Open-Cohort Simulation	PHARMACOECONOMICS-OPEN			English	Article; Early Access							ANTI-INTERLEUKIN-17A MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; DOUBLE-BLIND	Objectives Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease. In Germany, guidelines recommend fumaric acid esters (FAEs) as first-line systemic treatment. Despite treatment with FAEs, disease burden remains high in Germany. Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated greater efficacy and safety than FAEs in the PRIME trial. The aim of the current study, hence, is to quantify the potential societal economic impact of secukinumab in systemic treatment-naive patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in Germany. Methods We employed a semi-Markov model to capture health gains at an individual level and a dynamic population model to extrapolate the findings in the population of interest. We quantified the health outcomes in two scenarios: (i) patients receiving secukinumab and (ii) patients receiving FAEs. Using estimates on change in work productivity and societal economic parameters, we translated the health outcomes into paid and unpaid economic gains. We used gross value added (GVA) to value these gains and calculated the macroeconomic indirect and induced value-chain effects. Results Our calculations show that patients treated with secukinumab spend on average 94% of their time in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) >= 75 state compared with 80% for patients in the FAEs scenario. When assuming that FAEs are the sole comparator to secukinumab, this difference could lead to 4.3 million active hours gained until 2030. These gained hours translate to a total societal economic impact of euro308 million till 2030 for the whole patient population in GVA terms. Conclusion This study demonstrated that using secukinumab instead of FAEs in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis could lead to substantial macroeconomic GVA gains.

Policy discourse in Cambodia increasingly frames aquaculture as a viable alternative to capture fisheries, and seeks to promote its development. This paper presents results from the first comprehensive survey of Cambodia's aquaculture value chain. The study combines qualitative (46 Key Informant Interviews) and quantitative surveys (1,204 farmers and 191 other aquaculture value chain actors) to investigate potential for aquaculture in Cambodia to grow, support livelihoods, and contribute to food security. We found the following: (i) The fish farm sector in Cambodia is comprised mainly of small family farms raising carnivorous fish species or pangasius, using direct inputs of "trash fish" harvested from the wild; (ii) Most fish seed and pelleted feed are imported, and domestic producers of these inputs struggle to compete; (iii) Fish farmed in Cambodia is mostly sold live. Farm fish are more expensive than the main species harvested from inland capture fisheries, and struggle to compete with imported farmed fish; (iv) Capture fisheries employ many times more people than aquaculture; (v) Space for aquaculture is limited because few locations have both perennial access to water and protection from flooding. These findings raise questions about the potential of Cambodia's aquaculture sector, as currently organized, to contribute significantly to employment, food and nutrition security, and rural economic development. We propose actions to improve the sector's sustainability and contribute to desirable development outcomes.</p>	[Joffre, Olivier M.; Freed, Sarah] WorldFish, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Bernhardt, James] Amer Soybean Assoc, St Louis, MO USA; [Teoh, Shwu Jiau; Belton, Ben] WorldFish, George Town, Malaysia; [Sambath, Sak] Commercializat Aquaculture Sustainable Trade CAST, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Belton, Ben] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA		Joffre, OM (corresponding author), WorldFish, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.	olivier1975@gmail.com; JBernhardt@soy.org			CGIAR Research Program on Fish Agri-Food Systems (FISH)CGIAR; CGIAR Trust FundCGIAR; U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food for Progress program	This work was undertaken as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Fish Agri-Food Systems (FISH) led by World Fish.

J	Werner, M				Werner, Marion			Geographies of production III: Global production in/through nature	PROGRESS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						chemical geographies; commodification; extraction; global production networks; unequal ecological exchange	PRODUCTION NETWORKS; UNEQUAL EXCHANGE; LABOR; FOOD; GLOBALIZATION; ACCUMULATION; FRONTIERS	This report draws upon political ecology and nature-society geography to examine the production network-nature nexus. Indebted to these approaches, a growing number of production network and value chain studies are expanding well beyond the field's traditional remit of environmental governance. This work centers the institutional arrangements of firms, laboratories, workers, and regulations that organize and combine extensive and intensive strategies to appropriate nature's value. 'Nature' is neither input nor output here; rather, it is metabolized in and through the functional coordination of these spatially distributed activities. I explore these themes in recent studies of resource extraction and frontier-making, chemical geographies of biocides, and the material-cum-geographical claims of ethical supply chains. Expanding and deepening the dialogue between conjunctural analyses of states, labor, and supply chains, on the one hand, and how socionatures condition these arrangements, on the other, is both analytically and politically necessary. I offer this, my final report, as a modest contribution to this endeavor.

Low-temperature hydrothermally treated Eucalyptus globulus bark: From by-product to horticultural fiber-based growing media viability	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Low-temperature hydrothermal treatment; Woody biomass; Processed bark; Phytotoxicity; Substrate blend	PINE TREE SUBSTRATE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; PEAT; OPTIMIZATION; FRESH	Worldwide, the circular economy approach increased the need of waste-streams minimization, promoting byproducts re-circulation into the value chain which creates sustainable industrial synergies. Eucalyptus globulus bark fiber is a waste from pulp and paper industry that can be re-used in horticultural applications. This work aims to use low-temperature hydrothermally treated E. globulus bark as a fiber material for growing media formulation. Three types of bark fiber were used: industrial E. globulus fresh bark (IB) ground to output sieve of 6 x 6 mm, and two low-temperature hydrothermally treated barks (TB60: 60 degrees C, 20 min; TB100: 100 degrees C, 40 min). The three fiber materials were blended at 25 and 50% (v v(-1)) (B25; B50) with peat. IB was phytotoxic for Cress (Lepidum sativum) seeds, causing low germination (91%) and root growth inhibition. TB60 and TB100 reduced significantly phytotoxicity with germination rates of 98 and 100%, and Munoo Liisa index around 90% compared to commercial substrate. A pot experiment using Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) as a model plant, revealed lower germination (95%) in IB blends than in treated ones and in commercial substrate (CS) (98-100%), reinforcing the IB phytotoxicity. B50 decreased water retention, and reduced plant growth due to nitrogen immobilization inherent to woody biomass. B25 showed shoot weight, and mot growth statistically equal or higher than CS, encouraging use of this blending proportion of low-temperature hydrothermally treated bark in future growing media formulation.

J	Lee, JM				Lee, Jong Min			MNCs as dispersed structures of power: Performance and management implications of power distribution in the subsidiary portfolio	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						multinational corporations; headquarters-subsidiary relationships; power structure; agency theory; resource dependence theory; expatriates; performance	MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISE; FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY; KNOWLEDGE FLOWS; VALUE CHAIN; INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION; AGENCY THEORY; HEADQUARTERS; FIRM; PERSPECTIVE; BUSINESS	Multinational corporations (MNCs) are considered as dispersed structures of power, in which diverse headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary power relationships collectively influence performance and management. Yet, few studies have accounted for the subsidiary portfolio characteristics shaped by the entire set of differentiated HQ-subsidiary power relationships, and little is known about their effect on the performance and management decisions of MNCs. Drawing on agency and resource dependence theories, this study investigates how the power structure of the MNC, or the pattern of power distribution in the subsidiary portfolio, affects MNC performance and expatriate utilization. Results from a comprehensive panel of Korean MNCs show that the degree of power concentration in the subsidiary portfolio has inverted U-shaped relationships with MNC performance and the use of expatriate control. However, the results also reveal that these relationships vary between manufacturing and downstream subsidiary portfolios. These findings suggest that the structural characteristics of the subsidiary portfolio are important determinants of MNC performance and management. This study opens an important new avenue for international business scholarship by explicitly conceptualizing the MNC as a portfolio of differentiated subsidiaries and by examining the consequences of the subsidiary portfolio characteristics.

Spatial Tools for Integrated and Inclusive Landscape Governance: Toward a New Research Agenda	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Participatory spatial tools; Integrated landscape approaches; Inclusive landscape governance	VALUE CHAIN; CONSERVATION; AGRICULTURE; INITIATIVES; SERVICES; POLITICS; COLLABORATION; VISUALIZATION; EXPLORATION; MANAGEMENT	Participatory spatial tools-community mapping, PGIS, and others-find increasing resonance among research and non-governmental organizations to make stakeholder claims and community perspectives explicit for more inclusive landscape governance. In this paper, we situate the use of participatory spatial tools in debates on integrated landscape approaches and inclusive development. We show that using such spatial tools is not new but argue that their application for inclusive landscape governance requires a new research agenda that focuses on expanding the scope of application of the tools, improving the inclusivity of the processes, and developing new technologies.

J	Aggarwal, S; Chakraborty, D; Bhattacharyya, R				Aggarwal, Sakshi; Chakraborty, Debashis; Bhattacharyya, Ranajoy			Determinants of Domestic Value Added in Exports: Empirical Evidence from India's Manufacturing Sectors	GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan; domestic value added in exports; global value chains; India; manufacturing trade policy; panel data analysis	UNIT-ROOT TESTS; PRODUCTION NETWORKS; TRADE AGREEMENTS; PATTERN; TIME; PRODUCTIVITY	Over the last decade, trade policy reforms have significantly influenced the internationalization of Indian manufacturing firms, leading to deeper participation of the country in global value chains (GVCs) and international production networks (IPNs). With the growing participation of foreign firms in the value chain, the domestic value-added (DVA) content embodied in Indian exports have displayed a declining trend. Recently, in 2020, India has decided to launch the 'Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat Abhiyan', which, in principle, aims to consolidate the manufacturing sector, leading to increasing DVA embodied in exports (DVA-content), apart from employment generation. The current article attempts to analyse the drivers of India's DVA in exports for select manufacturing industries over 2000-15 by using the OECD trade in value added (TiVA) database. The empirical results reveal that sectoral DVA content is positively influenced by both domestic capital and foreign direct investment (FDI), and labour skill intensity, but negatively influenced by the presence of unskilled workers. Moreover, FDI inflows in sectors characterized by high skill-intensity and high-relative growth rate play a crucial role in influencing DVA content. Finally, the presence of larger and more capital-intensive firms is found to be a major driver of DVA. On the policy front, therefore, the empirical results underline that export promotion policies alone will not be able to resolve employment worries, a major concern in India, as vast numbers of unskilled and low-skilled workers trapped in the agricultural sector or working in unorganized and micro-industries fail to figure in the country's export value addition. A concerted effort towards labour skill enhancement as well as technology transfer is necessary for exports to play a more positive role.

J	Lauer, C; Conran, J; Adkins, J				Lauer, Christopher; Conran, Joseph; Adkins, Jeffery			Estimating the Societal Benefits of Satellite Instruments: Application to a Break-even Analysis of the GeoXO Hyperspectral IR Sounder	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						GeoXO; hyperspectral-infrared sounder; OSSE; OSE; VOI; value-chain; earth-observations	TEMPERATURE; IMPACT	This paper describes the process, and lessons learned in a preliminary benefits study of a proposed infrared hyperspectral sounder (HSS) for NOAA's next generation geostationary satellite program (GeoXO). The valuation of government-owned satellite systems providing a public good with a complex array of instruments is a nascent field of study. Many different sensor configurations are possible, but there are restrictions due to physical and budget constraints. Accounting for economic considerations during the design and planning phase for satellite constellations helps to ensure that the most cost effective instruments are selected. To assess whether the HSS instrument should be included on GeoXO, we applied a value of information approach and found the benefits associated with this instrument are likely to substantially outweigh the costs. Value of information studies often focus on data and information that has a direct use case. Estimating benefits for the HSS is especially challenging because data are not used directly by decision makers. Instead these data along with information from other Earth observing (EO) satellites play a key role in producing the inputs necessary for modern numerical hydrometeorological modeling. We describe strategies to assess the marginal (i.e., incremental) contribution of an instrument that is part of a complex information production process. We make several recommendations that, if implemented, would improve the quality of future studies of this kind. This includes (1) a systems approach to observing system planning, (2) improving the design of observing system experiments (OSSE and OSE), and (3) better tracking of the decisions and needs of end-users, especially those external to the agency.

J	Makhloufi, C; Kezibri, N				Makhloufi, Camel; Kezibri, Nouaamane			Large-scale decomposition of green ammonia for pure hydrogen production	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Ammonia; Hydrogen; Decomposition; Cracking; Dehydrogenation; Energy storage	COMMERCIAL RU/AL2O3 CATALYST; STEAM-METHANE REFORMER; REACTOR; STORAGE; MODEL	It is acknowledged that Hydrogen has a decisive role to play in insuring a reliable and efficient penetration of renewable electricity in the energy mix. Nonetheless, building a sustainable Hydrogen Economy is faced with numerous challenges across the value chain. Namely, large-scale production and storage are still open issues that need to be addressed. A promising solution is to store renewable H-2 in the form of green ammonia often referred to as Power-to-Ammonia. Thus unlocking all available infrastructure for ammonia to effectively store and export hydrogen in bulk. In this value chain, the missing link is ammonia cracking to recover back hydrogen at high purities. The present work explores a technical solution to recover hydrogen from ammonia at large-scale. Through an exhaustive technoeconomic analysis, we have demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale production of pure H-2 from ammonia. The designed Ammonia-to-H-2 plant operates at a thermal efficiency of 68.5% to produce 200 MTPD of pure hydrogen at 250 bar. Furthermore, this study has established a final estimation of the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) from green ammonia. It was revealed that LCOH is mostly dependent on green ammonia cost, which in turn varies with renewable electricity cost.

It is an especially effective approach for investigating the marine microbiome. To mature marine microbiome research and operations within a global ocean biomolecular observing network (OBON) for the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and beyond, research groups will need a system to effectively share, discover, and compare "omic" practices and protocols. While numerous informatic tools and standards exist, there is currently no global, publicly-supported platform specifically designed for sharing marine omics [or any omics] protocols across the entire value-chain from initiating a study to the publication and use of its results. Toward that goal, we propose the development of the Minimum Information for an Omic Protocol (MIOP), a community-developed guide of curated, standardized metadata tags and categories that will orient protocols in the value-chain for the facilitated, structured, and user-driven discovery of suitable protocol suites on the Ocean Best Practices System. Users can annotate their protocols with these tags, or use them as search criteria to find appropriate protocols. Implementing such a curated repository is an essential step toward establishing best practices. Sharing protocols and encouraging comparisons through this repository will be the first steps toward designing a decision tree to guide users to community endorsed best practices.

J	Simiyu, S; Chumo, I; Mberu, B				Simiyu, Sheillah; Chumo, Ivy; Mberu, Blessing			Fecal Sludge Management in Low Income Settlements: Case Study of Nakuru, Kenya	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						fecal sludge management; low income settlements; Nakuru; safely managed sanitation; sanitation value chain	RESOURCE RECOVERY; SANITATION; TECHNOLOGIES; OPTIONS; NAIROBI; SLUMS	Introduction: In order to meet the sustainable development goals targets of sanitation, countries aim to increase access to safely managed sanitation services for its citizens. Safely managed sanitation services refers to improved sanitation technologies that are not shared with other households and where excreta is treated and disposed; or stored, transported and treated off-site. In most Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, on-site sanitation facilities such as latrines and septic tanks are common, with low-income urban settlements mainly using pit latrines. However, little is documented about the management of sludge from these facilities, especially in low income settlements in secondary and emerging cities. This lack of data is a major hindrance to public health, development and planning efforts by governments and planning agencies. This study specifically assesses practices and challenges along the sanitation value chain related to containment, emptying, transportation, treatment and recycling of fecal sludge.Methods: The study was carried out in low income settlements in Nakuru, a secondary city in Kenya. Over half the population in Nakuru live in low income areas and majority of these residents use pit latrines. A case study design was selected for this study and data was collected using qualitative methods. Data was collected through In-depth interviews and Focus Group Discussions using in depth interview guide and focus group discussion guides that had questions on sanitation practices along the value chain, challenges, opportunities available, and recommendations for improvement. Analysis was done through content analysis by reading the transcripts multiple times to gain a sense of the flow of the discussion. Thereafter, coding was done by following emergent issues and thereafter categories were identified which formed the basis for providing a picture of FWM practices in the settlements.Results: On site sanitation facilities are dominant in the settlements, but they are few and are shared by several households. These facilities were unclean, and they filled up at a fast rate because of the high number of users. The latrines were emptied by manual emptiers who used mechanized equipment but complemented with manual emptying using buckets. Sludge was transported to a central collection point using large and small scale means of transportation, before transfer to the treatment site for final treatment and disposal. Various stakeholders are involved in capacity building of emptiers as well as in the transportation, treatment and disposal of fecal sludge in the settlements. Challenges along the stages of the value chain included negative community perceptions and attitudes toward fecal sludge management.Conclusion: The results highlight the need to address the challenges along the chain by involvement of state and non-state actors. Low income areas have high populations and thus contribute huge amounts of fecal sludge.

J	Condotta, M; Zatta, E				Condotta, Massimiliano; Zatta, Elisa			Reuse of building elements in the architectural practice and the European regulatory context: Inconsistencies and possible improvements	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Resource efficiency; Circular economy; Reuse design project; Building sector; On-site mining; Urban mining	BUILT ENVIRONMENT; CIRCULAR ECONOMY	Current European policies identify the efficient management of Construction and Demolition Waste as a priority area. With regard to this, circular economy principles and present research trajectories encourage the less demanding manufacturing patterns as the ones enhancing resource efficiency, recognising the advantages of reusing as compared to recycling. However, the heterogeneous nature of EU norms concerning reclaimed building elements generates multiple inconsistencies. Uncertainties related to the waste management process, together with a legal vacuum, prevent reuse strategies from spreading, affecting both market competitiveness and its shift towards the sustainable resource management. Starting from the European regulatory framework for reclaimed products and components in the architectural perspective, the paper discusses possible improvements towards a more circular built environment. It analyses how existing legal vacuums and inconsistencies prevent the implementation of reuse processes in the architec-tural field, adding barriers to a value chain already lacking driving forces. The examined regulatory context highlights how the reuse of building elements is subordinate not only to proper deconstruction activities, but also to the uncertain application of the CE marking and the unclear requirements for the element specific use. As a consequence, the legal framework worsen the existing obstacles to the use of reclaimed elements: the results show how time frames, costs, performance assessment, and end users perception are the more involved criti-calities in the conflict between the enactment of reuse processes in architecture and the related regulatory context. The discussion reports possible actions and improvements on the regulatory and policy levels to simplify the procedures for architectural reuse practices. It also highlights how academic and professional research could represent a lever in promoting innovative and site-specific strategies fostering the reuse of building elements as a sustainable process.

Smallholders operate the majority of farm enterprises in Rwanda but have typically been limited to village poultry production. Meanwhile, larger modern enterprises have been the primary suppliers of broilers to the commercial market. However, hybrid, asset-building broiler operations are a third production model that represent a potential avenue for smallholder poultry intensification. The integration of this model into the Rwandan broiler sector provides greater opportunity for domestic producers to meet Rwandan government targets for the supply of animal-sourced foods, while generating livelihood opportunities for smallholders. This paper provides an overview of the commercial broiler value chain and outlines lessons learned from a pilot project that employed this third production model. Challenges to smallholder engagement in the Rwanda commercial broiler value chain cut across input supply, production, post-harvest and marketing, and have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, multiple opportunities exist to strengthen smallholder engagement and integration into the Rwandan commercial broiler value chain. These include: reducing the recurring costs of production; providing value chain trainings; facilitating microfinancing; reducing post-harvest costs; increasing local demand for broiler meat; and strengthening policies in support of smallholders.

Comparative juvenile performance assessment of genetically improved Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) under commercial conditions in Bangladesh	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Bangladesh; farmer perceptions; growth; Nile tilapia; survival	GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; GIFT STRAINS; VALUE CHAIN; MIXED-SEX; AQUACULTURE; PROFITABILITY; FRY; ADOPTION; MONOSEX; IMPACTS	Two on-farm juvenile performance trials were conducted at a hatchery in Bangladesh to compare a genetically improved strain of farmed Nile tilapia (GIFT) and a local strain (LS) produced by commercial operators. A 21-day early nursing trial was conducted in five replicate hapas followed by a 27-day advanced nursing trial in six replicate hapas. The mean feed conversion ratios (FCR), mean specific growth rates (SGR), mean individual final weights, mean production yields and mean survival rates were calculated for both strains. During the early nursing trial, GIFT fry survival rate and overall yield were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than LS values, which in contrast demonstrated better FCR and SGR. Improved performance was demonstrated in terms of FCR, SGR and yield for GIFT during the advanced nursing trial and mean final individual weights were 78% greater for GIFT than LS fish (2.26 g and 1.27 g respectively). Economic analysis indicated GIFT fish produced a net return 84% greater than that of LS fish at the end of the early nursing period, and by the end of the advanced nursing period, this difference had grown further such that GIFT generated a gross return over double that of LS. The results from a survey of tilapia grow-out farmers suggested producers from poor, medium and better-off backgrounds agreed GIFT performed better than traditional strains and is beneficial for aquaculture growth in Bangladesh. However, the results also indicate there may be a greater propensity for better-off farmers to appreciate the potential benefits of improved strains over poorer farmers.

Therefore, this study aims to assess the determinants of four aspects of milling, namely, choice of milling technology, millers' perceptions of the importance of paddy quality attributes, milling return and milling capacity. Design/methodology/approach Multinomial logit, semi-nonparametric extended ordered probit, linear regression and additive nonparametric models are applied to cross-sectional data obtained from a sample of 196 rice millers. Findings Physical, economic, institutional, technological and sociodemographic factors are found to be important determinants of the four aspects of milling. Physical factors include the distance of the mill from major town and availability of storage space at the milling premises, while economic factors include milling charge and backward integration of miller into paddy production. Contracting and use of a single-pass mill are important institutional and technological factors, respectively, and miller's household size, age, gender and education are the key sociodemographic variables. Originality/value The study's originality lies in its scope, especially in terms of its breadth. Without compromising the needed analytical rigor, it focuses on four aspects of milling that are critical to improving the marketing of Uganda's rice. In doing so, it provides a holistic understanding of this segment of the value chain and offers specific recommendations for improving the marketing of Uganda's rice.
