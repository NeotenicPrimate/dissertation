To provide students with an understanding of the features of the discourses they may encounter, this study investigates lexical bundles (LBs) used in the reading passages of Malaysian University English Test (MUET), a compulsory entrance examination for tertiary education. More specifically it aims to compare and contrast the functional types of LBs found in arts and science-based reading passages. A specialised corpus of MUET test papers made up of only the reading passages categorised into two main traditional disciplines; arts and science was built using WordSmith Tools Version 5. The lists of LBs of the identified disciplines were generated using WordSmith Tools Version 5. The generated data was then analysed qualitatively based on Hyland's (2008) Functional Taxonomy. Findings revealed that although the number of LBs in both disciplines shows significant difference, many similar LBs are found. Science-based passages employ more research-based LBs whereas arts-based texts employ more participant-oriented LBs. These findings seemed to confirm that the functions of LBs are specific to particular disciplines. Hence, explicit teaching of LBs should be considered in schools and two separate sets of MUET reading tests where the first comprises of texts adopted from the scientific and technological context while the other made up of texts from the social sciences should be designed to accommodate both arts and science stream pre-university students.

A psychoanalytic study of his famous drama Suddenly Last Summer (1958) will enable us to explore the qualities of unresolved psychological complexes in the characters and also in the author himself, as the play is believed to draw strongly upon the playwright. s own biography. Towards this end, an intertextual interpretation serves to reflect upon the semiotic disposition of author and characters, which figures out a paradigm of the "transcendental ego" (Moi, 1986, p. 28). This analysis therefore aims at projecting the unconscious of the characters and the author through language, while examining how language can represent characters. identities and their hidden complexes through fragmentation of their identities. Through the analysis it will be shown how the interpretation of poetic language uncovers the unconscious via the effects and affects of devices such as metaphor, metonymy, replacement and condensation. Using a Kristevan interpretation of poetic language and its revelation of the semiotic, this paper therefore attempts to show that violence presented in the text is rooted in the fragmented identities of the characters and their creator and ultimately, it suggests the potential to recover one. s identity through poetic language. It may thus offer some clues to puzzling issues that have been misunderstood with regard to the recurrent poetic language and images in Suddenly Last Summer.

This allows media to propagate ideology through their texts. As such a comparative analysis of four newspaper articles; from The Star (Malaysia), the International Herald Malaysia (international newspaper with a Malaysian edition), The Jakarta Post (Indonesia), and The Guardian (United Kingdom), reporting on the same story using Fairclough's (1989, 1995) framework of Critical Discourse Analysis to determine the ideological meanings associated to the papers was conducted. The focus of the articles is the July 2009 announcement on the change in medium of instruction from English to Bahasa Malaysia for the teaching of Mathematics and Science in Malaysia. Even though the news agencies have access to the same information and / or facts, the analysed reports are ideologically different and shed a different light on the issue presented. The study reveals the complexity of our human communication system and it becomes visible that newspapers from different socio-cultural and political contexts interpret and report an ideologically contested issue in different ways and in so doing influence their readers' thinking and opinion about the issue.

This collection is published in 2007 by All Women's Action Society (AWAM), an independent feminist organisation committed to improving the lives of women in Malaysia. The writers' writings of life-narratives are analysed in the framework of narrative therapy developed by Michael White and David Epston and Kamsler's theory of revising individuals' relationship with one-self in relation to violence and abuse. By placing the plots of the stories within Kamsler's stages of revising individual's relationship with one-self in relation to violence and abuse, the stories reflect the authors' success in forming a more positive self-dignity, thus allowing them to go on with their lives guided by new perspectives and hopes. By contextualizing their violent experiences in a broader cultural politics of race, gender, class, sexuality, professional and institutional dominance, these stories, when viewed as therapeutic engagement, have helped these women to externalise their problems allowing them to create awareness as well as speaking out to the Malaysian society in order to expose the detrimental effects of sexual and domestic violence.

This paper discusses the application of Wiki in fostering collaborative writing in a specific upper secondary class. The study investigates how a group of secondary students learned to use Wiki to co-write a science dictionary, and the effects of Wiki on their collaborative efforts in producing the dictionary. The study employed a single-case observation research design. The single case was a class of 23 Form Four students with only 13 students regularly participating in the Wiki project for three months. The participants' perceptions of Wiki were analysed through interviews and a survey questionnaire. Their behaviours were observed while they were in the process of using Wiki in constructing the science dictionary. Results show that students who actively participated in the project perceived Wiki positively, while those who were apprehensive in writing and contributed the least to the project thought otherwise. Active students who were weak in both ICT skills and English had the most to gain because they improved in both areas by the end of the project. A tangible outcome of the collaborative writing project was that by the end of the third month, a Wiki science dictionary was successfully created online at the Tiki-Wiki website.

Some of the followers of this theory believe that the traditional Arabic scholars had emphasized only on Arabic prose and poetry in their efforts to compile Arabic grammar. Hence, the purpose of this research is to present the commitment of Ibn (c)Aqil and Ibn Hisham, a prominent Arabic grammarian of Mamalik period, who introduced Quranic evidence (shahid) in Arabic grammar teaching practice. The research method used in this study is based on document analysis technique. This research analyzes the word shahid from a chapter named al-Marfu(c) at in two books known as Sharh Ibn (c)Aqil written by Ibn (c)Aqil and Sharh Qatr alNad (a) over bar wa Bal Al-Sad (a) over bar written by Ibn Hisham using the document analysis technique. The analyses concluded that both of them use the shahid effectively with the diverse patterns in the application of the shahid in the sole form or combination form with non-Quranic evidence, besides examples from the writers themselves. The study also shows that there are differences in the application of the shahid by both scholars. The differences indirectly showed that Ibn Hisham had been more committed to the Quran because he tended to use the shahid in the sole form and preferred the shahid over Arabic poetry. Overall, this research has successfully established that Ibn Hisham was amongst the traditional scholars who put prevalence of applying the Holy Quran over kalam al-(c) Arab and this practice had elevated his status as the most acknowledged brilliant, without equal, Arabic grammar scholar.

To ensure the effectiveness of this programme, the positive attitudes and high perceptions towards the language are needed. Therefore, this study aims to identify the perceived attitudes and perceptions, which is part of the cognition of the young students towards the Malay language, and views the significance of the relationship between the social background of young student, particularly in gender differences, race/ethnicity, and the class stream of study and their congnitive towards the Malay language. More than 1,500 students were involved in this study. The result shows that nearly 80.0% (1,208) of the students have a positive attitudes towards the Malay language and there are only 29.9% (456) of them who have high perception towards the language. The study also reveals that the cognitive of the young students have significance relations to their social background. Hence, the research considers that positive attitudes and high perception towards the Malay language needs to be cultivated so that they remain assured on the capability of the Malay language, particularly as a language of knowledge and language of unity in Malaysia.

For instance, alphabet 'tha' is considered difficult to the Malay students because the alphabet does not exist in the Malay alphabet consonant, whereas this alphabet is in the early part of the Arabic alphabetical order. Therefore, the aim of this study is to rearrange the Arabic consonants according to the Malay accent for learning purposes. The objectives of this study are to: (a) identify the fluency level of Arabic language consonants; and (b) rearrange the Arabic consonants according to the fluency of Malay accent. This study was carried out at the preschool centers deploying six-year-old children who have just started learning Arabic language. The instrument in this study was a set of pronunciation test based on al-Khalil Method. The pronunciation test was evaluated by two experts in 'tajwid' and 'tarannum' disciplines. The findings showed 12 consonants were found to be at the moderate level of fluency, and one at the weak level, and the rest at the high level. The findings also showed that the highest mean score is the alphabet, and the lowest score is alphabet. Therefore, this study suggests the identified Arabic alphabetical order to be used in teaching of the pronunciation of Arabic language in Malaysian schools.

This paper is concerned with the identification and examination of dictionary features perceived as helpful by ESL learners in assisting them in a sense differentiation task. Anecdotal data were analysed through a process of data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing and verification (Miles & Huberman, 1994). Qualitative coding categorization was adopted to classify and categorize media-related and generic-related dictionary features at three levels; macrostructural level, microstructural level, and interstructural level. Results generally indicated that preferred dictionary features mostly occurred at the microstructural level and that generic-related features were a priority as compared to media-specific features.

Lately, the use of computers in the classroom is particularly important in the context of teaching and learning English as a second language. This paper aims to investigate and to understand how computer-based activities are organized in a school situation that is totally dependent on the syllabus. This study is a case study that incorporates classroom observations, field-notes, interviews and written documents. Both computer-based activities and non computer-based activities in ESL classrooms were recorded and anaylsed. This study concludes that the opportunities for students to learn English as a second language using computers are very wide, and the use of L2 can be increased if authentic computer-based activities can be incorporated in the lesson.

The main focus of this case study was to discover whether less proficient students of Bachelor of Arts in English Language Studies (B. A ELS) at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia can "stretch" their learning styles outside their preferred modes namely the auditory and visual styles, and working individually over two semesters (eight months) of practice. The tools in collecting the data were Reid's (1984, cited in Reid, 1995) perceptual learning style preference questionnaire, journal writing, semi-structured interviews and observations. The findings from this study were: 1) the majority of the students in this study had at least kinaesthetic and/or tactile as their major perceptual learning style and the majority of them had also chosen working in a group as their major learning style; 2) all the students had the same common reactions in terms of having difficulties in completing visual or auditory tasks, normal way of studying, and the abilities to make the new ways of visual and auditory techniques of learning work when introduced and practised in class. They also had the same negative reactions to incongruent styles.

J	Salehuddin, K; Hua, TK; Maros, M				Salehuddin, Khazriyati; Hua, Tan Kim; Maros, Marlyna			Definiteness And Indefiniteness: A Contrastive Analysis Of The Use Of Determiners Between The Malay Language And English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article								This paper aims to investigate the Malay language interference in the production of erroneous English structures among secondary ESL learners. The strong version of Contrastive Analysis claims that the differences between L1 and L2 structures results in negative transfer due to the transfer of old habits into new ones. However, this version of CA is only predictive in nature and is not always true. Errors made by learners give us better insights into the process of language learning. Thus, errors are now regarded as a very important tool for diagnostic purposes in language teaching. The procedure in carrying out this investigation follows Norrish's (1992) approach to conducting Error Analysis. This includes sample collection, identifying, describing errors, explaining and evaluating errors. The corpus of this research consists of 873 sentences, collected from 51 essay samples. There were 826 uses of determiners with 175 occurrences of errors. The subjects were Malaysian secondary school students who are learners of English as a second language. The results indicate that determiner is a possible problematic area for Malay learners of English. The different aspects of the incorrect use of English determiners that reflect the Malay grammar are related to specific places of location, instrument, countries as Adjectives, name of Subject, agreement to the Noun, and Cardinal numbers. The differences in the possessive forms in both languages also attributed to the errors.

This extensive bidirectional English-Polish corpus of original parliamentary contributions paired with professional simultaneous interpretations includes 11 European Parliament debates held between January 2016 and February 2020. The main topic of these debates is the rule of law crisis triggered by the Law and Justice government in Poland. The corpus contains over 157,000 tokens and about 20 h 45 min of recordings, counting both source and target texts. The two interpreting directions (English-Polish and Polish-English) are represented almost evenly. The annotation of the corpus completed so far includes mark-up information, POS tagging, labelling disfluency phenomena, and all forms of explicitating shifts. Manual annotation for personal deixis is in progress. An additional interesting feature is the speaker identification performed employing the X-vector method, which allowed us to identify 36 interpreters. We begin with an overview of the existing interpreting corpora. Then we proceed to explain the design features of the EP-Poland and report on two completed empirical studies analysing idiosyncratic interpreting behaviour. We conclude by outlining future development pathways and offering some remarks on corpus significance and its limitations.

J	Luporini, A				Luporini, Antonella			Metaphor, Nominalization, Appraisal: Analyzing Coronavirus-Related Headlines and Subheadings in China Daily and The Wall Street Journal	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						appraisal theory; conceptual metaphor; coronavirus; nominalization; presupposition		This paper focuses on two corpora of headlines and subheadings from news articles about the coronavirus, published in China Daily (CD) and in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) between January 7 and February 8, 2020. Applying Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and Systemic Functional Linguistics, particularly the nominalization framework (Halliday, 1997/2004) and Appraisal (Martin & White, 2005), the paper explores how the virus and actions taken against it are framed in the corpora through the use of metaphors, nominalizations, and evaluative language in general. Results highlight similarities in the metaphorical conceptualization of the virus/disease in the corpora, but also key differences in terms of framing. In China Daily, metaphor and nominalization function to frame the situation and the actions taken in mainly positive terms; conversely, in WSJ, the emerging outlook is predominantly pessimistic. The conclusive section takes stock of such differences, also in the light of the socio-cultural contexts in which they are embedded. Finally, remarks are made about the usefulness of the proposed theoretical and methodological approach, the main advantages being the holistic perspective on textual data emerging from the combination of metaphor and nominalization analysis - as the two phenomena often work synergistically and systematicity brought about by integrating the appraisal framework into metaphor studies. At the textual and contextual level, the relevance of the findings lies in their contribution to a deeper understanding of different national responses, and their media representation, at the onset of the coronavirus crisis.

J	Mahmood, II; Kasim, ZM				Mahmood, Israa Ismaeel; Kasim, Zalina Mohd			Metadiscourse Resources across Themes of Islamic Friday Sermon	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Metadiscourse; sermons; theme; Islamic Friday sermon; rhetorical device		Friday sermon is a formal speech delivered during the act of worship by the Muslims held before Friday prayer. It is a weekly event that involves disseminating information as well as persuading the congregation through preaching and teaching. In Friday sermons, as a rhetorical religious genre, religious orators usually try to convince an audience using different strategies and language devices such as metadiscourse. Metadiscourse is a rhetorical strategy used to achieve persuasive and communicative purposes as it helps writers (speakers) to engage their audience and guide their understanding of a text. To get insights into how metadiscursive devices contribute to the theme of a sermon, the current study aimed to examine the distribution of rhetorical devices frequency in three themes (belief, practice, and spiritual) of Islamic Friday Sermon (IFS) delivered in English. To achieve the aim of this study, Hyland's (2005) interpersonal model of metadiscourse was adapted to analyse metadiscourse devices that were deployed in thirty sermons (10 per theme) delivered between 2012 and 2018. The findings reveal the dominant presence of metadiscourse in the sermons of practice/action theme. This indicates the vital role of metadiscourse features in the nature of sermons as a teaching method. Revealing the status of MD rhetorical devises in three different themes can help raise awareness among orators on the appropriate use of MDMs to support the theme of a sermon and make their speeches meaningful, coherent and persuasive.

J	Sultan; Rapi, M				Sultan; Rapi, Muhammad			Positive Discourse Analysis of the Indonesian Government Spokesperson's Discursive Strategies during the Covid-19 Pandemic	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						positive discourse analysis; Covid-19; discursive strategies; government communication; pandemic	COMMUNICATION; DYSPHEMISM; SOLIDARITY	The Covid-19 pandemic that is sweeping across the globe has caused increased anxiety. Studies in linguistics have found a variety of language expressions that convey people's anxiety and fear. However, there are only a few researchers that studied the use of language used in communication by the government, to enhance the citizens' morale and help them recover from psychological distress from the Covid-19 pandemic. This study focused on investigating the discursive strategies used by the Indonesian government spokesperson at daily press conferences during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study employed the Positive Discourse Analysis (PDA) framework. A total of 28 recorded press conference sessions that lasted between 25-45 minutes were analyzed through the identification, interpretation, and explanation stages. Identification was carried out through careful reading of the transcription of the government spokesperson's speech to find out the discursive strategy used by the spokesperson. The interpretation was done by grouping similar quotes with the same themes, based on the context of the discourse. The explanation was done by explaining, in a macro way, the situational aspects and social contexts that provide the background for the texts' production and relating them to the pandemic. The results of the study showed that the spokesperson made use of nomination, predication, argumentation, perspectivization and intensification, and mitigation strategies to deliver information to the public. The entire discursive strategies are used to improve the public's optimism and build solidarity of the citizens as a moral force to face the pandemic.

J	Joharry, SA; Turiman, S				Joharry, Siti Aeisha; Turiman, Syamimi			Examining Malaysian Public Letters to Editor on COVID-19 Pandemic: A Corpus-assisted Discourse Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						COVID-19; Movement Control Order (MCO); corpus-assisted discourse analysis (CADS); corpus linguistics; critical discourse analysis		Around the world, people are now facing an unprecedented situation with the COVID-19 virus pandemic. With numerous countries announcing various modes of self-quarantine and social distancing, the Malaysian government has initially called for a 3-week Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning mid-March 2020. In this paper, we explore how citizens in Malaysia respond to such crises by examining letters that were submitted during the MCO period to The Star Online the nation's leading English online news portal. Using corpus linguistics techniques, 227 letters were firstly investigated for recurrent words/phrases used on how people talk about issues during this time. A critical discourse analysis on these recurring patterns of language was then employed to further examine their occurrences in this corpus, following Carvalho's (2008) analysis of media discourse. This, we contend as being the synergy between corpus methods and classic CDA that contribute to the corpus-assisted discourse analysis (CADS) approach. Results yield Malaysians' view on the matter that could describe in so far as how the country is coping with the pandemic at the time. More specifically, letters that have mostly referred to COVID-19 pandemic as being a challenge and associating it with negative expressions are in fact emotionally charged, revealing how public letters written by citizen journalists provide a much more comprehensive view of public stance on COVID-19 in Malaysia.

J	Marra, D; Quinn, M; Blamires, LA				Marra, Daniel; Quinn, Marie; Blamires, Luiz Arthur			Semantic Change in Portuguese: Considering Cerrado and Vereda	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Semantic Change; Lexicon; Metaphor/Metonymy; Portuguese language	METAPHOR; METONYMY	This paper highlights the process by which meaning instantiates itself in word formation and discusses how semantic change installs subsequently in them, in this case, the Portuguese words cerrado and vereda. These two words have long individual histories that can be tracked back to their Latin or Celtic etymons, cerrado rooted in the origin of the Latin verb serare, which gave origin to the Portuguese verb cerrar (to close, to seal) and vereda (narrow path) derived from the Latin word veredus (horse), which has its root in the Celtic word voredos. Yet, in the modern Brazilian context, Cerrado designates a particular ecosystem, the second largest biome in the country, that of short, closely-packed trees and foliage, and Vereda, a verdant subsystem of the same ecosystem. The discussion tracks the linguistic movement to arrive at these current meanings, showing how understanding the "history" of a word helps to understand both the uniqueness of its morpho-phonological and semantic constitution, as well as that of its relationship with the object it designates in the empirical world.

J	Huang, Y; Hashim, A				Huang, Yan; Hashim, Azirah			A Quantitative Study of Chinese Learners' Identities as Reflected in Their Attitudes Toward English Accents	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						attitude; accent; identity; English as a lingua franca; mainland China	ATTAINED PROFICIENCY; EFL LEARNERS; LANGUAGE; PRONUNCIATION; 2ND-LANGUAGE; WILLINGNESS; COMMUNICATE; VARIETIES; TEACHERS; SPEAKER	Once an asset owned exclusively by native English speakers (NESs) in inner circle, the native English speaking norms, specifically the standard varieties of British and American English, have been taken for granted as models for non-native English speakers (NNESs) in outer and expanding circles to imitate and approximate to. But this paradigm is under severe attack given the fact that people who use English as a lingua franca (ELF) have far outnumbered NESs. This paper aims to show how Chinese tertiary-level second language (L2) learners perceive different English accents and how their perceptions were related to their identities within the framework of ELF. By means of an online questionnaire survey, data from 574 English major students were retrieved and analysed with the assistance of SPSS 20.0 and Nvivo 11.0. The current study focuses on ambivalence in respondents' attitudes toward different English accents. On the one hand, there was an obvious bias towards NES norms and accents and a strong bias against Chinese-accented English and other NNES accents; on the other hand, there was an emergence of linguistic rights and learner identity experienced by some respondents, which demonstrated itself in highlighting pragmaticity in communication, endorsing L1-accented Chinese identity, and questioning benchmark roles accorded to NES accent standards. The implication of the current study is to acknowledge an urgency of addressing the controversies between the linguistic reality and the prescriptive standards, and between the respondents' hidden appeals for projecting their identity via L1-accented English and highly-acclaimed NES accent models.

J	Silvestre-Lopez, AJ				Silvestre-Lopez, Antonio-Jose			Conceptual Metaphor in Meditation Discourse: An Analysis of the Spiritual Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Meditation; spirituality; discourse; metaphor; qualitative analysis		Meditation has spread beyond the frontiers of religion to go global in other areas of social practice, including secular and spiritual-but-not-religious contexts. Conceptual metaphor, as proposed by Lakoff (1993) has been described as a powerful mechanism to facilitate the communication of first-person experiences connected to religious and lay contemplative practice, including meditation and enlightenment, as reported in several studies. Despite the detachment of the spiritual-but-not-religious movement from other areas of practice, the question of how metaphor is used in discourse about meditation within this perspective has not been addressed. This paper investigates the role of conceptual metaphor in spiritual-but-not-religious meditation discourse through a bottom-up qualitative analysis of a corpus of talks about meditation given by three highly-recognized spiritual teachers. Results chart the topics that are addressed more frequently through metaphor in the corpus (metaphor target domains), describe the range of areas of experience (source domains) used to characterise metaphorically the three most frequent target domains (THOUGHT, THE PRESENT MOMENT, MEDITATOR), and discuss fundamental differences in non-deliberate and deliberate conceptual metaphor use with the help of a selection of examples from the corpus. The findings provide evidence of relevant metaphors used to model the experience and practice of meditation in spiritual-but-not-religious settings and how they are rendered in discourse. Comparisons with metaphorical models already identified in religious and secular discourse contexts are also established, with a special focus on the models that have been transferred from traditional religious meditation spheres to current contexts of social practice.

J	Quinto, EJM; Macayan, JV				Mansarate Quinto, Edward Jay; Veran Macayan, Jonathan			Exploring English Speaking Anxiety Among Filipino Engineering Students: Its Influence on Task Performance and Its Sources	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						speaking anxiety; debilitative anxiety; task performance; engineering education; explanatory sequential	MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH; MATHEMATICS ANXIETY; MOTIVATION; IMPACT	The need for effective English speaking skills in engineering fields compels schools to innovate curricula that shall address the language skills of a 'global engineer.' The impact of engineering curricular reforms trickled down among students who contend with language learning anxiety, besides anxiety from mathematics and other technical courses. In this paper, the researchers explored English speaking anxiety among 162 engineering students in an engineering University in Manila, Philippines. A mixed-method, explanatory sequential design was used. This method combines the quantitative and qualitative approaches in investigating the phenomenon under study, i.e., English speaking anxiety. In the quantitative phase, the researchers used data from the speaking component of a self-developed scale and speaking performance scores yielded from an interactive English conversation task. Analysis revealed a significant negative relationship between speaking anxiety and speaking task performance, pointing to the debilitative influence of anxiety on task performance. In the qualitative phase, semi-structured interviews among nine purposefully selected students revealed that both peers and teachers were common sources of speaking anxiety and in a variety of ways. The findings point to speaking anxiety as an important psycho- and sociolinguistic phenomenon, which is hinged on the specific roles that language teaching and learning plays in preparing engineering students as future language consumers and users in highly technical, specialized, and competitive engineering fields.

J	Loan, NTT				Nguyen Thi Thuy Loan			A Case Study of Teacher Feedback on Thai University Students' Essay Writing	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Error correction; Teacher feedback; Essay writing; Thai student; EFL writer	WRITTEN CORRECTIVE FEEDBACK; ERROR-CORRECTION; SLA	The effectiveness of written feedback on writing is influenced by various variables, including students' proficiency levels, prior learning experiences, expectations and educational contexts. Although Thai students are reported to have serious problems in English writing, which are partly caused by their culturally-based English learning styles, few studies have been conducted to find out how teachers assist them through their feedback. This study thus reports on the practice of teacher feedback in terms of its forms, locations, types and purposes with a consideration of several influential factors in an essay writing class at a university in Thailand. Furthermore, the levels of the students' reactions to the teacher feedback, the effects of their revisions and their revision strategies were also examined. To learn about these students' opinions on the effectiveness of the feedback strategies employed, a survey with the whole class and a focus-group interview were also conducted at the end of the course. The results showed the students' active engagement in responding to the teacher feedback, and this tends to assert the crucial roles of teachers' knowledge of students' learning experiences, English proficiency levels, feedback preferences and classroom settings on the success of written corrective feedback. Though the findings might not be generalized in other EFL settings, they show how in-service teachers adjust feedback strategies in their actual teaching situations to prepare EFL students to become self-regulating writers.

J	Shin, C; Mangku, H; Collins, JT				Shin, Chong; Mangku, Hendrikus; Collins, James T.			The Language Choices of the Muslim Penan Community in Sarawak	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						The Muslim Penan; Bintulu Language; Penan Language; Domain		The Penan ethnic group who resides in Sarawak has frequently been stereotyped as a nomadic, pagan and poor tribe of the interior. However, based on recent research many ethnic Penans live throughout the coastal area, in particular in the Niah, Suai and Kemena river valleys. This paper focuses on the Catholic and Muslim Penans in Suai Jambatan village. These two communities of ethnic Penans each with an allegiance to a different language and a different religion, i. e. the Penan Muslim speak Bintulu language meanwhile the Chatolic or Pagan Penans still maintained Penan as their mother tongue. The existence and manipulation of four languages in this village presents a complex sociolinguistic environment. This paper aims to describe the language choices they make in this complicated multilingual setting. The data were collected by using the participation observation and face to face interview method based on Fishman's approach (1971). The researcher of this study has stayed a month in the field to collect the data. He involved in the villager's daily activities and observed their language choices. This study has determined that domains plays important roles in language selections. For example, they choose the language associated with their Muslim identity, i. e. the Bintulu language; while the Penan and Iban language remains the alternative language for daily communication. The implication of this study is it has reappraised the concept of Malay language selection and Islam convertion. In this case, the Penan Muslim tend to choose other "Moslem language" rather than Malay language.

The knowledge of these words is vital for comprehension and communication purposes, particularly among university students, to enable them to engage with authentic complex input, such as textbooks and journal articles. Limitation of academic vocabulary in their mental lexicon may restrict students 'comprehension to grasp the academic concepts they are learning. The current study investigated Malaysian English as a Second Language (ESL) undergraduates' knowledge of academic words, based on Coxhead's (2000) Academic Word List (AWL). The AWL consists of academic words commonly used in academic texts across four general disciplines of studies namely arts, commerce, law, and science. The list consists of 570 word families categorised in 10 sub lists based on frequency and range. One hundred and eleven first year undergraduates with different levels of English language proficiency and from different academic disciplines at a research university in Malaysia participated in this study. Data were collected using a questionnaire, which comprised a list of words derived from the AWL. Findings show that AWL words from sub lists 8 until 10 (which consist of low frequency and low utility academic words) had the highest percentage of unknown AWL words reported by students compared to the other sub lists. The distributions of unknown academic words reported were also different among students with regards to their academic disciplines and English language proficiency. Although the findings in general are rather evident, identifying unknown academic word among undergraduates from different academic programmes is significant to instructors and learners so as to enable them to focus on the right words during valuable class and independent study time.

Prior to this, the translation of metaphors has been conducted through the conventional translation theory. Following the increasing interest in discussing metaphors using the cognitive approach, this paper investigates how the cognitive approach can be used to describe this issue from a different perspective at a macro level. To this end, three Malay novels namely Salina, Ranjau Sepanjang Jalan and Angin Timur Laut and their respective French versions namely Salina, Le Riz and Le Vent de Nord-Est were used in this study. All six novels formed a Malay-French Bilingual corpus. Through Metaphorical Pattern Analysis methods (Stefanowitsch, 2006), six linguistic metaphors were selected for the purpose of discussion. Focus was given on linguistic metaphors that show the metaphors of LIFE as LIFE IS A JOURNEY, LIFE IS WAR and LIFE IS A STRUGGLE. This study was based on the cognitive approach proposed by Kovecses (2005). Results of the analysis conducted on the six data suggest that there are differences in the word forms used in Malay and French. However, from the perspective of literal and figurative meaning as well as the conceptual metaphors used, only one sample of the JOURNEY concept was different; the five others maintained the meanings and the conceptual metaphors.

Discussions of the word al-Kafur in Arabic language can be found in the fields of Arabic philology, hadith, Quranic interpretation, lexicography and Arabic poetry. There were disagreements among Arab-Islamic scholars in determining the meaning of word al-Kafur. Some of them refer to it as cinnamomum camphora, some refer to it as the oleander tree, while others gave it other meanings. The factor that led to the dispute among Arab-Islamic scholars was due to the fact that word al-Kafur in the Quran carries the meaning of blessings in heaven. This study aims to elucidate the meaning of the word al-Kafur as described in the Quran. The study adopted a qualitative approach, which used the library search method in data collection and analysis. In an effort to achieve substantial data, the discussion involved the use of the world al-Kafur in different context as used in the interpretations of Quran, hadiths and Arabic poetry. This study also used comparative data from the fields of agricultural science and Islamic medical sciences. Finding from this study showed that the closest interpretation of the world al-Kafur as described in the Quran is cinnamomum camphora. This study has dissolved the conflict in understanding the Quranic verse and rejects allegations of imperfections in the content of the Quran.

J	Jeyaraj, JJ				Jeyaraj, Joanna Joseph			It's A Jungle Out There: Challenges In Postgraduate Research Writing	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						postgraduate research writing; writing challenges; academic writing; thesis writing; EAP writing	INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE-STUDENTS; HIGHER-EDUCATION; PHD STUDENTS; ENGLISH; MALAYSIA; DIFFICULTIES; SUPERVISION; EXPERIENCES	Literature in English for academic purposes and postgraduate education suggests that research writing is challenging for students and acts as a barrier to timely completion. In Malaysia, postgraduate numbers are steadily increasing, yet high attrition rates remain a significant problem. Research into thesis writing appears to be an area that is slowly beginning to grow among Malaysian scholars, however most studies focus on public higher education institutions in the country. This study seeks to provide a voice for students from an off-campus university in Malaysia by investigating their writing experiences. The aim was to explore research writing challenges because there seemed to be a lack of any formalised structure which supported the writing process in this institution. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with six full-time postgraduate research students from non-native English-speaking backgrounds and data were analysed using a general inductive approach. It was found that academic language demands were challenging, and this affected writing and disciplinary socialisation. Additionally, some students felt there was an absence of clear direction in writing. Finally, isolation was experienced and resulted in a need to reach out to other communities. These findings reveal the diverse needs of students; if addressed, more timely completion rates and greater student learning experiences may be achieved.

J	Rashid, SMM; Yasin, MHM; Ashaari, NS				Rashid, Syar Meeze Mohd; Yasin, Mohd Hanafi Mohd; Ashaari, Noraidah Sahari			The Use of Malaysia Sign Language in Al-Fatiha Translation	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Malaysian Sign Language; Surah Al-Fatihah; people with hearing impairment; perception; understanding and appreciation	DEAF	Sign language is a form of communication used by the hearing impaired (GKUP) because the use of sign language facilitates the communication of hearing impaired people and gives them an opportunity to express their feelings, opinions, ideas, feelings and so forth. The Malaysian Sign Language (BIM), according to Lim (2006) is the main language for hearing impaired people in Malaysia. The present study, therefore, aims to identify the use of BIM in the translation of surah Al-Fatihah. This study involves 10 people with hearing impairment who are skillfull in applying BIM in the translation of surah Al-Fatihah. Surah Al-Fatihah is chosen for this study because this Surah is the first Surah in the Quran. This study was conducted through semi-structured interviews and the findings show that there are two perceptions held by people with hearing impairment on the importance of BIM in Surah Al-Fatihah translation. Firstly, BIM is able to provide understanding on the translated meaning of the Surah Al-Fatihah to the hearing impaired person. Secondly, the use of BIM has enabled the hearing impaired people to appreciate the translated surah al-Fatihah. Therefore, it is proven that the use of BIM has a great impact on the learning of Quran among the hearing impaired people.

The lack of guidelines for assessing the suitability of textbooks for their audiences is a major constraint which has prompted this study. This study aims to identify the manner in which linguistic features are used in Arabic texts and the correlation between linguistic features and text readability. This study paves the way for the development of methods which can be used to measure textbooks readability. 315 samples of 100-word texts were selected at random from 105 form one to form five Dini Curriculum textbooks. The linguistic features analysed were common and frequent words, abstract words, simple sentences, complex sentences, noun clauses, average sentence length and conjunctions and discourse markers. These features were analysed using descriptive analysis, and Pearson correlation. The findings revealed that the use of simple sentences was at a low level followed by complex sentences and noun clauses at a moderate level. The level of complex sentences was higher than simple sentences and was consistent with the form levels with the exception of noun clauses. The use of common and frequent words was at a high level across all forms (form one to form five). The use of abstract words was at a low level and was not consistent with the order of the forms. Conjunctions and discourse markers were at a high level in form one texts and at a moderate level in form two to form five texts. Average length of sentences was at a high level across all forms. The Pearson correlation analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between complex sentences, common and frequent words, conjunctions and discourse markers and the level of text readability level. There was a significant positive correlation between the average length of sentences and the level of readability. This study paves the way for future research aimed at developing methods for measuring the readability of Dini Curriculum Arabic texts using linguistic features as a key indicator.

J	Behrooz, N; Pirnajmuddin, H				Behrooz, Niloufar; Pirnajmuddin, Hossein			The Ridiculous Sublime in Don DeLillo's White Noise and Cosmopolis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Don DeLillo; White Noise; Cosmopolis; the sublime; the ridiculous		The sublime figures significantly in Don DeLillo's novels. Transformed into what has been termed postmodern sublime - disposing of transcendence in favor of immanence - it is considered to be more of a hollow, confusing and overwhelming phenomenon rather than an elevating and empowering one. Moreover, the multiplicity of prior representations and the exhaustion of the possible have undermined the authenticity and power of the sublime, turning it into pseudo-sublime and mock-sublime. As such, it has moved ever closer to the realm of the ridiculous to the point where it is rather a question of co-existence and co-implication between them rather than an opposition. This can be phrased the ridiculous sublime. This paper focuses on DeLillo's White Noise (1984) and Cosmopolis (2003) by drawing on major theorists of the sublime like Kant, Jameson, Zizek and, most notably, Lyotard, in an attempt to shed light on the modality of the merging of the sublime and the ridiculous. Our analysis shows that in DeLillo's fiction, White Noise and Cosmopolis, the events and phenomena that transpire to convey a sense of sublimity are almost always interrupted and tarnished by an implication of the grotesque and the ridiculous. This transformation of the concept of the sublime reflects the decline of metanarratives and the exhaustion of possible experiences as the hallmarks of the postmodern era.

J	Sultan, FMM; Ramli, MR				Sultan, Fazal Mohamed Mohamed; Ramli, Mohd Romzi			The Pronouns in Mendriq Language	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						pronouns; Mendriq; descriptive analysis; Orang Asli; Austroasiatic		Orang Asli are the minority groups who were the first natives in Malaysia. They were the first race to inhibit this country about 100 thousand years ago and spoke languages under the Austroasiactic group. One of the languages that attract the researchers is the Mendriq language. Mendriq language is a language used by Orang Asli who are known as Mendriq. These groups dwelled at Kuala Lah, Gua Musang, Kelantan. However, this language is spoken by a total of 245 people only, in three villages known as Kampung Kuala Lah, Kampung Baru and Kampung Kuala Stail. This paper discusses and analyzes the pronouns of Mendriq language. This is a field study conducted at Kuala Lah for 6 months. The data are primary data collected from the native speakers. The data were collected through story telling method by a native speaker of the Mendriq language. Data were then translated by a translator appointed by the Department of Orang Asli, Kelantan. Data consisted of various types of sentences. However, this study focuses on the pronouns of Mendriq language. The pronouns are analysed descriptively. The descriptive analysis revealed that the pronouns have two properties. The first property is that the pronouns have all the three functions; as subjects, objects and possessives or at least two of the mentioned functions. The second function is that the pronouns can only function as subject or object, or possessive only. But each of these types of personal pronouns do represent the first, second and third person pronouns.

J	Nordin, MZF				Nordin, Munif Zarirruddin Fikri			'Ilm al-Tafsir and Critical Discourse Analysis: A Methodological Comparison	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						religious language; religious discourse analysis; comparative discourse analysis; 'ilm al-tafsir; critical discourse analysis		The methodology of 'Ilm al-Tafsir and the methodology of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) highlight the similarities and differences in leveraging the text as research data beyond the level of the text's structure. Questions on similarities and differences between methodologies are addressed in the present study. This study, therefore, compares the similarities and the differences between the methodology of 'Ilm al-Tafsir and the methodology of CDA. Based on the comparison, the present study also constructs a religious discourse analysis model. The selected methodology of 'Ilm al-Tafsir is al-Sabuniy's in Safwat al-Tafasir (1979), while the chosen methodology of CDA is Fairclough's 3D (1992; 1995). The universal principle of discourse and the linguistic goals in the philosophy of language is applied in the analysis. Similarities and differences were identified in the production, meaning and interpretation. The findings strongly suggest that the two methodologies have circumstances which lead to the use of language, the production of language, the features of texts, the nature of meaning and the means of interpretation. One of the main focuses of the comparison is on the differences that constitute barriers to the adoption of CDA for religious discourse analysis, specifically the critical approach towards the sickle and the fixed elements. The obstacles to this alternative are presented in order to prove that there is a linguistic approach that is capable of linking language with social elements. The findings thus have implications for the relatively new methodology of religious discourse in linguistic studies.

J	Pey, KC; Min, LH; Wah, LL				Pey, Khor Ching; Min, Low Hui; Wah, Lee Lay			Relationship between Oral Reading Fluency and Reading Comprehension among ESL Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						reading; ESL; fluency; comprehension; assessment	PROSODY; MATTER	Fluency is one of the five components of reading competency alongside with phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary and comprehension. It is related to reading comprehension and it can be used to predict the reading competency of a reader. However, research on such relationship is limited in ESL context. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between three sub-skills of fluency (accuracy, reading rate and prosody) and reading comprehension among a sample of ESL students in a Malaysian school. It also aims to examine the concurrent validity of using the objective (i. e. reading accuracy and rate) and subjective (reading prosody) measures of fluency. It is hoped that the findings could shed light in identifying the possible methods of assessing oral reading fluency in ESL classrooms. The participants were 67 lower secondary school students who learn English as their second language. The students completed a reading comprehension test and then they were asked to read aloud the texts used in the test, individually. The individual reading sessions were audio recorded for the analysis of three sub-skills of reading fluency. Bivariate correlation analysis was then conducted to measure the strength of relationships with reading comprehension. The results revealed that all three sub-skills of fluency were strongly correlated with reading comprehension. Both objective (accuracy and reading rate) and subjective (prosody) rating scales were strongly related, and thus could be used in parallel or interchangeably in the assessment of oral reading fluency. The findings provided evidence that in line with the research findings in English as the first language contexts, reading fluency is closely associated with reading comprehension in an ESL context.

This study was framed by the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) of language learning, Keller's (1987) Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction (ARCS) Model and the Social Cognitive Model of Motivation (SCMM). The motivational design of the system and the prevalent types of motivation facilitated by the system were measured using two sets of questionnaires (i.e. the adapted versions of WebMac Sr. 4.0 and Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ)) and a focus group interview. Findings from the study support the prediction that LitOSS would significantly enhance students. motivation to learn literature due to its highly motivating design. It was also discovered that not only did the system promote self-efficacy and a high control of learning, it also motivated the students extrinsically and intrinsically.

GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						feminism; womanism; stiwanism; motherism; nego-feminism		In its four decades of rebirth, the world has debated ( enough) the relevance of feminism, but there is, surprisingly, refreshingly emergent dimensions at the turn of the twenty-first century: feminisms from feminism flowing from Africa. The theories or models of Womanism, Stiwanism, Motherism, and Nego-feminism, with their underlying assumptions and values, were all born at various end times of the twentieth century with a common objective of seeking gender justice. This paper examines the crucial question of how relevant these models are to the global practice of woman as human. What propels their separateness, and why didn`t they combine to make a more solid stance on the plight of the African woman? In fact, why can`t they simply identify with the general feminism? Put differently, are they dwelling in the same terrain or are they separable and easily recognisable discourses duelling in possibilities for the woman in Africa in particular and the woman of the globe in general? More specifically, how (ir) relevant are African feminisms? In trying to answer these questions, the paper presents a critical review of the afore-mentioned theories of African feminisms with the goal of providing readers an understanding of what is new in each model, and what is similar or different between the various strands of African feminisms. The paper concludes with the author`s analysis of the model that holds the best promise or possibilities for African feminism to achieve its seemingly elusive goal of gender equality.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of learning materials in the context of learning oral Arabic at UiTM. It is a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative study using questionnaires, interviews and classroom observations. For quantitative data, stratified random sampling technique was used involving 455 students and 48 course lecturers while for qualitative data, 13 interviews with students, 8 interviews with subject lecturers and 12 classroom observations were engaged. The study found that the textbooks were the only learning material that had been highly used compared to other materials, showing that learning was primarily based on the textbooks. This study suggests some improvements in the use of learning materials such as to use authentic materials through computer and Internet. The textbooks have to be used as a guide and not as a final objective of learning. The use of learning materials has to support students' interest, their needs and motivation. They also have to be given freedom to select materials according to their needs and interest.

J	Salehuddin, K; Winskel, H; Maros, M				Salehuddin, Khazriyati; Winskel, Heather; Maros, Marlyna			The Pragmatic Functions Of Numeral Classifiers In Modern Malay Written Corpus	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Malay; numeral classifiers; referentiality; definiteness; pragmatic functions		Numeral classifiers are primarily used to provide semantic information about the physical and functional properties of objects, the cognitive categories of objects in a particular culture, and the perceptions of the speakers within a particular speech community towards the objects. Numeral classifiers of Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese and Thai have been found to perform pragmatic functions as well. To identify if Malay does use numeral classifiers to perform a number of pragmatic functions, we analysed a 73,000-word modern Malay corpus targeted at both adult and young audience. Results indicate that in the modern Malay corpus, the Malay numeral classifiers perform several pragmatic functions in various contexts: they function as anaphoric and cataphoric references, as indicators of definiteness and indefiniteness, and as foregrounding mechanisms in modern Malay discourse. Using twelve instances of numeral classifier usage and omission in the modern Malay corpus, this study proposes that the absence of numeral classifiers in texts is not likely to be due to language users' ignorance of the need to use a numeral classifier or of the correct form of numeral classifiers. On the contrary, the absence of numeral classifiers in the corpus exhibits the Malay language users' knowledge of the pragmatic functions of Malay numeral classifiers.

J	Manqoush, R; Yusof, NM; Hashim, RS				Manqoush, Riyad; Yusof, Noraini Md.; Hashim, Ruzy Suliza			The Use Of Historical Allusion In Recent American And Arab Fiction	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						allusion; affirmation; opposition; 9/11; terrorism; Iraq; America		In this paper, we analyse John Updike's Terrorist (2006) and Mohammad Ismail's Desert of Death and Peace (2005) with the aim of examining the use of allusion in the depiction of 9/11 acts and the US occupation of Iraq. The comparison of the two novels, selected from two different literary traditions, enables us to explore American and Arab viewpoints of recent history. By appropriating the discussions of Gerard Genette, Michael Leddy, William Irwin, John Campbell and Allan Pasco on the use of allusion in literature, we argue that when authors allude to history in their works, they either employ allusion to affirm or oppose certain notions. In other words, there are two main strategies of allusion: affirmation and opposition. Updike alludes to history to affirm that Arab terrorists are the main enemies of the USA and also to oppose the actions of those terrorists who give themselves the right to kill civilians. In contrast, Ismail asserts that the Iraqi and American people are equally victims of super-power Jews. Therefore, he exposes an opposition to the US occupation of Iraq and the irrational reaction of the US to 9/11. Both novels implicitly utilise 9/11 and the US occupation of Iraq but each one employs these incidents according to the viewpoint and cultural background of its author. Hence, the different employment of history reveals contestations of worldviews which are symptomatic of the ideological clashes between the East and West.

J	Machali, R; Nurhayati, I				Machali, Rochayah; Nurhayati, Ida			Challenging tradition: the Indonesian novel Saman	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						challenging tradition; magical realism; gender and sexuality; religious dimension		Indonesia has witnessed the birth of a new generation of (female) writers. Many of them are young, cosmopolitan female whose work often challenges tradition, and are quite radical at that. One such writer, Ayu Utami, had won an award for her first novel Saman. This novel has invited critics, particularly because the writer has challenged tradition, both in the theme and content as well as in narrative style. Themes such as sexuality, which had been considered taboo in the past, is explored and challenged in an almost blunt way. Her frequent references to female body parts have been most strikingly merged into her critical views on tradition. Also, her rejection of conventional ways of writing can be seen, for example, in her almost ' stubborn' way of switching from first person to third person on the same character in virtually the same paragraph. This, as many have said, would confuse readers. She concocts her challenges to tradition by intertwining the shifts in her narration. These two main aspects of Saman, ie content and narrative style are analysed in this article, with an emphasis on the first, as it is this aspect that most clearly reflects the writer's break from tradition.

J	Luesakul, P				Luesakul, Pasuree			Geocriticism and the exploration of Mexico City-Tenochtitl?n in Carlos Fuentes? Where the Air is Clear	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Geocriticism; Mexico City-Tenochtitlan; Carlos Fuentes; Where the Air is Clear; representation		Where the Air is Clear, or La region mas transparente (1958) in its original version, is an urban fiction of Mexico City structured from a postcolonial perspective by Carlos Fuentes, one of Latin American Boom authors. This literary biography of 1950s Mexico's capital is portrayed with a double complexity. On one hand, the modern but chaotic space is presented through a narrative fragmentation composed of a "chorus" of inhabitants from different social classes and neighbourhoods. On the other, the author depicts a total image of the megacity by highlighting its historical particularity: Mexico City was constructed by Spaniards precisely above the ruins of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztecs. This article proposes a study of the Boom's classic text with a novel approach from a geographical focus. The methodology utilized is Bertrand Westphal's Geocriticism (2007) that aims to explore a space's fictionalization from a multidisciplinary approach, in this case, literature, history and geography, and with the use of cartographic representations. This analysis is, thus, "mapped" from the perspective of Ixca Cienfuegos, an indigenous character with supernatural powers who explores the space of Mexico City-Tenochtitlan through two key years: 1951-the Dystopia of Mexico City where modernity cohabitates with antiquity, and prosperity with poverty- and 1519 -the Utopian past of Tenochtitlan before the landscape's transformation under Spanish colonization.

J	PourAli, S; Eslamieh, R; Chavoshian, S				PourAli, Soheyla; Eslamieh, Razieh; Chavoshian, Shohreh			Intersectionality Reading of Caribbean-American In-Transit Female Narratives: Kincaid's Lucy and Nunez' Boundaries	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Diaspora-intersectionality; Marginality; Outsider Within; Structural Intersectionality; Situated Intersectionality		While large bulk of recent scholarship has reflected growing attention to migration, there has been little focus on the evolving intersected marginalization and social inequalities of in-transit women in the host land. The present study addresses the evolving phenomena of intersectionality in the context of larger structures of racism, sexism, classism and the legacies of colonialism. Intersectionality refers to the interlocking oppression experience produced by the interaction of social, economic, political, cultural and racial factors. Intersectionality both as a concept and theory is to uncover the underlying interrelated and interconnected layers of dimensions including but not limited to race, class, gender, sex, ethnicity, age, nation and dis/ability which generate a distinct mode of oppression, subordination and inequality for an individual. In this study, the intersectionality related coined concept diaspora-intersectionality is presented to acknowledge the role of the overlapping interplay of interconnected factors in social exclusion, marginalization, class discrimination, genderization, and social locationality of diasporic female characters in the two Caribbean women writers' works: Jamaica Kincaid's Lucy (1987) and Elizabeth Nunez's Boundaries (2011).The authors have a number of themes in common, both Caribbean descent with hyphenated identity living alternately in the USA and the Caribbean. Their protagonists are also very similar; both immigrated to the West to earn professional experience and seek happiness. Both works abundantly overlap in portraying in -transit Caribbean females whose positionings in the host land are hardly affected by intersectional patterns resulting to translocational marginality, class-conscious exclusion and social inequality. Thereby, intersectionality theory is beneficially opted to explore how diaspora context shapes marginalized shifting identities and how dominant power systems construct and neutralize social injustice and inequality for diasporic intersected individuals in the narratives.

J	Hassanein, H				Hassanein, Hamada			Oppositions in Arabic Proverbs: A Lexicosyntactic Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Oppositions; Arabic; Proverbs; Syntagms; Frames; Functions	DISCOURSE FUNCTIONS; COOCCURRENCE; ANTONYMY	Human beings are claimed to have a strong tendency for structuring their thoughts in terms of binary oppositions (Lyons, 1977). Binary oppositions, both canonical and non-canonical, have cross-linguistically been shown to perform textual functions in language and discourse (Jones, 2002; Davies, 2012; Hsu, 2015; Aksehirli, 2018, among many others). This study examines the discourse functions of oppositions in a dataset of oppositional pairs extracted from a collection of Arabic proverbs. Drawing on a synergy of Jones's (2002), Davies's (2012), and Hassanein's (2018) syntagmatic typologies of antonymy and opposition, it tests the synergised typology on the dataset to quantify and exemplify the discourse functions of opposition therein and prove the interactivity of the syntactic environments. The study has shown ancillary opposition to be the preponderant function with far higher frequency distributions than the remaining ones. Two functions logged in Classical Arabic discourse (Hassanein, 2018) have also been logged in proverbial discourse. One function is subordination (one opposite is hypotactically appended to another) and the other is case-marking (both lexemes play oppositional case roles at syntactic and semantic levels). The analysis has also shown that the syntagmatic classification replicated in this study validates former classifications across languages, most notably English, Swedish, Japanese, Chinese, Serbian, Romanian, Turkish, and Persian. It has also been revealed that the syntactic frames of co-occurring oppositions play significant roles in proverbial categorisation and conceptualisation and support the argument that proverbs tend to pattern cultural units and schemas into parallel structural frames.

In Islam, the most fundamental religious text that Muslims refer to is the Qur'an. Appreciating and understanding the Qur'an are fundamental for the believers of Islam to understand their religion. The Qur'an was revealed in the Arabic language. Hence, the aim of the study was two-pronged. One was to understand the importance of possessing knowledge of Arabic among non-native speakers of Arabic to understand the Qur'an and the other was to identify how non-native speakers of Arabic use the knowledge of Arabic to understand the Qur'an. The study employed exploratory design. A semi-structured interview method was used to collect data from five non-native speakers of Arabic. The collected interview data were analysed through thematic analysis. Results revealed that there was a need to have knowledge in Arabic to understand the Qur'an. Findings also showed that that non-native speakers of Arabic comprehend the Qur'an in three ways. One was using the translation approach; another was the lexical approach and the final one was using the linguistics approach. Thus, this has pedagogical implication. The teaching and learning to comprehend the Qur'an can be conducted in Arabic for specific purposes classes. The focus is on the Classical Arabic which encompasses the three approaches.

Effects of Diglossia on Classical Arabic: Language Developments in Bilingual Learners	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Bialystok's model; classical Arabic; colloquial Arabic; diglossia	ACQUISITION	The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Arabic diglossia on the development of classical Arabic language acquisition amongst bilingual learners in a private school in Lebanon. The study compares the Arabic language (L1) performance to that of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in accordance with Bialystok's model. One hundred-forty participants; (n=140), ranged from five to eleven years of age, with a mean of eight years were sampled. A two-stage random sampling technique was applied, while ensuring that students with contrastive academic achievement were included within the study. The participants sampled for this correlational research were learners enrolled at a private middle school. Participants were given two standardized measures so as to establish the trend of development in oral skills for both classical and colloquial Arabic, determine the grade level at which convergence occurs between the two forms of acquisition and finally compare the degree of classical Arabic (L1) acquisition with respect to their EFL acquisition. The findings indicated interrelatedness between Arabic diglossia and the late oral development of classical Arabic, whereas participants showed a higher degree of comfort with English than with their mother language. Recommendations for future directions and research are also given.

J	Ramasamy, MD				Ramasamy, Mohana Dass			Irregular Behaviours of Coda /M/ in Tamil Reduplications	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Reduplication; TETU; Bilabial nasal deletion; Assimilation; Optimality Theory		In Reduplication, the Base and Reduplicant usually undergo various phonological changes to reconcile and harmonise them. Despite this general view, not many studies have attested to credibility of a single phoneme for its capacity of triggering various reactions, otherwise known as the emergence of the unmarked (TETU). A specific coda of such nature, bilabial /m/, in one of the Dravidian language Tamil is known for registering irregular reactions at the juncture of Base and Reduplicants, forcing the coda to trigger seven types of phonological reactions, a phenomenon that probably hard to witness in universal grammar. This study discusses the phonological and morphological reactions of reduplicative words as the consequences of TETU, which were resolved in language-specific ways, within Optimality Theoretic parameters. The results verify that as long as the conflicting markedness constraints do not interrupt reconciliation of reduplicative words in Tamil, the reconciliations take place systematically without markedness reduction or increase in reduplicant, except in reduplicative words ending with labial /m/. The reduplicants tend to reduce markedness of its prosodically weak position in many ways, while the same markedness is tolerated within the base words, in isolation or otherwise. It responds, at least, in seven different ways (in isolation or simultaneously) in reduplications, suggesting that the markedness reducing and markedness increasing should be addressed as a context-sensitive issue of reduplicant-base, in the lights of natural and prosodic phonology, collectively, but not in the absence of one against another, at least for the sensitive phonemic coda, like /m/, in hand.

J	Uni, K				Uni, Kazuhito			Connecting Kanji Radicals with their Malay Equivalents in Japanese Kanji Instruction to Native Malay-speaking Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Japanese; Kanji radical; Malay; similarity; vocabulary	LEARNERS	The current methods to teach Kanji characters in Malaysian Japanese-language textbooks limit students' understanding of the semantic link between the Kanji characters and their radicals. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of teaching Chinese characters (Kanji) using the major components (radicals), along with their Malay equivalents. This study proposed a method to connect the meaning of Kanji radicals with their Malay equivalents when teaching Kanji characters to native Malay speakers. A multiple-choice test was administered to 116 native Malay-speaking university students. They had no previous knowledge of the Japanese or Chinese languages. Participants studied a list of Malay words and their Japanese equivalents comprising 28 Kanji. Each Kanji pair in the list shared a common radical, and each pair of their Malay equivalents shared a common root. The control group was given a list of the spellings and pronunciation of same Japanese and Malay words but without the instructions regarding the semantic similarities between Japanese and Malay. Both groups were given 30 minutes to learn the Kanji and another 30 minutes to take an identical 28-question test. On average, the experimental and control groups scored 17.03 and 10.58, respectively (n = 116); therefore, at a 5% level, a significant difference was found between the scores for the two groups (p < 0.001, t = 8.10). A multiple linear regression indicated that the experimental group had an effect size of 6.4 more correct answers than the control group (df = 114, R-2 = 0.3651, p < 0.001). The results imply that the explicit presentation of the Kanji radicals and their Malay equivalents assisted native Malay-speaking students in learning Kanji including characters which consist of more than 10 strokes.

This study examines the level of use, of Arabic language collocation strategies among Arabic language students in public universities. For that purpose, a set of Likert scale questionnaires were distributed to Arabic language students studying in public universities, who are in their final year of study. This study uses simple random sampling. A total of 344 students from eight public universities participated in this study. The findings show that collocation learning strategies in Arabic language are dominant even though they are at a moderate scale of use. This study proposes a new Arabic collocation learning strategy based on recognition, mastery techniques (understanding, repetition, highlighting, dictionary, social and imagery) and applications. The findings also discovered that collocation learning strategies should be utilized by students especially with regards to the autonomous role in using specific strategies and techniques to enhance competency in the Arabic language, especially in collocation.

J	He, MY; Rahim, HA				He, Mengyu; Rahim, Hajar Abdul			Comparing Engagement Markers in Economics Research Articles and Opinion Pieces: A Corpus-based Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						engagement markers; research articles; opinion pieces; economics; ESP writing	STANCE; ENGLISH; READER	Engagement markers which are reader-oriented rhetorical features are used by writers to signal the presence of readers in their writing. As a key rhetorical feature, the use of engagement markers in academic writing has been explored in recent years. Despite this, few studies have compared their use in research articles and opinion pieces. In addition, studies on engagement markers have not drawn extensively on corpus methodology. Given this, the current study explores the use of engagement markers in economics research articles (henceforth RAs) and opinion pieces (henceforth OPs) based on corpus methods from two self-compiled corpora of RAs and OPs. The corpus analysis tool AntConc was used to generate data need for the analysis of engagement markers in the two genres based on Hyland's (2005b) framework of five types of engagement markers. The results of this study show that there is a higher occurrence of engagement markers in RAs than OPs. Among the different types of engagement markers, directives were predominantly employed by the writers in both genres. The use of engagement markers in RAs and OPs is discussed in relation to the target audiences and different communicative purposes of the two genres. These findings have important implications for English for Specific Purposes (ESP) writing.

Therefore, knowledge of the rhetorical structure (moves and steps) of article-based thesis (AT) is crucial for the successful completion of a thesis. This study then seeks to compare the rhetorical structures and linguistic realisations of thesis introduction chapter found in the Traditional (TT) and Article-based (AT) theses. To realise the objectives, 12 purposive selected PhD thesis introductions were analysed based on Bunton's (2002) move model. Using content analysis, the moves and steps in the introduction chapters were quantified for their frequency of use and then examined qualitatively for their linguistic realisations. The data revealed that both types of theses had obligatory and optional moves and steps. It was also found that the steps of move 3 in the article-based theses were slightly different from that in the traditional theses. For the linguistic realisations, it was shown that there were variations in the different moves and steps in TT and AT. Words such as paper and article were found in move 3 in AT but were absent in TT. The results have several pedagogical implications. They provide informed input on the structures of the two types of thesis to the writing instructors and writing curriculum writers. More importantly, the findings provide knowledge to student writers on the genre of AT, specifically its rhetorical structures and linguistic realisations.

J	Maheswari, VU; Sultana, AS				Maheswari, Uma, V; Sultana, A. Shahin			VLS Model for Content Words: An Experimental Study on Engineering Students in India	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						VLS Model; Content words; ESP; Engineering Science; L2 learners	VOCABULARY KNOWLEDGE; LEARNING-STRATEGIES; DEPTH	The resurgence of interest in vocabulary learning in the past two decades and research in Vocabulary Learning Strategies (VLS)since Schmitt's 1997 taxonomy have yielded a few other taxonomies and strategies to enrich the vocabulary of ESL learners. However, developing a VLS taxonomy or Model in ESP context has not been focused upon though the need for it has been studied and reported. Students from vernacular medium schools in ESL and EFL countries find it difficult to learn the content in colleges due to their limited knowledge of content vocabulary. Hence a new VLS Model for content words has been designed to render linguistic assistance to them. The efficacy of the Model has been tested in the context of Engineering Science. The proposed model is unique and specific for deriving strategies to learn content vocabulary in all branches of Science and Engineering. There is scope for diachronic, synchronic, and scientific study of words through Cognitive and Metacognitive strategies. Activities generated on this Model combine decontextualized Discovery strategy and contextualized Consolidation strategy. Eighty engineering college students in India took part in the study. The experimental group which received intervention based on the VLS Model outperformed the control group in the posttest. Hence this Model is advocated for enhancing the knowledge and use of ESP vocabulary and for helping learners understand their disciplinary field. It is believed that through appropriate VLS, the learners can be empowered to be autonomous in reading.	[Maheswari, Uma, V; Sultana, A.

J	Cerce, D				Cerce, Danica			The Aboriginal Intervention in Colonial Discourse: Challenging White Control of Cross-Racial Intersubjectivity	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Australian Indigenous poetry; socio-economic and political critique; destabilising whiteness; cross-racial intersubjectivity	ALF TAYLOR	Written against the background of critical whiteness studies, the article deals with the poetry of Romaine Moreton and Alf Taylor, two contemporary Aboriginal voices who are not yet widely recognised, although their work is powerful and compelling. They both use their medium to explore various aspects of indigeneity and to intervene in the public dynamics of racial separation. In their attempt to instil agency for the postcolonial Indigenous subject, they challenge what Sara Suleri (2003) calls "the static lines of demarcation" between colonial power and disempowered culture - the assumptions about such binary oppositions as domination and subordination, centre and margin, self and other, upon which the logic of coloniality often stands. In convening a cross-racial public, the rhetoric of the two poets' critique generates a discursive guilt in non-Indigenous readers and foregrounds the need for the intersubjectivity of race; that is, a zone of mutual respect and cooperation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.

J	Shabanirad, E; Dadkhah, M				Shabanirad, Ensieh; Dadkhah, Mahtab			A Foucauldian Study of Space and Power in Two Novels by Nadine Gordimer	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						foucault; power; space; resistance; Nadine Gordimer	SOUTH-AFRICA	This paper aims to study the relation between space and power in Nadine Gordimer's first novel of the apartheid regime, The Lying Days (1953) and her first novel of the postapartheid era, None to Accompany Me (1994) in the light of Michel Foucault's theory of space and power. The paper first introduces Gordimer and the concept of apartheid. Then, it states the common engagement of Foucault and Gordimer with the concepts of space and power in their work, the significance of the study and the limitations of the research. After offering the literature review, the researchers discuss Foucault's theories and his key concept of heterotopias (other spaces) and the relation between his ideas and apartheid. After that, drawing on the theoretical insights of Foucault, the researchers explore how Gordimer's selected novels display an ongoing and developing understanding of the importance of space as a way of explaining key questions of power, resistance and social organization and reflect on the geopolitics of apartheid and its policies of spatial control in South Africa. The researchers also explore how heterotopias as sites of social struggle and resistance challenge apartheid. The researchers examine space as a technique of control and domination, as well as a means of resistance.

J	Kasdan, J; Haroon, HA; Pa, NSC; Idrus, Z				Kasdan, Junaini; Haroon, Harshita Aini; Pa, Nor Suhaila Che; Idrus, Zuhairah			Partial Reduplication in Malay Terminology: A Socio-terminological Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						terminology; socio-terminology; the Malay mind; partial reduplication; term		Terms are formed to address the need for vocabulary in new or expanded knowledge. The question is how were terms developed before there were ever rules or formula? While opinions abound that many terms have been formed spontaneously, there must have been certain methodologies that were adopted in the coinage of terms. Research has shown that in the Malay community of yesteryear, one approach that has been used was to source from people's interaction with nature. The tradition does not stop among the ancient Malay community, but the same technique appears to have been used until the present day. For example, through the names of fauna such as sesibur (sibur-sibur), pepatung (patung-patung), lelais (lais-lais) or sesumpah (sumpah-sumpah); and flora such as deduit (duit-duit), bebaru (baru-baru), bebuas (buas-buas) or bebati (beti-beti), which have been used for a long time, new terminologies such as cecair, rerambut, tetikus, bebuli and tetingkap are used from a wide range of discipline, including engineering, science and technology. The structural similarity is certainly not a result of copying but is due to the adoption of particular formula that can be explained. This article presents aspects and patterns of partial reduplication in Malay terminology, explaining the link between knowledge and the coinage of terms. Our deliberation on the concept of the coinage, which is based on socio-terminological analysis, drawing from the data, analogies used, and philosophy as well as cognition of the Malay speaker, not only brings to the fore the Malay wisdom in the determination of terms, but also highlights the reasoning of the Malay mind. The analysis comprised of 1,087 partial reduplication terms found in the Science and Technology (S&T) corpus reveals that while the formation of the terms ensures the retention of their "Malayness", the coinage has not been done arbitrarily but has been based on structured patterns and system.

Instead these students seem more inclined to use technology for social rather than academic purposes. In Malaysia, the use of technology in learning English as Second Language (ESL) has generally been well received. However the characteristics of the "digital natives" have not been clearly defined until recently when Thang et al. (2014) undertook a study to investigate patterns of ICT use of students in a public university in Malaysia. Their findings are somewhat similar to those of other countries but they differ in that they found students show a preference for the teacher-centred approach. The current study extends on this by undertaking a study involving four different types of public universities. A questionnaire designed by the research team was used to collect data which were analysed quantitatively using SPSS. The findings revealed that students from all four universities generally felt that technology is useful for learning ESL. However, their usage is more for recreation than for learning ESL. It further revealed that the teachers used technology only moderately, but the students still felt that their teachers are competent in the use of technology. This shows their unwillingness to criticize their teachers openly. However, there were some variations which suggest that students from older research universities are more self-reliant and students from newer universities are more receptive to the use of technology for learning ESL.

This study is undertaken to explore the behaviours of a group of nine learners at a tertiary institution in Malaysia to see how they utilise both receptive as well as productive vocabulary learning opportunities meaningfully beyond their English language course. The theory of constructivism appertains, as the learning activity is active, constructive, cumulative and goal-directed. The participants. journal entries of one month were perused to enquire the various aspects of their learning experiences and what they did before, during and after English language class. Weekly retrospective in depth interviews were conducted with the participants, as well as their class lecturer. The study found that these learners lacked proactive attitude in seizing learning opportunities and were poor readers of English language materials. The study also found that the extent learners take learning opportunities is not solely dependent on their language proficiency, but more than that on learner confidence and their preferred learning style of non-verbal learning, hence dispelling the widely accepted belief that high proficiency learners are more proactive in their learning pursuits. In seizing learning opportunities at opportune moments, the major stumbling blocks are lack of transfer in learning as well as limited and untapped communication opportunities with the lecturer beyond class hours. This study shows that average and low ability learners can also embrace learning opportunities meaningfully with other moderating variables, such as a confident personality and adequate risk taking initiatives.

J	Termizi, AA				Termizi, Arbaayah Ali			"Un-Romanticized" Love in Anthony and Cleopatra and The Taming of the Shrew	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Bakhtin; Degradation; Festivity; Grotesque; Un-Romanticized Love		Among Shakespeare's plays revolving around the theme of love, Anthony and Cleopatra and The Taming of the Shrew develop an un-romanticized attitude by focusing on carnal realities, reinforced through the imagery associated with Cleopatra and Katherine as well as the banquet occasions. In these two plays, the theme of love acquires a carnivalesque approach through which debasement is experienced as a part of love rapports. This paper discusses grotesque representations of love and feasting in the plays by employing relevant viewpoints of the 'grotesque,' mainly those theorized by Mikhail Bakhtin. Accordingly, Bakhtinian idea of 'grotesque realism' and carnival as well as the concept of degradation related to bodily life are highlighted in their association with carnal realities as portrayed in the selected works. The aim of the study is to demonstrate how the theme of love is un-romanticized through the idea of grotesque. Furthermore, since Bakhtinian analysis targets the comic and regenerative in the grotesque, the elaborate choice of a comedy and a tragedy for this study is assumed to be an illuminating endeavor. Grotesque and its implicative denotation revolve around the concept of language and the discourse carried out by the intention of the characters. The elaboration of linguistic discourse in this study goes along with love ideology in a dramatic text. Thus, Bakhtin's conceptualization of grotesque facilitates the dramatic orientation of love in Anthony and Cleopatra and The Taming of the Shrew, whereby the theme of love gets un-romanticized in these plays.

J	Sa'd, SHT; Modirkhamene, S				Sa'd, Seyyed Hatam Tamimi; Modirkhamene, Sima			Examining Acculturation Model in an EFL Context: Learners' Attitudes towards Target Language Accent vs. L1 Accent	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						accent; acculturation model; attitudes; mother tongue accent; target language accent	ENGLISH; IDENTITY	According to Schumann. s (1986) Acculturation Model, accent acts as a means of the learner. s identification with either his/her mother tongue culture or the target language culture and affects his/her effort to learn English as a target Language. Taking up a critical stance, the present study, thus, aimed at investigating the role that learner attitudes and beliefs play in the language that learners adopt in their mother tongue (MT) or the target language (TL) (i.e., English) accent when speaking English in an instructed foreign language setting. The participants consisted of 213 Iranian male elementary EFL learners, aged 12 to 19 years. The data were elicited using a questionnaire consisting of both close-ended and open-ended questions, and were, furthermore, triangulated through focus-group interviews and class observations. The questionnaire required the participants to voice their opinions freely regarding the accent they assumed and preferred when using the target language and the reasons for their preferences. The findings revealed that 81.3% of the participants displayed strong preferences for the TL accent (i.e., English) while only 18.7% of the participants privileged speaking English with their MT accent. The rationale for the TL accent preference was found to be composed of nine categories with, intelligibility.,, beauty and effectiveness of TL accent., and, resemblance to native speakers and avoidance of mockery. cited as the most primary reasons. On the other hand, the major reason for assuming a MT accent was to reveal one. s identity through the MT accent. The study therefore highlighted the strong inclination among EFL learners to acculturate into the TL culture through assuming its accent.

J	Rajandran, K; Taib, F				Rajandran, Kumaran; Taib, Fauziah			Disclosing Compliant and Responsible Corporations: CSR Performance in Malaysian CEO Statements	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						corporate communication; CSR; CSR reports; CSR performance; CEO Statements; CDA	BUSINESS	In Malaysia, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is relatively new but corporations are required to engage in and disclose CSR. CSR reports are a common register for disclosure and their CEO Statements provide an overview of CSR performance in these reports. This article studies how language features in Malaysian CEO Statements disclose CSR performance. A corpus containing 27 CEO Statements from 2009 to 2011 from 10 Malaysian corporations was analyzed. The analysis was grounded in critical discourse analysis (CDA), which employed Social Actors and ATTITUDE from Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and interviews with corporate representatives to understand the ideology of CEO Statements. The analysis proposes three strategies of categorization, evaluation and chronology to disclose CSR performance because performance is oriented to four categories (community, environment, marketplace, workplace) and a positive evaluation, which are centered on the past. The disclosure reflects the ideology of CEO Statements, which promotes corporations as agents of positive social change. Through CEO Statements, corporations disclose compliance to the government and stock exchange and responsibility to their other stakeholders. CSR disclosure in CEO Statements helps to strengthen economic legitimacy through social legitimacy. This study is useful for people practicing and teaching corporate communication because it encourages them to consider the meaning implied by language features (evaluative and non-evaluative lexis, modifiers, tenses and prepositional phrases, besides exact numbers) in corporate registers. Yet, the corpus was limited to 27 CEO Statements and future research should expand the corpus to represent CEO Statements from other years, countries and languages.

In addition, the prominent language usage indicator in the discussion genre on television channels are evidence of a speech event. The speech event of a discussion on television has created a two-way interaction among the participants. Consequently, the existing social process requires a thorough examination of factors which influence politeness and communication strategy used by the participants. Communication strategies, which are connected to politeness, need to be marked by several factors, which among others are role and differences in social status. The denial of the influence of politeness factors and violation of communication strategies will only result in the participant's confusion on their understanding of a culture and its society. This research focuses on the discussion genre which is aired on the prime channel, TV 1, on Malaysia Radio and Television broadcasting (RTM). Thorough examination on the use of politeness factors and communication strategies which occur in this speech event have been conducted and data has been analysed and described according to the approach by Asmah Hj Omar. The objective of this study is to explain and describe factors that influence the use of communication strategies marked with politeness, in a television discussion genre. Three episodes based on Forum Hal Ehwal Islam, which discuss religious issues, were recorded. This study found that continuous communication strategies marked with politeness create effective communication in achieving the actual purpose of a discussion aired on television.

J	Aziz, AYA				Aziz, Adi Yasran Abdul			A Constraint-Based Analysis of Coda in Kelantan Dialect	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						phonology; constraint; Optimality; Kelantan dialect; coda condition		The uniqueness of the Kelantanese Malay dialect (DK) has been attracting a lot of optimality phonologists to study the dialect. This study aims to explain the aspect of Kelantan dialect phonotactics involving the syllabic coda position. Foregoing analysis has managed to display and describe some significant data for this study. Therefore, the same data will be used in this study. However, there is still confusion and conflicting views on the sound segment that are allowed to appear in the syllable coda position and its explanation based on the set of constraint hierarchy. This study has successfully resolved this problem by adopting the latest grammatical theory, that is, Optimality Theory propounded by Prince, Smolensky and McCarthy in 1993. This Optimality theory is still the main theory in linguistics until now. Based on the analysis, only the placeless features are allowed to occupy the position of Kelantan Dialect syllabic coda, which is [?, h, N]. In the Optimality theory, this phonotactic constraint is called CODACONDITION. In the Kelantan Dialect, CODACONDITION constraint dominated the other constraints.

Error Analysis In Learning Malay Language Among Foreign Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						error analysis; Malay language; foreign students; lexical errors; orthography errors		This study investigates lexical errors and classifies the phonological errors that are committed by foreign students in learning the Malay language as a foreign language at Multimedia University, Cyberjaya. Both the contrastive analysis approach and error analysis have been applied on written tests among 75 foreign students from Botswana, China, Iran and Indonesia. They have attended Malay Language classes (Bahasa Kebangsaan B) for a semester or fourteen weeks. Written tests and observations were used in the process of data collection for eight weeks. A total of 182 orthography errors were identified and grouped into five areas according to the level of difficulties. These include the numbers in words, followed by question words, simple communication words, personal pronouns, and finally greeting words. On the other hand, the most frequently found phonological errors involve the changes of letters with other letters. These errors occur differently according to demographic background, especially the country of origin and mother tongue. At the present stage, foreign students are generally passive in the learning of Malay language. The location of MMU as an English campus in Cyberjaya has also exposed students more to the English learning environment. In such scenario, the role of language teachers and motivation of learning are very important. In addition, preparation methods, reference materials and teaching activities to attract students should also be emphasized. Results and recommendations of this study are particularly vital for prospective teachers to be involved in the teaching of Malay language as foreign language. This study is in line with efforts to promote Malay Language in the international arena and, is complementary to the 10th Malaysia Plan that aims to attract 150,000 foreign students.

Data were collected from the text of "Kitab Kiliran Budi, Dictionary of Special Malay Proverb, 1001 Malay Proverbs, and the SPM Proverbs. Data were analyzed using Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (1929). The results show that the Malay proverbs have five aspects of Malay thoughts that cover philosophical categories of thought such as the existence (metaphysics), thinking about knowledge (epistimology), of human morality (ethics), of universal human reasoning (logic), and of beauty (aesthetics). The language of Malay proverbs has potrayed aspects of creativity and high thinking. The study also found that there is a relationship between language and thought in the Malay proverbs, as highlighted in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. In conclusion, this research has managed to reveal the high level of thinking and creativity of the Malay in the formation of the Malay proverbs using environment and nature as its base.Malay thoughts are conveyed in explicit and implicit Malay proverbs. The Malay proverbs also highlight the social, moral values, and customs and the philosophy of the Malays that are associated with metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic and aesthetics which reflect their interactions with their surroundings.

J	Lide Abu Kassim, N				Kassim, Noor			Judging Behaviour And Rater Errors: An Application Of The Many-Facet Rasch Model	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						rater error; judging behaviour; Many-Facet Rasch Model; performance assessment; validity		Of the potential sources of construct irrelevant variance or unwanted variability in performance assessment, those associated with raters have been found to be extensive, difficult to control, and impossible to eliminate. And as rater-related errors are non-trivial and threaten the validity of test results, it is necessary that these errors are accounted for and controlled in some way. This paper explains the different types of rater errors and illustrates how they can be identified using the Many-Facet Rasch Model, as implemented by FACETS. It also demonstrates what these errors mean in terms of actual judging or rating behaviour and elucidates how they may affect the accuracy of estimation of performance. Rater errors that are explicated in this paper are those related to rater severity, restriction of range, central tendency, and internal consistency. As assessment and its procedures are central to student learning, matters related to valid and fair testing need to be taken seriously. It is hoped that with greater awareness of how we judge and a better understanding of how rater-related errors are introduced into the assessment process, we can be better raters and better teachers.

While the overarching aim of the study was to investigate the youths' level of English language competencies and their literacy skills in relation to the required competencies for the 21st century, the scope of this paper highlights the case study of the teaching of English language skills at the vocational institute. It examines the extent to which the English language curriculum prepares the youths for English language use in the competitive and globalized era, and highlights the disparity between the level and type of language skills that they are taught with those that they need and should exit with for employability. The participants in this study were school leavers who had not been able to gain entry into public institutions of higher learning but had obtained entry to the goverment run skills training programme instead at the Institute of Skills and Vocational Training Malaysia. Data was collated through a questionnaire, interviews and document or content analysis. The findings indicated that the youth have not acquired or mastered the necessary English language and communicational skills, required for accessing and analysing information in the ICT and global era as they mainly lacked in linguistic and communicative competencies. Additionally, the findings indicated that they do not posses the needed critical literacy to access information in a meaningful and effective way for better paying jobs. Majority of the youth pointed out that they feel intellectually, socially and culturally marginalized as the content and skills taught to them lack in terms of linguistic needs, language use needs, content relevance and types of critical literacy skills. Based on these findings the paper advocates for a revision of the current English language for vocational purposes syllabus and instead introduces an English literacy curriculum that is based on the reflexive pedagogic approach framed from within a pluriliteracy view of learning.

There is no doubt that some arguments about present taxonomies still persist among researchers and some domains did not discover yet. This paper describes a preliminary study designed to explore and develop metaphysic strategy as a new subcategory in the classification systems of LLS. Based on an extensive literature review, items in the metaphysic subcategory questionnaire were developed. The internal consistency reliability as measured by Cronbach's Alpha for the metaphysic strategy was 0.805. A total of 460 students from 13 Religious Secondary Schools in Terengganu participated in this study. The results showed that the metaphysic strategies were the next most frequently used after compensation strategies. The results also indicate that metaphysic strategies were among the most frequently used based on language proficiency and motivation level. The findings have contributed to providing a well-defined framework for further studies on metaphysic strategies and on factors affecting the choice of LLS.

J	Noor, NM				Noor, Noorizah			Reading Academic Text: Awareness And Experiences Among University ESL Learners	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article								Studying in the university for the first time may involve a sudden change in the way of learning for most students. These initial experiences of higher education may have a profound effect on whether these students are able to successfully complete their course of studies. The review of literature on students' approaches to learning has often described students as either deep or surface learners. A deep approach is associated with intrinsic motivation and a focus on understanding the meaning of the learning material. In contrast, a surface approach focuses on memorizing discrete items in isolation resulting in superficial understanding of the learning material. Although these studies have provided information on the different approaches in various contexts, little research has been conducted within an ESL context. Accordingly, through phenomenography, the aim of this paper is to describe the reading process of six ESL learners within a Malaysian educational context. Findings will reveal that there exist 'variations' or 'qualitative differences' in these ESL students' approaches of reading an English academic expository text.

Good academic writing necessitates the writers' language talents and their comprehension of accepted rhetorical components. Many researchers have explored non-native authors' use of metadiscourse markers in academic discourses and how they differ from native speaker authors. However, limited attention has been given to Malaysian authors, precisely stance features in each rhetorical Move of research articles. This study intends to bridge the gap of comparative studies of native and non-native authors in understanding the usages of stance features within the rhetorical moves of research articles, focusing on the "Introduction" section. The present study compared the "Introduction" sections between six British and Australian authors' research articles and six Malaysian authors' research articles in applied linguistics. A mixed-method approach was used in this study. The data were firstly analysed qualitatively to identify the rhetorical moves in the "Introduction" section presented in the research article texts using Swales' (2004) Creating a Research Space (CARS) model. Secondly, the frequency of stance features used in each move was investigated quantitatively using Hyland's (2005) stance features taxonomy. The findings revealed that the stance features mostly appeared in the first two Moves (Moves 1 & 2) of the "Introduction" section written by Malaysian authors. The most frequently occurred stance features were hedges, followed by boosters, and lastly attitude markers. There were no self-mentions in the non-native speakers' (NNS) articles. The native speaker (NS) authors, whereas used more stance features in the three moves (Move 1, Move 2, & Move 3) of the "Introduction" section than Malaysian authors. The authorial identity in the NS authors' articles was strategically constructed by the presence of self-mentions. As such, the results of this study have informed the pedagogical implications, and further research is needed.

J	Herda, D				Herda, Damian			To Be "a Boat Load Healthier" and Not to "Care a Single Scrap": On the Adverbialization of English Size Nouns	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						grammaticalization; adverbialization; size nouns; English; corpus-based study	DEGREE MODIFIERS; GRAMMATICALIZATION	While the grammaticalization of English size nouns into vague quantifiers has already received a considerable amount of scholarly attention, their subsequent syntactic expansion beyond the nominal domain remains an under-researched area. In particular, little has hitherto been written about the possible factors contributing to the emergence of additional adverbial uses of such items. Based on synchronic corpus data, this paper therefore aims to partially fill in this gap by providing an analysis of the adverbialization patterns of nine nominal forms of this kind, namely bit, scrap, shred, heap, heaps, load, loads, lot, and lots, whose empirical tokens have been classified into six categories: (i) verbal inherent modification, (ii) verbal extent modification, (iii) adverbial ambiguous, (iv) object-pronominal, (v) adjectival modification of positives, and (vi) adjectival modification of comparatives. The results demonstrate that in the verbal domain, most of the analyzed forms reveal a preference for pronominal uses, in which they function as an argument of the verb rather than a genuine degree adverb, while in the adjectival domain, a majority of the items, especially 'large size' nouns, exhibit a conspicuous propensity to combine with the comparative forms of adjectives/adverbs. Moreover, it is shown that there exists a strong positive correlation between the items' respective degrees of grammaticalization in the quantifier function and their extents of adverbialization, operationalized as the proportion of pertinent attestations in corpus samples. Thus, the study underscores the role of frequency in grammaticalization on the one hand, and points to the importance of paradigmatic analogy on the other.

The specific aspects studied were: (1) the frequencies of five categories of interactional markers; and (2) the distribution of interactional markers by rhetorical section. The descriptive study which involved the analysis of political science research articles published in 40 SCOPUS-indexed journals (20 Quartile 1; 20 Quartiles 3 and 4) conducted using Hyland's (2005) interpersonal metadiscourse model identified 10,903 markers. Both Q1 and Q3-Q4 political science articles have boosters and hedges as the most frequently used markers, and engagement markers as the least used marker. There are significant differences between the higher and lower tiered political science research articles in the frequencies of interactional metadiscourse markers found in rhetorical sections. The method section has the most self-mentions, particularly in articles published in Q1 journals. Writers of articles published in Q1 journals prioritise boosters, indicating confidence in emphasising certainty, but writers of articles published in Q3-Q4 journals prioritise hedges over boosters. The Q1 articles have more attitude markers in the introduction and results-discussion-conclusion sections but less in the abstract and method sections, but writers of Q3-Q4 articles use attitude markers in similar frequencies across sections. The findings suggest that the nature of reader engagement varies with rhetorical section in research articles.

J	Alkhodari, FT; Habil, H				Alkhodari, Fatima Tamim; Habil, Hadina			Metadiscourse Markers in Dr. Zakir Naik's Persuasive Discourse	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Metadiscourse; interpersonal Metadiscourse; Islamic discourse; Persuasion discourse; Zakir Naik	SCIENCE; WRITTEN	The International speaker Dr Zakir Naik has been the target of many studies for his influential speeches. Analysing persuasive speeches can be tackled from different angles, amongst which is the functional markers of persuasion represented by the Metadiscourse markers. Dr Zakir Naik's persuasive speeches have never been analyzed from a metadiscourse perspective. This paper aims to investigate the types and functions of metadiscourse markers in Zakir Naik's speeches. After transcribing Zakir Naik's videos manually, the coding process was accomplished via NVivo software and Microsoft Excel. Applying Dafouz-Milne's (2008) categories in the codification process, the interpersonal and textual metadiscourse markers are revealed. In terms of interpersonal metadiscourse markers, commentaries have been chiefly employed, contributing to Naik's relation to the audience. In terms of the textual metadiscourse markers, logical markers showed the highest usage. Such markers help in connecting his various persuasion strategies and multi-argument to make them smoothly connected. This paper has found that, generally, Zakir Naik has effectively developed and promoted his arguments via the extensive use of various metadiscourse tools while establishing an excellent relationship with the audience to attain a continuous relationship. This paper also argues that a fruitful approach to explore the interpersonal and textual definitions of language is Dafouz-Milne's categorization of metadiscourse markers as a powerful methodological tool in discourse analysis.

J	Margono-Slamet, YB				Margono-Slamet, Yosep B.			Y Socio-Political Engagement of Contemporary Javanese Literature	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Javanese literature; socio-political engagement; democracy; power; equality		This paper analyzes four selected short stories in Javanese literature entitled "Durmogati" by Budianto, "Maju Tatu Mundur Ajur" ("Damned if One Does, Damned if One Doesn't") by Budiono, "Bojo" ("Wife") and "Apik Meneng" ("It's Better to be Silent") by Harjono which were all published in 2018. In Indonesia, Javanese literature-together with other regional literatures-is a part of or complimentary to Indonesian literature but it has not received much attention at the national level, let alone at the international level. However, Javanese literature has not been less vocal than Indonesian literature. In this article, I will examine the sociopolitical engagements of the four short stories in Indonesian society. Using Phillips' ethnographic approach and Foucault's theory of power distribution, I will analyze how the four short stories are related to democracy, people's power, equality, and corruption in Indonesia after the fall of Suharto as the president of Indonesia in 1998. The analysis shows that the four short stories have significant socio-political engagements in the present Indonesia. The authors of the four short stories discussed in this paper show courage to blatantly criticize those who are in power. As such, the discussion of this essay offers fresh insights about contemporary Javanese literature and its role in the socio-political situation of the country. In the end, this essay will show that these four short stories are not only a reflection of Javanese society in particular and that of Indonesia in general but also as expressions of their authors as key informants about their society, i. e., how they see and think about the society in which they live.

J	Jaafar, NM; Thang, SM				Jaafar, Nurjanah Mohd; Thang, Siew Ming			Processing of a Multi-representational Science Passage by ESL Learners	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						multiple representations; ESL learners; processing science texts; eye tracking; interviews	FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; TEXT; INFORMATION; VOCABULARY; PICTURES	Verbal input is integral and is the core component in any language learning materials. As such, despite the incorporation of non-verbal input to facilitate language learning, language learners, more often than not, give attention more to the verbal components as opposed to the non-verbal ones. This paper reports on a study undertaken to examine 28 ESL undergraduates' eye fixations when reading a science passage in English with an accompanying diagram. The data collection involves two stages. The first stage concerned the reading of the science passage and the second stage comprised short retrospective interviews conducted to explore the reasons behind the learners' processing. Results of the eye tracking analysis indicate that similar to the processing of language learning materials, the ESL learners' processing of the science passage was also mainly focused on the text (henceforth, "heavily text-based"). Findings from the retrospective interviews indicate that although a heavily text-based processing strategy was evident, most of the learners found the graphic input helpful. Analysis of the interviews also revealed that some learners were not aware of the strategies that they employed during the reading process. Although the eye tracking data imply that the ESL learners lacked the awareness and strategy to read and process multi-representational science texts in English effectively, the interviews suggest that they were aware of the potential and benefits of processing the accompanying diagram for overall comprehension. Effective design principles for multi-representational materials are suggested to promote more strategic processing among learners.

The Internet has made connectivity faster and stronger than the old days. However, studies have shown that many have misused this platform to incite hatred and animosity when expressing themselves. Online derogatory expressions include the usage of slurs, pejoratives, hate-speech, flaming, and trolling, among others. The present study aims to analyse defensive strategies employed by Facebook commenters on the issue of 1MDB. Three threads of comments and responses towards the political scandal of 1MDB were identified and extracted from Facebook newspaper page. The data was then analysed using the summary of response options and the list of defensive counter-strategies offered by Bousfield (2007). The findings demonstrated the use of defensive strategies by the participants in disputing criticisms of 1MDB issues, particularly comments affecting the reputation of their social group and ethnicity. Most of the participants chose to contradict the opposition directly; and some of them included statements of clarification, explanation or details about the issue together with the arguments. The discussion of the findings offers some novel insights into the field of impoliteness by drawing attention to online users' defensive linguistic behaviour in dealing with out-group impoliteness strategies in online communication.

J	Li, ZM; Lian, AP; Yodkamlue, B				Li, Zhongmin; Lian, Andrew-Peter; Yodkamlue, Butsakorn			Learning English Intonation Through Exposure to Resynthesized Self-produced Stimuli	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						English intonation; precision language education; modified stimuli; phonological representation; phonetic realization	TRAINING JAPANESE LISTENERS; PRECISION EDUCATION; PRONUNCIATION; INTELLIGIBILITY; EXPERIENCE; JUDGMENTS; SPEAKERS	EFL learners are prone to having problems in pronunciation, while their problems in intonation are more salient. The Chinese EFL pronunciation classroom has long been criticized for teacher-centered, "one-size-fits-all" teaching, which is inefficient and ineffective for solving individual student's specific pronunciation problems. This study conducted an experiment to examine the effectiveness of exposure to resynthesized self-produced stimuli for intonation learning. The participants were 66 first year English majors studying at a university in China. The treatment was a form of English intonation training wherein the students in the experimental group used their resynthesized self-produced stimuli (their own voices) as the pronunciation model for learning while the control group used a model produced by a native speaker. After the training, the results of the intonation production test showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group in eight intonation patterns. The students' problems in intonation support Mennen's (2007) claim that intonation learning involves a first stage of acquiring the phonological representations of intonation patterns and a second stage of acquiring the phonetic realizations of those patterns. The results of this study revealed that exposure to resynthesized self-produced stimuli for intonation learning was as effective as the native speaker model for helping the students form the phonological representations of intonation patterns, while it was more effective than the native speaker model for facilitating the students to produce more accurate phonetic realizations of those patterns.

J	Alvi, A; Vengadasamy, R; Majid, ABA				Alvi, Amatulhafeez; Vengadasamy, Ravichandran; Majid, Amrah Binti Abdul			The Philosophy of Nature in the Poetry of Ghulam Sarwar Yousuf and William Wordsworth: A Comparative Ecocritical Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Ecocriticism; Ecocentrism; Interrelationship; Ecological awareness; William Wordsworth; Ghulam Sarwar		This paper is a comparative ecocritical investigation considering the relationship between man and nature in cross-cultural contexts as reflected in the poetry of two great admirers of nature in England and Malaysia: William Wordsworth and Ghulam Sarwar Yousuf. Both poets have composed poetry that strengthens man's bonds with nature and inspires environmental consciousness. Their nature poetry has been previously studied from different individual perspectives, but none has approached it comparatively from an ecocritical stylistic viewpoint. This study aims at analyzing selected nature poetry to identify the unique philosophy of nature both poets adopted, highlighting the artistic and aesthetic values their poetry are teeming with. The study demonstrates the cognitive development of the poets' environmental consciousness through three phases of attitudes towards nature; the physical, the intellectual and the mystical. Using major ecocritical concepts like ecocentrism, symbiotic interrelationship and ecological consciousness, the study adopts a comparative stylistic approach to scrutinize linguistic and literary representation of nature in the selected poems. It identifies the similarities and differences between both poets concluding that despite differences in their times, places, cultures, language and style, there is an affinity between both poets in their treatment towards nature. The present study responds to the enormous need for literary-linguistic investigation of leitmotifs of nature across geographical, cultural, and linguistic contexts as a means of facilitating environmental sensitivity and sensibility.

J	Andriyanti, E				Andriyanti, Erna			Language Shift among Javanese Youth and Their Perception of Local and National Identities	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Bahasa Indonesia; Javanese; language shift; multilingualism; youth's identities		It is not uncommon for language to play an important role in identity issues in multilingual countries. Declaring one of the important community languages as the official language in such a country can pose a threat to the survival of the other languages. Bahasa Indonesia is an example of this phenomenon. Its successful establishment as the national language has altered the local language situation throughout the country. Relevant to this study, it has had an important effect on young people's use of Javanese, the dominant local language of Yogyakarta. This study analyses the extent of language shift among the young multilinguals in the city and investigates the youth's search for authentic local and national identities. A questionnaire was used to elicit the youth's mother tongue as well as their attitudes and perceptions towards Javanese and Bahasa Indonesia and local and national identities. Their real use of languages was obtained through non-participative observations. A sample group of 1,039 students from 10 junior and senior high schools was surveyed. The findings reveal the current status of Javanese and Bahasa Indonesia as mother tongues and the identity-language choice links. Most young people with Javanese parents claimed that Bahasa Indonesia is their first language. This signals a weakened intergenerational transmission of Javanese. With regard to identity, the youth's sense of national identity is stronger than their sense of local identity. To elevate the vitality of Javanese and strengthen the local identity, intergenerational transmission and intensive use of Javanese at school is imperative.

J	Majid, AA; Jalaluddin, DQA				Majid, Amrah Abdul; Jalaluddin, Dinnur Qayyimah Ahmad			The Conflicts between the Secular and the Religious in Tahmima Anam's The Good Muslim	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Tahmima Anam; The Good Muslim; Talal Asad; the secular; Bangladeshi writing in English		This paper discusses the relationship between the ideologies of the secular and the religious in the process of nation-building as presented in Tahmima Anam's The Good Muslim (2011). It centres around the conflicts between the Haque siblings, Maya and Sohail as they navigate their ways in life after the Bangladeshi Liberation War of 1971. The novel portrays how Sohail's submission to extreme dogmatism which has led him to neglecting his son, Zaid, and Maya's inability to tolerate her brother's transformation, result in their estranged relationship, eventually leading to a devastating family tragedy. Using Talal Asad's (2003) definition of the secular as an ideology that brings together different concepts and practices, and which is neither a break from religion nor a continuity of it, this paper suggests that the skirmish between the siblings is a metaphorical representation of a conflict between the secular and the religious in the efforts towards nation-building. This formulation foregrounds the importance of establishing an intricate balance between the secular and the religious, which also has the social implication of destabilizing the binary that is often drawn to differentiate between a 'good' and a 'bad' Muslim.

J	Noorashid, N; McLellan, J				Noorashid, Najib; McLellan, James			Teaching and Learning an Ethnic Minority Language at University Level: The Case of Dusun in Brunei	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Dusun; ethnic minority; language curriculum; language maintenance; Brunei	ENDANGERED LANGUAGES	This article investigates the teaching and learning of an ethnic minority language at tertiary level as a strategy for language maintenance and revitalisation. We offer a case study of the Dusun language, which is taught as a breadth/elective course at the Language Centre in Universiti Brunei Darussalam. Although the initial purpose of introducing ethnic language courses was to encourage students to be familiar with the practices and the cultural knowledge associated with the community of users, their role in language maintenance is also worthy of investigation. The research methods include classroom observations, a questionnaire survey and analysis of examination results. The observation and the survey assist in the understanding of students' reactions to the curriculum. We find that offering Dusun as a credit-bearing language module (course) has generated interest among both students and the wider Brunei community. Those from Dusun family backgrounds taking the module are a minority: most students have no family connections with Dusun. The implementation of the curriculum remains problematic, and there are issues resulting from the need to meet the formal requirements and academic expectations of the university administration in terms of coursework and examinations. The absence of dictionaries, grammars and other pedagogical materials means that Dusun language teachers are obliged to develop their own materials and resources. We argue that offering Borneo minority indigenous languages at tertiary level may not in itself maintain or revive the language in question, but is one strategy, along with several others, which may help towards maintenance and revitalisation.

J	Asl, MP; Hull, SP; Abdullah, NFL				Asl, Moussa Pourya; Hull, Simon Peter; Abdullah, Nurul Farhana Low			Nihilation of Femininity in the Battle of Looks: A Sartrean Reading of Jhumpa Lahiri's "A Temporary Matter"	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						masculine; feminine; gaze; hole and slime; hierarchies of gender	SHAME	The panoptic gaze is vested in with a constitutive impact upon the subjectivity of individuals. Feminist scholars like Luce Irigaray have charged that the metaphor of vision is intimately connected with the construction of gender and sexual difference. By pointing to the masculine logic of Western thought, Irigaray confirms that a woman's entry into a dominant scopic economy signifies her inevitable confinement to passivity. This essay aims to examine the sexual politics of metaphors of vision in a literary text that is controversially argued to be a voice for the subordinated Indian immigrant women in the US. As one of the most influential schools of thought in Western philosophy, the Sartrean paradigm of sexual difference is employed to investigate this allegation by identifying the latent binary system at work in the fiction of Jhumpa Lahiri, who has garnered substantial yet controversial critical attention over her representations of gender. Specifically, this essay focuses on Lahiri's prefatory story to her Pulitzer Prize-winning short story collection, Interpreter of Maladies (2000), to unravel the manner her exercise of vision in this narrative perpetuates the dichotomies of a male subject and a female object pre-established in the traditional hierarchies of gender in the West. In this story, Lahiri (un)wittingly privileges masculinity over femininity and reduces the latter to a typically disgusting Sartrean female body of holes and slime. Hence, notwithstanding infrequent emasculated images of the male subject, it is ultimately the masculine that, in the battle of looks between male and female, nihilates the Other to the state of "being-in-itself" and enjoys supremacy over the feminine.

J	Loan, NTT; Pramoolsook, I				Nguyen Thi Thuy Loan; Pramoolsook, Issra			Citations in Literature Review Chapters of TESOL Master's Theses by Vietnamese Postgraduates	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Review						citation types; citation functions; Vietnamese writers; literature review chapters; TESOL master's theses	ACADEMIC ATTRIBUTION; RESEARCH ARTICLES; SECTIONS	Citing other works poses difficulties for novice writers, especially the non-native English speaking students in their first experience of writing for academic purposes; the master's (M.A.) thesis. However, few studies were conducted on these students' citations in their M.A. theses. This paper, therefore, presents the study of in-text citations in 24 literature review (LR) chapters of TESOL M.A. theses written by Vietnamese students. Employing the Antconc software, Thompson and Tribble's (2001) framework for citation types and functions, and discourse-based interviews with the actual thesis writers and their thesis supervisors, the study confirmed the claim that non-native novice writers cannot fully learn crucial citation practices from mere reading of the guidelines. Besides these writers' preference for integral citations and a very limited number of citation functions used in their LR chapters, this study also identified the presence of several secondary citations, the students' "invented" ways of citing previous researchers, grammatical mistakes and the absence of further discussions of the cited works. These findings tend to render the students' LR chapters as ineffective, in terms of grammar and the rhetorical functions of LR chapters in synthesizing, arguing and indicating the relevancy of the reviewed literature for the niche of their research to be established. Furthermore, these findings indicate a need for an increased amount of formal instruction in academic writing courses which aims at equipping novice writers with the means to successfully acknowledge the sources and at raising their awareness about the various functions and rhetorical effects of the students' citations in their academic writing.

J	Abadikhah, S; Ahangar, Z				Abadikhah, Shirin; Ahangar, Zohreh			Effectiveness of Integrating Content and Language Instruction in an EFL Context	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						content-based; output; focus-on-form; dictogloss; accuracy	FORM; STUDENTS; OUTPUT	Integrating content and language instruction has recently become popular in many countries. This approach has gained momentum following the inadequacies observed in comprehension-based classrooms, indicating that the learners were unable to develop native-like proficiency and control over L2 production (Swain, 2001). The present study is an attempt to examine how integrating content and language instruction may affect the accuracy of L2 production in an EFL context. Two groups of learners (n=36; experimental and control) attended twenty sessions in a semester. In order to examine the participants. progress over the term, an achievement test targeting content and linguistic knowledge was administered to both groups during the pretest and posttest sessions. For integration of language into content, the experimental group worked in pairs to complete four focus-on-form tasks (dictogloss) developed on the basis of the content presented to them during the previous sessions. To examine the amount of noticing and progress in the accuracy, their conversations were tape-recorded and transcribed. While performing each task, the learners were asked to write their reconstructed texts in their handouts. The results obtained from the pretest and posttest indicated that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in their final scores. It was also revealed that the amount of noticing increased in the experimental group from the first to the fourth task. Furthermore, there was a rising trend in the accuracy of production. The findings lend support to the efficiency of integrating content and language instruction in the Iranian EFL context.

J	Quinto, EJM				Mansarate Quinto, Edward Jay			Physical and Topical Structures of Manpower Discourse: A Contrastive Rhetoric Analysis in Southeast Asia	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						contrastive rhetoric; topical structure analysis; internal coherence; Southeast Asia; manpower discourse		This paper explores the physical and topical structures of thirty paragraphs culled from websites of Philippine, Indonesian and Malaysian manpower agencies. Drawing on the frameworks of Simpson (2000) and Lautamatti (1987), the study describes potential regional (Southeast Asian) and national preferences of writers on a subgenre of L2 professional writing, called manpower discourse (MD). The physical structure analysis points to slight but statistically insignificant differences between the data sets. Such analysis aids in the description of a possible regional preference in the physical structure of MD in Southeast Asia, which appeals to directness and simplicity. The topical structure analysis (TSA) shows that there is a stronger demand for internal coherence in Philippine MD, compared with Indonesian MD and Malaysian MD. Specifically, the analysis reveals that topical development is more sophisticated in Philippine MD attributed to the use of some form of topical reoccurrence and some kind of topical progressions in all paragraphs, which was not observed in the internal structure of paragraphs from Indonesian and Malaysian MD. Moreover, Philippine MD seems to keep up with one valued characteristic of composition in English: to develop ideas using sequential and extended parallel progressions. Also, topical depth is found to be most elaborate in Philippine MD than in the Indonesian and Malaysian counterparts. The paper closes with a discussion of implications for professional writing, specific to manpower discourse and teaching writing coherence based on socially and culturally relevant inputs.

The main aim of this study is to gain preliminary insights into the relationship between teaching and learning factors affected by the washback effect. It focuses on eight pedagogical dimensions: four of them concerned the teachers (teaching methods, teaching experiences, content assessment, and beliefs) and four concerned the students (learning styles, learning activities, attitudes and motivation). A semi-structured interview was conducted with three English teachers who have over ten years of teaching experience. Based on the interview, a questionnaire was constructed and then administered to 30 Yemeni English teachers of the 12(th)grade English classes. The data were analysed using SPSS software, version 20. The results showed that the test had a great influence on the learners and teachers mainly on teaching methodology and on learning styles. Triangulation with the qualitative data confirmed the findings. Hence, the study provides a clear evidence of the washback effect of the exam on the components of the language teaching-learning processes in Yemen and its influence on what and how the teachers teach, and the learners learn.

J	Ahmad, MRW				Ahmad, Mas Rynna Wati			Finding God In Dinsman's It Is Not A Suicide: An Islamic Metaphysical Approach	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						theatre of the absurd; pessimistic; religious; metaphysical approach; Al-Ghazali's The Alchemy of Happiness		Dinsman, whose real name is Che, Shamsuddin Othman, was known for his experimentation on the absurd theatre techniques during the period of Experimental Theatre in Malaysia in the 1970's. His play It Is Not A Suicide reflects strong philosophical underpinnings that highlight the deep emotional setbacks experienced by an individual who is caught in the tumult of finding the right path. Even though his experimentation seems to be vague to many scholars and theatre critics, his appropriation of absurd theatre techniques had successfully transformed a play that was once known to be atheistic in nature to be distinctively his own. Unfortunately, his experimentations on absurd theatre were not clearly understood by many. This is because most theatre critics and local audience remain sceptical towards the fundamental philosophy of the absurd. As a result, the concept of the Malay absurd in Modern Malay theatre is still not fully received. Although the intellectual and religious maturity of the audience and the theatre scholars has grown over the years, the view of absurd works being pessimistic remains. For the purpose of this paper, the author focuses on Dinsman's It Is Not A Suicide; reading it through the lens of Al-Ghazali's The Alchemy of Happiness. Through the Islamic metaphysical approach, this article offers a more optimistic perspective to his work. It argues that the play still functions within the Islamic parameters thus eliminating the atheistic label which clouded this work for more than three decades.

J	Harun, K; Yusof, M				Harun, Karim; Yusof, Maslida			Tenses In 17th Malay Grammar: Dutch perspectives	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						conjugation; tense marker; pronouns; climate of opinion; verb		The Malay language has no tenses like Latin, English and Dutch. In Malay, tenses or time has not been marked because the hearer can decide based on contexts and relations in utterances. But in the early observation of the Dutch people, Malay was viewed from the same perspectives as Dutch language. Malay was considered the same as the Dutch language which has tenses in verbs. Frederick Houtman presented the Dutch and Malay conjugations in the form of tables in his conversation book Spareck ende woord-boeck. In these conjugation tables Frederick Houtman tried to show that verbs in Malay also can be used as a tense marker. This paper discusses the conjugation tables presented by Frederick Houtman which focus on tenses from the perspective of history of linguistics. Koerner climate of opinion model will be used to discuss the tenses. The findings show that the conjugation tables were parallel with the climate of opinion in the 17th century. In this century, the grammarian. s emphasis on conjugation is due to the influence of Latin. It is also in line with the development of grammar writing which was taking place around the world at that time. As Latin was a lingua academica at that time, the influence cannot be avoided. Thus, this make Malay a language parallel with other languages in the world, especially Latin, because Latin means grammar.

The purpose of this article is to find out the competence of dialect among lower secondary school in Negeri Sembilan. The research was conducted in the districts of Rembau and Tampin. This study is divided into two parts. First, a list comprises of original words from Negeri Sembilan dialect was collected from Rembau district (one of the six districts in Negeri Sembilan). Second, this group of words were reduced to 80 words and tested on a group of students in a school in the Tampin district. The research samples were acquired individually and in groups. Similar method was observed by Labov and a few other researchers in the West (Chambers & Trudgill 1990). This study utilizes the naming method (on certain aspects) and questionnaires with multiple choice questions. Findings from the study show that the students have a moderate attitude towards Negeri Sembilan dialect because they received little encouragement from their parents. However, the students displayed a positive attitude towards competence and perception on Negeri Sembilan dialect. The findings also indicate that the higher the social economic background of the students, the lower their competence of the Negeri Sembilan dialect. Lastly, the analysis on word class shows that social change leads to a few words pertaining to adat (custom), for example, kodin and the verbs bertating and bertandak are among words that were least understood by the respondents. Overall, the findings of the research indicate that there is an observable pattern of language change among adolescents in Negeri Sembilan which is in-line with a rise in social status	[Jaafar, Mohammad Fadzeli; Awal, Norsimah Mat; Aman, Idris] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Pusat Pengajian Bahasa & Linguist, Bangi, Malaysia	Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia	Jaafar, MF (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Pusat Pengajian Bahasa & Linguist, Bangi, Malaysia.	fadzeli@ukm.my; norsimah@ukm.my; idrisa@ukm.my	Awal, Norsimah Mat/AAT-3212-2020	MAT AWAL, NORSIMAH/0000-0002-7693-2344				Aman I, 2009, GEMA ONLINE J LANG S, V9, P63; [Anonymous], 2005, KAM DEW; Awal Norsimah Mat, 2011, JURNAL BAHASA JENDEL, V7, P1; Chambers J., 1990, DIALEKTOLOGI; Chee LK, 2012, GEMA ONLINE J LANG S, V12, P275; Duan Lei, 2004, THESIS; Hendon R.S., 1966, PHONOLOGY MORPHOLOGY; Ibrahim Nurhalim Hj., 1993, ADAT PERPATIH PERBEZ; Kob Ajid Che, 1984, MONOGRAF U KEBANGSAA; Labov William, 1966, SOCIAL STRATIFICATIO; Maalip Saadiah, 2011, JURNAL MELAYU, V6, P57; Omar Asmah Haji, 1988, SUSUR GALUR BAHASA M; Onn Farid M., 1995, S DIALEK PENYELIDIKA; Osman Wan Robiah Meor, 2004, VARIASI SOSIAL BAHAS; Othman Arbak, 1994, NEGERI SEMBILAN GEMU; Saidat Ahmad Mahmoud, 2010, INT J ACAD RES, V2, P235; Samarin W.

J	Antonova, A				Antonova, Anna			Empathy As Speech Manipulation Target In Pre-election Discourse Of Great Britain	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						speech manipulation; mutual aid instinct; altruism; empathy; speech producer		Nowadays much attention in linguistics is paid to the study of manipulative kinds of texts which function within the political discourse. This paper deals with the linguistic means that the British political leaders use to actualize empathy and compassion. Despite the basic statements of Darwin's theory these manipulation targets are considered to be the important mechanisms of tribal human behavior by many ethologists. The pre-election speeches of the British political leaders taken as linguistic data are regarded in the article with the help of intentional analysis and the analysis of stylistic means and vocabulary which are used by the producers. These methods let us understand how the producers of manipulative messages which consist of manipulative speech acts apply to the recipients' empathy and compassion. The results of such analysis show that the most frequently used linguistic means of realization of this manipulative strategy are nominating lexemes, associative lexemes and some stylistic means (anaphora, simile and some others).

J	De Rycker, A; Ponnudurai, P				De Rycker, Antoon; Ponnudurai, Prema			The Effect Of Online Reading On Argumentative Essay Writing Quality	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						interactive online reading; print reading; English as a Second Language; reading-based writing; argumentative essay		In tertiary education in Malaysia, essay-writing assignments are central to most English as a Second Language (ESL) courses. Often reading texts are used as a stimulus to better writing but it has not yet been extensively researched whether these texts should be presented on screen or on paper. This study examines which of these two presentation modes, viz., interactive online reading or print-based reading, help today's ICT-literate generation of Malaysian students write better argumentative essays. The rationale is that interactive online reading motivates these students more, and that this higher task motivation in its turn leads to more successful task performance. Using a quasiexperimental, between-subjects research design, we elicited a total of 90 essays (31,207 words), 44 of which written by students reading the input text online and 46 by students reading the same text on paper. The quality of argumentation was analysed, using a modified three-way version of Harrell's (2005) coding rubric: thesis, support and counter-arguments. Our comparative study shows that 61% of all essays are 'good', with 39% rated as 'average' to 'poor'. Results indicate that the interactive online reading condition yields superior task performance and that it also produces proportionately more essays with a 'good' thesis statement. Both findings are statistically significant. Essays with a 'good' thesis are more likely to contain 'good' support though not always 'good' counter-arguments. Counter-argumentation remains underdeveloped for both conditions. As a springboard to better argumentative content, ICT-enabled reading-based activities may not suffice, leaving room for other pedagogic interventions.

J	Somsai, S; Intaraprasert, C				Somsai, Surapa; Intaraprasert, Channarong			Strategies For Coping With Face-to-face Oral Communication Problems Employed By Thai University Students Majoring In English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						English-major students; communication strategies; oral communication problems; continuous interaction strategies; discontinuous interaction strategies		Nowadays, it is undeniable that the communicative approach plays an important role in language teaching especially in the context where English is a foreign language and the ultimate goal of language teaching is to improve the communicative competence of language learners. Language learners can significantly improve their communicative competence by developing their ability to use communication strategies (CSs) or strategies for coping with face-to-face oral communication problems. The present study, which is exploratory in nature, primarily aimed at investigating how university students majoring in English for International Communication (EIC) cope with their face-to-face oral communication problems. The participants were 48 students studying at three different Rajamangala Universities of Technology in Thailand. A semi-structured interview was used for data collection. The obtained data were transcribed unfocusedly verbatim and translated from Thai into English. The translated data were then validated and analysed. Based on the role of the language learners when engaged in a conversation, i.e. as the message sender and as the message receiver, the results show two main categories of strategies for coping with face-to-face oral communication problems. The two groups of strategies employed for conveying a message to the interlocutor as the message sender: continuous interaction and discontinuous interaction subcategories and one group of strategies for understanding the message as the message receiver were reported.

J	Aziz, AYA				Aziz, Adi Yasran Abdul			An Optimality Theoretic Account Of Basic Syllables In Kelantan Malay Dialect	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						phonology; Optimality Theory; Kelantan Malay; basic syllables; Malay language		This paper describes the constraint interactions that account for the basic syllable types in the Kelantan Malay dialect based on Optimality Theory (OT). Previous analysis of basic syllables in Malay focused only on the possible types of syllables. These analyses do not offer any explanation on the differences found in the possible syllable types found in various Malay dialects even though they all originated from the same parent language. Most of these analyses described the basic syllable template as (consonant)-vowel-(consonant) or (C)V(C), CV, CVC, VC and V. Nevertheless, this paper presents an alternative description using a set of constraint hierarchy in the Kelantan grammar, which is different from the set of constraint hierarchy for the standard Malay variety, in order to account for the basic syllable types in Kelantan Malay. The set of constraints hierarchy proposed for Kelantan Malay comprises *COMPLEXNUCLEI, *COMPLEXCODA, CONTIGROOT >> ALIGN-LEFT >> ONSET >> DEP >> MAX >> *CODA. These constraints are considered universal in the human mind; however, its hierarchy depends on the constraints interaction of the language or the local dialect. The present analysis shows that the explanation available from constraints interaction from OT has greater explanatory power in describing the grammar of a language.

Critical and independent thinking (MoHE, 2007a) is a vital attribute for first class human capital. This paper reports the preliminary findings of a research which examines the voices and experiences of postgraduate students from different linguistic backgrounds registered in a course which is committed to building situated critical literacy from the Critical Literacy Awareness (CLA) Instructional perspective and method. The conceptual framework aims to redefine the construction of meaning in terms of the intersecting and/or conflicting voices and discourses with respect to ideological perspective ideas on literacy and awareness of knowing (Wallace, 1988; Lankshear & McLaren, 1993; Kress, 2003; Koo Yew Lie, 2009). Using action research involving transcripts of teacher talk and student logs, this paper qualitatively analyzes a subject's reflections of her journeys through CLA Instructional pedagogy in a transnational Malaysian Higher education classroom. The use of multilayered codes (vernacular languages, dialects, registers) and diverse cultural resources in the subject's reflective logs demonstrates the complex ways in which hybrid texts are constructed based on the subject's various social locations. The teacher's deliberate engagement with the subject's positions is also seen as a contributory influence on the use of diversity for cultural meaning-making. The findings indicate that for it to be inclusive and transformative, teacher's talk and interventions through CLA pedagogy has to multiply and inter-culturally engage with student's language and cultural resources as variously valued in diverse context.				kooyl@ukm.my; wff@ukm.my; oja@ukm.my; chang@ukm.my; subakir@ukm.my						[Anonymous], 1998, LOCAL LITERACIES; [Anonymous], LINGUIST EDUC, DOI DOI 10.1016/0898-5898(92)90018-R; [Anonymous], 2004, PLUR LIT ITS IMPL PO; Camnitzer L., 2009, E FLUX, V9; Dam-Mieras R.

J	Yazdani, S				Yazdani, Saeed			Projective Identification and Paranoid-Schizoid Position in Toni Morrison's Home: A Kleinian Reading	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						projective identification; defense mechanism; splitting; paranoid-schizoid position; racism		This article applies the Kleinian notion of projective identification on Morrison's novel, Home. Based on the Kleinian notion of projective identification, there is a tendency in individuals to project the dark aspect of their lives on others. On the other hand, Paranoid-schizoid position is the starting point of the projective identification, originating from splitting of both ego and its objects. Toni Morrison's novel Home, presents a disturbing narrative of childhood abuse, racial discrimination and impact of war on a traumatized individual. An attempt is made in the article to focus on an analysis of Morrison's novel, Home, from the perspectives of the Kleinian projective identification, splitting, and schizoid-paranoid positions. The main question that the article poses is to what extent such concepts like projective identification and paranoid schizoid position are applicable to the main characters, Frank Money in particular, in Toni Morrison's Home. As a result, it can be concluded that under certain circumstances, Frank Money's mental condition can be explored in terms of total shift from the past into the present; in addition to his emotional defenses, his social interaction with different institutions in the society has constructed his self because there have been different forces which he has confronted since his childhood.

J	Zahra, T; Abbas, A				Zahra, Tehseen; Abbas, Akhtar			Corpus-Driven Analysis of Pakistani Newspaper Editorials on COVID-19 Discourse	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						COVID-19; Corona; Corpus -driven analysis; Pakistan; Editorials	PLAGUE	Cataclysmic changes by the gradual spread of COVID-19 have triggered the interest of scientists, scholars, academicians, and linguists in analyzing the discourse related to the spread of the pandemic. The descriptions made by all of these scholars not only contribute to language with linguistic innovations but also cause the emergence of human attitudes and behaviours. At the same time, the issues raised through the language used during the challenging time of such crises shape and reveal several human schemas of language, discourse, society, and culture. Several studies on past situations of diseases and calamities have provided critical analyses of these schemas of difficult times in human history. Discourses through various linguistic practices in this regard play a crucial role in shaping and demonstrating the schemas of the crisis hit societies. Media discourse, specifically, has hidden powers to exercise, identify and report various socio-cultural issues. The current study focuses on finding the themes of socio-cultural attitudes and behaviours that emerged from newspaper editorials published in Pakistani newspapers in February, March and April, 2020. To achieve this goal, the corpus -driven analysis of 198 newspaper editorials having 215,842 words was conducted. The study revealed various themes that prevailed in this pre-vaccination period of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The themes included the metaphoric use of the language such as battle, corps and frontline; racism while naming the virus as China virus or Hazara virus; conspiracy theories assumed to be associated with COVID-19 spread i.e. suspected involvement of Bill Gates and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US and World Health Organization (WHO); negligence on the part of people; and criticism on government for health facilities and implications of globalization. It is concluded, based on these findings, that media representation of pre -vaccination phase of COVID-19 in Pakistan is loaded with unhealthy discourse which could have been avoided in order to shape positive attitudes and behaviours of the masses.

Existing works on Malay stop words are based on standard Malay and Quranic/Arabic translations into Malay. Thus, there is a lack of domain-specific stop word list, making it discordant for processing of Malay parliamentary discourse. In this paper, we propose a semantic approach towards identifying and removing Malay, conventional Malay spelling and English functional words in analysing a time-series corpus, namely the Malaysian Hansard Corpus (MHC), to extract a Malay specific-domain stop word list. The study utilised a combination of Z-method of most frequently occurring words, words that appear once, and the classic method. The dataset of the corpus evaluated comprised Parliament 1 (year 1959) to Parliament 13 (year 2018). The study then categorised the stop word list according to domain specific related words. The resulting list comprised 587 stop words. New stop words that emerged from the MHC include parliamentary-related words like 'Berhormat' (salutation to the members of the Parliament), 'Pertua' (salutation to the Speaker of the House), 'ketawa' (laugh) and 'tepuk' (clap). Other than typical English stop words like 'and' and 'the', there are also words like 'hon'ble' (short for 'Honourable') and 'honourable'. The list also includes stop words in conventional Malay spelling like 'untok' (for), 'lebeh' (more), and 'kapada' (to). The proposed set of stop words can be further utilised to assist natural language processing and text analysis.

J	Shamallakh, MLSA; Vengadasamy, R; Sulaiman, MZ				Shamallakh, Mohammed Lami S. A.; Vengadasamy, Ravichandran; Sulaiman, Mohamed Zain			The Dialectics of 'Home' in Ghassan Kanafani's Men in the Sun	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Ghassan Kanafani; Men in the Sun; Hegelian dialectics; home; Palestinian diaspora		Since the Palestinian Nakba in 1948, the definition of home in diasporic Palestinian literature has become a central issue among literary scholars. However, this concept of home has been addressed mainly from a mono-dimensional perspective, that is, either the concrete attachment or the abstract affiliation of home. Based on the significance of the interplay of both dimensions and the lack of focus on the duality of home in previous studies of Palestinian literature, this paper explores the abstract and concrete dimensions of 'home' as depicted in the novel Men in the Sun written by Ghassan Kanafani, a Palestinian diasporic writer. This study investigates the paradoxes of home for Palestinians in the aftermath of the Palestinian Nakba, with a special focus on Kanafani's perception of home. The study adopts Georg Hegel's dialectics of thesis, antithesis and synthesis in the discussion of the abstract and concrete perceptions of home. Our findings disclose that Kanafani projects the many spaces that the refugees seek shelter in, such as the refugee camp, as the antithesis of home and that they are attached to poverty, humiliation, and death. Not only does Kanafani deny any mediating solutions for home, but he also assures us that such mediating solutions, other than the original home, will lead to additional aggravation to the original problem of displacement. Therefore, the synthesis of home, in both its concrete and abstract dimensions, remains as Palestine. It is hoped that this paper will pave the way to a better understanding of the concept of a Palestinian home.	[Shamallakh, Mohammed Lami S.

Hence, this article presents the acquisition of English grammar among Malay-English bilingual primary school children. Seven nine-year-old children, who have attended the same primary school which employed the Standard Based Curriculum for Primary Schools (KSSR) syllabus for 2 years (i.e., since they were 7 years old) became the subject of this study. The speech output of the children was elicited from two communicative tasks. Their English grammatical acquisition was then analysed using the Processability Theory (PT) framework. Other than the school environment, the children's home language factor was also examined. The results indicate that other than the home language environmental factor, the children's language aptitude also contributes to their English grammatical acquisition. In terms of PT's developmental stages, it was also found that the children's acquisition of English morphology adheres to the stages predicted by PT. The findings also lend credence to PT's typological applicability across different populations.

Past research has shown that sharing illness experience provides emotional support which surpasses traditional face to face support. In addition, studies also suggest that online sharing of illness experience can be both therapeutic as well as beneficial for cancer patients. Thus, exploring cancer discourse on media is important in enhancing understanding of the nature and characteristics of cancer discourse as constructed on social media. This is especially important in breast cancer illness, in the Malaysian context in which survival rate remains low due to lack of awareness and reluctance to perform screening. Hence, a total of three personal blogs written by breast cancer survivors from Malaysia were examined in this study. Taking a discourse analytic perspective, this study explored the positions taken by bloggers when constructing their illness experience and how these positions are realised through the different discursive strategies and linguistic devices. The findings provide insights into how breast cancer patients position themselves when they share their illness experience online. Understanding this new form of illness sharing provides an avenue to better understand breast cancer patients' journey and their struggles, and the different roles relevant parties can play in their own health care management and information.

J	Almahasheer, MB				Almahasheer, Muneerah Bader			Winds of Change: Heterotopias in Nimah Nawwab's The Unfurling	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						gender; heterotopia; Saudi Arabian poets; feminism; Nawwab	WOMEN	This paper examines a Saudi Arabian poet, Nimah Ismail Nawwab's collection of poetry, The Unfurling (2004). It suggests that her poetry upend traditional stereotypes of Arab and Saudi women as they demonstrate a relationship between the literal and figurative space and social change, particularly in relation to gender and culture. Thus, they occupy and define what Michel Foucault describes as a heterotopic space - a space that stands apart from others. The creation of the space allows for a new understanding of Arabic culture, particularly in relations to the experiences of women. Through a thematic analysis of the poems, the paper contends that Nawwab's poems uniquely reflects heterotopia as they document social changes, particularly in relations to gendered shifts in the Saudi Arabian landscape. As women experience transgressive responses to social change around the world, they not only create a space that retains a strong connection to the patriarchal history of the Middle East and the Muslim world, that space in itself is a unique space within a space. Nawwab puts women at the centre of each experience, demonstrating the creation of a larger space for the female self while physically maintaining the same order of the society.

M.; Hashim, Ruzy Suliza			Architectures of Enmity in Andre Dubus III's The Garden of Last Days	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						American novel; The Garden of Last Days; Andre Dubus III; Geopolitical postcolonial approach; 'Islamic' antagonism		In the aftermath of 9/11 terrorist attacks, Islam and Muslims became the subject of representation in the American literary milieu. American novelist Andre Dubus III was one of those who have appropriated the attacks directly by characterizing 9/11 hijackers within his bestseller novel, The Garden of Last Days (2009). This paper sets out to investigate Andre Dubus' III demonstration of Islam and Muslims in line with their association with terrorism and intolerance towards non-Muslims. We also seek to contextualize Dubus' exemplification of the Muslim Other within pertaining geopolitical and Orientalist inferences. As post-9/11 literature has been highly immersed in the cultural, colonial and political ramifications of the attacks, both postcolonial and geopolitical concepts are incorporated into a geopolitical postcolonial approach. Geopolitical postcolonial approach is meant to illustrate the narrative's exemplification of Islam and Muslim in view of the geopolitical consequences of 9/11 attacks as well as the long established Western knowledge about the Orient, Orientalism. Architectures of enmity are the deliberated schemes exploited to shape the other into a differentiated and abhorred adversary to initiate violence against him/her. Dubus' architectures of enmity will be examined within four constructs, specifically, ` hatred,' ` Islamic agency,' ` clashing Islam' and ` Arabic antagonism.' In The Garden of Last Days, the Muslim Other is exemplified as the enemy of the West. Islam is illustrated as an antagonist ideology that leads Muslims to hate all non-Muslims. Through the geopolitical postcolonial lens we expose the circumstantial implications of these representations and relate them to their due context.	[Alosman, M.

It describes in detail the processes involved in the collection and selection of data and preprocessing of raw data, which includes data digitizing, cleansing and tagging. This paper also introduces the user interface for MaCFE with its built-in linguistic analysis features. MaCFE was designed and developed with the intention of providing corpus linguistic researchers with the avenue to explore the field and for ESP/EAP practitioners in Malaysia, as the resources for the development of local-based ESP/EAP curriculum and teaching and learning materials. It would also serve as a learning avenue for future financial professionals in their training. MaCFE corpus has approximately 4.3 million words from 1472 electronic documents retrieved from banks and financial institutions' official websites. At present, users can make queries to the MaCFE database using its built-in concordancer. In the future, its language-data-processing facilities will be expanded to include tools for keyword, wordlist and word collocations queries.

J	Taerungruang, S; Aroonmanakun, W				Taerungruang, Supawat; Aroonmanakun, Wirote			Constructing an Academic Thai Plagiarism Corpus for Benchmarking Plagiarism Detection Systems	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						plagiarism; Thai plagiarism detection; corpus creation; language resources; natural language processing		Plagiarism is a major problem in the academic world. It does not only undermine the credibility of educational institutions, but also interrupts the processes of creating knowledge in the academic community. To lessen this problem, many plagiarism detection systems have been developed to detect plagiarized texts in academic works. In this paper, we describe the design and process in creating an academic Thai plagiarism corpus. This corpus is necessary for training and testing plagiarism detection systems for Thai. In order to make this corpus a comprehensive representation of plagiarism, the data has been divided into various types based on the degree of the linguistic mechanisms used in plagiarism. Data compiled in our corpus comes through two main methods: manually created by participants and automatically generated by a program. After the corpus is created, its validity is verified by using three measurements: a measurement of similarity between suspicious texts at the character level, a measurement of similarity between suspicious texts at the word level, and a comparison of different types of data compiled in the corpus based on the similarity measured. The results of the analyses indicate that the corpus created by the proposed methods is effective in training and testing plagiarism detection systems.

A total of eighteen narrative texts closely associated with the undergraduates' personal experiences were prepared by the researchers for a reading-writing intervention programme. This quasi-experimental study involved 192 undergraduates who participated in a nine-week intervention programme. The pre-test and post-test mean scores indicated significant differences in the undergraduates' content development, lexical variety and grammatical accuracy. The findings show that there is an improvement in content, lexical variety and grammatical accuracy in students' essays. The undergraduates' improvement in the content development aspect shows that reading texts which supplement information common to the undergraduates' background will help them in their content development specifically and writing performance on the whole. The study also shows that the reading materials, vocabulary input and comprehension exercises helped the undergraduates to improve on their use of lexical variety and grammatical structure. The results support the notion that comprehensible input (Krashen, 1984) and appropriate language instructional exercises for writing intervention enable engaged learning by the students. The study therefore recommends that teachers should utilise authentic reading materials that are relevant to the background knowledge of the students in teaching writing to low English proficiency level undergraduates.

The implementation of this act was done through the National Language Act 1963 and the 1996 Education Act. Although various efforts have been made to ensure the widespread use of Malay language in government agencies, official programs as well as in the private sectors, there are still organisations which do not use the Malay language including public universities. The objective of this research is to investigate the use of Malay language in the management and administration of UKM. Questionnaire and structured interviews were employed as the primary research instrument. Respondents consisted of 562 UKM's management and administration staff. Structured interviews involved ten informants consisting of three categories, which are academic administrators, the management and professionals as well as implementers. A descriptive data analysis on frequency and percentage was conducted for data analysis. Meanwhile, structured interviews were analyzed using verbatim methods. The findings revealed that majority of respondents and informants supported the use of Bahasa Melayu in the management and administration and most respondents and informants also agreed on dual language use for UKM programs internationally. From the aspect on the use of Bahasa Melayu in official affairs in UKM, the study found that the use of Bahasa Melayu was the highest in documents and forms pertaining to administration. Meanwhile there is less usage of Bahasa Melayu in oral communication with clients from outside UKM. Data from the interviews showed that UKM staff fully support the proposal for the preparation of the Malay Language Guidelines on the Administration and Management at UKM. The implications of the study is that the guidelines on the use of Malay language in the management and administration at public universities is a necessity as a strategy to uphold the status of the Malay language.

J	Sridhanyarat, K				Sridhanyarat, Kietnawin			Thai Learners' Acquisition of L2 Collocations: An Interlanguage Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						interlanguage; L2 collocations; order of collocation acquisition; receptive and productive tasks; variability in L2 collocations	FORMULAIC SEQUENCES; SINGLE WORDS; VOCABULARY; ENGLISH; MODEL; 2ND-LANGUAGE; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS; ALPHA	The emergence of second language (L2) collocation studies has grabbed the attention of a number of scholars. However, few empirical studies from an interlanguage perspective have addressed the issue of how learners acquire L2 collocations. The current study investigated what grammatical and lexical collocations posed difficulty to Thai EFL learners and whether learners of different proficiency levels exhibited the same order of acquisition. The study also attempted to explore whether task differences significantly affected the learners' acquisition process. The participants were organized into a high proficiency group (N = 45) and a low proficiency group (N = 45). Receptive and productive tasks were devised to gauge the learners' collocation knowledge. In the receptive task, the learners were encouraged to identify errors. In the productive task, they were asked to write a correct collocate required for a certain context. The results illustrated that almost all target collocations were difficult for both advanced and basic groups. Only verb-preposition collocations did not pose any considerable difficulty to the advanced participants. In terms of acquisition order, there were palpable differences between the two groups. It was also discovered that the different tasks administered exerted a profound effect on the learners' order of collocation acquisition. The key findings are discussed in light of first language (L1) transfer, transfer of prior knowledge of a particular congruent collocation, familiarity with receptive tasks, and effects of both receptive and productive tasks. The findings suggest that teachers can teach students a group of words rather than individual words by utilizing meaningful materials oriented toward specific difficult collocations or receptive-productive integration tasks. Teachers can also encourage their students to practice using frequency-based collocations and dictionaries in English classes.

Grafting Eco-Diasporic Identity in Randa Abdel-Fattah's Selected Novels	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Grafting; eco-diasporic identity; Randa Abdel-Fattah; Muslim young adult; homeland semiosphere		This paper is based on three selected novels entitled Does My Head Look Big In This? (2005), Ten Things I Hate About Me (2006), and Where The Streets Had A Name (2008) written by Randa Abdel-Fattah (1979), a Palestinian-Egyptian Australian Muslim diasporic writer. In this article, we examine the manifestations of grafting eco-diasporic identity by Abdel-Fattah in order to address how identity graft is operated by interacting with ideology, culture and nature in the contexts of the host land and the homeland as represented in the three selected novels. Using Colin Richards' theory of graft as a framework, we explore identity contestations of Muslim young adults in the novels from an ecocritical and diasporic perspectives. In the novel Does My Head Look Big In This?, the images of Amal's sense of being marginalised in the semiosphere of the host land and the sense of self-respect of her Muslim rootedness and heritage of the homeland semiosphere frame the fractured graft of identity. The character of Jamilah, in Ten Things I Hate About Me displays genuine manifestations of the collective emblem of the grafted identity. Finally, the symbol of the iconic jar of the homeland soil and its potentiality of regenerating Hayaat's identity in Where the Streets Had A Name exhibits the ecological semiosphere in which the grafted identity is shaped. The current discussion, therefore, offers fresh insights into allowing a new horizon for identity grafting in Abdel-Fattah's works as well as other writers within the tradition of Muslim Diasporic Literature.

J	Azman, H; Mahadhir, M				Azman, Hazita; Mahadhir, Mahanita			Application of the Vignette Technique in a Qualitative Paradigm	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						qualitative research paradigm; vignettes; Linguistics Anthropology; heritage languages; mixed-heritage	MIXED-HERITAGE ADULTS; RACIAL IDENTITY; METHODOLOGY; ME; PEOPLE; BLACK; WORK	Vignettes are short depictions of typical scenarios intended to elicit responses that will reveal values, perceptions, impressions, and accepted social norms. This article describes how vignettes were developed and used in a qualitative linguistics anthropology study to elicit those responses as experienced by mixed-heritage individuals in attaining heritage legitimacy despite their inability to speak their heritage languages. The vignettes were administered during in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Eight participants were asked to reflect and respond to prompts which revolved around typical experiences where speakers were limited by their lack of heritage language proficiency. Based on the vignettes, the participants described how the speakers would linguistically strategize to compensate their limited abilities in using the heritage languages. At the same time, the cultural means through which speakers gain legitimacy within their own heritage groups were also identified. Essentially the use of the vignettes facilitated in generating data that would have otherwise been challenging to elicit given the culturally sensitive as well as highly private nature of the phenomena under investigation. The application of vignettes provided a less intrusive and non-threatening way of obtaining perceptions, opinions, beliefs and attitudes based on responses or comments to stories depicting lived experiences of the participants that the researcher is otherwise not privy to as an observer. However, application of this data elicitation technique can prove challenging for the researcher.

J	Hung, BP				Bui Phu Hung			Vietnamese Students Learning the Semantics of English Prepositions	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						teaching prepositions; metaphors; English language teaching; image schemas	LEARNERS	Prepositions are significant in sentences because they are used as markers to join words and phrases into a sentence. Teachers usually teach prepositions by providing students with explanations about the usage of prepositions and then gives examples as illustrations. These examples are often accompanied by vivid pictures. This method, however, does not provide students information on how to analyze the different senses of prepositions. This current study, thus, aims to explore the effectiveness and students' opinions of new pedagogical instructions on ten English prepositions, namely above, among, at, behind, beside, between, in, in front of, on and under. The research design involved a quasi-experimental design adopting pretest-posttest between-group research. Out of 95 students who volunteered to participate in the study, 38 participants were selected. They were divided into two groups for the new cognitive linguistic approach and traditional instructions. Pretest and posttest were used to discover the participants' improvements. The participants' opinions of the cognitive treatment were also investigated. The findings illustrate that the group that was treated with CL-based instructions outperformed the traditional group in the posttest although they gained a comparable mean score in the pretest. Most participants also provided positive responses to the new treatment. The findings suggests that cognitive treatment could be employed to assist students in improving their understanding and retaining the metaphorical meanings of the prepositions.

The existence of Kerinci-language in Malaysia is due to the mobility and migration of speakers who came from West Sumatra, Indonesia. Both Kerinci languages spoken in those two countries have different set of sound system. However, Kerinci phonological system in Malaysia has not been theoretically discussed.. The sample selected in the Kerinci Malay community in Kampung Sungai Lui, Hulu Langat are aged between 50 years and above. Data was obtained through observations and interviews. The recording was then transcribed for the purpose of analyzing and explaining the sound changes. The study employs the generative phonology framework to explain the changes of /s/ to [h]. The phonological processes does not only involve changes to segment /s/, but also affects preceeding vocal sounds such as /a, i, u/. The results showed that vowel /a, i, u/ that precedes the segment /s/ in Kerinci will experience a phonological process and produce a different surface from each other. The phonological processes involved are vocal raising rule that change /as/ to [epsilon h] and vowel reduction rule that change /is/ to [ae h] and /us/ to [awh]. However, any changes require a description of the program formulas to describe the process that first occurs. The results show that the changes of segment /s/ to [h] only occur after the implementation of the rules that change the vowels in order to comply to the conditions specified on common stated rules.

J	Jafarigohar, M; Khanjani, A				Jafarigohar, Manoochehr; Khanjani, Amin			Text Difficulty Effect on Metacognitive Reading Strategy Use among EFL Learners	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						metacognitive reading strategy; text difficulty; Key English Test; Preliminary English Test; First Certificate in English	COMPREHENSION; AWARENESS; FLUENCY	Reading is one of the most integral academic skills in learning a foreign language. According to Anderson (2003), it is the interaction of four factors: the reader, the text, fluent reading and strategic reading. A large number of studies have indeed recognized the importance of the metacognitive reading strategies (MRSs) and text difficulty in reading comprehension. However, the effect of text difficulty on the learners' MRSs use has not been paid due attention in the literature. Accordingly, this study, employing a within-subject design, investigated the effects of text difficulty on MRSs use. Sixty Iranian intermediate EFL learners from two private institutes were asked to answer the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory questionnaire (Mokhtari & Reichard, 2002) at three different times, focusing on pre-intermediate (KET), intermediate (PET), and upper intermediate (FCE) texts. To get a better picture of the EFL learners' MRSs, an oral interview was also carried out on 10 participants. The results of the statistical analyses showed that text difficulty had significant effect on metacognitive reading strategy use with problem-solving strategies being affected most. The interview data revealed that the participants in this study benefited from various MRSs such as planning, summarizing and translating especially when the text was difficult. The implications of the study concern foreign language teaching, teacher training and curriculum design with regard to the selection of appropriate reading materials and methodology for EFL learners. Moreover, EFL instructors need to consider the difficulty level of reading materials so as to trigger the learners' metacognitive reading strategy use.

J	Seong, GS; Ean, BP				Seong, Goh Sang; Ean, Boh Phaik			An Analysis Of Chengyu Translation Strategies Into Malay	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						chengyu; chengyu translation strategy; proverbs; transference of meaning; Chinese-Malay translation		Chengyu is a subcategory of Chinese proverbs, made up of four characters in a beautiful and poetic manner that also expresses certain meanings which are either explicit or implied. This paper discusses strategies used in the translation of chengyu into Malay. Data involved a total of 208 chengyu collected manually from the novel Jia, a great literary work produced by the national writer of China, Ba Jin, in the early 20th century and from its translation entitled Keluarga, a Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka publication (1995). The theoretical framework waseclectic, which includes the definition of translation by Larson (1984), the definition and categorization of chengyu by Wu Zhan Kun and Wang Qin as well as chengyu translation strategies by Chen Wen Bo. This study shows that translation of chengyu is dynamic in nature. It was found that the application of translation strategies were influenced by three main factors, namely the type of chengyu present in the source text, the context of the sentence where it is present as well as the similarities and differences between the thinking concepts of the source and target languages. Among the strategies detected are symbol translation, meaning translation, partial translation, omission, pragmatic translation and literal translation. In this case, the partial translation strategy by Chen can be expanded in scope to be used in the translation of chengyu where the front and back structures differ in meaning. This study also found two new strategies, the couplet strategy which involves a combination of any two strategies and also the natural equivalent strategy. Therefore, fully understanding the meanings of chengyu and applying an appropriate and effective translation strategy is crucial to ensure accuracy in reproducing the meaning while maintaining the same symbol and form in the target language.

The research focused on how exposure frequency or the number of encounters with the target words in reading passages affected different aspects of vocabulary knowledge such as receptive and productive knowledge of orthography, parts of speech, associations and meaning. In general, the findings (based on ANOVA and its non-parametric version, Kruskal-Wallis whenever normality requirement was not met) indicated that incidental exposure to second language (L2) words through reading passages might be conducive to vocabulary acquisition and retention. Particularly, it was revealed that as the number of encounters to L2 target words increased, the learners were more successful in acquiring different aspects of vocabulary knowledge. In this regard, the effect of exposure frequency was significant in both the immediate and delayed post-test for all aspects of vocabulary knowledge when the amount of exposure increased from one encounter to seven. Nevertheless, the analyses of the scores obtained from the seven subtests suggested that the effect of exposure frequency may vary for different aspects of vocabulary knowledge. Moreover, there was no marked distinction between receptive and productive aspects of vocabulary knowledge. However, the scores on the semantic subtests revealed that increasing the number of exposure frequency could mostly affect the receptive knowledge of meaning and form as well as productive knowledge of associations. These aspects were also more vulnerable with the passing of time. It is recommended that English teachers put incidental vocabulary acquisition within the perspective of a longitudinal, intensive and systematic vocabulary recycling where the learners' knowledge of vocabulary is reinforced and accumulated over time. Moreover, English teachers may make use of form-focused or explicit instruction to compensate for any lack of time or their learners' need for more incidental exposure to L2 vocabulary.

Rasdi			ANIMAL SYMBOLISMS IN SEMAI PROVERBS	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						proverbs; Semai ethnic group; Semai language; animal; cultural elements		Amongst the tribes which inhabit the forests, the Semai tribe are very good nature observers. It is inevitable that they utilize the natural environment as the best material to express sense, desires and as a reference for the comparison of human nature or behavior. Their rich natural heritage allows the Semai figurative language to use the nature and behaviour of animals as comparisons to humans. This study therefore examines the elements of animals used in Semai proverbs. Data from the interview of five respondents were analyzed and then commented based on Hymes's (1972) ethnographic framework that focuses on four fundamental points, namely situation, application, structure and activity function. It is found that the animals and plants used in the Semai proverbs are those encountered in their daily life and are relevent to the ethnic's lifestyle. The present study is important to help develop a better understanding of this ethnic group and also to bridge the sociocultural gap among the ethnics in Malaysia. The analysis of these proverbs reveal that the Semai are very good observers of nature and are able to combine the natural environment with their daily activities. The inclusion of animalistic elements in their proverbs shows that animals and humans share some common characteristics. Such inclusion implies that the values and norms of the Semai tribes are derived from and based on the environment, which they perceive as the best teacher	[Mahali, Saidatul Nornis Hj.] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Pusat Penataran Ilmu & Bahasa, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia; [Saamah, Mohd.

Therefore, this initial study will attempt to make the most of the Kedah dialect in order to explain the characteristics and elucidate the syntactic structure of wh-question word, 'sapa.'. Initial observation portrays that the wh-question has two positions. The first position is known as the final position or also known as in-situ. The second position is known as initial position or also known as movement. The in-situ characteristic of, 'sapa'. is not in conflict with the standard grammar which holds across the board for Malay language that all question words must occur sentence initially and attached by a particle '-kah' or stay insitu at the final position without the particle. The data for this research were gathered through a field work at Baling, Kubang Pasu, Kuala Nerang dan Kubang Rotan. This paper elucidated the characteristics of, 'sapa'. by employing the syntactic analysis based on the Minimalist Program framework (Chomsky, 1995). This study found that the in-situ or moved characteristics of the question word is due to the OP (Operator), VAR (variable) and the [+/- in-situ] factors, which are manipulated by the question word 'sapa'.

J	Heng, CS; Ebrahimi, SF				Heng, Chan Swee; Ebrahimi, Seyed Foad			Marked Themes As Context Frames In Research Article Abstracts	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						context frame; marked theme; research article abstracts; academic genre; rhetorical organisation		Research article abstract (RA abstract) is an important area of investigation. This importance comes from the role that it plays in the scientific community that is used to serve different writings and reading functions and purposes. It helps writers to squeeze significant information and findings of a whole research article into a compact unit and to manage information flow to be communicated in the scientific community (Martin, 2003; Ventola, 1994). This paper attempted to investigate the discourse functions (context frames) of marked themes used in Applied Linguistics and Economics research article abstracts. Sixty research article abstracts from the two disciplines published in journals of Applied Linguistics and Oxford Economic Papers in 2010 to 2011 issues were analyzed. The results revealed a significant difference in the use of validation context frame across the two disciplines. However, there were more similarities than differences regarding use of context frames in the abstracts from the two disciplines. This is discussed in the context of general and specific genre expectations as well as textual choices exercised to give text coherence. Findings of this study also supported the proposition that one micro level feature, in the form of marked theme, as thematic function, has the potential to signal the development of macro structure and rhetorical organization in abstract writing for scientific article writing.

Samad			Production And Perception Of English Word Final Stops By Malay Speakers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						acoustic; Malay accented English; spectrographic analysis; voicing contrast; second language learning	PHONATION; VOWELS	A few influential speech studies have been carried out using established speech learning models, which confirmed that the analysis of first language (L1) and second language (L2) at a phonemic level provides only a partial view of deeper relationships between languages in contact. Therefore, studies focusing on cross-language phonetic differences as a causative factor in L2 learner difficulties have been proposed to understand second language learners' (L2) speech production and how listeners respond perceptually to the phonetic properties of L2. This paper presents a study of the production and perception of the final stops by English learners (L2) whose first language is Malay (L1). A total of 23 students, comprising 16 male and 7 female Malay subjects (L1 as Malay and their L2 as English) with normal hearing and speech development participated in this study. A short interview was conducted in order to gain background information about information about each subject, to introduce them to the study, to inform them about the process of recording, the materials to be used in the recording session, and how the materials should be managed during recording time. Acoustic measurements of selected segments occurring in word final positions (via spectrographic analysis, syllable rhyme duration and phonation) were taken. Results of the voicing contrast realisation in Malay accented English and Malaysian listeners' perceptual identification/ discrimination abilities with final voiced/voiceless stops in Malay and English are presented and discussed. The findings revealed that the Malay students' realisation of final stops in L2 is largely identical to their L1. In addition, the results also showed that accurate 'perception' may not always lead to accurate 'production'.	[Shahidi, A. H.; Aman, Rahim; Kechot, Ab.

J	Abdullah, FS; Hosseini, K				Abdullah, Faiz Sathi; Hosseini, Kobra			Discursive Enactment of Power In Iranian High School EFL Classrooms	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						power relations; classroom discourse; critical discourse analysis; EFL learning	DISCOURSE	Teachers' dominance in teaching environments has been criticized as an oppressive educational practice by critical theories of education. While critical pedagogy that espouses a problem-posing model of education has sought to promote a more equitable and dialogical teacher-student partnership and to transform the oppressive conditions of the ESL/EFL classroom, the claimed potential of the approach has had only limited success in practice. Drawing upon Fairclough's approach to critical discourse analysis to make for a principled analysis of EFL classroom practice, this study investigated the discoursal features of unequal power relations in Iranian high school EFL classes. The data was collected via observation of two classrooms, one located in an urban area and the other in a semi-urban area of Iran. The analysis of the observation data, which included transcripts of classroom lessons as well as field notes, indicated that teachers played a disproportionately dominant role to the extent that the students were kept apparently passive and powerless via a range of discursive strategies including maximizing teacher-controlled talking time, turn-taking, topic control, modes of meaning-construction, and elicitation strategies. The findings of this study are expected to provide critical and emancipatory insights into ESL/EFL classroom practice and contribute to the transformation of its status quo.

Automated essay marking systems developed from the late 1960s have attempted to prove that computers can evaluate essays as competently as human expert. Several computer-based essay marking (CBEM) systems have been developed to mark students' essays and they can be divided into semi-automated and automated systems. This paper illustrates the development of an Automated Tool for Detecting Errors in Tenses (ATDEiT(TM)). The first phase analysed the errors found in 400 essays written by 112 English as second language (ESL) learners at tertiary level using Markin 3.1 software. The results showed that the most common errors were found in tenses. This finding led to the second phase of the research, which was the design of an automated marking tool. Consequently, the techniques and algorithm for error analysis marking tool for ESL	[Maasum, Tengku Nor Rizan Tengku Mohd; Stapa, Siti Hamin; Darus, Saadiyah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Sch Language Studies & Linguist, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Omar, Nazlia; Ab Aziz, Mohd Juzaiddin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia	Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia	Maasum, TNRTM (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Sch Language Studies & Linguist, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.	tntm@ukm.my; sitihami@ukm.my; no@ftsm.ukm.my; din@ftsm.ukm.my; adi@ukm.my	Omar, Nazlia/L-9901-2019; Darus, Saadiyah/I-2918-2019	Darus, Saadiyah/0000-0002-6832-1535; Tg Mohamad Maasum, Tengku Nor Rizan/0000-0002-5330-2710; Omar, Nazlia/0000-0002-8173-8933	e-ScienceFund [01-01-02 SF0092]	e-ScienceFund	The research team is grateful for the research grant received from e-ScienceFund 01-01-02 SF0092.

The objectives of this study are to investigate (1) the level of oral Arabic practice among UiTM students, (2) the correlation between oral Arabic practice and resource management strategies which consist of four sub components, namely, time and environment strategy, effort regulation strategy, help seeking strategy and peer learning strategy, and (3) the differences in the use of resource management strategies among students with different level of oral Arabic practice. This is a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative study using an adapted questionnaire of self-regulated learning strategies and interviews with students. The quantitative data were collected from 455 samples using the stratified random sampling technique. The study found that (1) students used moderately oral Arabic, and their practice outside the classroom was lower than inside the classroom, (2) there were significant correlations between oral Arabic practice and the use of peer learning strategy as well as time and study management strategy, and (3) there were significant differences in the use of peer learning strategy among students with different level of oral Arabic practice. This study suggests that the use of peer learning strategy as well as time and study management strategy have to be increased in order to increase the oral Arabic practice among students, such implementing collaborative grouping activities and using peer assistants which are officially selected among students themselves.

If left unchecked, these negative norms of behavior and attitude could be institutionalized and gradually become part of our social and cultural code. Recent research findings indicate a strong presence of gender bias and linguistic sexism in the language and content of educational materials such as textbooks and practice books. This paper addresses linguistic sexism and gender role stereotyping in Malaysian English language school textbooks. Specifically, it looks at: If sexism is inculcated very early in life, how is it inculcated and what is inculcated? Are our school textbooks indirectly and unconsciously functioning as a conduit for the indoctrination and enforcement of sexism and sex role conformity among young Malaysians? This paper presents the preliminary findings of an on-going research study that documents the extent of gender bias and linguistic sexism in selected Malaysian primary and secondary school English language textbooks.
