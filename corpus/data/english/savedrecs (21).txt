GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Text Simplification; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Pragmatic Adaptation; Professional Communication; Literary Texts	SENTENCES	Narrowly specialized information is addressed to a limited circle of professionals though it provokes interest among people without specialized education. This gives rise to a need for the popularization of scientific information. This process is carried out through simplified texts as a kind of secondary texts that are directly aimed at the addressee. Age, language proficiency and background knowledge are the main features which are usually taken into consideration by the author of the secondary text who makes changes in the text composition, as well as in its pragmatics, semantics and syntax. This article analyses traditional approaches to text simplification, computer simplification and summarization. The authors compare humanauthored simplification of literary texts with the newest trends in computer simplification to promote further development of machine simplification tools. It has been found that the samples of simplified scientific texts seem to be more natural than the samples of simplified literary texts since technical background knowledge can be processed with machine tools. The authors have come to the conclusion that literary and technical texts should imply different approaches for adaptation and simplification. In addition, personal readers' experience plays a great part in finding the implications in literary texts. In this respect it might be reasonable to create separate engines for simplifying and adapting texts from diverse spheres of knowledge.

This popularity is emanated from the curiosity and interest in the west that was raised after 9/11 and the ensuing political aftermath. Written to unveil the lives of Iranian women in the Islamic Republic, these diasporic narratives have been 'growingly commodified, circulated and consumed uncritically' in the west. Much ink has been spilled on the surge of diasporic Iranian women's life narratives, the politics of their reception and circulation in the west, and their liability to furthering imperialist ideologies. We have no intention of continuing the debate over how some of these life narratives facilitate and promote imperialistic agendas. Rather, we would like to embark on an untrodden path, a fascinating journey through the growing body of life narratives by and about Iranian women from inside the Islamic Republic, equipped with accounts that vitiate the orientalist assumptions and diasporic narratives' generalisations. This paper seeks to introduce and analyse these alternative narratives. By developing a theory of the `insider within,' this paper exhibits how alternative narratives from within can serve as a better model for understanding Iran and Iranian women.

An analysis of the Sang Kancil stories was conducted by comparing them to these Trickster stories from other cultures to identify the similarities in the trope of the trickster to determine the ways in which Trickster tales have been used to convey messages of resistance against injustice and impart moral lessons, as well as pointing out the importance of intelligence and wit to solve problems. To limit the corpus due to the countless different Trickster tales around the world, we have only used these two animal tricksters who are the most congruent with Sang Kancil. Following from this, the article examines the commonalities in the neo-archetypal elements present in all of the studied tale types which correspond to the ways in which these tricksters are Andersonian cultural artefacts in the cultural imaginary, disseminated through both oral and print mediums. This is due to the well-documented and widespread sources of print literature on both Brer Rabbit and Reynard the Fox. By studying the commonalities of the tales through the archetypal elements present, Sang Kancil may be determined to be an Andersonian cultural artefact in the cultural imagination.

J	Asl, MP; Abdullah, NFL				Asl, Moussa Pourya; Abdullah, Nurul Farhana Low			Circulation of the Discourse of American Nationalism through Allegiance to Consumer Citizenship in Jhumpa Lahiri's The Namesake	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						capitalism; consumerism; homogenization; Indian diaspora; The Namesake	ORIENTALISM	This essay examines South Asian American writer Jhumpa Lahiri's literary engagement with the re-Orientalization and sexualization of a collective subject described as Indian diaspora within the context of contemporary consumer culture. The essay explores the relationship between Lahiri's best-selling novel, The Namesake ( 2003) and its contemporary society by taking the point of view that diasporic literary writing is an example of a Foucauldian social apparatus-a new form of governmentality-that was used for the production of American nationalism after the events of 9/11. Here, we expose the material and ideological specificities that formulate a particular group of women as powerless consumers in the context of the post-cold war period. More precisely, we focus on the ideological elements of the routine consuming experiences of these women to unpack the manner in which the macropolitics of economic and political structures influence the micropolitics of the everyday experiences of Indian immigrants in the capitalist society. In Lahiri's fiction, the Indian woman's body-in its both first-and second-generation types-is figured as a deliberate site of economic and erotic excess that fundamentally complies with the contemporary heteronormative ideology of patriarchal capitalism, wherein the woman is essentially treated as the archetypal consumer. In effect, as the essay further argues, Lahiri's fiction dances to the tune of Western marketing demands of production and consumption.

J	Quinto, EJM; Santos, JC				Quinto, Edward Jay Mansarate; Santos, Juan Carlos			Abrogation and Appropriation in Selected Pre-war Philippine Short Stories in English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						abrogation and appropriation; textual strategies; postcolonial literature; Manuel Arguilla; Philippine short stories		Postcolonial literature is characterized by abrogation and appropriation, in which writers take the language of the former imperial power and re-place it in a discourse fully adapted to the colonized place. Studies on literary traditions of former colonies have shown how native writers advance local collective sentiments. In this paper, the short stories of Manuel Arguilla, a literary icon of Philippine short stories in English, were analyzed using Ashcroft et al.'s (1989) textual strategies in postcolonial writing to unearth the strategies used by the writer in valorizing the use of an abrogated and appropriated "english" in expressing native sentiments. Qualitative content analysis of Arguilla's four short stories suggests that the use of untranslated words and glossing were the most abundant strategies used to abrogate and appropriate the colonizer's language. Further, thematic analysis of the stories point to four themes relating to how the author valorized the use of an english in expressing native sentiments: expression of an authentic self, expression of an authentic place, subtle form of subversion and advancement of Filipino identities and ideologies. These findings suggest that, like in other postcolonial literary traditions, postcolonial Philippine short stories, as seen from the writing of Manuel Arguilla, are typical of what Ashcroft et al. (1989) advance as a paradigmatic tension between the colonizer and the colonized, but are unique in that they serve as medium through which to voice out local Filipino sentiments and aspirations. Some implications for postcolonial literature are discussed.

To fill this gap in literature and to further explore the relationship between surrounding linguistic context and learning, and retention of new words, this study was set out to investigate whether systematically changing the amount of surrounding context has any significant effect on learning and retention of new vocabulary items. Forty-seven Iranian female advanced EFL learners within the age range of 18-24 were employed in this study and were taught 100 new vocabulary items (unknown words) in ten sessions and in three different contextual conditions (i. e., 1. one known word, one unknown/new word; 2. two known words, one unknown/new word; and 3. three known words, one unknown/new word). Known words for contextual conditions were selected from the previous units of World Pass which the participants had covered before. Furthermore, Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary was used for some of the contexts. The researchers made an attempt to use simple and high-frequency words from the units covered and/or from the dictionary. The results of one-way ANOVA for both immediate and delayed post-tests revealed that extending the number of known words (that is, adding to the amount of surrounding linguistic context) does not have any significant effect on learning and retention of new vocabulary items. It can be claimed that two or three known words context is still as small as one word context and they do not have differing contextual roles. Further results and implications are discussed in the paper.

J	Heidari-Shahreza, MA; Moinzadeh, A				Heidari-Shahreza, Mohammad Ali; Moinzadeh, Ahmad			Teaching Word Stress Patterns Of English Using A Musically-simulated Technique	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						word stress; Iranian EFL learners; musically-simulated patterns; Persian language; teaching stress		The correct placement of word-level stress is a main concern in EFL speech intelligibility training. It is particularly important for EFL learners who have a drastically different stress system in their L1 (e.g. Persian). These learners usually misplace the primary stress in their L2 which subsequently may interrupt the flow of communication and leads to unintelligibility. Therefore, the present study explored the effect of musically-simulated patterns, as a new teaching technique, on the learning of word stress patterns of English. Musically-simulated patterns were defined in the context of the study as impressionistic patterns which were acoustically similar to word stress patterns of English. 30 Iranian EFL elementary learners at a language institute participated in the study. The new technique was used to teach four stress patterns of two- and three-syllable English words. The results of the posttest indicated that the participants in the experimental group (who listened to musically-simulated patterns) obtained significantly higher scores. Moreover, two-syllable words appeared to be more positively influenced by these musical patterns. It is suggested that L1 negative transfer and the inherent cognitive complexity of the stress patterns may contribute to the varying effect of these musical patterns. Finally, the possible applications of using this technique at both levels of material development and classroom practice are discussed.

Based on traditional Malay sayings, poems, proverbs and verses, Hashim Hj. Musa (2008) was able to establish 26 core Malay psyches or social character traits. Those who were able to adopt these traits were considered to have high moral and ethical values and were highly respected by the Malay society. They were regarded as the gentiles and has acquired three noble traits, namely, (1) good-natured, well- mannered and urbane, (2) polite, sensible and insightful in speech, and (3) wise and knowledgable. In oder to discover the condition of the Malays today, a study was carried out to determine the degrees of conformity or divergence from these 26 core social character traits. Findings showed that the Malays still retain their religious, ethical and moral values, and basic knowledge, but are weak in upbringing and nurturing traits resulting in negative and defective social behaviour and inablity to put into practice what they know. This is the main factor that gives rise to social ills and decadence in the Malay society of the past and present. Thus efforts and striving to nuture, instil and redevelop those 26 core social character traits among the Malays of today, is of paramount importance to rekindle and regenerate their inner qualities and strength in order to achieve the qualities of of par excellence.

As such, to acquire this grafology is time consuming. Transliteration method which translates Arabic grafology into Latin grafology can be used to reduce that period of time. There was no empirical study conducted to test its usefulness on Malay students. Hence, this study was carried out to highlight the following: first, to explore the Arabic teachers' views toward the method of transliteration and second, to examine the extent it was used by the Arabic students as one of their learning strategies. Data was collected through two instruments; questionnaires and interviews. 344 students from UiTM were chosen to complete the questionnaires. Whereas the respondents involved in the interviews were 10 Arabic lecturers from five higher learning institutions in Terengganu and Kelantan and 10 UiTM students. The results of the study revealed that some of the lecturers supported transliteration use while others rejected with their own arguments. However, most of the students involved had shown positive attitudes toward the use of this method.

It begins with a discussion on the complexity and fluidity of male sexuality and how it is mediated through the absence and presence of homosexuality, men's articulation of sexuality in the public and private realms and men's fear and insecurity in developing intimate relationship with each other. The paper then presents a brief overview of the depictions of male sexuality in Malaysian literature in English, which is followed by discussions on the absence and presence of homosexuality in Go East and the transgression of male sexuality in Neighbours. The paper concludes that fictional Malay men in Karim Raslan's short narratives not only transgress the concept of male sexuality but also the socio-cultural and religious norms and boundaries, offering alternative insights into mainstream ideas about sexuality and sexual identity in the contemporary Malaysian society.

Research that use offline learning measures to examine effects of glosses on learning found that they are useful in facilitating vocabulary acquisition and overall text comprehension. This paper reports a small-scale study that combined an offline measure of learning with online measures of reading behaviour in an attempt to provide a more comprehensive picture of reading and learning with glossed passages. The eye tracking methodology was used to provide insights into the cognitive processing of reading. A group of 15 university undergraduates read four glossed and non-glossed passages in English and answered comprehension questions afterwards. The findings revealed that glossed and non-glossed passages were read differently with readers attempting to integrate glosses and text information in the former. Vocabulary knowledge was found to predict comprehension performance and to some extent, the processing of glosses. The findings also suggest that moderate amount of attention could be more useful for comprehension as too much attention appeared to indicate comprehension difficulties. Suggestions to promote more strategic and useful processing of glossed passages are discussed.

J	Jalaluddin, NH; Halim, WAAWA; Radzi, H				Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah; Halim, Wan Athirah Adilah Wan Abdul; Radzi, Harishon			Dialect Revisited in Terengganu After Three Decades: A Geolinguistic Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Terengganu dialect; geolinguistics; isogloss; dialect revisited; dialect continuum	LANGKAWI	The study of dialects, which used to be traditional through the search of phonological differences, has evolved into a geographical study, historical study, and theoretical data sources. Today dialect studies have undergone innovations by synergizing technology in isogloss descriptions and incorporating non-linguistic elements in explaining the spread of the dialect itself. For the sake of this knowledge's continuity, efforts to fill the void of the study of dialect by specializing in the Terengganu dialect have been made. This dialect was once described three decades ago and certainly needed new input. This study aims to re-investigate the Terengganu dialect features, produce isogloss lines that separate the Terengganu and Kelantan dialects and prove this dialect's dominance along the east coast. This study is a field study involving 500 speakers with 64 village points. It involves the elderly, adults and adolescents. All respondents were asked to pronounce forty selected lexicals based on the Swadesh list in addition to interviews to obtain accurate sounds. The study results found that all phonological features remained the same three decades ago; only phonetic inputs and phonological rules were refined to meet linguistic standards. Secondly, the exact isogloss limiting Terengganu and Kelantan's dialects have been successfully mapped along with the exact village points. Finally, there is a chain or continuum of the Terengganu dialect along the east coast from Setiu Laut to Kota Tinggi in Johor. Topographic, historical and socio-cultural factors further strengthen the spread of this dialect along the east coast area. This study has improved the Terengganu dialect description based on the geolinguistics perspective, proving that a multidisciplinary approach can systematically describe this dialect.

J	Aziz, J				Aziz, Jamaluddin			Exploring Gender Issues Associated With wanita/woman and perempuan/woman in Malaysian Parliamentary Debates: A Culturomic Approach	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						binary structure; wanita/woman; perempuan/woman; Culturomics; Malaysian Hansards Corpus		Language use and function can reveal tremendously about the society. In the context of Malaysian Hansard, parliamentary discourse is useful in understanding how certain issues are discussed, understood and resolved. For this paper, two Malay words wanita/woman and perempuan/woman, both refer to the English equivalent 'woman', are used to identify some Malaysian women issues as found in the Malaysian Hansard Corpus (MHC). The objectives of this research are: 1) To identify the frequency of both lexicals wanita/woman and perempuan/woman; 2) To identify the unique trend or pattern of the usage of these two lexical items; 3) To identify some issues related to women based on the trend identified. For that reason, Malaysian Hansard Corpus from Parliament 1 (P1) (year 1959) to Parliament 13 (P13) (year 2018) involving over 157 million words is used. The research employs both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. Culturomics approach and tool (AntCon software), are employed to identify the frequency and the trend by generating n-grams. The qualitative approach involves a discourse analysis of MHC based on the trend shown in the n-grams. The research finds that the nodes wanita/woman and perempuan/woman collocate rather consistently with the word lelaki/man. This means women issues are often compared to men's conditions and situations. There is also a shift in trend in terms of how wanita/woman and perempuan/woman have been discussed, that is, from women functioning in private sphere (collocates like anak/child and mengandung/pregnant to a more public one (collocates like guru/teacher and gaji/salary). However, there is no apparent shift in terms of women being defined as a biological category (sex) or a cultural category (gender). Cultural connotations of both words influenced the choice of words employed in the discourse that contribute towards our understanding of the changing trend of the way women issues have been discussed.

GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						genre; complementary and alternative medicine; information brochures; promotional genre; hybrid genre	HEALTH-CARE; GENRE ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; COMMERCIALIZATION; THERAPIES; WOMEN	The presence and influence of complementary and alternative therapies have been increasingly felt in recent years. One reason for this is the active promotion of its services and products through various media channels. The current study focused on information brochures that are placed on pharmacy counters and shelves, and examined how they function as persuasive texts in promoting products and persuading potential users to buy them. The study utilised genre analysis as a method for examining how language and information in texts are systematically selected and structured to perform particular actions and achieve particular communicative purposes. Genre hybridisation as a theoretical concept is drawn on to explain the inter-generic realisation of forms of discourse. One hundred brochures providing information on complementary and alternative health products produced by pharmaceutical companies were collected from pharmacies in Malaysia and analysed for their communicative content in terms of rhetorical moves used to promote the products. This paper describes the generic structure of the print content in the brochures and discusses how it functions to present a favourable view of complementary and alternative health products to the reader. The results show that across all the brochures, regardless of the type of product, a uniform set of moves that is comparable to the sales promotional genre is identified. The findings also reveal that such information brochures on pharmacy counters are in fact persuasive promotional literature. As these brochures are ubiquitous in pharmacies and drugstores in most countries, they are an important force in influencing consumer and patient knowledge, and beliefs about complementary and alternative medicine.

J	Mohd, M; Fauzi, WFP; Jasin, A				Mohd, Masnizah; Fauzi, Wan Fariza Paizi; Jasin, Amri			Focused Crawler Enhancement Technique with Language Detection Module for Malay Web Retrieval	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						crawler; information retrieval; Malay language; search engine; web	TEXT	Crawler is one of the major components in the architecture of information retrieval systems or search engines. The function is to gather relevant websites aimed to be managed through indexing of links and content. A focused crawler application is designed to select and collect web pages that are relevant to domains or specific topics in the Internet. A good crawler can provide accurate, extensive and relevant information to the user during the process of information seeking using search engines. The inability to detect links and content of Malay language is one of the main issues. Therefore, some of the content of the Malay website cannot be indexed and processed for information retrieval. The lack of research in focused crawler especially for Malay website has motivated this research. The main objective of this study is to identify good crawling strategies for focused crawler in detecting relevant and quality links for Malay website. The focused crawler employed in this research has undergone some modifications resulting from a combination of some crawling strengthening techniques. Findings indicate that the presence of a focused crawler enhancement module provides good results because it can detect Malay language webs accurately. This research is also a turning point for the development of information retrieval for Malay websites as well as enhancing the prominence of Malay language in cyberspace.

J	Lin, DTA; Choo, LB; Kasuma, SAA; Ganapathy, M				Lin, Debbita Tan Ai; Choo, Lee Bee; Kasuma, Shaidatul Akma Adi; Ganapathy, Malini			Like That Lah: Malaysian Undergraduates' Attitudes Towards Localised English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						English varieties; Malaysian English; local-accented English; language attitudes; language vitality	LANGUAGE	Native-like English use is often considered the standard to be achieved, in contrast to nonnative English use. Nonetheless, localised English varieties abound in many societies and the growth or decline of any language variety commonly depends on how it is perceived; for instance, as a mere tool for functionality or as a prized cultural badge, and only its users can offer us insights into this. The thrust of the present study falls in line with the concept of language vitality, which is basically concerned with the sustainability of non-global languages. This paper first explores the subject of localisation and English varieties, and then examines the attitudes of Malaysian undergraduates towards their English pronunciation and accent, as well as their perceptions of Malaysian English. A 26-item questionnaire created by the researchers was utilised to collect data. It was also tested for reliability, with returned values indicating good internal consistency for all constructs, making the instrument a reliable option for use in future studies. A total of 253 undergraduates from a public university responded to the questionnaire and results revealed that overall, the participants valued their local-accented English and the functionality of Malaysian English, but regarded this form of the language as substandard. They also considered it important for Malaysians to achieve native-like English use, particularly for the attainment of better educational and economic prospects. These findings provide direction for educational policy-planning as well as English language teaching, and are of relevance to research on English varieties, including the preservation of linguistic heritage.

It is also in line technology that governs our life today, for we use technology and digital applications in almost all aspects of our life. The objective of this study was to discuss the interactions of utterances among primary school children, using Brown and Yule's (1983) Discourse Analysis Theory. This study was conducted to analyze the utterances produced by specific children through storytelling elements and digitization by associating it with the chosen theory. Three seven years old children from a primary school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Sri Serdang were selected as respondents. The methods used in this study were observations, interviews and lists of questions. The instrument for this study is a story about animal, which is produced in digital form. The interactions of the respondents were recorded and documented in written transcription form. The results of this study showed that there were a few elements that could stimulate children's speech based on the application of usage narrative elements. Children became more focused on learning with the computerized method, were more active, enjoyed the session, and spoke naturally. The findings can assist in stimulating children's interactions in producing utterances that are appropriate in the context of the messages and conversation. In addition, this study also aims to assist in giving ideas and input to the development of childrens' social interaction, not only in schools but also in their daily life.

This paper tries to evaluate the effectiveness of a console-based Praat script that utilizes acoustic data in real time to help Persian L2 learners to improve their production of the English vowel /rho/. This vowel is not among the Persian vowels and believed to be difficult for Persian learners of English to perceive and produce. A group of 30 Persian ESL learners was recruited - 15 learners were randomly assigned to the experimental group and 15 to the control group. Over a three-week period, the experimental group received acoustic-articulatory training and was exposed to the CALL software for receiving acoustic feedback, while the control group was exposed only to auditory input on the target sound. The groups were given a pretest to ensure their comparability, an immediate posttest to evaluate the effectiveness of the feedback provided and a generalization test to see whether the participants were able to generalize the possibly developed knowledge to new contexts. The results of the study showed a significant improvement in the performance of the participants in experimental group in terms of both the posttest and the generalization test. These findings lend support to the feasibility of the use of much simpler and more available CALL tools than those reported in previous research for foreign language segmental acquisition and its effectiveness in generalization of the acquired skills to new contexts.

However, the growth of this concern, particularly in developing countries such as Afghanistan, requires more scholarly attention not only because the lives of many Afghan women are affected by it, but also because it remains overlooked due to socio-cultural norms that consider discussions about it as taboo. Of late, however, there is a rising trend among members of the Afghan Diaspora in portraying domestic violence against their womenfolk back home through such artistic mediums as fiction (Parveen, 2015). Therefore, in this paper, we shall examine the manifestations of domestic violence against women in the Afghan context through a textual analysis of The Patience Stone by Atiq Rahimi, an author belonging to the Afghan Diaspora. Originally written in French, this breakthrough novella highlights the harsh reality of the misery suffered by many Afghan women on a regular basis, notably the various forms of domestic violence that they have to endure in the poverty-stricken, war-torn and staunchly patriarchal environment of their homeland. Through a feminist reading of The Patience Stone (2011), we shall examine Rahimi's depictions of domestic violence against women in the novella as a highly engendered phenomenon resulting from gender inequality and a sexist hierarchy of power prevalent in Afghan society. Furthermore, this paper is outlined based on three main forms of domestic violence, namely physical, sexual and emotional abuse, which are depicted in The Patience Stone through the novella's female characters, notably the main protagonist.

J	Zarei, N; Hussin, S				Zarei, Nafiseh; Hussin, Supyan			Impact of Learning Management Blog on Students ' Language Learning and Acquisition	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						second language learning; second language acquisition; learning management blog; interaction	TOOL	In the modern language learning scenario, language learning and language acquisition experience can be enriched outside the classroom where students can engage in interactive activities. This is enabled by Web 2.0 tools such as blog, twitter, and computer mediated communication tools like email and chat. Web 2.0 tools can provide unlimited space and time for students. Blog as one type of Web 2.0 tools can be designed to manage the learning and acquisition environment which provides learning materials, relevant learning resources, and online discussion. This paper reports on the impact of a "Learning Management Blog" (LMB) environment on students ' experience of language learning and language acquisition. The LMB was designed to function as a language learning platform for a particular group of tertiary students. Supplementary course materials that matched the objectives of the course were uploaded to the LMB. This qualitative study involved 30 Malaysian undergraduate ESL students at local university. A semi-structured interview was carried out to elicit responses from the students; then the recorded data were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively. The findings of the study revealed that the LMB has proven to be a useful tool to facilitate the language learning and language acquisition processes among the participants. The students had opportunities to use the language learning materials in the LMB as well as interacting with each other in the discussion forum. The learners developed their independent learning interest and motivation to use the English language learning materials and participate in the LMB environment.

J	Ahangar, AA; van Oostendorp, M; Soohani, B				Ahangar, Abbas Ali; van Oostendorp, Marc; Soohani, Bahareh			Relationship between Phonological and Geographical Distance: Persian, Sarawani Balochi and Sistani Dialect	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						linguistic variation; geographical variation; syllable structure; reranking; constraints		This article focuses on the study of geographical variations among the phonological systems of Standard Persian (SP) language, Central Sarawani Balochi (CSB), a dialect of Balochi language and the Sistani dialect (SD) of Persian, based on Optimality Theory (OT) and van Oostendorp's (2008) approach. SP and SD are linguistically closely related, but SP and CSB are very farther apart. While these language varieties share some similarities in their phonological system, they also have some peculiarities and are spoken in different geographical locations in Iran. Following OT and van Oostendorp's (2008) approach, the study of syllable structure of SP, CSB and SD supports the fact that the linguistic distance between two dialects is the minimal number of minimal reranking needed to get from one grammar to another. The findings of the present research show the fact that reranking DEP-IO and * COMPLEXONS constraints supports how the initial clusters are realized in the syllable structure of CSB and SD, but not in SP. In addition, the analysis of the status of [?] in the onset position of the syllable structure of SP and SD based on the constraints: DEP-IO, ONSET and MAX-IO indicates that all these language varieties are among languages which typologically do not permit onset-less syllables. Moreover, the data suggests that the linguistic distance between two languages or dialects equals to the geographical distance between them. Further, as to syllable structure, historical considerations should be taken into account. Accordingly, the syllable structure of SD corresponds to the syllable structure of CSB rather than SP, although linguistically SD is closer to SP not CSB.

J	Seong, GS				Seong, Goh			The Translatability Of Chinese-Malay Habits Culture	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						translatability; habits culture; componential analysis of meaning; predicate logical expression		This article discusses the research on the translatability of habits culture verbs. By utilising a cluster of theories covering translation concepts, semantic theory and sociolinguistic theory, linguistic units containing elements of habits from Shui Hu Zhuan (Hikayat Pinggir Air) were identified and analysed. The results indicated that a majority of the sample habits culture in the Chinese language cannot be translated into the Malay language. The level of untranslatability of these cultural elements depends largely on the existence of the form and function of the source text in the sociolinguistics network of the target language. When the form and function of the Chinese language habits culture exists in the Malay language, the level of probability that the elements are translatable is much higher compared to the form and function of Chinese language habits culture that do not exist in the sociolinguistic network of the Malay language.

According to Searle (1969), all linguistic communication involves the production of speech acts, such as offering apologies, asking questions, making promises, or refusing. The speech act of refusal has been looked at by many researchers. However, in the Malaysian context, the study of refusals has yet to be ventured, either focusing on manifestations in the speaker's mother tongue, or focusing on manifestations in English. This study aims to discover the preferred semantic formulas or strategies used by Malay university students in Malaysia to refuse a request in an academic context. For this study, 40 undergraduate and postgraduate students were asked to respond to different situations in which they were required to carry out the speech act of refusing a request. The data, collected by means of a Discourse Completion Test, were analyzed in terms of semantic formulas and were categorized according to the refusal taxonomy of Beebe et al. (1990). The findings show that participants differ in the ways they perform refusals. Regret or saying 'sorry', and giving excuses or explanations were the preferred formulas used in refusing requests. The choice of these semantic formulas suggests the influence of Malay culture in respondents' realizations of refusals in English.

The literature on assessment in higher education clearly places assessment at the heart of student learning and it is claimed that "the truth about an educational system" may be discovered by examining its assessment procedures (Rowntree, 1987, p.1). Using a qualitative case study approach, the study aims to reveal the values inherent in assessment, to show how these are conveyed through institutional discourses and through practices of lecturers, and how students' learning behaviour may be affected by their perspectives of assessment. Data gathering activities for the entire doctoral research include focus group discussions and individual interviews with final-year undergraduates, interviews with their lecturers, observations of lectures and classroom assessments, examination of documents related to the course descriptions and assessment, as well as a study of the administrative and procedural aspects of assessment which are part of the assessment praxis. The emerging themes reported here, based solely on the analysis of two of the focus group discussions, indicate how assessment praxis in higher education seems to be a reproduction of dominant power structures that have inculcated patterns of student passivity in learning. This has serious implications for the university's agenda for transformation, and broadly, the shaping of participatory democracy in citizenry.

(1993) identify employees poor writing skills on different writing requirements between school and work. The results of a research conducted by Sidy (1999) indicated that the participants could not relate what they did in freshman writing classes to the types of writing they have to do in the workplace. The objective of this paper is to discuss workplace written literacy demands and the levels of written literacy among applicants for a job at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). Data was collected using interviews and a written test. The findings suggest that there exists a mismatch between written literacy demands and the levels of the applicants. Hence, there is a need to look at the present curriculum in written literacy both at secondary and tertiary levels with a view to incorporate workplace literacy components.

J	Nasir, SNNM; Yusof, M				Nasir, Sarah Nur Najwa Mohd; Yusof, Maslida			Systematic Literature Review on the Study of Communication Language on Internet from Perspectives of Pragmatics	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Review						internet communication language; internet language; pragmatics; linguistics; language systematic literature review		Technological advancement that provides internet conveniences at your fingertips increasingly facilitates communication in the digital space worldwide, including Malaysia. This has not only resulted in new digital cultures, but also new patterns of communication language on internet. Past studies on the event of communication in the digital space have started years ago regardless of the aspect of communication, technology, or language. Scholars in Malaysia such as Azianura Hani Shaari (2020), Nur Atikah Ibrahim and Maslida Yusof (2020), and Wan Nur Azira and Maslida Yusof (2021) had studied the patterns of communication language on internet, particularly from pragmatics perspective. Thus, previous studies need to be examined and reviewed competently. The assemblage of past studies using systematic literature review as a method with specific procedure such as the PRISMA protocol for article selection in two large databases; Scopus and Google Scholar. A selection of 18 articles has been proceed to be synthesised to produce findings. Review of these selected articles found that the language patterns of internet communication probed in Malaysia are slang, bahasa rojak, code mixing, code exchange, emojis, memes, language impoliteness and satire. The platform for data sourcing chosen by previous researchers was dominated by Facebook. The pragmatics perspective in this systematic literature review explains the flow of latest pragmatics development. These perspectives are able to develop in greater length if future researchers accept the language used in communication on internet as a language variation that should be studied.

J	Nor, NFM; Zulcafli, AS				Nor, Nor Fariza Mohd; Zulcafli, Adlyn Syahirah			Corpus Driven Analysis of News Reports about Covid-19 in a Malaysian Online Newspaper	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Covid-19; corpus-driven; collocates; news report; Movement Control Order	MEDIA; SARS; MERS	Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March, 2020. Scientists and researchers immediately took interests to find a vaccine. While researchers in various discipline, particularly in medicine, began to study about the virus to help us understand the situation from various perspectives, there is limited research on linguistics analysis to date about Covid-19. Therefore, the present study aims to contribute to research in linguistics about Covid-19, by employing corpus-driven approach for data analysis. Online newspaper reports about Covid-19 were downloaded from the Star online from March 1st to March 31st, 2020. A total of 1018 news reports were processed and analysed, with 140 themes being identified.100 top collocates with the MI score set at a minimum of 5, using AntConc software revealed that verb and noun collocates co-occurred frequently with the node word Covid-19. Generally, the collocates reflect fear, anxiety and uncertainty that majority of Malaysians feel. have. It also shows how the virus is taking a toll on Malaysia and Malaysians with regards to economy and social life. On the other hand, some of the collocates portrayed the government to be in total control of the situation, despite the threat to health and economic situations in the country. Suggestions for future research about Covid-19 include comparison of several newspaper reports from English newspapers in Malaysia, analysis of news report during extended movement control order (ECMO) in Malaysia or discourse analysis of crisis communication by political leaders in ASEAN.

J	Baharun, H; Harun, H; Othman, J				Baharun, Hazleena; Harun, Haliza; Othman, Juliana			Analysis of Negotiation Episodes in Foreign Language Learner Interactions	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						oral interaction; communication task types; negotiation of meaning; negotiation strategies	STRATEGIES; IMPACT; TASKS	In second/foreign language learning, it is hypothesised oral interaction facilitates language acquisition. Studies show that one aspect of interaction that promotes second/foreign language acquisition is through the process of negotiation, and one factor that influences interaction is the task or activity that learners are engaged in. Hence, it is the aim of this study to investigate if foreign language (FL) learners would engage in different negotiation strategies when completing different communication task types. Nine FL learners from a tertiary EFL class in groups of three participated in the study. They completed three different communication task types (i.e., information gap, jigsaw and decision-making) over a period of four weeks. Data for the study comprised transcribed recordings of the groups' oral interaction. This study qualitatively examined FL learners' oral interactions when engaged in three different types communication tasks. Data collected were analysed for instances of negotiation. Findings revealed that the different communication tasks elicited negotiation episodes as the participants engaged in task completion. They applied similar negotiation strategies during peer interaction. However, further scrutiny revealed that there were differences in terms of the depth of negotiation for the different communication task types. The results of this study exhibit evidence that language communication tasks do promote meaningful interactions among tertiary EFL learners. Data clearly showed widespread negotiation episodes during task completion. The knowledge on the types of communication tasks that can promote meaningful interaction and negotiation episodes can assist language practitioners to make informed decisions on tasks that are suitable for their learners.

J	Radzi, NSM; Musa, M				Radzi, Nur Syuhada Mohd; Musa, Mahfuza			Beauty Ideals, Myths and Sexisms: A Feminist Stylistic Analysis of Female Representations in Cosmetic Names	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Feminist Stylistics; sexisms; patriarchy; advertising language; women studies; gender representation	WOMEN; ADVERTISEMENTS; ENGLISH; GENDER	Cosmetic names today carry more than just information on products' functions or ingredients; they carry dreams, fantasy and stereotypical beliefs of femininity. This study intends to investigate gender representation through advertising language from the perspective of Mills' (1996) Feminist Stylistics. This research explores the naming devices at word and clausal level, stylistic features and rhetorical devices in order to uncover the extent to which prevailing views of gender are either maintained or challenged. It examines how advertisers and copywriters use language to depict women and how language contributes to such depictions. Findings reveal that the noun phrases are dominated by pre modifiers that function as adjectives to describe the cosmetic names. The notion of gender is also represented in various clause types in which women are not encouragingly depicted, while the stylistic features and rhetorical devices used in cosmetic names reveal traits that are stereotypically prescribed to women. Evidences in which the cosmetic names revolve around gender differences and the patriarchal concept of male domination are extensive. This study hopes to contribute in improving advertising practices, as well as to provide awareness in educating buyers to be more critical when decoding advertising language.

J	Salleh, NM; Ghazali, K; Nor, MHM				Salleh, Norhana Md.; Ghazali, Kamila; Nor, Mariyati Haji Mohd			Digital Storytelling in Japanese Lexical Acquisition	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Digital Storytelling; Japanese lexical acquisition; Social Constructivist; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK)		This is a case study that examines the Japanese lexical acquisition process through Digital Storytelling. Digital Storytelling is a method of creating and telling a story using technology. The aims of this study are to identify lexical acquisition strategies and to analyze the lexical acquisition process during the production of a Digital Story. A total of nine students from a local university in Malaysia who learned the Japanese language as an elective subject were chosen as samples. This study was based on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) and 'Social Constructivist' approach while taking into account the process of Digital Storytelling production by Teehan (2006). Qualitative data were collected through observations and recordings during the production of Digital Storytelling. The findings showed that subjects most frequently chose the strategy of asking friends, followed by the use of internet and asking teachers in order to acquire Japanese language lexical during the process of Digital Storytelling. In addition, new findings in the learning and teaching system through Digital Storytelling enabled the TPCK approach to be carried out to overcome the Japanese language proficiency problems especially with regards to lexical acquisition.

J	Abdi, R; Basarati, A				Abdi, Reza; Basarati, Ali			A Critical Analysis of the Representation of Yemen Crisis in Ideologically-Loaded Newspaper Headlines	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						critical discourse analysis; ideology; newspaper headlines; agency; events	CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; NEWS	This qualitative research is a critical discourse analysis of the representation of Yemen crisis in ideologically-inclined newspaper headlines of Iran, Arab and the West. A total of 63 headlines were selected as the corpus of this study. The newspapers included Iran Daily, Tehran Times, Iran on-line and IRNA (Islamic republic news agency) from Iranian; Al-sharq Alwsat and Al-Jazeera from Arab; and finally Telegraph, USA Today, News Week, and New York Time from among the Western newspapers. The three dimensional model of Norman Fairclough was employed to explore the specific themes conveyed through the representation of participants and processes about Yemen crisis. The findings showed that the Houthis are introduced as rebels by both Arab and Western newspapers, and that Saudi Arabia plays a protective role against rebels. On the other end, Iran, along with representing Saudis and the westerns as intruders, chooses and promotes a diplomatic way by condemning the military measures and inviting the parties to come up with a diplomatic solution. Meanwhile, the West supports Saudi-led coalition and legitimates Saudi's attack by proving that the Houthis are Rebels. As for the source of such opposing discourses, it is argued that the opposing ideological views of Islam in the Middle East and the discourse of Secularism in the West lead to contradictory discourses in the region.

Quantitative and qualitative questionnaire data were collected from 262 intermediate students and 21 teachers in order to test two hypotheses: (1) teachers' and students' WCF preferences would differ significantly, and (2) their justifications for their preferences would differ significantly. The hypotheses were confirmed: teachers rated indirect feedback with metalinguistic comment as being most useful while students most preferred direct feedback with metalinguistic comment. This trend extended to all types of direct feedback being preferred by students while teachers preferred all types of indirect feedback. The most common explanation for the teachers' preferences was the development of metacognitive skills, while accuracy was the greatest concern for students. The pedagogical implications of the results regarding expectations, student agency, and self-efficacy are discussed.

J	Teng, F				Teng, Feng			The Effects of Word Exposure Frequency on Incidental Learning of the Depth of Vocabulary Knowledge	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						frequency; word occurrence; graded readers; depth of vocabulary knowledge; vocabulary learning	2ND-LANGUAGE VOCABULARY; L2 VOCABULARY; ACQUISITION; REPETITION	This study examined the rate at which depth of vocabulary knowledge was learned and retained from reading a 300-headword graded reader, The Star Zoo. A total of 30 tertiary-level students who learn English as a foreign language (EFL) in China volunteered to take part in a reading program. Incidental learning and retention of the depth of vocabulary knowledge was measured, complementing previous research along this line. The depth of vocabulary knowledge was examined by using 36 test items within six bands of frequency (more than 20 times to only once). The target words were substituted with pseudo-words. Two tests were employed to measure receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge. This study was completed in three sessions: Students read the book for the first time and finished tests; students read the book for the second time seven days later, and finished tests; finally, retention tests were completed three months later. The findings showed that incidental vocabulary learning through reading was very limited, and this learning was largely based on a high frequency of word occurrence, that is, the higher the frequency level was, the better the learners' word-learning was. The number of times that Chinese EFL learners needed to encounter a word to recognize vocabulary knowledge was 14 times, and at least 18 times were needed for productive vocabulary knowledge. This study shows that attention to building knowledge of known words instead of solely introducing new words should be paid, and that both word exposure frequency and elaborate word processing are important as part of successful vocabulary development.

J	Khoshnood, A				Khoshnood, Ali			The Impact of Deracination on Colonial Zone: Nadine Gordimer's July's People	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						assimilation; civilizing mission; displacement; in-betweenness; uprootedness	'JULYS-PEOPLE'	One of Nadine Gordimer's major obsessions has been raising awareness about the unjust and discriminatory policy of apartheid law in South Africa. She has dramatised the history of her country in her fictions to expose more awareness and truth of the unfair political situation of her homeland to the world. This study explores Nadine Gordimer's July's People to analyze the effects of an impromptu journey of the Smales, a white family, into their black servant. s hinterland. Apartheid atrocities and racial segregations of the white government of South Africa caused an interregnum of white reign and consequently led to black insurgency, tumult, sudden abandonment of home and therefore displacement of the Smales family. This deracination into the primitive settlement of the black servant July renders the Smales family members to have a nostalgic feeling of returning to their metropolis home, which is a manifestation of their inability to assimilate with and adapt into black culture and standard of living. The aim of this study is to analyze the deep impact of unhomely sojourn on each member of the Smales family and on July, who feels a sense of in-betweenness after his regression from city life style to his village environment that is devoid of the city qualities and values. Even though the Smales family. s authority, power and social prestige are diminished while they are in the black contact zone, they emerge to be the embodiment of the white civilization - modern, secure and hygienic, which are the modes of urban life standards.

According to Robinson's Cognition Hypotheses (2001a, 2005, 2007), the production of language would be different when certain manipulation of task complexity was made. The tasks were manipulated following two variables from the Cognition Hypotheses, along resource-directing (+/- causal reasoning demand) and resource-dispersing (+/- task structure) dimensions. Eighty-eight undergraduate students from one of the technical universities in Malaysia were divided into four groups and assigned with a writing task. After the participants have completed the writing tasks, they were interviewed and asked to complete a questionnaire to gauge their motivation towards the tasks. Participants' written language production was coded and analyzed using syntactic and lexical complexity measures. Further analysis of the data was conducted using Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and correlational analysis. Analyses of the results showed that there is a correlation between task complexity and task motivation among learners. However, the correlation is only evident in lexical complexity production and no correlation was found for any of the syntactic complexity measures. This study is significant as it explores the roles of task complexity and task motivation in mediating the production of language. It also highlights how the manipulation of task complexity would encourage the production of the language in terms of its complexity.

J	Adomako, K				Adomako, Kwasi			Truncation of Some Akan Personal Names	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						personal names; Akan; optimality theory; morphology; truncation		This paper examines some morphophonological processes in Akan personal names with focus on the former process. The morphological processes of truncation of some indigenous personal names identified among the Akan (Asante) ethnic group of Ghana are discussed. The paper critically looks at some of these postlexical morpheme boundary processes in some Akan personal names realized in the truncated form when two personal names interact. In naming a child in a typical Akan, specifically in Asante's custom, a family name is given to the child in addition to his/her, God-given. name or day-name. We observe truncation and some phonological processes such as vowel harmony, compensatory lengthening, etc. at the morpheme boundaries in casual speech context. These morphophonological processes would be analyzed within the Optimality Theory framework where it would be claimed that there is templatic constraint that demands that the base surname minimally surfaces as disyllable irrespective of the syllable size of the base surname. The relatively high ranking of this minimality constraint, we claim in this paper, forces the application of the compensatory lengthening rule to ensure satisfaction of that constraint in the truncated forms.

A total of 20 printed adverts in Spanish were taken from magazines, newspapers and the internet. They were analyzed according to the Model of Impoliteness (Culpeper, 1996). The findings revealed that in the world of modern advertising, advertisers are no longer relying merely on politeness strategy to persuade potential consumers. Instead, the impoliteness strategy that explicitly threatens the face is also used extensively in advertising. The use of impoliteness strategies in the analysed advertisements, however, do not cause rejection of the products advertised, but the strategies act as the impetus that can trigger the interest of consumers to buy the advertised items. Briefly, the impoliteness strategies that can be identified in the current corpus of the study are threatening strategies (to scare consumers), elements of direct or indirect extortion, irony and sarcasm, as well as assertive message.

J	Bidabadi, FS; Yamat, H				Bidabadi, Farinaz Shirani; Yamat, Hamidah			EFL Learners' Perceptions towards Meta-Cognitive Strategy Use in English Language Listening	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						qualitative; meta-cognitive strategies; listening; freshman; perceptions		Most Iranian learners face several difficulties when they need to listen to recordings in English or their lecturers' speech in English because they do not know how to employ the listening skills and listening strategies to understand the texts. Therefore, the purpose of this case study was to explore how Iranian female freshman learners, who are learning English as a foreign language (EFL) at tertiary level, listen to English texts in classrooms and what are their perceptions towards the use of meta-cognitive processes and strategies while listening to English texts. 84 Iranian EFL female freshman university learners who are majoring in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL), in the west of Esfahan, Iran participated in this study. They are native speakers of Farsi/Persian aged 18. Based on the scores obtained from Oxford Placement Test (OPT), they are placed in intermediate proficiency level category. The descriptive analysis of the four factors of Meta-cognitive Awareness Listening Strategies (planning and evaluation, problem-solving, personal knowledge, and directed knowledge) reveals that the learners employ directed knowledge strategies more frequently, followed by planning and evaluating, problem-solving, and personal knowledge strategies respectively. Furthermore, analysis from the qualitative data also supported the use of these four key factors in the meta-cognitive strategies, which contributed to how EFL learners understand and listen to English texts. The study implies that meta-cognitive strategies should be explicitly infused in the teaching and learning of listening activities in the classrooms.

J	Sultan, FMM; Suhaimi, N				Sultan, Fazal Mohamed Mohamed; Suhaimi, Nurulafiqah			WH Questions In Kedah Dialect	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						WH questions; Kedah dialect; in situ; descriptive grammar; prescriptive grammar		One of the interesting elements in a dialect is the existence of WH questions which transforms a declarative sentence into a question sentence. Therefore, this article discusses the use of WH questions in Kedah dialect. The data elucidated in this article originated from a fieldwork conducted in villages situated in the east, west, north and south of Kedah. The analysis revealed that the use of WH questions in Kedah are unique and portray variation. The native speakers of this dialect have various lexical forms for questions words. The analysis also found that the positions of the WH questions do not portray a static position either at the initial position or at the final position of a sentence. To clarify further, the researchers suggest that there is a default feature [+/- in-situ] which can explain the various phenomenons of WH questions in Kedah dialect. This default feature [+/- in-situ] percolates its default features into [+ in-situ], [-in-situ] or [+/- in-situ] which may illustrate the various behaviour of WH questions in Kedah dialect. The findings of this research will be able to help educators understand the behaviour of WH questions that portray differences between descriptive grammar and prescriptive grammar.

J	Zakaria, WNW; Buang, NA				Zakaria, Wan; Buang, Nor			Analysis Of Text Structure In The Skills Of Reading Economics Text	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						reading skills; reading strategies; text comprehension; text structure analysis; textbook		Academic texts contains information framework that the authors want to convey to the students. This information framework forms the structure of the texts. Thus, students who read the texts should be familiar with the structure of texts in order to help them deepen their understanding of the texts. This study aimed to identify the structures of the economic texts that were used by students who took Economics subject. The topic chosen as a model for texts structure analysis was Perfect Competition. The design of this study was a content analysis which analyzed the texts structure of every unit and inter units of Perfect Competition. The findings show that there are four types of texts structure unit namely; description, listing, cause and effect, and sequence. While texts structure relationship between units consists of description, cause and effect, pre and post knowledge, and sequence. The implication of this study is that students who read Economics texts should identify the types of texts structure to help them understand the content of Economics texts.

Those who can demonstrate having good attitude and social flexibility, able to build good relationships with others, and able to use appropriate language during their interviews have higher chances of being employed. However, reports show that graduates of higher learning institutions lack social intelligence. Failure to address this issue can affect future graduates' employability. This paper examined the extent to which students in higher learning institutions had developed social intelligence. The participants were the final year students of one technical university in Malaysia. These participants underwent a job interview session as one of their course assessments. In this paper, the responses by three participants were selected to be analysed. The mock job interview sessions, which were conducted online, were recorded and transcribed. The data were analysed using multimodal social semantic discourse analysis to determine the candidates' intention and then, using the five dimensions of social intelligence which included social awareness, presence, authenticity, clarity, and empathy to examine the presence (absence) of social intelligence. It was found that social awareness and empathy to build relationships and develop trust with the interviewer were taken for granted by the participants. In addition, the participants' focused more on the qualification and skills that they had rather than how they could use their skills for the benefit of a company or organisation. The findings provided invaluable input on ways in designing courses that promote the development of social intelligence among students of higher learning institutions.

J	Kumaran, PN; Krish, P				Kumaran, Prashana Nair; Krish, Pramela			Mother Tongue Interference in English Writing among Tamil School Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Writing challenges; English; mother tongue interference; interlanguage errors; Tamil schools	L1 USE; LEARNERS	Writing is considered one of the most challenging language skills that students need to acquire. In Malaysia's vernacular schools, students encounter several challenges as they need to write in variety of languages: their mother tongue, Malay and English. The students' mother tongue can interfere when writing in English due to the difference of structures between these languages. This paper aims to explore this issue further by examining how the Tamil language in particular influences its young native speakers' writing of English essays. For the purpose of this study, 30 writing samples of Year 5 students from a Tamil school were studied in terms of structure, vocabulary usage, and spelling. Errors committed in the essays were identified, categorized and scrutinized. The findings reveal that the main issues in the students' writings are related to grammar, direct translation of the Tamil language, vocabulary and spelling. While we need to understand why and how mother tongue interference affects their writing, it is crucial to curb these writing issues at the primary school level so that such errors can be minimized as they will be doing higher levels of writing. The findings of the study suggest that students need to recognise the differences between their first language ( L1) and the English language and learn to understand the different features and structures of the languages in order to write communicative and correct sentences.

J	Zabir, A; Haroon, H				Zabir, Atikah; Haroon, Haslina			From 'Ratcatraz Prison' to 'Penjara Pudutikus': Lexical Creativity in Children's Literature and its Translation into Malay	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						translation; children's literature; lexical creativity; corpus; normalisation	CORPUS	Lexical creativity is one of the ways through which authors of children's literature shape their stories, entertain children and build their identity and style. In spite of their uniqueness, creative lexical items are often replaced with more common words in translation, a phenomenon described through the law of growing standardisation hypothesis. In view of the importance of creative lexical items in children's literature, there is a need to explore how creativity is transferred in the process of translation. This study is carried out to examine the translation of lexical creativity in children's literature from English to Malay. More specifically, the aims of the study are to identify the types of creative lexical items in children's literature in English and to determine how translators transfer creativity from English into Malay. The study also aims to determine whether the hypothesis of the law of growing standardisation applies in the context of the translation of children's literature from English into Malay. The study employs a corpus-based model for research on the translation of creative lexical items. Corpus analysis tools are used to identify different forms of creative lexical items and to identify the translations for these items. Based on the analysis, five types of creative lexical items are identified; many, however, are replaced with common words when translated into Malay, resulting in the loss of unique features of the original works. It is, however, also found that translators compensate for some of these losses by introducing other elements in the Malay translations.

J	Sulaiman, MZ; Yusoff, MJHM				Sulaiman, Mohamed Zain; Yusoff, Muhamad Jad Hamizan Mohamad			When and Why 'You' Becomes 'Kita': A Contrastive English-Malay Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						English-Malay contrastive analysis; indefinite you; English-Malay translation; personal pronouns; parallel text analysis	PRONOUNS; CULTURE	The use of pronouns differs across languages. The most striking difference between English and Malay lies in the second-person pronoun. There are several options in Malay for the translation of the English second-person pronoun which refers exclusively to the addressee, i.e. 'definite you'. The selection of the appropriate option is dependent mainly on socio-cultural factors. There is also another type of you which refers to people in general and not to the second person in particular, known as 'indefinite you'. Two main English-Malay dictionaries provide contradicting Malay equivalents for indefinite you. A review of the literature failed to yeild any studies or academic discussions on the equivalent of indefinite you and its suitable translation in Malay. Adopting the parallel text analysis method, this paper investigates how the Malay language, as used by Malay society, encodes the functions fulfilled by indefinite you. The findings show that the functions fulfilled by indefinite you in general are not encoded in Malay using any of its second-person pronoun variants such as anda, engkau, awak and kamu. Instead, there are two other methods: (a) the use of words denoting people in general such as orang (people), seseorang (one), siapa-siapa (anyone) and sesiapa (anyone); and (b) the use of the inclusive first-person plural kita. The study discusses the reasons behind the Malay choice of kita as an indefinite personal pronoun from both the linguistic and cultural prespectives.

J	Tengku, FH; Salehuddin, K				Tengku, Fariqul Haq; Salehuddin, Khazriyati			Reading Malay Literal And Metaphorical Expressions: An Eye Tracking Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						cognition; reading process; eye tracking; literal expression; metaphorical expression	ANALYZABILITY; IDIOMS	Malay, like any other languages in the world, is known for its diverse metaphorical expressions to convey specific purposes as an alternative to the literal expressions. Although typically, speakers of a language are able to distinguish literal expressions from the metaphorical ones, little is known about how these differences are identified in the cognition. Hence, this paper discusses findings of a study that investigates the cognitive processes in reading Malay literal and metaphorical expressions from a psycholinguistic perspective. This study that involved 40 Malay students reading 40 Malay sentences with 20 literal and 20 metaphorical expressions used the Tobii TX300 Eye Tracking Devices (APGM) as a tool to link eye movement patterns with reader's cognition. The findings show that only six out of the 20 expressions studied show significant differences between the two expression types in their visit counts, fixation duration, and fixation counts. Qualitatively, analysis of visual representation of heatmaps and gaze plots shows differences when the two types of expressions are read. To explain the difference, the DBP corpus data was used to see how the expressions are used in everyday contexts. This paper concludes that the processing patterns of Malay literal and metaphorical expressions in the cognition of Malay speakers are influenced by the frequency of usage by their speakers.

Problems involving children are increasingly prevalent and often populated in the newspaper. Children's novels are one of the mediums in looking at the environment that helps the psychological development of children. Hence, a healthy environment can shape a balanced child in both the spiritual and physical development. Therefore, environmental aspects should be emphasized in children's novels to provide guidance not only to novel writers but also to the society. In the context of literary works, the environments surrounding childhood are manifested through individuals who surround children's lives. This analysis will show an environment surrounding the main character in the novel. This study applied one of the principles in Bronfenbrenner ecological theory (1979); a microsystem of analyzing texts. The method used in this study is library method and text analysis. The findings show that the environment surrounding children's lives affects the behavior of children. A healthy environment can produce balanced children in spiritual and physical aspects. This situation also manifests the importance of a healthy environment in the lives of children. Parents, friends, teachers and neighbors are important environment in influencing a child's character. In conclusion, the environment in the children's novel using the microsystems in ecological theory Bronfenbrenner (1979) can explain the influence of the environment on children in the novel Beruk.

The category of vague language studied is the adjunctive and disjunctive phrases. Corpus-based methodology enables the identification of unusually significant keyword index of words in this category thus affirming the significance of vague language in the Malaysian Parliament. The adjunctive phrases were 'dan lain lain', 'dan sebagainya. and the disjunctive phrases were, atau sebagainya. and 'atau lebih'. Findings indicated that there is an extension of function of 'dan sebagainya. whereby this phrase is used to address only issues in 1970s in contrast with the year 2000s where the function of 'dan sebagainya. has been expanded to address both issues and providing solutions. The disjunctive, atau lebih. is interesting, as it is used extensively in 2000s to quote legal acts, something which is not present in the 70s. Generally, the trend of usage from the 70's to 00's is a high preference for the use of adjunctives over disjunctives based on frequency per million. This trend predictably will continue in the forthcoming Parliamentary sessions.

J	Abu Bakar, SS				Abu Bakar, Siti Saniah			Language Teacher Interpersonal Communication in Germany	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						interpersonal communication; teacher communication; Malay language; language class discourse; Leech's Politeness Principle	POLITENESS; STUDENTS	This study aimed at examining the interpersonal communication used by the German teacher and native-language speaking teacher who taught the Malay-Indonesian language class in Germany, and compared the tact maxim used between the teachers. This study employed the qualitative approach through the method of observation in class which was carried out by recording using a video camera. The recorded data were transcribed, given themes and analysed descriptively based on Leech's Politeness Principle (1983). The results of the study revealed that the German teacher who taught the Malay-Indonesian language used all the six maxims as interpersonal communication while the native-speaking teacher of the target language used only three (3) out of the six (6) maxims. However, three (3) maxims were used minimally by the German teacher, with the maxims of generosity attaining the highest percentage, followed by maxim of modesty and finally maxim of sympathy. This showed that all three maxims were not the teacher's strategy to be used in the classroom while conducting the teaching and learning session. Among the six maxims, the tact maxim was their main choice; in comparison to the other maxims, the German teacher practised the tact maxim at 70 percent while the native-speaking teacher used it 81.5 percent. Based on the four scales of the tact maxim, it was found that the German teacher only used the cost-benefit, optionality and social distance scales, in comparison to the native-speaking teacher who used all the four scales including the indirectness scale. This finding showed that the culture of a society which refers to the practice and way of life of a person, can be manifested as interpersonal communication, even in the language class discourse.

This study analyzes two adolescent bloggers who actively wrote blog posts in 2012. Both adolescents were chosen from 20 adolescents who were randomly selected by the researchers. The analysis was conducted qualitatively by applying the theory of the Big Five Personality by McCrae and Costa (1997). Other than Neuroticism, this theory explains that there are four other personality tendencies, namely Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness, and Conscientiousness. The results show the existence of invented words in the blog posts by both adolescents. The use of the invented words in blogs' text occurred due to the influence of adolescent emotions while communicating in blogs. The diversity of these emotions prompted adolescents to communicate without the constraint of a similar youth community. The resulting text was understood by adolescents only and the selection of words differed from its true meaning. The use of the resulting words affected the adolescents' personalities, to be either positively or negatively influenced. Most invented words resulted from communication in social networks, especially blogs. The invented words developed and were used by other adolescents who communicate with each other or read blog posts. As a result, the invented words were used widely and caused the words to differ from their original meanings. The result of this study indicates that the implications in understanding adolescents' personalities through written text on internet social networking only differ from its original meaning. The study also provides a clear picture of adolescents' personalities on the internet compared to face-to-face interaction.

J	Ching, FTH; Termizi, AA				Ching, Florence Toh Haw; Termizi, Arbaayah Ali			Roycean Loyalty In William Shakespeare's Timon of Athens	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Shakespeare; Timon of Athens; the Steward; loyalty; Josiah Royce		The study focuses on the master-servant relationship shared by the Steward and Timon in Shakespeare's Timon of Athens (1605). The paper begins with a brief overview on the notion of loyalty and moves towards reviewing some master-servant relationships found in Shakespeare's plays. While most studies highlight the comical nature and bearings of the servant class, the study centers its analysis on the serious nature of loyalty displayed by the Steward towards Timon. The social establishment pertaining to the practice of loyalty within the Elizabethan servant class is also presented. Following the literature review on the Steward is an account which explains Josiah Royce's concepts of loyalty forwarded in his work The Philosophy of Loyalty (1908). The discussion of the study highlights the Steward's loyalty in truth speaking, minimizing conflicts and idealizing the lost cause which enhances his self-will and forgoes his self-gratification. The paper concludes with an emphasis on the eminent role and nobility of the Steward in serving his master, Timon. Through the instances and extent of loyalty examined, the study aims to instigate new textual interpretations in the area of master-servant relationships within Shakespeare's playtexts.

Acoustics measurements (via spectrographic analysis) were taken of VOT, closure duration, voicing during closure, vowel duration and voice bar of plosive /p, b, t, d, k, g/. For the purpose of final plosives investigation, specific measurements were taken of overall duration of a syllable rhyme and its phonation patterns (Open Quotient, F1 Bandwidth and Spectral Tilt). The results shows that Malay are characterised with Short Voicing Lag (SVL; unvoiced plosives) vs. Voicing Lead (VLd; voiced plosives). This study also indicates the neutralisation pattern of plosive voicing contrast in Malay word final position.	[Shahidi, A.

Hence to facilitate effective interaction, a good working team of learners and instructors is important. For this to happen, social presence is necessary to create sound social interaction for instructional effectiveness. Social presence is the ability of the instructors and learners to project their physical and emotional presence (Mardziah H. Abdullah (2004). However, the level of social presence in a virtual learning environment depends on the students' and instructors' sociocultural background. The sociocultural theory in language learning itself emphasizes the roles of interpersonal interaction rather than intrapersonal interaction. This article discusses some findings of a study on a computer supported collaborative learning environment. It shows how distance learners at an institution of higher learning in Malaysia responded to a questionnaire on the issues of social presence. The postings in the learner management system (LMS) and data from focus-group interviews were also analysed and discussed. The findings share some positive responses towards social presence in a virtual learning environment and calls for a more in-depth inquiry that will contribute to the literature on online collaborative learning in the Malaysian context.

It is an aspect that determines success in second and foreign language teaching and learning processes and as a benchmark for mastering any language. This is an exploratory research aims at identifying the techniques which teachers normally used in teaching the spoken Arabic language in National Religious Secondary Schools (NRSS) in Malaysia based on their own perceptions and also their students' perceptions. In addition, it also aims to discover whether the techniques support the communicative approach which is the central focus in Arabic Language Curriculum (ALC) in Malaysia. Two sets of questionnaires were used as the instruments in this study which comprised 73 NRSS teachers who implemented ALC and 1371 students from 16 NRSS based on four zones. The findings illustrate that teachers exert more technical instructions which required short and direct responses such as question and answer, and listen and repeat techniques whereas the techniques less executed by teachers are replacement, conversion, ripple and expansion techniques. It also includes exercises which necessitate students to simply recognize whether a statement is true or false, advanced exercises, and also getting students to perform role-plays and compose couplet essays. The techniques that used short and direct responses by the teachers limit students' opportunities to communicate. This is because having the opportunities is one of the important aspects for the learners in using the language for communication. This findings show that the teaching of Arabic language in Malaysia do not support communicative approach in ALC.

J	Jalaluddin, NH; Ahmad, Z; Saad, NHM				Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah; Ahmad, Zaharani; Saad, Nurul Huda Mohd			The Extended Meaning Of The Prefix BeR-: A Semantic Cognitive Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						prototype theory; image scheme; cognitive mechanism; meaning extension		The prefix beR- is one of the affixes that are discussed widely in the Malay grammar book. Generally the descriptions on this prefix are fairly similar and sometimes overlapped. One of the important aspects about affixation is a study of meaning. Most grammarians agree that the prefix beR- denotes the meaning of 'self do', 'reflexives', 'reciprocate' and 'belonging'. Nevertheless, these meanings are superficially described whereas there are other meanings that can be further explored. Based on 5 million corpus data taken from UKM-DBP data bank which comprises of newspaper (Utusan Malaysia, Berita Harian, Harakah) magazines and books, the meaning of beR- can be explicated in detailed. The extension of meaning of the prefix beR- is explained within the cognitive semantics approach through the prototype theory and the radial network category model. Cognitive mechanisms such as action image scheme (movement, reflexive, reciprocal, and production), belonging image scheme, passive image scheme, psychology image scheme, and grouping image schema have been utilized successfully in explaining how the meaning extension works. Evidently, the process of meaning extension involving the prefix beR- operates systematically. The application of meaning extension has two domains, namely, main and peripheral domain. The difference of each domain contributes to the extension of meaning of the prefix beR- itself.

It focused on the context of implementation and student perception on online learning in the school. The study involved 324 undergraduate students across all levels of study in the school. A questionnaire was used to collect data about their perception on the readiness of the school, the extent to which online learning was carried out, the opportunities and limitations of the learning mode, and student perception on online learning as a whole. Quest (Adams & Khoo, 1996), an interactive computer item analysis software, was used for data analysis. It was found that online learning helped to supplement the quality of teaching and learning. The students found that online learning was not only helpful, but also enjoyable and exciting. Online learning was perceived to be a better learning experience compared to face-to-face learning. It also helped students to take more initiative in their learning and development compared to the conventional classes. However, the school needs to improve the infrastructure and facilities of ICT for more effective use of online learning for the future.

In contrary, they are less utilised in studies on L2 listening and speaking. The objective of this review is to describe the use of verbal reports in recent studies on L2 speech production. The studies were identified through a comprehensive search across two (2) online databases: the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) database and the Language and Speech (LAS) journal database. In particular, the search was restricted to studies published in the past ten (10) years (January 2012 to December 2021). A total of six (6) studies on different aspects of L2 speech production that met the predetermined selection criteria were identified and reviewed. All of the studies are set within the ESL/EFL context. The review resulted in two (2) major findings. Firstly, the verbal reports in recent studies on L2 speech production are all retrospective reports or stimulated recalls. Secondly, the verbal reports mostly played the role of triangulation to confirm and explain the data from other research instruments about the main construct being studied. Moreover, verbal reports revealed the psycholinguistic processes behind L2 learners' speech including processes associated with bilingual speech production. Based on the review's results, suggestions related to the use of verbal reports in future studies on L2 speech production were made.

This study was designed to investigate the difference in plosives VOT at the initial position produced by Malay monolingual speakers and bilingual native Mandarin speakers in Malay. 10 native Mandarin speakers (20-30 years old, M=20.9) took part in this study. 1080 sample units (10 subjects x6 plosives x3 words x3 repetition) were recorded. Data collected were analyzed via spectrogram analysis with a phonetic acoustics approach using PRAAT software. VOT produced in Malay and Mandarin was measured and compared to Malay data from previous research. Results showed significant differences in VOT produced by monolingual and bilingual Mandarin speakers (/b/ (p=0.022) ; /d/ (p=0.028) ; /g/(p=0. 009) ; /p/ (p=0.007); /t/ (p=0.009), p>0.05) except for /k/ (p=0.574, p>0.05). 70% of the subjects produced /b/ with voicing lead, followed by 40% subjects for /d/ and 20% for /g/ while the others produced with short lag. 66.67% Malay VOT sample produced by bilingual native Mandarin speakers approached VOT values of plosives produced by monolingual Malays. The acquisiton of plosives of the remaining 33.33% sample was influenced by the Mandarin phonetic system. The frequency and exposure to Malay language may have influenced the acquisition process and voicing contrast proficiency of bilingual Mandarin speakers in Malay. These findings are beneficial to linguists and speech therapists especially in assessing clients and for creating effective assessment tools. The study also explains that bilingual speakers are able to produce sounds resembling monolingual native speakers of the Malay language. Furthermore, bilingual speakers from national school background promoted the mastery of the Malay language well.

J	Suhai, DSA; Bakar, KA; Awal, NM				Suhai, Dayang Sariah Abang; Bakar, Kesumawati A.; Awal, Norsimah Mat			Modality in Parliamentary Debates	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						modality; social relations; government; opposition; parliamentary debate	DISCOURSE	Parliamentary debate is one of the spoken genres involving key political actors that indirectly highlight social relations through the elements of language used. As such, the analysis of modality in speech clauses is one of the preliminary study that can highlight the role of social actors and their audiences through language. This paper aims to identify and describe aspects of the meaning of modalities used by members of the Government and Opposition in the Parliamentary debate as a way of constructing social relations with their discourse audience. The parliamentary debate selected for the purpose of this analysis is the Budget 2019 debate, the first budget debate after the 14th General Election (2018) and after the transition of power in the New Malaysia era. The analysis used qualitative method, adopting Fairclough's (1992 & 1995) critical discourse analysis approach. The results of the study, revealed thirteen (13) modalities utilized by both the members of Parliament and Opposition. The findings show that informative modality and command modality are utilized by both parties. The use of informative modality is higher frequency, which is 777 times compared to the command modality of only 282 times. Opposition discourse is seen to dominate the use of informative modality with a frequency of 419 times through the meaning of will, ability, knowledge, and refusal more than Government discourse. Government discourse is seen to be more dominant in the use of command modality for the purpose of demand with a frequency of 147 times through the use of the word modality must and should be dominant than the Opposition. It is clear that the use of the word modality by the Opposition discourse is more informative to its audience, while the Government discourse is more in control of its audience. Thus, it can be described that the form of social relations built between the Opposition discourse is more relaxed, and for Government discourse is more formal and serious with the public.

J	Alkhammash, R				Alkhammash, Reem			Discursive Representation of the EU in Brexit-related British Media	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						corpus-based discourse analysis; Brexit; discursive representation; EU; conflicting discourses		Coverage of the Brexit referendum dominated UK media in the summer of 2016. Previous research has focused on the Leave-leaning press and the representations of politicians within that debate. Analysing the British media representation of the EU is paramount in understanding dominant, conflicting discourses regarding the decision of British voters in the period preceding the referendum. This study compares language use in conflicting discourses of Brexit in British media by adopting a corpus-based discourse analysis using the Brexit corpus in Sketch Engine. Drawing on two corpus methods, namely concordance analysis and collocation analysis of the lexis under study (i.e., the term 'EU'), results of the analysis show that in the Leave campaign, the EU is represented in a negative sense in that continuing to be a member of the EU is viewed as bringing certain economic danger to the future of the UK and as increasing the prospect of terrorist attacks. However, the EU is represented in the Remain campaign both positively and negatively. It is represented positively in that the British public is reminded that the UK shares similar values to those held by the EU and negatively in that the media are critical of the EU in its current form. The Remain campaign also dismantles narratives made by the Leave campaign detailing the benefits of exit to British sovereignty and economy. This article concludes with a discussion of the dominant discourses about the EU found in the British media.

J	Othman, N; Nor, NFM; Ibrahim, N				Othman, Norzanita; Nor, Nor Fariza Mohd; Ibrahim, Noraini			Linguistic Representation of Violence in Judicial Opinions in Malaysia	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						judicial opinions; sexual violence; language and violence; discourse analysis; legal discourse	DISCOURSE; ASSAULT; CONSTRUCTION; LANGUAGE	Violent behaviour is understood as being a social and unilateral action initiated by one party. It is social in nature as it occurs within an interpersonal context and unilateral per se because it involves action taken by one individual against the well-being of another. Judges use strategic discursive strategies to describe the accounts of the crime in their judicial decisions. This research aims to investigate the language used by judges to describe the accounts of rape in selected appellate judgments of sexual violence cases in Malaysia. Specifically, it aims to investigate the discursive strategies adopted by judges to reformulate the description of the crime. The findings revealed that violent, disapproving, sexual, and ambiguous terms were adopted. It was also revealed that the crime is often characterized as a non-coerced and mutually-consented behaviour rather than a criminal act. This results in minimizing the level of violence, the mitigation of offender's responsibility, and the relegation of victim's experience to the background. Another significant finding from this study is the issue of judges' interpretative repertoires' in describing cases of sexual violence. We recommend for future studies to include a bigger sample size, as well as to study whether different rape categories namely acquaintance rape, incestuous rape, and stranger rape would reveal distinctive terms used for the respective rape types.

Faculty members, who are usually engaged in advising to tease out problems and suggest solutions, could often times be faced with negative attributions concerning faculty members' competence, as well as receive unaligned responses rather than collaborative understanding of issues or recommendations. While previous studies on advising may have focused on specific, intricate, discourse particles and microscopic perspectives on advising, studies on advice giving exchanges that depart from these dimensions are insufficient. To fill in this lacuna, this paper proposes to explore strategies and participation roles in which faculty members assume in selected doctoral dissertation advising. Through discourse analysis, specifically focusing on discourse and situational identities grounded in identities-ininteraction (Zimmerman, 1998), the study illuminates some of the many advising roles and advising strategies that are revealed as legitimate, aligning doctoral student learning experience. In particular, advising roles and advising strategies, as illustrated in this study, link social and institutional context by proposing some of the many trajectories of how both faculty members and graduate students understand the relevance of advising exchanges. By focusing on these exchanges, the paper will also contribute to the growing body of literature on a range of different factors that may constitute advising in terms of content and manner in which advising takes place.

J	Joseph, R; Lim, JMH				Joseph, Renu; Lim, Jason Miin-Hwa			Background Information in the Discussion Sections of Forestry Journals: A Case Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						research articles; genre analysis; Discussion sections; background information; Forestry	EXPERIMENTAL DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS; RESEARCH ARTICLES; WRITING INSTRUCTION; APPLIED LINGUISTICS; LANGUAGE EDUCATION; ENGLISH; INTRODUCTIONS; DISCIPLINES; RESOURCES; SPANISH	The Discussion section constitutes a powerful closing argument used by a researcher to highlight key findings in relation to the existing knowledge with the aim of facilitating readers' comprehension of the entire study. As previous research has yet to identify the frequencies of the different types of background information and the language resources used to present them, this study sought to identify the types of background information employed by expert writers, ascertain the frequencies and positions of the information concerned, and explore how expert writers use lexico-grammatical resources to present such information in the Discussion sections of Forestry research reports. Using a genre-based analytical framework, 60 Discussion sections in Forestry journals were studied. The findings revealed that provision of essential background information is a principal communicative move appearing in 95% of Forestry Discussion sections. This section comprises (i) contextual and theoretical information aimed at facilitating readers' comprehension of the findings to be presented, and (ii) a reiteration of objectives, methods and/or hypotheses of the research. Based on the findings, it is suggested that background information be highlighted to learners as a segment that serves a promotional function which emphasises the significance of their research topic in relation to the plenitude of past studies. Using the language resources identified in this study, it is recommended that lecturers teaching English for Research Purposes (ERP) focus on the use of (i) adjectives denoting prominence, (ii) investigative and procedural verbs, (iii) means and purposive adjuncts, and (iv) infinitive clauses describing expected behaviours in order to help learners clearly furnish relevant background information.

J	Yusoh, MH; Aziz, J				Yusoh, Mohd Helmi; Aziz, Jamaluddin			Female Character's Empowerment in Islamic Oriented Film: A Case Study of "Ketika Cinta Bertasbih"	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Women's representation; Islamic oriented film; prophetic social science theory; genre; patriarchy	MALAY HORROR FILMS; FEMINISM; WOMEN	This research focuses on women's representation in Islamic oriented film. Women's characters are more often than not being the victims of patriarchal ideology in various film genres and has been one of the most often discussed issues amongst film scholars. Hence, this research tries to scrutinize women's representation in Islamic oriented film genre to prove that there is an effort to liberate these women from oppression. For this purpose, Hanung Bramantyo's Ketika Cinta Bertasbih (2009) from Indonesia has been selected as a sample through purposive sampling and has been analysed using in-depth textual analysis approach. Selected women characters have been analysed by using the Prophetic Social Science theory and feminist framework, based on cinematic techniques such as camera shot, camera movement and dialogue. Prophetic Social Science theory is a theory that is based on a Quranic verse, specifically from chapter Ali 'Imran, verse 110. It consists of two behavioural elements which are Humanization and Liberation, with one vision element which is Transcendence. We argue that in this specific Islamic oriented film, there are several womens characters who have been empowered after ongoing oppression attempts against them in the narrative and this empowerment process can be understood in two forms; Islamic conceptual empowerment and feminism empowerment. These findings can provide added value to the understanding of the Islamic-based genre through female characters and the combination of the theories also provides a new dimension in analyzing Islamic oriented films.

J	Sunarya; Sumarlam; Teguh, WS; Marmanto, S				Sunarya; Sumarlam; Teguh, Sahid W.; Marmanto, Sri			Development of Non-arbitrary to the Arbitrary Iconic Words in Javanese Language	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Javanese language; onomatopoeia; iconicity; phonological aspects; root word		Onomatopoeic words in Javanese language are an evidence of the uniqueness of both the lingual aspects and the described facts. This study discussed the phenomenon of phonological and morphological language processing. It examined the derivation of the onomatopoeic root words of Javanese language into some form of the word as iconic formation. The data source covers the source language of local print media and another complementary source which was obtained from informants living in the regions of Surakarta and Yogyakarta. This study revealed the Ullman's onomatopoeic classification of primary and secondary onomatopoeias. The primary onomatopoeic is sound imitations of referents, i.e. crowing, roaring, barking sounds, etc. The secondary onomatopoeia is the sound which arises beyond the occurring acoustic experience; they are sounds produced by movements and physical, and mental quality of an object. i.e. the word bruk (voice of falling heavy objects), prang (sound of a broken plate). The development of sound imitation icon as an icon causes a shift in the status of a root word form or onomatopoeic sound imitator to other states. Words like thuthuk [ktU?] 'beater', kethuk kempyang [ktU? kmpjan] 'typical instrument used in Gamelan', pethuk [ptU?] 'coming across' and bathuk [batU?] 'forehead' were the derivative words which originated from the root word thuk [tuk] with the additional formative process, repetition on the root word, compounding, and reduplication. In the Javanese language, onomatopoeic words often have the same family with other words.

J	Mani, SD; Vengadasamy, R; Hamdan, SI				Mani, Sheba D.; Vengadasamy, Ravichandran; Hamdan, Shahizah Ismail			Japanese Dichotomies and the Individual Identity in Haruki Murakami's Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						identity; Japanese dichotomies; group consciousness; uchi/soto; Haruki Murakami	SELF	Japanese indigenous terms such as uchi/soto (inside/outside) and omote/ura (front/back) are common dichotomies employed to understand the differences between expected behaviours associated with group dynamics such as promoting collective harmony rather than individual uniqueness. Haruki Murakami advocates that the Japanese need to move away from these dichotomies in order to embrace the true self and assert an individual voice. This dictum comes after he concluded his observations on the tragic 1995 sarin gas attacks in Japan and noted that individuals should be more assertive in forming their own voice rather than conforming to the collective voice. In his latest novel, Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage (2014), he presents a new narrative on individual negotiations with group consciousness. This article seeks to reveal the sense of individuality presented through the frame of the Japanese dichotomies and the psychological response of the main character, Tsukuru. The character will be analysed in relation to the group that he belongs to: in the context of the Japanese uchi (inside) or soto (outside) and within each context, representations of his omote (front) or ura (back) is examined. The findings expose that both uchi and soto are significant in developing individuality. More importantly, how the individual responds while in these contexts determines his ability to construct his identity. This reading suggests that Murakami fulfills his agenda by empowering the individual to explore various ways in being independent. The novel also indicates that the Japanese society is gradually manifesting a growing sense of individuality by departing from its codes of group consciousness.

J	Quinto, EJM; Castillo, JCD				Quinto, Edward Jay Mansarate; Castillo, John Christopher Dimasaka			Reconceptualizing the language motivation of Timorese ELLs in the Philippines	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						language learning motivation; Timorese ELLs; Possible Selves; 'ideal L2 self'; 'ought-to L2 self'	POSSIBLE SELVES; FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; SELF; ATTITUDES; STUDENTS; CONTEXT; ENGLISH; 2ND	Second language (henceforth L2) motivation has been traditionally studied from the lens of integrative motivation. However, this framework presents problems in that it is limiting and lacks insights from emerging cognitive motivational research. This paper investigated the L2 motivation of Timorese English language learners (henceforth ELLs) using Dornyei's (2009) L2 Motivational Self System and Markus and Nurius's (1986) possible-selves theory. Ten Timorese ELLs studying in a school of higher learning in the Philippines participated in a free writing task and a follow-up focus group discussion. These activities aimed to examine the content and functions of the students' two most important types of possible selves: 'ideal L2 self' and 'ought-to L2 self.' The results revealed that the students' 'ideal L2 self' coincides with the original theoretical construct, which includes a promotion-focused function for studying English, i.e., to achieve personal goals and to communicate with other people. Interestingly, however, the present study corroborated Chen's (2012) findings in the Taiwanese context that the 'ought-to L2 self' is not simply prevention-focused, but a mixture of prevention- and promotion-focused functions of learning English. The findings pointed to necessary research, curriculum design and pedagogical implications, which are discussed as this paper closes.

J	Li, R; Suleiman, RRR; Sazalie, A				Li, Rui; Suleiman, Raja Rozina Raja; Sazalie, Azimah			An Investigation into Chinese EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						pragmatic competence; pragmatic awareness; pragmatic production, speech act; Chinese EFL learners	AWARENESS	Successful communication is influenced not only by language accuracy, but also by language appropriateness in various social contexts. Accordingly, second/foreign language (L2) learners. pragmatic competence as well as how they develop the competence has attracted much attention in the research field of interlanguage pragmatics (ILP). The existing literature on Chinese EFL learners. pragmatic competence focuses on their awareness of contextually appropriate language and neglects their production of the language. This study investigated Chinese EFL learners. pragmatic competence in terms of both awareness and production. Three research instruments were employed to collect data: a multiple-choice discourse completion task (MDCT), a written discourse completion task (WDCT), and a retrospective interview. Eight-five English major undergraduates from a university in China participated in the study. The results showed that Chinese EFL learners. ability to identify and produce contextually appropriate utterances needed to be promoted, and their pragmatic awareness was found to be positively correlated with their production. Compared with the ranking of imposition, Chinese EFL learners were more aware of the interlocutor's social power and tried to display the power distance in their language. However, they had difficulties in using appropriate strategies and linguistic features to achieve communicative intentions, and a very serious problem that they encountered was the intended meaning and force of different linguistic forms and strategies. The research findings provide evidence that Chinese EFL learners. pragmatic competence is still much influenced by Chinese language and culture, and some form of pragmatic instruction to raise their awareness or understanding of pragmatic features and force relation is crucial for the learning of L2 pragmatics.

One factor that makes reading Jawi a cognitively complex process is the complex and confusing use of vowel letters in the spelling of Malay words in Jawi; hence, making the Jawi spelling system appear to be rather inconsistent. Currently, the vowel phonemes in Malay words in Jawi are represented differently in different syllables either using vowel letters or not represented at all. Two reading experiments on Malay bi-syllabic words written in Jawi were conducted with two groups of readers. In Experiment 1, 28 Malay native speakers and 13 Arabic native speakers read 200 Malay bi-syllabic words in Jawi as quickly and as accurately as possible to investigate the naming latencies of words written in Jawi with and without diacritics. In Experiment 2, 30 Malay 13- and 14-year-olds read 108 Malay bi-syllabic words in Jawi to investigate if adding vowel diacritics and/or vowel letters to represent Malay vowels facilitates reading Jawi. Both experiments were conducted using DMDX, a Win 32-based display system for psychological experiments that records reaction times to visual and auditory stimuli. Results are presented in terms of the subjects. reading accuracy (correct responses) and latency (reaction times). To a great extent, adding vowel diacritics to the Jawi spelling system does facilitate reading. This study also shows that two forms of permutations in the Jawi spelling system can help make reading Jawi a cognitively less complex process for readers.

They were considered as 'aborigines' who refer to an advanced, primitive community and face problems with modernity. Nevertheless, the Negritos are still using Mendriq language as a medium of communication. The language phenomenon among Negritos has been evolusioned with the Malay language through loanword because they no longer leave in their small group and they also communicated with outsider communities especially the Malays. Therefore, the Negrito's community has been using a lot of Malay words to communicate and to sustain their social life. This article describes loanword in Malay by Mendriq as a phenomenon of sustaining minority life group. This paper also describes the Mendriq language used by the group of Negritos in Kuala Lah, Gua Musang, Kelantan. This paper employs a descriptive approach in the forms of loanwords such as full loanwords and affixation loanwords. Observation has shown that language plays a significant role in human communication. It is worth studying the elements of loanwords in Malay as a symbol of communication and identity among the Negritos to distinguish one race from another.

J	Al-Zumor, AWQG				Al-Zumor, Abdul Wahed Qasem Ghaleb			A Socio-Cultural And Linguistic Analysis Of Yemeni Arabic Personal Names	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						anthroponomy; naming system; semantic analysis; sociolinguistic analysis		This study is an investigation in anthroponomy of a Yemeni community which may reflect the naming practices followed in some tribal regions of Yemen neighboring Saudi Arabia. The study aims at investigating personal names, particularly female names, as they look very striking to a person who does not know much about the culture of those regions. Almost 300 personal female names are collected by the researcher using questionnaire as the tool for data collection. The names are, then, classified into different categories on the basis of their sources. For instance, Saadah and the adjacent governorates (in Yemen) are famous for different weapons business, so, you can hear names like tomateek, canadah: types of gun or qunbulah: grenade). Such selection of names is indicative of the attitudes of the parents of the family and of the way they are associated with the nature and the atmosphere around them as suggested by the responses to the questionnaire. However, the changing social, political and linguistic influences on the land and the people of Saadah and the neighboring places (in Yemen) have left their impact on naming patterns. As a result, naming practices are changing. This study is a preliminary investigation in anthroponomy of the Yemeni community, to be precise in the north and north west part of the country. It is an attempt toward understanding anthroponomy as a branch of the science of Onomastics in the region in relation to sociolinguistics.

J	Do, LT				Long Tuan Do			Over Again: A Cognitive Account of its Meaning Transference in the Light of an Image-schema Based Model	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						over; meaning transference; image-schema; Multimodal Image Theory; Extended Conceptual Metaphor Theory		This article is the second in a two-article series that first critiques polysemic and monosemic theories to the meaning transference of over and then accounts for the word's meaning transference from an image-schema based model. To be specific, this qualitative study aims to explain the processes of over's meaning transference from spatial to non-spatial ones with 1350 instances in the 2017 Corpus of Contemporary American English, genre: Fiction. In the light of a combination of Multimodal Image Theory and Extended Conceptual Metaphor Theory, the mappings from SPACE domain to non-spatial domains, image-schema transformations, and a range of conceptual metaphors associated with over were systematically analysed to first identify the word's senses and then account for the mechanisms of its meaning transference. It was found that mappings together with image-schema transformations are significant in motivating the meaning transference processes. The results of the study are summarized as follows: (i) The prototypical sense of over, represented by a pair of image complexes, designates the relative UP spatial positions and potential forces between the Trajectory (TR) and Landmark (LM) denoted by the preposition; (ii) its spatial senses cognitively generate within three spatial modalities of thought: Visual space, Maneuver space, and Kinetic space, and (iii) its non-spatial senses are attached to a range of conceptual metaphors which are spatially grounded. In other words, three spaces provide concrete image-schemas or experience which are virtually represented/mapped on to abstract experience shown by the retaining salient TR-LM configurations.

J	Salim, NR; Mansor, I				Salim, Nazirah Radin; Mansor, Idris			Mastery of Cultural Competence in Arabic-MalayTranslation	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Cultural competence; Arabic-Malay translation; translation training; trainee translator; translation accuracy	STRATEGIES	In a translation activity, the translator acts as an intermediary between two communities of different languages and cultures. However, even if a translation is completed, good communication between two communities of different languages will be disrupted if the culture in a language unit is not understood by the translator while conducting the translation activities. This is because culture is a reflection of a language. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the differences in form and accuracy level of translation results based on cultural competence by students majoring in Arabic at two teaching institutions and identifying factors that affect their cultural competence. This study employed qualitative descriptive methods, using two types of instruments, namely the test question instrument related to translation competence conducted on ninety student samples and interview instruments conducted on three lecturers and twelve student participants. Interviews were used to find the factors that influence the mastery of cultural competence level among students. The findings show that the mastery of cultural competence level among students majoring in Arabic language in the two teaching institutions is at a medium to low level with a mean score of 53.44%. The results of the interview revealed that less emphasis on application and practical aspects on the cultural elements in translation were given to the students. It is expected that this study could provide new input to the students to produce better translation between two cross-cultural languages, as well as to give ideas to the authorities to take more proactive steps in improving the mastery of cultural competence level among students, such as to include cultural elements in the syllabus of translation courses.

J	Kotorova, E				Kotorova, Elizaveta			Methodology of Cross-Cultural Description of Speech Behaviour: A Case Study of INVITATION in German and Russian Discourse	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						speech behaviour; cross-cultural communication; contrastive analysis; Russian; German	PATTERNS	The article aims to demonstrate a consistent methodology for conducting cross-cultural research of verbal communication behaviour and identifying its peculiarities in different language cultures. First of all, the author discusses the problem of defining a basic unit of communication crucial for the analysis of communicative behaviour and proposes her own interpretation of such a unit called speech behaviour pattern (SBP). The illocutionary content and general organization of any SBP is considered universal, while their actual realization in a language is culturally conditioned and therefore may vary significantly in different languages. Utterances that constitute a certain SBP are organized into a field with a prototypical centre and a gradationally formed periphery, which is referred to as communicative-pragmatic field (CPF). The proposed methodology of contrastive analysis includes the following four major components: 1) definition of illocutionary purpose, 2) description of structural forms of SBP (i.e., their lexical and grammatical characteristics), 3) identifying communicative-pragmatic factors, 4) description of the structure and hierarchy of the communicative-pragmatic field that includes utterances implementing SBP. The presented approach is then consistently applied to the analysis of the SBP of INVITATION in the Russian and German discourse. The language data are taken from the existing Russian and German corpora.

GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Rhetorical organization; linguistic realizations; applied linguistics abstract; Scopus journal quartile; move analysis	RESEARCH ARTICLE ABSTRACTS; GENRE ANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; MOVES	This study investigates whether Scopus journal quartile affects the rhetorical organization and linguistic realizations of applied linguistics research article (hereafter RA) abstracts from Scopus-indexed journals. Embracing the corpus-based approach, this study analyzed 28 abstracts from four AL journals (seven abstracts each) with different quartile. Hyland's (2000) model was adopted as the analysis guideline. The phrase was the unit of analysis to obtain fine-grained results of the moves occurrences. The analysis revealed that most of the articles from Q2-Q4 journals applied the informative typology, while those from Q1 journal applied the indicative-informative one. Journal quartile does not necessarily affect the manifestation of all moves and steps. The number of occurrences of Step 1-describing participants and Step 3-describing procedure in the Method move was similar in all journals. Moreover, the Purpose and Findings moves were obligatory in all journals. Journal quartile played an influential role in employing the verb tense of Introduction, Purpose, and Conclusion moves and the sentence voice of Method and Conclusion moves. The findings reach a conclusion that journal quartile does not necessarily affect the domination of the standard rules of the RA abstracts' rhetorical organization and linguistic realizations in AL journals. This study provides insight into the realm of English academic writing about the current trends of move analysis from the journal quartile lens. Further comparative research on the rhetorical features between the accepted and rejected RA abstracts and materials development for the pedagogy of English for research publication purposes are recommended.

This paper looks at the issues that surround air/water in Malaysian Parliamentary debates by specifically focusing its relation to the state of Selangor. The air/water related issues were examined based on the collocates of air and Selangor in the Malaysian Hansard Corpus (MHC) from Parliament 1 (P1) to Parliament 13 (P13). The findings show that air is consistently present as one of the collocates of Selangor from Parliament 4 (P4) to Parliament 13 (P13). However, air started to show an upward trend starting in Parliament 7 (P7) and continued to Parliament 13 (P13). The recurring issues during those periods are the never-ending water-related problems and the steps taken by the government to overcome the problems. In P7 and P8, the focus is on the source of water as it collocates with pembersihan logi air (water treatment plant) and kawasan tadahan air (water catchment area). In Parliament 10, Parliament 11, Parliament 12 and Parliament 13 the recurring issue with air and Selangor is penyaluran air mentah (the transfer of raw water) from the neighbouring state Pahang to Selangor. Another issue observed is penstrukturan air (restructuring) of water supply and services which was first observed in Parliament 12 and continues to Parliament 13. Thus, by focusing on the collocates of air this corpus-driven account has managed to show the trend of the parliamentary debates in relation to air and Selangor. Therefore, parliamentary debates where various issues of national interest are often raised offer opportunities for more critical analysis of issues that are important to the public.

Tioman-Aur-Pemanggil Malay Dialect Variants: AComparative Linguistics Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						comparative linguistics; qualitative comparison; vocal; diphthong; consonant		Studies on the Malay homeland (Austronesian) have never been ceased to discuss by neither scholars of cultural studies nor linguistics. There were claims that the Malays came from China and Taiwan, and nowhere else in the world but this archipelago. In this regard, we argue that the relation among Malay dialects has not been studied thoroughly. Therefore this study focuses on the existence of Malay dialects in the southwest territory of the South China Sea covering Tioman Island-Aur-Pemanggil. This study attempts to discuss the status of joint innovation inherent in the Tioman Island-Aur-Pemanggil dialects. The discussion on the joint innovation of the Tioman Island-Aur-Pemanggil dialects uses qualitative comparative methods. In order to obtain the joint innovation features, comparison of vowels, diphthongs and consonants between ancient Malay and Tioman Island-Aur-Pemanggil dialectswas conducted. The discussion shows there are innovation and retention features inherited in the Tioman Island-Aur-Pemanggil dialects of Malay in Tekek, Juara and Salang variants. By having the linguistics data, it reveals that Malays or Austronesian people had made the archipelago as their residential area. Thus, Austronesian people were originally from the north (China and Taiwan) as claimed by western linguists is untrue.

J	Raslie, H; Keong, YC				Raslie, Humaira; Keong, Yuen Chee			Literacy Brokering among the International Students of a Public University	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						socio-cultural theory; literacy brokering; cross-cultural literacy; new literacy studies; multiliteracies	AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS; LANGUAGE; FAMILY	The influx of international students to Malaysia in pursuance of tertiary education has created the urgency to ascertain the English literacy struggles faced by these students in the Malaysian classrooms as well as the suitability of the current pedagogical practices in addressing their existing literacy practices. Insights on the aforementioned aspects could be gained by examining the students' literacy brokering engagements. Literacy brokering refers to an act of seeking informal help in various forms from fellow language users when facing unfamiliar texts or text-oriented practices and events. This case study therefore examined the literacy brokering phenomenon occurring within a Malaysian university's intensive English Language class. The research participants consisted of 15 international students from five different countries. The specific objectives of the study were to: (i) identify the themes involved in literacy brokering interactions occurring in the Malaysian university English language classroom context; and (ii) describe the literacy practices of the international students in their English class. Through the methods of audio and video recording, 98433 words of transcribed data were collected. An in-depth analysis of the data revealed the primary brokering theme to be the English language system, specifically aspects of grammar and semantics. However culture and genre-based themes were also apparent. The brokerage of culture and genre stemmed from the mismatch between the participants' existing literacy knowledge with those in their current context of living. The findings create an andragogic importance to include learners' socio-cultural schemata in designing and carrying out non-native language pedagogy.

J	Wehrli, A; Awal, NM				Wehrli, Andre; Awal, Norsimah Mat			Second Person Reference in Indonesian Christian Prayer: A Sociolinguistic Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						reference; coreference; Indonesian; prayer; God		One might expect that the divine person addressed in prayers by Indonesian Christians matches those in biblical prayers. However, this seems not always to be the case. Since referential differences in such texts are not always obvious, the aim of this paper is to define steps for identifying who exactly is being addressed. For that purpose, sample prayers in Indonesian are analysed. These samples consist of prayers from an Indonesian Bible translation, Christian prayers in Indonesian books, and spontaneous prayers by Indonesian Christians, which were recorded and transcribed. The following steps were defined: 1) the grammatical analysis of nouns and pronouns, 2) the listing of relevant instances of referents, 3) the assignment of these instances to certain referents and 4) the comparison of the identified referents with the context of the analysed prayers. The findings show that the person addressed in Indonesian Christian prayers cannot reliably be identified without looking at the context. As for the recorded spontaneous prayers, the socio-religious background and a close look at the actual perception of the person praying are crucial for a reliable identification of the referent. This was done by comparing the results with interview responses of these persons. By applying the four mentioned steps, different addressees can be identified in prayers. In the examples of this analysis, the most significant difference was found between the addressee of prayers in the Bible compared to the addressee in spontaneous prayers. While 9 out of 11 Christians spontaneously address Jesus in their prayers, all investigated biblical prayers do not address Jesus. The findings show that the four steps applied are beneficial to a high degree, but in some circumstances, ambiguity may remain.

J	Al-Ma'amari, AA; Yusof, NM; Vengadasamy, R				Al-Ma'amari, Abdulrahman Abdullah; Yusof, Noraini Md; Vengadasamy, Ravichandran			Process of Decolonization in Nabulyun fial-Azhar "Napoleon in Al-Azhar"	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						decolonization; Najib Al-Kailani; Arabic novel; Frantz Fanon; French invasion		This paper examines the decolonization process in Najib Al-Kailani's novel, Nabulyun fialAzhar (Napoleon in Al-Azhar-1980). The study explores the ways the colonized react to the colonizers in order regain liberty, freedom, and sovereignty of their land. Decolonization is the reverse process of colonization by which colonies become independent of the colonizing country. Najib Al-Kailani (1931-1995) is an Egyptian novelist, poet, and critic. In his writings, he focuses on the colonial experiences that the Arabs and Muslims have faced throughout history. Al-Kailani here wrote a revisionist novel recounting the French invasion of Egypt in the eighteenth century (1798-1801) commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte (15 August 1769-5 May 1821), the general in Chief of what they called at that time = Arme d'Orient (English: Army of the Orient) and depicts the people` s resistance and rebellion against the colonizer. The novel depicts the Egyptian resistance, against French subjugation and humiliation, and sacrifices for the sake of independence and dignity. The analysis of decolonization based on the events in the novel is executed by applying Frantz Fanons theory of resistance and revolution which embodies three stages and steps of decolonization. These stages are: assimilation to the colonizer` s culture, rediscovery of their own culture and identity, and finally the confrontation with the colonialists. Colonized people usually do not reach the confrontation stage with the colonizer unless they go through the first two stages; assimilation and rediscovery. The paper also discusses the impact of the violence experienced by both the colonizer and the colonized as a result of the confrontation.

J	Tavakoli, M; Ghadiri, M; Zabihi, R				Tavakoli, Mansoor; Ghadiri, Momene; Zabihi, Reza			Direct versus Translated Writing: The Effect of Translation on Learners ' Second Language Writing Ability	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						direct writing; translated writing; writing ability; learner attitudes; Iranian EFL learners	1ST LANGUAGE; L2; STUDENTS; L1; STRATEGIES; MOTIVATION; ATTITUDES; ENGLISH; WRITERS	A growing body of research has been investigating how L2 writers, while writing in the second language (L2), make use of their first language (L1). In view of this, the present study was conducted to examine the effect of translation on the enhancement or deterioration of Iranian Elementary EFL learners' writing ability. The participants (N = 60) were prompted to perform two writing tasks: (a) writing directly in English (learners ' L2) and (b) writing in their L1 (Persian) and then translating it into English. They were also assigned a checklist, a retrospective verbal report, to express their attitudes towards the two modes of writing. Analysis of the results revealed that although translation may be of help to some learners, it cannot be an effective strategy to enhance the writing ability of all learners. In effect, the results indicated that there was a significant difference between two writing tasks in terms of using expressions, transitions, and grammatical points. What was of particular interest to the authors was the fact that direct writing did not seem to be as direct as it was expected. The vast majority (75%) of students reported they think in Persian, as '' often '' or '' always '' while doing the English task in the direct writing mode. This finding suggests that teachers should incorporate translation strategies into their writing courses and explicitly teach students how to employ effective strategies in different situations. The provision of instruction and practice in using L1, particularly in planning and organizing learners' writings, may be of benefit to some learners in performing certain writing tasks.

The study investigates ESL tertiary students' writing attitude and the learning problems they face in BEL 311 writing course at MARA University of Technology. The participants in the study were 60 Part Three Diploma students taking BEL 311 course, and 4 writing instructors who have been teaching this course for more than 5 years. The students were given a set of needs analysis questionnaires, and the lecturers were interviewed. In addition, both groups of participants were asked to describe the important elements which they perceive as useful for a supplementary online writing program. The results indicate that the lecturers felt the majority of the students have negative attitude towards writing as they would procrastinate. They are also careless and dislike writing. The findings from the participants also revealed that they perceive writing in English as difficult and they dislike it. In addition, both groups of participants also perceive that the students' learning problems, which affect their writing quality, include the lack of practice time being allocated in class, dull writing activities and the lack of emphasis towards critical thinking in their writing course. Furthermore, they suggested that a special online writing program which can act as a supplement for the course and help to enhance the learners' writing ability and interest.

It has been noted that the public university students of different ethnics rarely interact with each other. Hence, the purpose of this research is to investigate the teaching and learning methods that can be used to enable the students of different ethnic groups to interact with each other in the process of teaching and learning Chinese as a second language. Questionnaire were distributed to non-Chinese students studying Chinese as a second language in five Malaysian public universities to identify appropriate approaches that enabled them to interact with students of other ethnics. In addition, 10 Chinese lecturers and language instructors were interviewed to identify the effective ways of instruction and assessment that served to tie the relationship among the students of various ethnics who learn Chinese as a second language. Feedback from the respondents was analyzed quantitatively. It has been revealed that the course evaluation methods of requiring non Chinese students to record their conversations with Chinese students, the methods of oral tests, role-play activities, games, group assignment, mentor-mentee system as well as after-class activities are able to promote interaction among students of different ethnics.

J	Jalaluddin, NH; Sarudin, A; Ahmad, Z				Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah; Sarudin, Anida; Ahmad, Zaharani			The Meaning Expansion Of Alim: A Cognitive Semantic Approach	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						prototype theory; radial networking category; image schema; metaphor concept; metonymy		The advent of Islam to the Malay world has brought a huge influence not only in the culture and life style, but also encompasses language elements and thoughts. This phenomenon can be seen in the increase of Arabic words that enriches the Malay vocabulary through borrowing. This research aims to focus on some Arabic words that show a departure in meaning and imply that its original meaning is no longer become the core meaning. These changes occur as a result of semantics assimilation process and the Malay sociocultural lifestyle. The entries that are investigated is `alim' (pious) and the selection of the entry is based on the 4th Edition of Kamus Dewan, 2007. 'Alim' is polysemy in nature and apparently its core meaning from Arabic has changed when borrowed as loanword into Malay. This paper explains to what extent the changes have taken place based on 470 'alim' concordance lines taken from DBP corpus data bank. The analysis shows that the meaning of 'alim' has widen to other meanings and differ from the list given in the dictionary (4th Edition Kamus Dewan, 2007). It clearly shows that the expansion of meaning is semantically motivated. Based on the semantic cognitive theory using the prototype theory, radial networking category, image schema, metaphor conceptualization and metanomy, each expansion of meaning is well motivated and can be explained theoretically.

This effect, generally known as washback, can be considered negative or positive depending on the test and its intended use. The EEU is designed to screen the high school graduates for admission into higher education. This study aimed to investigate the washback effect of this high-stakes test on the Iranian high school English teachers. To achieve the aim of the study, a validated survey questionnaire was administered to stratified random sample of 132 high school English teachers who were teaching in the five main educational districts in the city of Isfahan, Iran. The data analysis revealed that the EEU negatively and implicitly influences English teachers to teach to the content and format of the test. Additionally, little attention was given to three language skills of speaking, writing, and listening in the classroom as these skills are not tested in the EEU.

The research is designed to compare writing patterns of urban and rural students from four different zones. The focus of analysis is divided into three aspects, namely, language used, discourse and idea conceptualization. In language used, the focus is on sentence structure, dialect usage and punctuation while discourse looks at interesting phrases. The ideas in the writings are evaluated holistically by looking at the clarity, maturity and relevance of ideas presented. The respondents of this research are selected from five different zones; Kedah (northern zone), Kelantan (eastern zone), Negeri Sembilan (central zone), Sabah and Sarawak (East Malaysia). The total number of respondents is 1524 students. Generally, the findings of the research show that the writing proficiency of the students is at satisfactory level. However, there are differences in the students' writing performance within the zones.

Based on purposive sampling, 10 students were selected from one tertiary institution. The study seeks to explore the test-taking strategies employed by female students of two levels of proficiency. Verbal reports from these participants were obtained via the retrospective protocol and playback sessions. The data provided information on participants' thinking process and revealed how they arrived at their answers and the reasons for their choice of answers. The data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed qualitatively whereby patterns of strategies were identified and categorized. On the whole the results showed both levels employed almost the same total number of strategies, 24 and 22 for the high and low proficiency participants respectively. The conclusions were drawn upon the results of the data provided by limited number of participants and thus thrust aside the claim of representativeness in terms of test-taking strategy studies. However, the study allows a peek on the types of test-taking strategies utilized by students in the study which may also be employed by students in general.

The positive effects of brand communication, especially offline communication, may be well investigated, whereas few studies have analyzed how online brand communication can be realized. This study examines an under-discovered visual source, namely pictures, that performs a pivotal function to display the visual identity of Chinese universities. This study investigates the multimodal discourse of the 'About Us' web genre which employs pictures to portray the universities' brand identity, and examines their meaning potentials. Drawing upon the visual grammar framework of Kress and van Leeuwen (2006), the sample for visual analysis in this study was collected from the 'About Us' webpages of nine elite Chinese universities (C9 League). Findings of the qualitative analysis indicate that pictures are ingeniously employed to display the virtual identity of the Chinese universities. The multifaceted brand identity of the universities may be projected through a heavy use of symbolic representations, along with a diversity of communication strategies to portray their representational meanings. The study provides information for universities to effectively use visual resources in constructing their brand identities and offering information to their target audience via the web-mediated multimodal discourses.

J	Haroon, H				Haroon, Haslina			Exploring the Translation of Non-verbal Behaviour in Fiction into Malay	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						non-verbal behaviour; communicative function; literary translation; Khaled Hosseini; Malay translation	COMMUNICATION	Non-verbal behaviour is often incorporated in literary fiction to complement or replace the verbal behaviour of characters. Because of its ability to convey messages, it is considered as equally important as verbal behaviour in a literary text. Taking this as a starting point, this study aims to explore the issue of non-verbal behaviour in translation. More specifically, the study aims to determine how the translation of non-verbal behaviour is dealt with in literary fiction, to discuss the implications of the use of different techniques in translating non-verbal behaviour, and finally to suggest techniques that can successfully convey the meaning of non-verbal behaviour in translation. The study uses as its source of data an English novel entitled A Thousand Splendid Suns , and its Malay translation, Seribu Matahari Syurga , and is guided by Poyatos' (2002b) framework on how non-verbal behaviour can be communicated in fiction. The analysis shows that non-verbal behaviour is either described or omitted in translation. The description of non-verbal behaviour, however, does not guarantee that meaning is successfully conveyed to the target readers. Likewise, the omission of non-verbal behaviour in the translation does not automatically imply loss of meaning. What is important is the reproduction of the same function or meaning in the translated text. The findings of this study underline the importance of properly addressing non-verbal behaviour in translation and demonstrate how the functional approach in translation can be employed to find not only suitable solutions to translations problems but also those which are meaningful to the target readers.

J	Abidin, EZZ; Mustapha, NF; Abd Rahim, N; Abdullah, SNS				Abidin, Enid Zureen Zainal; Mustapha, Nik Farhan; Abd Rahim, Normaliza; Abdullah, Syed Nurulakla Syed			Translation of Idioms from Arabic into Malay via Google Translate: What Needs to Be Done?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Indonesian	Article						Google Translate; translation of Arabic-Malay idiom; Arabic-Malay translation; idiom translation methods		Arabic idiomatic expressions, a type of figurative language which is different from its denotative meaning, need to be translated using suitable methods. Its wide use in everyday language including the newspapers and social media, poses a major challenge for Malay readers who use Google Translate (GT) tool to translate as they need to know how to use the tool optimally. Hence, the objectives of this study are to analyse and compare the translation results of Arabic-Malay idiomatic expressions of GT and dictionary translations according to idiomatic translation methods; and to summarise the Arabic-Malay idiomatic translation techiques using GT. This study applies the qualitative method through text analysis. Data were extracted from 35 idioms found in the Arabic-Arabic Contrastive Idiomatic Expressions Dictionary (KKUI) and Malay-Malay Kamus Frasa Idiomatik dan Ertinya (KFIADE) which are being used in the Al-Ghad (02) Jordan in the ArabiCorpus. A total of 105 data were translated using GT, and subsequently, detailed analysis was made on the translation results through comparison with the Malay-Malay KFIADE. The findings showed that the quality of GT translation is better when an idiomatic expression is translated within the sentence context, compared to being translated outside the sentence context. On the contrary to the main weakness of GT which translates literally, GT is able to produce good idiomatic translations in different sentences. The analysis also found that four methods for translating idioms have also been identified based on the adaptation of the Newmark (1988) Metaphorical Translation method. The most common method used by both the Malay-Malay KFIADE and GT is `changing idioms into meanings'. In addition, the flexi method is also found to be advantageous in the translation of idioms by the Malay-Malay KFIADE compared to GT. However, accuracy of GT can be improved by 5.7% by manipulating its translation data. Suitable Arabic-Malay idiomatic translation techniques using GT are proposed.

It operates differently across societies as well as genders within the same society. Thus, failure to understand such differences might result in misunderstanding and communication breakdowns. This paper discusses the phatic communication of the Javanese, the largest ethnic group in Indonesia. We focus primarily on the Javanese women who represent the majority of the Javanese population. Understanding the unique characteristics of their phatic communication would certainly play an important role in the cross-cultural network. The sociopragmatic approach is used for the analytical procedure to scrutinize the characteristics of Javanese women's phatic communication and the data are collected by taking field notes, conducting in-depth interviews, and distributing Discourse Completion Tasks (DCT) questionnaire. The findings show that Javanese women use phatic communication for initiating a conversation, intensifying camaraderie, pleasing others, expressing happiness, and consoling others. The main function is to sustain social rapport. Some phatic talk topics that may be regarded in certain cultures as intrusive and humiliating, such as those which concern one's private life, are not considered so among Javanese women. To Javanese women, phatic communication is crucial in maintaining and promoting solidarity. Understanding phatic communication among Javanese women would contribute to successful cross-cultural communication in building social networks and business affairs, definitely.

This biological taxonomy allows similiarities, differences and relationship between animals to be defined. The concept and function of biological taxonomy is 'borrowed' by Internet scientists and engineers in developing taxonomies for the Internet. Like biological taxonomy, developing taxonomies for the Internet manually is not easy and expensive because the task takes time and requires ingenuity in the field. Thus, computer scientists have used artificial intelligence approaches to develop taxonomies automatically from text. Machine learning algorithms are created to allow the machine to 'read' the text and then 'learn' to construct taxonomy from the context derived from the text. The main objective of this study is to develop an effective taxonomic learning algorithm from Malay text than the existing algorithms using hybridization methods. This study investigates the effectiveness of hybrid algorithms between the Firefly Algorithm (AKK) and the K-Means Bisecting Algorithm (PDS) and thi hybrid algorithm is called the Firefly-Bisecting Algorithm (AKK-PD). This empirical study collects data from experiments carried out on three Malay texts from the Islamic Jurisdiction, Biochemistry and Information Technology. Comparison of accuracy using F-measure shows that the AKK-PD build more accurate taxonomies than using existing algorithms when dealing with data sparseness problem. The AKK-PD is revealed to be more effective and robust compared to the seven existing algorithms. However, this exploratory study needs to be continued with a larger Malay corpus to test the robustness and resilience of this algorithm when dealing with a more general corpus than its technical and specific corpus of texts. The syntactic dependency-based extraction technique needs to be enhanced as it is obvious that this technique have resulted in the context of having serious data sparseness problems. Thus, it opens up new challenge for research about taxonomic learning from Malay texts.

Are Filipino Students' L2 Learning Goals Performance-or Masteryoriented? An Explanatory Sequential Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						goal orientation in L2; revised achievement goal theory; language motivation; explanatory sequential	ACHIEVEMENT GOALS; MOTIVATION; ORIENTATION	Whether students' goals for learning English as a second language (L2) are oriented towards performing better than others or mastering one's skills had not been traditionally investigated in language motivational research. Premised on Pintrich's (2000) revised achievement goal theory, this explanatory sequential research (Creswell, 2014) examined the influence of learners' goal orientation in L2 to their writing and speaking performances. 162 Filipino students enrolled in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course in a University in Manila participated in the study. They initially accomplished the Goal Orientation in A L2 Scale (GOALS) developed to fit the current context, alpha= .93. Then, they took two language tests, i.e., a group conversation in English for L2 speaking and an individual essay for L2 writing. Both were administered in the EAP classes as an entry requirement. Analyses yielded significant results on the influence of goal orientation on both speaking and writing. Results suggest that students with a performance orientation to L2 learning performed significantly better than those with either a mastery or a multiple goal orientation. In keeping with the sequential design, the researchers proceeded with semi-structured interviews among nine purposefully selected respondents to understand the quantitative results in greater detail. The follow-up interviews focused on two aspects of the statistical results: maladaptive influence of multiple orientation and the adaptive influence of performance orientation in L2 learning. The paper closes with implications for research and language teaching.

J	Ahmed, NAH; Jaafar, SRS				Ahmed, Noor Azureen Hamid; Jaafar, Sharifah Raihan Syed			Homorganic Nasal Assimilation in the Saribas Malay Dialect	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						homorganic nasal assimilation; velar nasal; prefix boundary; distinctive features; feature geometry	FEATURE GEOMETRY	Saribas Malay dialect is one of the main sub-dialects of the Sarawak Malay dialect spoken in East Malaysia. Saribas Malay dialect is distinctly different to the regional Malay dialect in Malaysia. The aim of this study is to explain the homorganic nasal assimilation of prefix boundary in Saribas Malay dialect. This study applied a qualitative research approach and fieldwork methods, such as word lists, interviews, and audio recording. The data gathered from ten native speakers of Saribas Malay dialect in Saratok, Sarawak. These linguistic data analysis is based on Halle's geometry features (1995). The prefix boundary of Saribas Malay dialect is velar nasal /eta/. The prefix /eta/ always assimilate to the following obstruent and liquid of the root, to form a homorganic nasal assimilation. Saribas Malay dialect data shows two types of homorganic nasal assimilation in prefix boundary; partial and total assimilation. Homorganic nasal assimilation cause adjacent segments to share the same point of articulation. This interaction reflects that homorganic nasal assimilation is sensitive to the feature spreading, whereby there is a tendency to dominate the adjacent segment and spread its features to form a segment with similar identities. The implications of this study provide an added value to the previous studies in Saribas Malay phonological dialect. Therefore, this study contributes to the development of phonological knowledge in the Saribas Malay dialect and can be a pioneer for a practical scientific research and comprehensive study.

J	Jaberi, S; Imran-Ho-Abdullah; Vengadasamy, R				Jaberi, Sareh; Imran-Ho-Abdullah; Vengadasamy, Ravichandran			Mystical Love Metaphors: A Cognitive Analysis of Sohrab Sepehri's Poetry	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						cognitive analysis; metaphors; mystical love; sohrab sepehri; poetic texts		Metaphor in poetic texts has been discussed from different perspectives. Philosophers and rhetoricians conceive of metaphor as an instrument utilized in the composition of literary texts, though metaphor proper was construed as ornamentation within a text. In cognitive linguistics, metaphor is not only confined to literary studies but it has become a commonality among all the sciences that address issues related to language and mind and it demonstrates the various ways we perceive our experiences. The present study is an investigation of mystical love metaphors in Sohrab Sepehri's poetry by drawing upon conceptual metaphor theory (CMT). Studying mystical metaphors via conceptual metaphor theory will provide a clearer perception of the ambiguous mystical concepts and can provide an exact explanation of the mapping of an abstract concept based on a concert one. The present paper will be focused on Sohrab Sepehri, a contemporary Persian poet and painter, renowned for his composition of several acclaimed Persian modern poems and mystical tendencies. Applying the cognitive approach upon metaphysical concepts proves the Lakoffian claim, which denies the possibility of producing 'pure' language even in metaphysical texts. According to this theory, the relations that exist between body, brain and interaction with the environment are the builders of unconscious mind and this kind of mundane mind cannot produce pure metaphysical experiences. In the meantime, cognitive viewpoint of language changes the notion of 'novelty' in poetic texts and argues that poetic innovations are just 'extending forms' of conventional metaphors. This paper concludes that Sepehri's mystical poems benefit from conventional cognitive metaphors about love and the complex relations between mystical metaphors are indeed the innovations that Sepehri had applied.

Thirteen Melanau variants (VM) of Sarawak has been investigated, namely Bintulu (BT), Balingian (BLGN), Mukah (MKH), Oya (OA), Igan (IGN), Dalat (DLT), Matu (MT), Daro (DO), Medong (MDG), Sungai UD (SG UD), Rajang (RJG), Kanowit (KNWT) and Tanjong (TJG). The study proves that reconstructed that BMLP has 5 vowel phonemes, ie * i, * u, * o, *., and *a and 6 diphthongs, ie * - w, * - aw, * -aj, * -ej, *uj, and *-oj. The presence of these ancient phonemes, ie phonemes vowel or diphthong phonemes occur regularly and predictably. The phoneme sporadic like BMLP *i, *u, *o, *., and *a, and diphthong phoneme, namely *-w, *-aw, *-aj, *-ej, * uj, and *-oj in particular distribution indicates that this feature is still new and is difficult to explain. However, our initial assumption is that the occurrence of sporadic innovation is likely caused by local migration factor. The new migration process occurs, thus, realizing the innovation characteristics. BMLP reconstruction process is reconstructed at a low level. Therefore, this study can be pioneer in the study of BMLP at a higher level, especially by comparing the vowel phonemes and diphthongs with the ancient Polynesian Malay language (PMP).

This paper presents a review of recent research that investigates "the perceived learning strategies of Malaysian university students in Web 2.0-based informal learning of ESL". The main research question considers how ESL learners account for the strategies of Web 2.0-based ESL learning when they engage with these tools in informal, learning settings. Questionnaires were used to generate quantitative data from the university student population (N= 400) through an on-line self-reported survey. Results suggest that the majority of the Malaysian university students (ESL learners) surveyed use learning strategies with Web 2.0 tools for their English informal learning that are intentional and purposeful, and provide valuable lifelong learning experiences too. Powerful shared intentions and thoughts guide actions, shared practice and sociocultural mediation through Web 2.0 tools and roles in this informal learning activity system, locally and globally. These learners also seek help from their peers and their own independent research, using web 2.0 tools to practice in communicative language learning environments outside of the classroom in more relaxed atmosphere. This media has enabled students to adopt new learning behaviours, cooperative practice, mutual engagement and responsibilities consistent with the realities of a rapidly changing virtual community. The participants also expressed strong positive experiences and perceptions towards learning strategies with Web 2.0 tools towards their meaningful English informal learning.

J	Jaafar, NM; Thang, SM				Jaafar, Nurjanah Mohd; Thang, Siew Ming			Revisiting Autonomy And Attributions: A Case In A Malaysian University	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						autonomy; attributions; teacher-centredness; self-critical tendency; English as a Second Language	SELF-ENHANCEMENT; STUDENTS; CRITICISM; FAILURE; SUCCESS	Contradictions often occur when concepts that originated in the West are applied in other contexts. Such is the case when concepts like autonomy and attributions are introduced in the context of language education in Asia. The claim that autonomy is universally applicable is refuted when researchers revealed findings which indicate that some Asian learners appear more teacher-dependent than autonomous. In the case of attributions, the claim that people in general credit themselves for successful outcomes (self-enhancing bias) and blame others for poor outcomes (ego-protective bias) appears to contradict findings that revealed some Asian learners have the opposite pattern of attributions, namely self-critical tendency. Such contradictions suggest the need to consider a number of factors like social, cultural and political when interpreting such concepts. Studies undertaken in the Malaysian context propose students. socio-cultural backgrounds as the reason behind their general tendencies to be teacher-centred and self-critical in the learning of English. They suggest that societies that nurture its members to respect teachers may produce self-critical learners. However, no empirical study has been undertaken to establish the relationship between autonomy and attributions in the Malaysian context. This study is an effort to bridge this gap in knowledge. A questionnaire survey was administered to 169 students of a Malaysian public university and its findings revealed their general tendencies to be both teacher-centred and selfcritical. Difference in proficiency levels has some minor influence on autonomy and attributions, and the relationship between them.

J	Isam, H; Awal, NM				Isam, Hishamudin; Awal, Norsimah Mat			Setia (Loyal) From Semantics Prosody Perspective: A Corpus-based Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						semantic prosody; value; setia/loyal; dominant lexical; amelioration		Issues pertaining to language surface from life experiences that are filtered and processed by human cognition because they are experientialist in nature. Semantics prosody which is based on this principle looks at the usage phenonmena of a particular lexical item that is often used by language users. Utilyzing semantics prosody perspective, this study aims to uncover the issue pertaining to the linguistic value of the lexical item setia/loyal that is said to be problematic (in deciding whether setia/loyal falls into the positive or negative value spectrum). This is proven when in terms of social values, setia/loyal is often regarded as the utmost important value in nation-building. For example, setia/loyal is elevated as the second principle in the Rukun Negara/National Philosophy (Loyalty to the King and Nation). Currently, the 1Malaysia concept as introduced by Malaysia's sixth Prime Minister has also outlined setia/loyal as one of the important components to ensure the success of the concept. However, the irony is past studies (specifically studies in sociology and anthropology) state that setia/loyal is aligned to negative values because by inculcating setia/loyal values, it perpertuates feudalism among Malaysians. The relationship between the social and linguistic values that conflict is related to the setia/loyal value. By utilyzing corpus based data (newspaper, book and magazine corpora) an analysis on the lexical item setia has successfully proven that in terms of linguistic values, setia is an example of amelioration or the upgrading of a word's meaning as when a word with negative sense develops a positive one. This can be shown from its collocations with a group of words that have also developed a good and positive sense.

J	Al-Sharabi, A; Ibrahim, N; Nor, NFM				al-Sharabi, Abduljalil; Ibrahim, Noraini; Nor, Nor Fariza Mohd			Representation Of Nojoud's 'Early' Marriage: A CDA Of Online English-Language Yemeni Newspapers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						critical discourse analysis; semiotic analysis; representation; multimodality; 'early' marriage in Yemen		Online English-language newspapers in Yemen are considered official windows through which Yemen is portrayed to the global world. Investigating the representation of a Yemeni social event (the Nojoud's phenomenon) to foreign readers, this paper specifically aims to identify the discourses that the newspaper texts draw upon in representing 'early marriage' in Yemen. Besides, it investigates the assumptions that the texts presuppose and the way the social actors are identified. As a qualitative analytic research, Fairclough's critical discourse analysis as well as Kress and van Leeuwen's (critical) multimodal discourse analysis employed the micro and macro discourse analysis of the online version of Yemen Times newspaper. Data analysis reveals that the selected texts draw upon a number of foregrounded and backgrounded discourses in representing 'early marriage' in Yemen including backgrounded Yemeni legal discourse, backgrounded Sharia discourse of 'maturity', and fore grounded discourse of minimum age of 18, and fore grounded discourse of sexual abuse. Simultaneously, it is uncovered that the texts presuppose many assumptions such as 'marriage in Islam', 'puberty' and the 'age documentation' in Yemen. While some of the important social actors are absent, the main social actors in the represented case are mainly identified by 'overwordings' of the age. This paper ends by offering several suggestions and recommendations that would benefit EFL (Yemeni) students, teachers, curriculum designers, journalists and translators when dealing with English-language texts reporting on local phenomenon.

J	Ho-Abdullah, I				Ho-Abdullah, Imran			A Cognitive Semantics Analysis of Malay Proverbs related to the Dog (Canis Familiaris)	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						cognitive semantics; animal proverbs; Malay language; metaphor; metonymy		Animal proverbs can be found in almost all languages. This article examines the role of cognitive mechanisms, namely the Great Chain of Being metaphor and the specific stands for the generic metonymy in Malay proverbs relating to dogs. The Great chain metaphor is based on folk culture and knowledge of the hierachy of entities in the real world. According to this hierachy, each animal has its typical instinctive behaviour. However, folk culture and knowledge might differ among cultures depending on their experience in interacting with the various animals which in turn will be reflected in the proverbs of their language. The metonymy the specific stands for the generic assumes the role of transferring a specific behaviour of the animal to a human trait generally. This allows for the creation of metaphorical schemas regarding various kinds of animals. Ibanez-Moreno's (2005) cognitive framework is applied to the analysis of Malay proverbs relating to dogs by mapping their source and target domain. Our analysis reveals that in Malay proverbs, the dog is often mapped onto human beings who are either weak, despised, bad or ignorant. Our findings confirm the differences in the propositions and metaphorical schemas in the semantics of animal proverbs.

J	Maros, M; John, A; Mydin, MB				Maros, Marlyna; John, Aslinda; Mydin, Mohd Baharim			Greeting Patterns Of Male And Female Students At A Higher Institution Of Learning: A Sociopragmatic Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						greetings; social status; social distance; sociopragmatics; Discourse Completion Tasks		The objective of this paper is to present greeting patterns among undergraduate students at a public higher learning institution in Malaysia. The study emerged from the researchers' random observations on inappropriateness of greetings behavior among the students which brought about the questions of the extent of their sociopragmatic competence. It specifically looks at the greeting patterns based on contexts, formality level and the relationships between the interlocutors. The paper will focus on presenting findings based on sex differences, and relating the gender factor to cultural and sociopragmatic aspects, based on Leech's (1993) sociopragmatics principles and Sherzer's (1987) features of male-female differences in interactions. Data from this study was collected via Discourse Completion Tasks, semi-structured interviews, and ethnographic observations. The DCT consists of 15 elicited settings, distributed to 264 respondents, giving a total of 3960 greeting outcomes. 30 respondents from the group of 264 contributed to the interview data. The ethnographic observations took 3 months of field work. Overall, the findings showed that interlocutors with close social distance preferred nonconventional greetings. Female students with close social relations would greet with the hearer with his/her first name, while male students would nod or said "hi". The presentations of the findings and discussions end with providing implications and suggestions for future research in this area.

J	Tuah, D; Shin, C; Gedat, R; Mis, MA				Tuah, Dilah; Shin, Chong; Gedat, Remmy; Mis, Mohammed Azlan			Language Choices among the Kedayan Ethnic Minority in Bekenu, Sarawak: A Preliminary Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Language choice; domain; Kedayan; ethnic minority; language sustainability		Kedayan is one of the minority ethnic groups in Bekenu, Sibuti, situated on the northern part of Sarawak. In previous studies, it was reported that most of the minority languages in Sarawak are facing language endangerment due to modernisation. This study investigates and reports on the language choices among the Kedayan community in Bekenu in order to determine the resilience of this language due to the wide usage of the Malay language, Sarawak Malay dialect and Iban language in Sarawak. This study utilizes Fishman's (1972) domain and language choice framework to study these issues. Five domains have been selected in this study, namely family, friendship, religion, education and employment domains. The quantitative data was obtained through questionnaire surveys and face to face interviews, whereas the qualitative data was secured through observations. A total of ninety informans from three different ages group were selected based on quota sampling method. This study found that the Kedayan language is resilient although it receives pressure from Sarawak Malay dialect and Iban language. The Kedayan language is the main language of interaction in all domains as well as the default language of the Kedayans. Although the Sarawak Malay dialect and Iban language are used regularly by the Kedayans, the Kedayan language is able to sustain its status and is considered at a `safe' level compared to other minoritiy languages in Sarawak.

The role of the media is vital in portraying Syrian refugees' image and affects how the Canadian public perceives them. This paper focuses on utilizing the referential and predicational strategies introduced by the Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) in framing the Syrian refugees, Liberal government, Conservative party, Canadians, and Canada (henceforth social and political actors). This study examines a total of 31 articles selected from three of the most visited Canadian news sites, namely, the Toronto Star, the Toronto Sun, and the National Post. News articles were collected beginning from the arrival of the first group of refugees in December 2015 and ending in March 2017, which marked the first anniversary of the refugees' arrival. The results obtained show that both liberal and conservative-leaning media utilized frames in ways that correspond with their ideological stance. In most cases, the limelight rarely focused on Syrian refugees. Instead, they were used as props to push the news source's ideological convictions and to condemn and shame the opposition. Therefore, it is understood, that the framing and portrayal of refugees in this narrow manner through discursive strategies obscures the complexity of the plight of Syrian refugees and depicts them as one-dimensional characters that audiences would either fear or pity.

Generally, divorce is an issue that can be discussed explicitly or openly. However, not everyone feels comfortable talking about it directly and, thus, subtle language is used to express it. This paper describes the concept of divorce that exists within the Sarawak Malay community (MIMS) by examining the use of euphemistic expressions in the domain of marital relations. A fieldwork was conducted at Kampung Buntal and Kampung Santubong, Sarawak involving interviews with two male informants and two female informants aged 40 and above. Interview questions revolved around the use of language in the topics of divorce. The data was further analyzed using the framework of Image Schemas, Conceptual Metaphors, and Metonymy within the Idealized Cognitive Models (ICMs) by Lakoff (1987). Findings reveal the use of divorce euphemisms such as sik ada jodoh gik (no longer a fated match), sik ada seratan (no longer destined), jodoh setakat tok jak (fate has run its course), seratan setakat tok jak (destiny has run its course), dah putus hubungan (have broken off the relationship), and dah bepisah (have separated) within the community. An analysis from a cognitive semantic point of view allows for a more systematic description of the MIMS' way of thinking, for example, through the image schema of Containment, Path and Source-Path-Goals, conceptual metaphors of DIVORCE IS A LOSS, MARRIAGE IS A JOURNEY and DIVORCE IS THE END OF A JOURNEY, DIVORCE IS A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP, and the metonymy BROKEN BOND SYMBOLIZES THE DIVORCE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE, as well as SEPARATION SYMBOLIZES DIVORCE. This study also explains the relationship between euphemistic meanings and the MIMS' experience and knowledge about divorce, which is based on the Malay culture and their belief in God's provision in human life.

Survival Psychology in Kevin Powers' The Yellow Birds	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						survival psychology; psychoanalysis; Kevin Powers; The Yellow Birds; war	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; MEMORY; WAR	After experiencing the American war in Iraq as a machine gunner in the U.S. Army, Kevin Powers deliberates on war and the risks surrounding the lives of all those involved in his debut novel, The Yellow Birds. This paper aims to uncover the survival psychology that underlies the behaviour of the two main characters in the novel, Private John Bartle and Private Daniel Murphy as well as other minor characters. Survival psychology expounds unpredictable and threatening situations where people's lives are at stake. They either choose to fight, flight or freeze in reaction to these horrible experiences, that is, they either take action, surrender or eventually die. In the context of war, soldiers frequently face such deadly situations. The reactions of the characters to the circumstances of war and their success and/or failure to cope with its dangers are indicative of their survival mechanism. The novel is examined according to the three major periods of impact in survival psychology, specifically, pre-impact, impact and post-impact periods. Bartle overcomes the psychological consequences of his war experience years after leaving the army, but Murphy loses his faculties in the chasms of war and consequently dies. The psychological survival of those who overcome these risks physically is not guaranteed. Such terrifying experiences of death may make these people vulnerable and exposed to psychological repercussions such as psychosis.	[Alosman, M.

J	Loi, CK; Lim, JMH				Loi, Chek Kim; Lim, Jason Miin-Hwa			Hedging in the Discussion Sections of English and Malay Educational Research Articles	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Hedging; claims; academic writing; pragmatic competence; writer-oriented hedges	DISCOURSE; ACTS	Academic writers resort to hedging as one of the interpersonal metadiscourse categories needed to present their findings cautiously in the hope that their research contribution can be accepted by the academic community. Such acceptance, to a great extent, depends on how propositions and claims are presented to the academic community. The purpose of the present study was to compare and contrast the hedges used in the Discussion sections of educational research articles in English with those in Malay. To provide additional insights, information was elicited from both English and Malay specialist informants on their perceptions of hedging in research article writing. This study contributes to an understanding on the use of hedges throughout the Discussion sections of the research articles from the two languages and possible contextual and socio-cultural factors which may have influenced their use. The corpus of the present study is made up of the Discussion sections of English and Malay research articles published between 2012 and 2017. The analytical framework of this study is based on Hyland's (1996) four hedging functions, which are writer-oriented, attribute oriented, reliability-oriented, and reader-oriented. Our analysis shows that overall, hedges are found in more English than Malay discussions. The greater number of hedges in the English data is in principle expected as English is a remarkably hedging culture. A closer examination reveals that English writers tend to subtly bring the value of the writer's contribution to the fore, tone down the force of the arguments, and bring forth the tentative nature of the conclusion drawn on the issue examined. The findings provide pedagogical implications in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classroom.

J	Rosly, NJB; Yusof, MB				Rosly, Nurul Jamilah Binti; Yusof, Maslida Binti			Conceptual Structure Representation of Causative Verb in Malay Language and Relation with Syntax	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						causative; conceptual structure; constituents; event and argument		Causative verbs can refer to an act because of something that is happening, because nothing will happen without any specific reason, for the occurrence of a favor and the reason for to justifying something. Therefore, this study will examine lexical verbs that are causative in representing the structure of the argument and its relation to syntax. To examine the lexical verb of causative in representing the structure of the argument and its relation to the syntax, this study will focus on the lexical of verb kill, force, allowed and help from the organizational class of the conceptual structure of semantics using data taken from the Corpus Base of the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka as an example of a data. The analysis of the study will use the Conceptual Structure Theory - by Ray Jackendoff (2011). Semantic representations are depicted in the form of conceptual structures within the Function [Event] that carry the conceptual structure of the formula [Event CAUSE ([THING, x], [Event ([y], [x])])]. The findings show the representation of conceptual structures for verbs to kill, force, allowed and help represented by constituents [Event CAUSE ([BE X], [Y])]), NO [event LET ([GO X], [Y])], and [Event HELP ([GO X], [Y])] to constituents [THING], [PLACE] and [PATH]. For conceptual structure representation to syntax, data findings indicate a connection between the Head Rules and Arguments Rules based on the role of the argument being a subset of the acceptance and verbal request to the Name Phrase. Consequently, this study will show the representation of conceptual structure and its relationship with systematic syntax and especially in the verbal nature.

J	Taghizadeh, A; Ghaderi, A				Taghizadeh, Ali; Ghaderi, Ali			Faith and Reason in the Mad Subjectivity: Cormac McCarthy's Post-apocalyptic Narrative The Road	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						The Road; other; subject/ivity; reason; madness		Identified as the core of human subjectivity, madness and the shattered self are among the issues which Cormac McCarthy represents in his brilliant though terrifying narrative The Road. This study attempts to address the representation of subjectivity's faith and reason in the face of physical and mental struggles in his novel. Moreover, the relation that subjectivity has to the Big Other will be analyzed under Zizekian paradigms. In the pre-Kantian era, the human subject was to struggle against an extremity of madness so as to redeem itself a state of reason. But since Kant proposed that the core of subject/ivity can be madness itself, the struggles represented in McCarthy's novel have been examined as significant events that show this core of inconsistency and madness. To do so, the present study analyzes his text to show the inconsistency of the subject/ivity of his characters along with the role of reason/madness and their relations to faith in the narrative. Particularly, it would be fruitful to focus on the contribution of what Zizek calls the "Light of Reason" and its fluctuations/fragmentations. The point opposite to this Light would be the Dark of the world, a dire night in which that mad center of human subjectivity could emerge into the novel's events. For this purpose, the paper will elaborate more thoroughly on Derrida's and Zizek's viewpoints regarding Enlightenment and subjectivity. Of the main consideration in McCarthy's text is deciding about life and death and about the force that compels his protagonists to keep fighting for their survival.

J	Vrbinc, A; Vrbinc, M				Vrbinc, Alenka; Vrbinc, Marjeta			Canonical Forms of Idioms in Online Dictionaries	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						idioms; canonical forms; dictionaries of idioms; online dictionaries; learners of English		This study focuses on the inclusion of canonical forms of idioms in different online dictionaries, and occasionally a parallel is drawn to canonical forms in print dictionaries used in the compilation of our database, which contains 141 idioms originating from literary works, ancient legends, fables and the Bible. In the foreground are dictionary users, especially learners of English, who may face a range of problems concerning canonical forms. However, we have to limit ourselves to a certain extent, which means that attention is paid mostly to the following: the use of the article preceding a noun that is the first constituent element in the idiom, the way of including information on possessives in idioms, the use of the infinitive marker, which is obligatory in some idioms beginning with a verb, the way of indicating variations in idioms, differences in the use of the apostrophe, the inclusion of similes with the comparison marker as, and lower-or upper-case initial letter. Analysis of the idioms from our database shows that the canonical forms may pose problems for lexicographers, who may not be sufficiently consistent, as well as to dictionary users, who may find it difficult to interpret the idiom correctly and consequently use it correctly. A possible variation should be indicated unambiguously and clearly, so as to make dictionary users aware that some idioms allow some flexibility in their form. If the comparison of the way a particular idiom is included in different dictionaries shows any differences, these are discussed and commented upon, suggestions are made and guidelines are proposed for improving the level of consistency, thus resulting in a more consistent as well as uniform and possibly more user-friendly inclusion of idioms.

J	Wahab, HA; Abdullah, IH; Mis, MA; Salehuddin, K				Wahab, Hamidah Abdul; Abdullah, Imran Ho; Mis, Mohammed Azlan; Salehuddin, Khazriyati			An Analysis of Death Euphemisms in Sarawak Malay Community from the Perspective of Cognitive Semantics	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						euphemism; death; image schema; conceptual metaphor; Sarawak Malay		This paper investigates the cognitive processes underlying death euphemisms used by the Sarawak Malay community. These euphemisms are polite forms of language used to replace those that are considered harsh or taboo, and inappropriate for direct speech. Through the use of death-related euphemisms, speakers are able to demonstrate politeness, thoughtfulness and awareness of others' feelings. This study, which adopts the perspective of cognitive semantics, uses the Conceptual Metaphor theoretical framework proposed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980). Several cognitive mechanisms were used to analyse the data such as image schema and conceptual metaphor. The data was collected through interviews, recordings and observations involving informants who were Malay speakers from Kuching, Sarawak. The analysis reveals that the conceptualisation of death euphemisms in Sarawak Malay speakers is based on the source-path-goal image schema, in addition to the conceptual metaphor DEATH IS A BETTER LOCATION, LIFE IS A JOURNEY, and DEATH IS A DEPARTURE [DEATH IS A JOURNEY]. In general, this study shows that the Malay culture and Islam have largely influenced the conceptualisation of death euphemisms in the Sarawak Malay community. This influence is observable through the use of soft expressions to show courtesy, in keeping with the Malay culture, which emphasizes politeness in communication. The reality of death for Muslims who will return to their Creator, Allah s.w.t., is also depicted in the euphemisms investigated. This linguistic study may serve as a reference for readers and researchers on the topic of Sarawak Malay euphemism, particularly in the field of cognitive semantics.

The conceptual framework of Victor Turner. s liminality and Homi Bhabha. s hybridity and the third space are applied in order to frame the analysis of this struggle and to show that the veil is a metaphor for the Arab woman. s positive and negative experiences. In Minaret, the protagonist, Najwa, experiences a sense of in-betweenness or liminality through crises, transitions, and resolutions of secular and religious lives. The different hybrid identities and efforts Najwa makes to come to terms with her developing Muslim identity is discussed, particularly through her and the women around her who choose to wear the veil and modest, rather than revealing, clothing. Together, these form our analysis of the Muslim Arab woman. s struggle to be Muslim through wearing the veil while living in Britain. The veil in this novel is furthermore symbolic of traditional Islamic culture and represents the struggle to be religiously faithful despite being surrounded by non-Muslims or non-practising Muslims. This then provides the means of understanding individual mobility, empowerment, and agency through which liminality is successfully negotiated in order to achieve a hybrid identity of Eastern and Western cultures.

J	Razak, ZRA				Razak, Zainur Rijal Abdul			Word Usage Variations in Arabic Newspapers: A Corpus Investigation	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						MSA; word frequency; Arabic newspaper; usage differences; stylistic		The Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is practiced in all Arab countries especially in official communication; written and spoken to unite Arab countries in certain aspects. However, a standardization of the Arabic language, particularly in the word usage is needed between Arabic countries. Seven Arabic newspapers from different countries which contain a corpus of around 87,000 words from World Affairs section are used to highlight the differences of word usage. This research is based on a theory (Kilgarriff, 2001) which states that the analysis of the consistency of word usage in corpora or sub-corpora can reveal the lexical choices. This study focuses on the discussion of several types of variations of nouns and verbs usage. The software Wordsmith 5.0 was utilized to analyze the corpus by extracting all words into frequency list and concordance. The results show that the Arabic newspapers had a great contribution in creating word usage variations, specifically in terms of spelling, loan word acceptance, verbs transitivity to particle, phrase combinations and plural formations. In some cases, the influence of foreign language such as English plays an important role in creating variation of Arabic language usage. The results of this study is hoped to increase the awareness of newspaper readers around the world regarding the significant variations in Arabic language usage and its transformations over the years.

J	Naderi, S; Keong, YC; Latif, H				Naderi, Sahar; Keong, Yuen Chee; Latif, Hafizah			The Use of Referential Cohesion in Academic Texts by Persian EFL Learners	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						academic writing; referential cohesion; systemic functional grammar; Persian EFL learners; conference papers		Writing cohesively remains a challenging task for many ESL and EFL learners and users of English, even at advanced levels. Despite its importance in academic writing, elements of cohesion have rarely been researched especially among Persian EFL writers. This study is aimed at filling the gap in the literature through an investigation of referential ties as one of the most explicit cohesion markers (Halliday and Matthiessen 2004). Papers by Persian scholars in the engineering field who attended a Nanotech conference in Malaysia, were reviewed for referential ties based on Systemic Functional Grammar (Halliday 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004). The distribution and categorization of such ties were described using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Subsequently the reference usage by Persians who performed research in Malaysian and Iranian universities were compared. A discussion is presented to examine any improvements due to the environment for the group of Persians studying in Malaysian universities using English language as the medium of instruction. The results confirm that Persians studying in Malaysian universities produce and repeat some components of referential ties more frequently in their academic writing when compared with their peers studying in Iranian universities. In addition, the results of this study are compared with the findings of some other studies among ESL/EFL learners of different nationalities to explain the cases of overuse, underuse, and misuse of referential cohesion which has implications for pedagogical objectives.

J	Jerome, C				Jerome, Collin			The Complexity Of Malay Muslim Identity In Dina Zaman's I Am Muslim	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						ethnicity; Islam; queer; Malay; Malay Muslim identity		Malay identity has been an important area of research in the field of Malay studies. Many scholars have argued that Malay identity is a product of a complex interplay of various identity markers and a dynamic adoption of diverse identity strategies. While most studies have focussed on examining Malay language, culture and religion as dominant identity markers of Malays in Malaysia, there is still a need for more research on other identity markers in the production of Malay identity. This paper explores the complexity of Malay Muslim identity, particularly queer Malay Muslims who are featured in Dina Zaman. s I am Muslim. Using the theories and research relating to ethnic, racial, and sexual identity, the paper analyses the markers and strategies employed by queer Malay Muslims in constructing their identities as well as the tensions and conflicts they experience in formulating a Malay Muslim identity marked by queerness. The results show that queer Malays in Dina. s work adopt varied identity markers and strategies in formulating their own ethnic identity which include embracing both sexuality and religious faith. The results also show that the discord between religion and sexuality becomes a major obstacle to some queer Malays who wish to assert their self-identities, but are not able to do so because of their strong iman, taqwa and ahlaq. The paper hopes to contribute to the research on Malay identity by demonstrating that same-sex sexuality, in addition to normative markers of Malayness, play a pivotal role in identity creation among queer Malay Muslims.

The objective of this study was to investigate students' self-efficacy in learning oral Arabic at UiTM. It was a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative study using a questionnaire adapted from The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and interviews. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS 17, involving 445 samples which were chosen by using the stratified random sampling technique. Qualitative data were analysed using NVIVO7 engaging 13 interviews with students. The study found that, overall; the level of self-efficacy among the students was high. Further investigation found that self-efficacy towards success in the oral Arabic course in UiTM was high while self-efficacy towards mastering oral Arabic in general was moderate. This study suggests that the concept of self-efficacy should be implemented and nurtured among students and it should be in line with their different abilities in oral Arabic. On the other hand, authentic learning materials should also be used in learning in order to become an ultimate benchmark in learning oral Arabic.

J	Li, CY; Gao, SL; Gu, S; Feng, RZ				Li Chongyue; Gao Shaole; Gu Sen; Feng Ruizhen			On The Coexistence And Complementarity Of Chinese Translation Methods Of English Metrical Poetry	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						English metrical poetry; Chinese translation; translation method; coexistence; complementarity		The Chinese translation of English metrical poetry has a history of more than one hundred years, but it is still controversial on how to translate English metrical poetry into Chinese. Chinese translators have hitherto devised three methods to render English metrical poetry: sinolization, liberalization, and poetic form transplantation. Translators practicing the methods of sinolization and liberalization belong to the group in favor of spiritual resemblance. Translators who follow the method of poetic form transplantation belong to the group in favor of formal resemblance. It is quite obvious that the two groups have disagreement on the translation standard or guiding principle. Actually the translation standards of the two groups can coexist, and the translation methods under the guidance of these different translation standards can coexist and complement each other. It is impractical and impossible to use one Chinese translation method or standard to guide all the Chinese translation practice, and the diverse Chinese translation methods of English metrical poetry can coexist and complement each other in the foreseeable future.

The specific objectives of the study are to determine the types of errors and the changes in grammatical accuracy during the duration of the English for Social Purposes course focussing on oral communication. The language data were obtained from the simulated oral interactions of 42 students participating in five role play situations during the 14-week semester. Error analysis of 126 oral interactions showed that the five common grammar errors made by the learners are preposition, question, article, plural form of nouns, subject-verb agreement and tense. Based on Dulay, Burt and Krashen's (1982) surface structure taxonomy, the main ways by which students modify the target forms are misinformation and omission, with addition of elements or misordering being less frequent. The results also showed an increase in grammatical accuracy in the students' spoken English towards the end of the course.

J	Vivanco, V				Vivanco, Veronica			Implicatures And Explicatures In English And Spanish Commercial Messages: Pragmatic Level Versus Semantic Level	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						advertising discourse; English; Spanish; implicature; explicature; consecutive sentence; semantics; pragmatics		This article analyses the differences between English and Spanish in technical advertising texts in relation to the concepts of implicature and explicature. It looks at the distinctive features of publicity discourse in both English and Spanish advertising messages. The texts studied show different patterns: fluctuation from implicit to explicit implicatures, explicatures combined with consecutive sentences, explicatures combined with implicatures, and exclusive use of implicatures. The contrast between English and Spanish reveals that the latter makes a full display of implicatures, so that the pragmatic level has a higher level of use. In contrast, English shows a tendency to combine implicatures with explicatures or with consecutive sentences, which also play the role of hidden implicatures. Both the English and Spanish language makes full use of implicatures. They are graded on a scale which ranges from implicit (veiled) to explicit (open) implicatures. The analysis shows that advertising messages share the same behaviour in the self-attribution of the concept of quality; they also show a contrast between the positive features of the company being advertised and insufficiencies of the rival companies; and, finally, this counterbalance is shown by means of the opposition open statements (haves) and implicatures (haves nots).

J	Abdullah, T				Abdullah, Tina			Meaning-Making in Literature: Unlocking Stances and Perspectives of ESL Readers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						literature; meaning-making; perspectives; stance; Transactional theory	STUDENTS	Meaning-making in reading literary texts is a process that is widely theorised, applied in instructions, and observed through research. While recognitions have been given to the value of literature for different purposes, trends in educational policies for literature in different curricula do not secure a clear and systematic way of how meaning-making should be explored. Research into meaning-making demonstrates the need to examine the process as this remains to be understudied. This study observed the meaning-making process through the stances and perspectives adopted among a group of ESL readers when meaning was made in reading a literary text. This case study employed Concurrent Verbal protocol for data collection. 31 participants, majoring in Teaching English as a Second language (TESL) were selected for the study. Qualitative data from the verbal protocol sessions were quantified using a pre-established set of 24 themes derived from the theoretical framework of the study. The themes were based on the Efferent, Aesthetic, and Critical stances and also the public and private perspectives of the Text, Reader, Universal Values, and Writer. The findings indicate that the Critical is favoured over the Efferent and Aesthetic stances. Public Textual Perspectives were also preferred over the Private Textual, Reader, Universal, and Writer's perspectives. The implication of examining the meaning-making process from multiple perspectives would nurture learning aptitudes and encourage personal connection and engagement to literature. Future research should consider expanding the investigation into the meaning-making process on other categories of readers as well as literary genres.

J	AlAmmouri, B; Salman, D				AlAmmouri, Bayan; Salman, Dina			From Bildungsroman to Geschaftsroman: The Posthuman Neoliberal Novel	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Neoliberalism; posthumanism; bildungsroman; geschaftsroman; novels	CITIZENSHIP	The emergence of posthumanism and the proliferation of neoliberal rationality have not only changed the meaning of the word human, but also the status of the human. Technological autonomy overpowers and replaces human agency and the human becomes marginal and peripheral on a planetary scale; in the same manner that humans have lost control over the machine, they have also lost control over their agentic narrative on a global scale and on a literary one. And in the same way neoliberal commodification reduces humans to non-humans and transforms technology to a transcendent other that can transform and control the body, neoliberal posthumanism transformed the genre of the novel. The authors argue that the decentralization of the human, triggered by posthumanism, and the commodification of the genre of the novel, triggered by neoliberalism, transformed the most popular subgenre of the novel, the bildungsroman into a geschaftsroman. There is considerable evidence that indicates that many contemporary novels no longer focus on the growth of human beings, but rather on the growth of businesses, instead. This paper analyzes Mohsin Hamid's How to get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia (2013), arguing that it is a poignant example of a geschaftsroman, in which the human is decentralized and the growth of the city and the development of the economy become the narrative's nucleus.

J	Augustyn, R; Prazmo, E				Augustyn, Rafal; Prazmo, Ewelina			The Spread of Chinese Virus in the Internet Discourse: A Cognitive Semantic Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						meaning potentials; conceptual integration; racist discourse; COVID-19; Chinese virus	METAPHORS	In the present paper we examine the use of non-technical terms used to refer to the SARS-Cov2 virus, which - in a deliberate or non-deliberate fashion - stress the place of the virus' origin. In particular, we consider the three following terms: Chinese virus, Wuhan virus, and Asian virus. Drawing on the cognitive semantics methodology, in particular, the notion of meaning potentials (Noren & Linell, 2007) and conceptual blending theory (Fauconnier & Turner, 2003; Brandt & Brandt, 2005; Oakley & Coulson, 2008) we aim to investigate the dynamics of meaning construal of the selected expressions in English-language Internet discourse. The main objective is to account for different interpretations of the same expressions as they are used in different contexts with, presumably, various intentions. Complex expressions such as compounds, tend to exhibit various meanings and thus, can be said to possess different meaning potentials which are activated differently depending on the contextual circumstances in the process of meaning construal, which - as we want to show in our analysis - is not always so intuitive. In this paper we thus argue that only a pragmatically-enriched model of dynamic meaning construal can account for the polysemy and frequent ambiguity of compound expressions, including semantic extensions with generally derogatory or even outright racist connotations.

J	Abd Hamid, MF; Jabar, MAA				Abd Hamid, Muhammad Faizul; Jabar, Mohd Azidan Abdul			An Interpretation of Discourse Strategies in The 2019 Budget Speech	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						2019 budget; speech text; communication; discourse strategy; critical discourse analysis	COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES	Discourse strategy can be seen as a strategic effort to achieve accessibility and intelligibility in a communication process. Because every produced discourse contains different content, through different way and for a specific group of audience. Therefore, this study aimed to identify and elaborate the discourse strategy created by the speaker to present the 2019 budget speech text. For this purpose, theoretical framework of critical discourse analysis by Fairclough (1995, 2007, 2013) was employed in the study. The analysis of the 2019 budget discourse focuses on two elements of discourse practice, namely, intertextuality and interdiscursivity element. The result of this research indicated that intertextuality construct involves three elements of intertextuality such as discourse representation, metadiscourse and presupposition. The usage of these three intertextuality elements revealed that the resulting budget discourse created is transparent, non-controversial and does not mislead the people. For interdiscursivity element, the speaker has used four types of discourse such as expository, explanatory, argumentative and expressive. The consolidation of this four interdiscursivity elements represent a variation in the presentation of information in speech. In conclusion, the identification and elaboration of the 2019 budget speech text have shown that the presentation of the budget discourse not only creates socio-economic activity but also produces a more complex discourse. Therefore, the speaker needs to act wisely in responding to people's needs for government to continue rule the country through its budget discourse strategy.

The Paraphrastic Reformulation is a process of redefining a message or an idea that is considered vague, ambiguous, or inadequate. This process is evaluated based on the similarity inherent between the two connected segments. In this regard, the process of reformulation shows the effort and capability of an individual, wheather oral or non-verbal in selecting the linguistic formula that is deemed best to clarify the meaning conveyed (Garces, 2008). This study was conducted by analyzing scholarly and scientific texts in Malay and Spanish. The findings show that both discourse markers studied, iaitu, and esto es have the same main function, namely, to explain the previously expressed idea. In addition, in terms of its distribution in discourse construction, the two discourse indicators iaitu and esto es are in the middle position, which is between the two connected segments	[Alias, Norhayati] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Pusat Kajian Bahasa & Linguist, Bangi, Malaysia	Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia	Alias, N (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Pusat Kajian Bahasa & Linguist, Bangi, Malaysia.	nasriati@ukm.edu.my						A.Kadir Jasin, 2009, MEMBANGUN BANGSA DEN; Abdullah Hassan, 2006, LINGUISTIK AM SIRI P; [Anonymous], 1987, BAHASA MALAYSIA SAIN; [Anonymous], 2009, NAHU MELAYU MUTAKHIR; [Anonymous], 1995, BAHASA KESUSASTERAAN; ANTOS G, 1982, GRUNDLAGEN THEORIE F; Asmah Omar, 2000, WACANA PERBINCANGAN; Asmah Omar, 2007, KESANTUNAN BAHASA DA; Awang Sariyan, 1991, ASAS PENULISAN DESKR; Hernandez MA, 2016, LINGUIST LIT, P295, DOI 10.17533/udea.lyl.n69a13; Blakemore D., 1993, LANG LIT, V2, P101, DOI [10.1177/096394709300200202, DOI 10.1177/096394709300200202]; Casado Velarde Manuel, 1991, LINGUISTICA ESPANOLA, VXIII, P87; David Ortega Gutierrez, 2003, CONSTITUCION ESPANOL; DLE = Real Academia Espanola, 2014, DICCIONARIO LENGUA E; Escandell Vidal M.V., 2006, INTRO PRAGMATICA; Garces Gomez Maria., 2008, ORG DISCURSO MARCADO; Gulich E., 1983, CAHIERS LINGUISTIQUE, V5, P305; Halliday Michael Alexander Kirkwood, 1976, COHESION ENGLISH; IDRIS A, 2014, GEMA ONLINE J LANGUA, V14, P189; Idris Aman, 2010, ANALISIS WACANA; Jose Luis Ruiz-Navarro, 2003, CONSTITUCION ESPANOL; Mahathir Muhammad, 2005, BAHASA SASTERA TAMAD; Martin Zorraquino M., 1993, GRAMATICA DESCRIPTIV, V3; Mazni Othman, 1999, PANDUAN MUDAH MEMBAI; Mohamed Isa Abd Majid, 2009, KOSMETIK ANDA; Mohammad Fadzeli Jaafar, 2013, JURNAL BAHASA, V13, P243; Mohd.

As a (post-)postmodern writer, Jonathan Franzen conflates contemporaneity, timelessness, placelessness and nonbelonging of his time with naturalism's determinism and realism's detailed description to offer a new version of realism called neorealism or, in his own words, tragic realism. Central to this new version of realistic fiction is the illustration of a complicated network of community, place, and the individual. The Corrections, in this regard, is a novel whose humanistic aspects show Franzen's faith in the possibility of certain kinds of 'corrections' and hence changes in the ethical and moral conditions of the characters. Franzen's tragic realism, despite showing the tragic and deterministic aspects of life, makes his readers and characters rethink what has long been taken for granted about familial, communal, and generational relationships. Thus it rekindles hopes in the possibility of mutual ethical (re) cognition of the other attainable via retrospective questioning made possible in the individuals' oscillations between certainty and doubt (i.e. epistemic imbalance). Franzen achieves these effects through displaying the complexity of the ordinary aspects of the lives of ordinary people to revive faith in ethical, humanistic and even empathic responsibility, through describing the characters' appreciation of the ethics of complexity. These relations often involve accepting or tolerating human flaws as the juxtaposition of tragic and realism suggests.

In Malaysia, the emphasis on the 'English only' approach in English language classes is still a common belief among many Malaysian ESL teachers. However, the reality is that this does not happen completely among local university students, especially in speaking skill. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the variations of L1 use, in this case Bahasa Malaysia (BM), in an English language class among university students. The study employs a qualitative approach, in which 14 participants were observed. Data gathered were analysed thematically. The findings show that generally, L1 is used by the participants for purposes reported in the literature. However, four main purposes are emphasized - task management, interpersonal use, language and content management. However, there are variations of L1 use in each category. The result provides clear justification for the need of the L1 use among university students, especially for speaking skill and that its can help build learners' confidence in improving their L2. Pedagogically, teachers need to consider learners' linguistic and cultural background in task design and allow L1 use when necessary. Without L1 use, English language learning can be discouraging for learners as it may lead to incomprehensible input. Thus, teachers have an important responsibility to design materials based on different background of learners, and be prepared for use of L1 especially among low proficiency L2 learners.

J	Dewi, N				Dewi, Novita			Ecohumanism in Teaching Poetry for EFL Students in Indonesia	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Ecohumanism; self-regulatory learning; reflection; people-nature poems	METACOGNITIVE AWARENESS	This article presents a research report on poetry teaching to Indonesian EFL students to investigate their environmental concerns. It first explores the theoretical concepts of global citizenship in the teaching of language and literature in the light of Ecohumanism. Applying metacognitive strategy or self-regulatory learning method, this study uses students' evaluation results, assignments, and reflection notes as data sources. It aims to find out to what extent reading and subsequently writing poems about the environment can raise students' awareness to care for the sustainability of earth resources. The present study reveals that, firstly, there is a lack of concern for the care of the earth, proven by the students' choice of poems to read and write. Secondly, the study shows that self-regulatory learning is suitable to implement here as shown from the students' expanding interests to deal critically with people-nature relationships through poetry reading and writing at the later stage. This study concludes that Ecohumanism as an educational paradigm can establish rationale to include ecology in language and literature teaching. The "what, how, why, and what next" in language and literature teaching should then be geared and habituated continually towards respecting Earth in this mutually dependent world.

J	Rifain, SBRM; Bin Pa, MT; Samah, R				Rifain, Syakirah Bt Rifa'in Mohd; Bin Pa, Mat Taib; Samah, Rosni			Analysis of the Language Style of Amr in the Context of Hajj in Surah Al-Bagarah	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Balaghah; the language style of amr; hajj; umrah; al-Baqarah		This study discusses on the language style of amr concerning hajj, encompassing umrah as revealed in surah al-Baqarah. This study addresses two main objectives; firstly, to identify the form and functions of amr and secondly, to summarize the implicit meaning of the diverse forms of amr in the context of hajj including umrah in surah al-Baqarah. The study is designed using qualitative approach by employing text analysis based on Quranic exegeses by traditional and modern scholars. (c)Abbas (1997) Theory is applied for the first objective and the remaining objective is based on the Theory of al-Awsiy (1988) and al-Zuhayliy (1991). The findings of the study regarding hajj and umrah encompassed two forms of amr, which are fi(c)l amr and uslub khabariy which means insyaly. Three purposes of amr are discovered within this context and they are obligatory (wajib), warning (tandid) and sunnah.With regards to the diverse types of indirect meaning of amr forms, this study found that fi(c)l amr is used as a strong and firm way to reflect the intensity of command in explaining fundamental matters. Uslub khabariy which is referred to as insyaly, is used subtly because it involves complicated matters. In conclusion, the forms of amr that have been used in specific contexts and circumstances have its own unique and implicit meanings. Thus, it is a good starting point to extend the scope of the present study to include other surah besides al-Baqarah.

Ecoethical Significance of Wilderness in Pablo Neruda's Selected Poems	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Pablo Neruda; ecocriticism; ecopoetry; wilderness; ecoethical awareness		This paper explores the ecoethical vision and ecological awareness in the selected poems of Pablo Neruda, a Nobel Prize winning poet of Latin American descent who was well known as a political poet. The structural and thematic analysis of the study will focus on the concept of 'Ethics' as one of the components of ecopoetry, which is the new brand of nature poetry and one of the components of ecocriticism which investigates the human-nature relationship. The objective of this paper is to highlight the significance of ecoethical consideration of Pablo Neruda towards wilderness. The study utilizes the theoretical frameworks of ecocriticism and ecopoetry to illuminate Neruda's call for reverence of the wilderness, flora and fauna, in the land, the sea and the sky through an ethical consideration of interdependence and interconnectedness of human and nonhuman. This paper problematizes Neruda's attitude towards nature to obtain new insights into his ethical stand towards the natural world. The discussion focuses on the poems which reflect the sense of ethics and represent the significant role of humility in shaping our sense of accountability towards the wilderness, while revealing Neruda's ideology and relationship with the non-human world.

J	Rashid, RA; Ismail, IR; Ismail, R; Mamat, R				Rashid, Roswati Abdul; Ismail, Isma Rosila; Ismail, Radhiah; Mamat, Roslina			Impoliteness in Japanese Language by Malaysian Tourist Guide	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Malaysian tourism; intercultural communication; Japanese politeness; tour guide; Japanese tourists	POLITENESS PHENOMENA	This study observes the application and patterns of Japanese linguistic politeness used by Malaysian tour guides during their guided tour sessions with the Japanese tourists. The interactions with the toruists were conducted in the Japanese language. During the guided tour sessions, the cultural encounters between the Malaysian tour guides and Japanese tourists influence the manner of communication for both parties to achieve and maintain effective and appropriate communication. The issue is whether the Japanese-speaking Malaysian tour guides, who are not native Japanese speakers, were able to perform their role using Japanese as the medium of communication and fulfil the standards of Japanese language according to the Japanese culture. Data were collected from audio-visual recordings of all interactions during the five tour sessions around Malacca City Centre and field notes. The audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, while visual recordings and field notes were used as references for details of certain interaction aspects that were not apparent in the audio recordings. The study found that most of the Japanese polite forms used were only at the teeneego (politeness form) level. Besides that, the data also revealed that several Malaysian tour guides were using the plain form for verbs and choosing vocabularies from vocabulary groups that were inappropriate based on the politeness aspect when speaking to the Japanese tourists. These practices were contradictory with the concept that ought to be practiced in the Japanese service culture. This means that politeness in the context of Japanese professional communication was not applied. However, the data analysis showed that these impoliteness manner did not affect the flow of the communication process and the intended messages were delivered during the tour. The findings can be used as a reference point for Japanese language instructors to design appropriate techniques, particularly for Japanese language lessons in tourism.

J	Lalbakhsh, P; Torkamaneh, P				Lalbakhsh, Pedram; Torkamaneh, Pouria			The City in Man: Foregrounding Psychogeography in The Blind Owl and City of Glass	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						The Blind Owl; City of Glass; psychogeography; nostalgia; urban space	REPETITION COMPULSION	New York City in Paul Auster's City of Glass and Ray in Sadeq Hedayat's The Blind Owl testify to the presence of a wasteland, setting in motion an unavoidable sense of nostalgia, confusion and fragmentation upon the protagonists. The present article argues that the pictures painted of the two metropolises with their specific cramped urban spaces function as culpable agents influencing Quinn as a New Yorker and Hedayat's narrator as a resident of Ray. The paper builds its argument upon Merlin Coverley's concept of psychogeography which supports transformation of the city as an integral part of the main characters' fates. Further, the article illustrates how in Hedayat and Auster's pieces the city reigns triumphant as the main characters fall victim to hallucination and isolation, or are left with desperate choices: in Hedayat's novella murder or acceptance of misery and in Auster's the sudden disappearance from the city and the plot horizons. To further support the argument advanced in this research, we take into account Totosy de Zepetnek's method of comparative literature and culture and its idea of parallelization that emphasizes the existence of similar social evolutions represented through the literature of various nations and carried out through the use of comparable literary conventions and symbols to stress their concerns.

Following the replacement of the faculty. s learning management system (LMS) by a unified platform, there were difficulties in conducting the same class activities that the researchers and students had grown accustomed to. Students were no longer able to initiate discussions in the target language in online forums nor were they able to use their mobile devices to access and share resources directly from the classroom. Current literature emphasises (1) the benefits of learning on SNS and (2) the advantages of mobile learning, which suggests these technologies as possible solutions to the issue discussed in the present study. The opportunities afforded by these technologies were first explored with a survey and deeper knowledge was gained with group interviews. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the survey data while computer aided qualitative analysis software was used to categorise the themes which emerged from the interviews. Smartphone ownership and SNS membership were not identified as impeding factors to adopt these tools for learning. However, several impeding factors were identified with each technology. Inhibiting issues with SNS were: the lack of privacy, the dichotomy in the notion of friendship, and paradoxically the lack of stimulus to communicate. The constraints from the mobile phones stemmed from their intrusive nature and their inability to perform the same tasks as laptops. These findings are assessed and discussed in light of other research before an SNS and smartphone system is implemented to supersede or replace the LMS.

It is utilised as a peer editing platform for students in correcting errors made by them in their essay writing. The purpose of this article is to find out how the affordances of Wikispaces encourage collaborative learning and knowledge management in correcting errors in L2 students. essays. The experience of using Wikispaces throughout the peer editing context and its affordances are described extensively based on three perspectives: pedagogical, social and technological. Data was obtained from online-writing records (students. essays), field notes, questionnaire, reflective research diary, and feedback form. The qualitative data are analysed thematically and then triangulated. In terms of pedagogical affordances, Wikispaces supports dual applications of pedagogical approaches (teaching and learning). In relation to social affordances, Wikispaces promotes a variety of interactions (peer-peer and students-teacher interactions) and the dynamics of the activities involved (individual, group and whole-class work) provide a safe and comfortable environment for social interaction and add possibility for asynchronous communications to happen through discussion forums and personal messaging. With respect to the technological affordances, it is a free, user-friendly, and easily accessible web-based tool provided via the Internet. Wikispaces secures backups as well as supports flexible learning environment with the presence of two features: page reverting and autosave. This study implicates the needs to consider the three mentioned affordances of wikis (pedagogical, social and technological) as a platform for teaching and learning.

J	Muhamad, I; Ahmad, WMAW; Mat, AC				Muhamad, Ismail; Ahmad, Wan Maizatul Akmar Wan; Mat, Azman Che			Attitudes and Reality of Arabic Skills Proficiency in j-QAF Program Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						attitude; proficiency; Arabic; primary students; j-QAF		Arabic language learning in primary schools was made compulsory by the j-QAF program. This noble intention indicates that Arabic language has been given a special status in the education system in Malaysia officially. However the fact is that learning a foreign language or a second language is not an easy task for most students. This study aims at examining attitude and Arabic language proficiency of students involved in this program. A total of 159 participants of the j-QAF program were selected from eight primary schools. They are students from the first cohort of the program. Questionnaires with appropriate items and language tests were used as instruments to obtain data for the study in order to conduct a statistical descriptive analysis. The findings of the respondents' attitude is generally positive with a strong interest to learn Arabic, which is at 66%, followed by determination at 63.52%, performance at 30.82% and encouragement at 29.56%. Whereas the language test results show that 74.21% of students are at a moderate level of writing, 60.38% in the low-level of the speech components and 51.57% at a moderate level of the reading component. In conclusion, the level of Arabic students' positive self-attitude does not reflect satisfactory achievement. Basically, this study has paved the way for the continuation of research on the attitude and achievement of primary students learning Arabic, especially in Malaysia.

However Japanese language courses at National University of Malaysia (UKM) still emphasize on the grammar aspects of the language. The usage of teaching material namely Erin ga Chousen! Nihongo Dekimasu seems to fulfill language instructor's aspiration in looking for a material that synthesizes cultural aspects in language learning classroom. The mechanism applied in this action research give prominence to student centered learning environment. This action research was implemented in two cycles. The first cycle was treated as a pilot and some improvement has been done in the 2nd cycle based on the findings and report from the 1st cycle. However there were only minor changes in the 2nd cycle mainly when students were required to present their assignments using Japanese language. The mechanism received positive feedback from the students through their commitment in completing and presenting their assignment as well as their determination in presenting using Japanese language. The action research method also encourages teachers to systematically introduce new teaching material or method that are beneficial in language teaching and learning.

J	Bakar, KA				Bakar, Kesumawati A.			RE-EXAMINING FEMININITY - THE VOICES OF LEADERSHIP IN MANAGERIAL MEETING DISCOURSE	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article								This paper contends that some of the communicative strategies employed by Malay women academic administrators are the antithesis of expected gendered speech patterns that could be triggered by the demands of leadership as well as an expression of individuality. Their observed communicative patterns contradict gender expectations and breach normative female communicative behavior. This paper chronicles the voices of 3 women academic administrators-as they project their individuality and construct their gender identities that defy gender stereotypes-and from new understandings reexamines the theory of language and gender within the context of managerial meeting discourse. Apart from understanding individual communicative styles of Malay women academic administrators, what this paper aims to demonstrate is the variation in communicative styles that exists within one gender of the same ethnic group, to re-examine the standard dichotic gender paradigm used in language and gender studies and consequently to reaffirm the concept of multiple femininities.

J	Vathanalaoha, K				Vathanalaoha, Kriangkrai			Corpus Stylistics in Contemporary English Dramas: Keywords and Semantic Fields of Delusions	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						contemporary dramas; corpus stylistics; delusion; keywords; semantic fields	LEXICAL BUNDLES	As reflected through contemporary Anglo-American dramas, delusion is considered a repertoire afflicted by the societal depression after World War II. Since post-war depression can be vocally expressed, it poses a question of how the theme of delusion could be portrayed through emotive phrases and how they are interconnected with the literary themes in dramas. This study investigates semantic fields demonstrated through corpus-based methodologies on a collection of contemporary dramas via Lancsbox and Wmatrix. Ten contemporary British and American dramas are constructed as a specialized corpus to compare with the reference corpus, built upon BNC and COCA imaginative texts. The comparison can generate keywords, lexical bundles, shared collocates, and extract the words indicating what the specialized corpus is about, or "aboutness." The meta-tiered results show that "Negative," "Wanted," "Getting and possession," and "Diseases" are the fields that relate to the aboutness of the contemporary dramas. The top 20 keywords can refer to the specialized corpus's dialogic structure and highlight four characters with dilemmas regarding the delusional disorder. The collocation network, measured by GraphColl, can raise stylistic awareness where these keywords and semantic fields are interconnected and substantiate the theme of delusion. Though literary texts are interpreted through close reading, this study argues that quantitative and qualitative aspects can be integrated to undermine the absence of positivism.

J	Subramaniam, R; Kaur, S				Subramaniam, Radika; Kaur, Sheena			A Corpus-driven Study on the Use of Passive Verb Bundles in Academic Writing: A Comparison between L1 and L2 English Speakers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Academic Writing; Corpus linguistics; Engineering; Lexico-grammatical pattern; Passive verb bundles	LEXICAL BUNDLES	Lexical bundles studies are still limited in relation to the use of verb phrase-based bundles, specifically the passive forms in academic writing. This study reveals the lexico-grammatical patterns and functional categories of passive verb bundles in the 409,373-word Malaysian Polytechnics Electronic Engineering Learner Corpus (MyPolyEELC) in comparison to the British Academic Written English (BAWE) 29,530-word sub-corpus. The Sketch Engine lexical computing tool is used to analyse both the L2 Malaysian and L1 English learner writing. Biber et al.'s (1999) structural categories framework is employed to identify the verb-phrase bundles and further locate the passive forms, whereas the functional categories are identified through Hyland's (2008a) framework. Francis et al.'s (1996) verb pattern analysis is used to identify the lexico-grammatical patterns and meaning groups of the passive verb bundles. The analyses indicate several passive verb structural categories in both learner corpora. The L2 learners disclose limited participant-oriented functions in the passive verb bundles' use, which is contrary to the L1 English learners who display profound use of participant-oriented 'engagement' and 'stance' categories through several choices of lexical verbs. The findings also show the inter-relation between the meaning group, lexico-grammatical pattern and functional category. The inter-relationship illustrates that the meaning group which motivates the lexico-grammatical pattern or vice versa, further contributes to identification of the functional category of the bundles based on a larger context of the text.

J	Al Abdely, AA				Al Abdely, Ammar A.			The Pronunciation of English Low Vowels by Iraqi EFL Learners: An Intralingual Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Low vowels production; Iraqi EFL learners; intralingual analysis; error patterns; acoustic analysis	ACQUISITION; PERCEPTION	Iraqi EFL learners of English are reported to show accented pronunciation on the segmental level, which might affect their speech intelligibility. This study aimed to identify problems encountered by Iraqi EFL learners in the production of English low vowels and account for them from an intralingual perspective. The study also aimed to identify the effect of Iraqis' English language proficiency level on their pronunciation of English low vowels. Thus, learners were divided into beginners and advanced groups to determine differences between them based on their proficiency level in English. A production test was conducted to identify error patterns of twenty Iraqi EFL learners in producing low vowels. Learners' recordings were acoustically analysed to validate the difficulties identified via the production test. Independent-samples ttests were conducted to identify any significant differences in performance for the two groups. The results showed that learners encountered problems in the production of low vowels, especially /alpha/, /ae/ and /Lambda/. The study concluded that these problems are probably ascribed to the complexities of the L2 vowel space, where vowels are close to each other and thus difficult to produce. Significant differences were identified between the two groups in terms of error means. Nonetheless, the comparison between the vowel chart obtained in this study and the charts offered in previous studies revealed that Iraqi EFL learners are still far from attaining approximant pronunciation. This requires reconsidering current texts, methodologies, and techniques used in teaching English pronunciation to allocate more attention to spectral differences among vowels.

J	Selvaraj, S; Sandaran, SC				Selvaraj, S.; Sandaran, S. C.			Discourses of Flood Disaster Preparedness by NGOs: Humanitarian Aid, Teamwork and Victimization	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Discourse; Flood Disaster Preparedness inMalaysia; Critical Discourse Analysis; NGOs; Recontextualisation Of Social Practice	MITIGATION	In recent years global warming and climate change due to human activity and natural phenomena, have become recognized as major contributors to the increased occurrence of flood events worldwide. Similarly, the frequency and seriousness of floods in Malaysia have made it a major threat to the country. To this end, research on flood disaster has increased. Most investigations have however, focused on engineering fields, thus there is a real need for research on human activities, response and involvement. Addressing the need for research on human involvement in flood, we adopt a social constructionist perspective to investigate the discursive construction of knowledge about flood disaster preparedness by NGOs commonly involved in flood mitigation and management in Johor. We draw on the perspective that disaster discourses reveal interpretations and perceptions of ways of understanding flood disaster, and that different discourses directly shape and influence response and action for flood mitigation and management. The data consists of four in-depth semi-structured interviews with officers from various NGOs. Adopting van Leeuwen's Critical Discourse Analytic approach, i.e. recontextualisation if social practice and representation of social actors and social action, the findings show that the members from NGOs employ various discourses such as discourses of flood causation, discourses of teamwork and humanitarian which have a direct impact on their actions/ response during the floods. More specifically, these discourses highlight more of what they do rather than the communities being helped. The study posits that the discourses not only show the positioning of the NGOs as humanitarians called on to help others, but via a discourse of victimization, they construct flood risk communities as helpless victims awaiting assistance. It advocates a change in mindset of the various parties involved in flood disaster mitigation and management in Malaysia, from that of perceiving the community as victims to survivors, thereby tapping on the communities' resourcefulness via discourses of empowerment, communitarianism and responsibilization.

J	Satkunananthan, AH				Satkunananthan, Anita Harris			Otherworlds, Doubles, Houses: Helen Oyeyemi's The Opposite House and White Is for Witching	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Helen Oyeyemi; Postcolonial Gothic; Trauma; Folklore; Mythology		Houses feature prominently in Helen Oyeyemi's novels, The Opposite House and White Is for Witching. I describe the connection between the Greco-Roman Underworld and the Yoruba Otherworld in Oyeyemi's texts as a "liminal intersection", one in which Gothic and supernatural metaphors from the Yoruba culture are syncretised. The Gothic tropes of the House collide with Oyeyemi's revisioning of the Yoruba pantheon and Otherworld. Key figures and symbols from Greco-Roman folklore, Yoruba mythology and European fairytales are either represented by characters in Oyeyemi's novels or are present as metaphors. The problematic postcolonial Gothic relationship between competing cultural imperatives and authorities in The Opposite House and White is For Witching takes place in these liminal intersections. I connect this struggle to the idea of transgression as agency. Pursuant to this, this article interrogates the postcolonial Gothic house as a trope in the two studied texts and argues that it is a site for the enactment of liminal and hybrid transgressions as agency through the deployment of the metaphors of doubling and that of the temporal slippage between multiple realities and the findings elucidate the ways in which the House as a gateway to the Otherworld may be a site for empowerment and decolonising through transgression.

J	Turiman, S; Abdullah, N; Noor, NM				Turiman, Syamimi; Abdullah, Normah; Noor, Noorzan Mohd			Spoken Metadiscourse in Malaysian ESL Job Interviews	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						ESL job interviews; spoken metadiscourse; metadiscourse analysis; graduate employability; job interview skills training		Various job interview skills training have been carried out to prepare students for employment. However, the outcome of job interviews is questionable, as one of the reasons for unemployment among Malaysian graduates is their inability to communicate competently in job interviews. The Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 (Higher Education) stated that unemployed graduates were also lacking in a strong command of English. Since job interviews are placed heavily on verbal exchanges between the interviewer and job candidate, the role that language plays in interaction is worth exploring. This paper investigates spoken metadiscourse in 16 actual first-stage technical and non-technical Malaysian ESL job interviews. Corpus linguistics was employed for data analysis. An adapted framework of spoken metadiscourse is employed to analyse the types and frequencies of textual and interpersonal metadiscourse in the corpus. The findings revealed that both textual and interpersonal metadiscourse were used, but there are variations in the distribution and composition of metadiscourse in the two categories across disciplines. Excessive use of metadiscourse was found to impede communication flow instead of assisting speakers to be persuasive in their speech. This implies the need for targeted instruction on metadiscourse, specifically among language learners in higher learning institutions to facilitate appropriate usage of metadiscourse in speech.

J	Baharudin, H				Baharudin, Harun			Arabic Novel Translation Strategies and Techniques used among University Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Translation Learning Strategy (SPT); translation techniques; novel translation; Arabic language learning; third Language	LANGUAGE; L1	Translation Learning Strategy (SPT) is somewhat excluded from the communicative approach in the Arabic Language curriculum, howevermany scholars acknowledge that it is a dominant strategy which is critically needed especially by the third language students who are still at the moderate level. The study aims to; 1) identify the level of translation learning strategies used in the Arabic language learning as a whole, and according to the SPT classification in particular, and 2) categorize the types of translation techniques used by the students in the translation of Arabic novels. The data was collected using a questionnaire and translated work of an Arabic novel entitled (Pengembaraan Tom Sawyer). A total of 129 undergraduates in an Arabic language degree program in public university participated. On the other hand, study on the translation of Arabic novel involved 40 students. The findings show that the overall use of translation learning strategies among university students was at moderate level. The study also shows that there were two categories of translation learning strategies used at moderate level which were translation writing strategy and mixed translation strategy. While the other three categories which were found to be at the low level were the translation reading strategy, translation speaking strategy and translation listening strategy. The Arabic novel translation technique found 130 types of translation techniques that were classified into six groups, in which the calquetranslation technique was dominant. This study concludes that SPT needs to be used with students from various levels to suit the different language abilities.

J	Abu Bakar, N; Razak, RA; Woan, LH				Abu Bakar, Norsofiah; Razak, Rogayah A.; Woan, Lim Hui			The Acquisition Of Relative Clause Among Malay Children: An Initial Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						syntactic ability; relative clause; Malay language; language acquisition; Malay children	COMPREHENSION; HEBREW; SLI	This initial study examines the development of the acquisition of relative clauses among Malay children in the Klang Valley. The objectives of the study were to determine the abilities of Malay children in using relative clause structures in Malay across two different age groups and to determine whether the acquisition of relative clauses is developmental in nature i.e. developing across the age range. In addition, this study will also analyze the error patterns produced by the subjects based on specific error categories in order to show the developmental nature of the acquisition of Malay relative clauses. Six subjects were recruited and divided into two groups: the preschool children and the primary school children aged seven. Data was collected using two main methods: (i) sentence-picture matching-to test the comprehension of relative clause structures and (ii) picture selection and picture description-to test the production abilities of relative clauses. Both activities test the abilities of subjects to comprehend and produce subject relative clauses (SRC) and object relative clauses (ORC). The findings showed that there was no significant difference between the preschool children and the primary school children in terms of the comprehension abilities of relative clauses, but there was a significant difference in terms of the production of relative clauses. The preschool children have limited abilities in the ORC when compared to the primary school subjects. Incidentally, the ORC structures have yet to be acquired by the primary school children. The ORC structures are acquired quite late and the development of relative clauses is still continuing among the primary school children. However, it was found that the mean score obtained increased with the increase in age. The qualitative analysis showed that subjects used strategies such as the simplification and substitution strategy. The subjects also use different language varieties: the preschool subjects tended to use colloquial Malay variety, while the primary school children used the standard Malay, and this dichotomy greatly affected their performance in the activities.

J	Barrot, JS				Barrot, Jessie S.			Comparing the Linguistic Complexity in Receptive and Productive Modes	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						text complexity; receptive linguistic complexity; productive linguistic complexity; microstructure analysis; narrative texts	PROFICIENCY; ACCURACY; FLUENCY; REPETITION; DIFFICULTY; FEATURES	Several studies have investigated linguistic complexity as an index of proficiency and across genres. However, very little research has been conducted in determining the difference between the linguistic complexity during receptive and productive modes. This study, therefore, attempts to fill in such a gap by providing evidence on whether the linguistic complexity that pupils can process during receptive mode is higher than what they can utilize during productive mode. Specifically, this study sought to determine the linguistic complexity level of learners' written narratives (i.e. productive mode) and reading passages most comprehensible to them (MCRPs) (i.e. receptive mode) and whether all linguistic complexity indices in MCRPs are higher than the linguistic complexity indices in written narratives. To address these objectives, this study used a narrative film to elicit the written narratives from the participants via story reconstruction. Eight graded narrative reading passages were also used to determine the most comprehensible reading passage via multiple-choice test. Using a microstructure analysis tool, the findings suggest that while the overall receptive linguistic complexity of Grades 2, 4, and 6 pupils is higher than their productive linguistic complexity, interestingly, not all indices of linguistic complexity are higher during productive mode. The implications of these findings for classroom teaching are considered more particularly in the selection of reading materials and the aspect of linguistic complexity that needs to be adjusted to facilitate comprehension.

J	Madahiian, M				Madahiian, Masoud			A Funhouse of Reading: Ontological Foregrounding in John Barth's "Lost in the Funhouse"	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						John Barth; "Lost in the Funhouse"; ontology; rupture; indeterminacy		John Barth's " Lost in the Funhouse" is a prime example of a postmodernist short fiction. The poetics of the work is mainly concerned with questions of ontology and frequently seeks to foreground this notion in different ways so much so that the reader gets lost in a funhouse of reading. Accordingly, the story has been divided into separate worlds, each trying to call into attention its own ontological existence and significance. Barth's story self-consciously implements certain techniques at different levels of his work to foreground world formation and draw the reader's attention towards the worlds of the text. His story foregrounds different planes, each of which stands independently as an ontological world: the world of language and text, the metafictional level, the projected world level, and the external world of the author. However, the resultant ontological ruptures, which are intentionally induced, cause various complications in the narrative. Ontologies are presented as unstable, and they intrude into one another. This brings about confusion, since the horizons of two or more worlds meet at a common point which brings about a critical state of affairs -ontological crisis. The above confusion, it is argued, makes an ontological funhouse in which the reader, gets lost.. This leads to a sense of uncertainty regarding the ontologies, that is, they flicker between existence and nonexistence. The texture of " Lost in the Funhouse" is thus suffused with such ontological indeterminacy.

J	Ansarimoghaddam, S; Tan, BH				Ansarimoghaddam, Shokoufeh; Tan, Bee Hoon			Undergraduates' Experiences and Attitudes of Writing in L1 and English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						attitude; writing skill; first language; English language; ESL		Writing is considered an important language skill. Although the importance of writing is undeniably realized and highly stressed by ESL scholars, educators and instructors, most ESL tertiary students and young graduates find creating a coherent and extended piece of writing difficult and challenging. Therefore, to overcome this problem, there is a need to be aware of the students' experiences and attitudes to writing in their first language and English language. This research is a quasi-experimental study that employs a mixed-method approach. Participants were 30 tertiary ESL students enrolled in an obligatory course in the first year of Bachelor of Arts (English) programme. The study compares participants' writing experiences and attitudes using questionnaire as the instrument for data collection. An interview was also conducted as a triangulation measure. Results suggest that participants mostly preferred using English language for various writing activities. Moreover, overall items of the questionnaire revealed that the there was no significant difference between the participants' writing attitudes in their first language and English language. Furthermore, with regard to each item of the questionnaire, three of them showed significant difference. Although the remaining items did not show any significant difference, most of the items did receive higher mean for attitude to writing in English than first language. Participants' interview responses revealed various reasons for their attitude, which supported findings obtained from the questionnaire analysis. The findings of the present study contribute to a better understanding of why some of the students do not like to write. Considering those reasons, instructors can then help their students to improve on their writing skill.

J	Hashim, NMHN; Alam, SS; Yusoff, NM				Hashim, Nik Mohd Hazrul Nik; Alam, Syed Shah; Yusoff, Norazlina Mohd			Relationship between Teacher's Personality, Monitoring, Learning Environment, and Students' EFL Performance	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						collaborative interaction; communication proficiency; learning environment; teacher characteristic; moderating effects		Teachers have been widely acknowledged to critically influence students learning and achievement. Nonetheless, the effects of teacher characteristics on student communication proficiency in the context of English as foreign language (EFL) learning have not received adequate attention among scholars. In contrast to most studies in the area, this article focuses on the influence of teacher-student interpersonal engagements, namely teacher ' s personality and monitoring, on EFL student communication proficiency. The purpose of this study is to explore whether teacher` s characteristics and environmental learning factors influence students` overall communication proficiency. Drawing on sociocultural theory, the authors assume that EFL learning is bi-directional in nature. In addition to conceptualizing the direct impact of domain-specific determinants of communication proficiency, internal classroom conditions and external college facilities were assessed for possible moderating effects. Using a sample of college students in twelve different campus locations from Institut Kemahiran Mara (IKM), across Malaysia, the authors performed a regression analysis to empirically test the proposed research hypotheses. All constructs demonstrated low levels of multicollinearity and measurement scales indicated sufficient reliability and validity. Results show that teacher ' s personality is an important determinant of student proficiency in English. Monitoring efforts, however, did not have a direct influence on English proficiency but coupled with teacher ' s personality and college facilities, respectively, the coefficient interaction effects became significant. The results also reveal that classroom conditions do not interact with teacher ' s personality to improve student learning outcomes, nonetheless acts more predominantly as a predictor that directly enhances students` learning. Important research implications and future research directions are suggested.

J	Samah, R; Hamid, MFA; Sha'ari, SH; Mohamad, AH				Samah, Rosni; Hamid, Mohd Fauzi Abdul; Sha'ari, Shaferul Hafes; Mohamad, Amizan Helmi			The Activities of Teaching Arabic Speaking Skills among Debate Coaches	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Arabic language; debate approaches; Arabic proficiency; speaking skills		Arabic debaters in national secondary school are students who not only possess excellent command of the language but are also able to articulate effectively their thoughts and argument in the Arabic language. The training sessions prepare the debaters with effective oral skills that are individually tailored to suit every debater's needs. The aim of this study is to identify the activities involved in the training sessions that have been designed by the coaches, particularly based on the approaches of gathering relevant vocabulary and word collocation, reinforcement and application. The data was collected by using questionnaires that focused on the three approaches. The respondents were 34 debate coaches from selected Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama, Sekolah Agama Bantuan Kerajaan and Kelas Aliran Agama. Findings from the study indicate that the debate coaches always implemented the three approaches in their training sessions. In the approach of gathering relevant Arabic words and sentences, the activity with the highest mean is finding the meaning of new words in Arabic through Arab-Malay dictionary. In the approach of reinforcement, the activity with the highest mean is correcting language errors made by students. In the approach of application, the activity with the highest mean is to make students translate sentences or words and make short sentences.

J	Sharif, AM				Sharif, Asiah Mohd			Limited Proficiency English Teachers' Language Use In Science Classrooms	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						teacher talk; content-based instruction; change; CLIL; classroom discourse	CLIL	The English for Teaching Mathematics and Science (ETeMS) policy was reversed in 2012 citing the reason that about 40% of the teachers were still using Malay in the ETeMS classroom hence, affecting the successful implementation of ETeMS. The quality of English used by the 60% and the other 40% especially in the rural areas motivates this study. Data for this investigation was obtained from three English teachers who have limited proficiency. These limited English proficiency (LEP) teachers teach science through English in a rural primary school in Malaysia. Transcripts of nine lessons, classroom observations and teacher interviews were gathered. The findings reveal that the English language used by the LEP teachers was simple and frequently riddled with errors which resulted in distortion of content taught. Errors were linked to negative transfers from Bahasa Melayu, teachers' interlanguage, unsuccessful guesswork and memorizing words without full understanding of meaning. The LEP teachers therefore, made poor models for their students. The researcher concludes that even if the LEP teachers had striven to teach completely in English, the policy may have been seen to be implemented, but the quality of classroom discourse and content taught would have been problematic.

J	Yoo, DG; Lee, J				Yoo, Duck Geun; Lee, Junkyu			Using Contextual Information In Learners' Spoken Language Communication: An Eye-Tracking Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						spoken language comprehension; predictive processing; context; English as a Foreign Language; eye-tracking		The efficiency of oral communication can vary depending on how quickly language users process not only language but also non-language information and on how that information is used. Various psycholinguistic experiments have shown that first language (L1) users incrementally form a representation by utilizing context information, and furthermore, can predict the forthcoming information. Since this topic has not been sufficiently studied using second language (L2) learners, theory and application of L2 processing are thus insufficient. This study aims to investigate, using an eye-tracking experiment, whether EFL learners can utilize visually presented contextual information during spoken language comprehension. Specifically, it eye tracked the comprehension processes of EFL learners when auditory inputs with four two-dimensional figures (e. g. Where is the large red circle?) were presented. Twenty-four learners with advanced English proficiency were asked to eye-spot figures corresponding to auditory inputs. Two conditions were manipulated in terms of figure size, color, and shape: (1) one pair of contrasting objects and; (2) two pairs of contrasting objects. It was revealed that the eye often moved to the target object before the noun (e. g. circle) was heard, adjectival information (e. g. large, red) being sufficient to restrict the domain of reference to one object in the visual display. Eye movements were thus quicker in the first condition that requires relatively little context information to distinguish the target than in the second condition that does not. The findings suggest that the subjects utilized real-time contextual information and top-down processing strategy of linguistic information in terms of Paul Grice` s maxim of quantity.

J	Ahmad, Z; Jalaluddin, NH				Ahmad, Zaharani; Jalaluddin, Nor			Incorporating Structural Diversity In The Malay Grammar	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						corpus; diversity; grammaticality; redundancy; rule		The underlying thesis of transformational generative grammar is that a grammar consists of a set of rules that governs the formation of linguistics structures and constructions.The rules are formulated based on regular patterns that are observable in the language under study.As a natural language,regularities in Malay are not homogeneous and uniform,and their realizations most often surface in various or diverse structures and constructions.Some of these structural variations are considered ungrammatical because their derivations are violating the standard rule prescribed by the grammar.Nevertheless,the so-called ' incorrect variants' are widely and productively used as attested in the corpus,and significantly has an impact on language learning.It has been reported that students are more inclined to use the ' incorrect variant ' as compared to the standard one,and this accordingly affects their grade in the examinations (Nor Hashimah et al.,2004).The issue that arises here is that there is a disagreement between the rules prescribed in the school grammar and the language used by the community outside the school.This paper argues that structural diversity in the language must be recognized,and the regularity patterning the variant needs to be generalized and formalized into rule.If the formation of the so-called ' incorrect variant ' is rule-governed,it must be accepted as well-formed and should be incorporated into the grammar.

J	Aman, I; Mustaffa, R				Aman, Idris; Mustaffa, Rosniah			Social Variation Of Malay Language In Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia: A Study On Accent, Identity And Integration	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						language variation; standard accent; Malay language; identity; integration		Language variation is conveyed through its regional or social dimension. In line with that proposition, this paper discusses the social variation of Malay language spoken in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia focussing on their accents. As part of the Malay language society, the Malays of Kuching have their own accent which is different from other Malay accents or the standard national accent. This paper analyzes the status of national standard accent and non-standard accent among the Malay informants in the city of Kuching. The discussion is based on a sociological urban dialectology research. For the analysis, five phonological variables are chosen. They are open-ended vowels (a), such as kita 'we', close-ended (i), such bilik 'room', close-ended (u), such as masuk 'enter', initial (r) or (r) 1, such as rumah 'home', and final (r) or (r) 2, such as pasar 'market'. Issues on accents are studied through four different degree of formality of speech styles, namely reading word list style (WLS), reading passage style (PS), conversational style (CS) and story-telling style (STS). Three social contextual variables -socio-economic status, sex, and age groups of the informants will be considered in the analysis. The use of national standard accent compared with the non-standard accent will be linked to issues of identity and integration.

While the speeches were aimed at informing the people of the order, it is anticipated that they contain interdiscursivity, that is a combination of discourse genres and styles, which carries out multiple functions in delivering messages pertaining to the order, based on political hegemony, ideology and culture. Prior to the announcement, the public is rife with questions and perceptions of what the MCO may involve. The speeches conveyed the Prime Minister's and the government's intentions such as delivering information, providing instruction, calming the people, and the like. Content analysis was conducted on two MCO speeches using qualitative approaches. The study is aimed at identifying functions and types of discourse, as well as deciphering techniques used to achieve the functions, using Idris Aman's (2006) discourse functions analysis framework. The study proposes interdiscursivity elements in the MCO texts, realised through five main functions of informing, providing understanding, presenting/defending opinions, expressing (one's views) and issuing orders. The study also found the use of three techniques additional to the existing framework, that of empathy, advice and appreciation. The study indicates that interdiscursivity is used in a text that contains a main objective for multiple purposes, which are determined by audience, environmental and situational factors. The presence of interdiscursivity also reflects the speaker's communication strategy, balancing between exhibiting sensitivity to public concerns and issuing the order.

J	Jain, P; Satkunananthan, AH				Jain, Priyank; Satkunananthan, Anita Harris			Pedagogical Aspects of EcoGothic Elements in Ruskin Bond's Novellas	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Postcolonial Gothic; EcoGothic; Gothic Pedagogies; Indian Gothic; Ecocriticism		This article examines the pedagogical aspect of the ecoGothic elements in Ruskin Bond's fiction, particularly the three novellas chosen to be highlighted: Angry River (Flood), Dust on Conservation) . Even his poems such as "The Pool" and "Parts of Old Dehra" carry the same sombre tone. This article will be analysing these stories, mapping their Gothic tropes such as 'Burkean Grief" and 'sympathy for the devil". In so doing, this article will be highlighting the pedagogical importance of Bond's work utilising an ecoGothic perspective married to a postcolonial Gothic pedagogical approach. The aim is to initiate a discourse around the pedagogical benefits of reading Ruskin Bond's novella from an ecoGothic perspective in order to inculcate an inter-disciplinary approach towards environment conservation. This article will mainly be using Gina Wisker for the postcolonial Gothic pedagogical framework and Thomas Nelson for his methodology of using education to combat ecological crises. The findings reveal that the conflict between humans and nature in Bond's fictions connect to a stronger underlying theme in Indian EcoGothic fiction in relation to climate change.

J	Skrzypek, D				Skrzypek, Dominika			Animacy, Anaphora and Language Change in Swedish	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						animacy; indirect anaphora; language change; definite article; Swedish		This paper considers the role of animacy in the overt marking of indirect anaphors, i.e., noun phrases (NP), which introduce new discourse referents, that are grounded in the preceding discourse by means of a grounding element, an anchor. The indirect anaphors are considered in a diachronic perspective with reference to the emergent definite article and the variation between the article and other marking elements, in particular possessive pronouns. The study is based on an annotated corpus of Swedish prosaic texts from 1200-1550, which is a period of time when the definite article undergoes the process of grammaticalization in this language. The material was sorted according to the different combinations of the animacy of the anchor and the anaphor. The indirect anaphors which are anchored by means of expressions referring to animate entities show more variation of expression than those expressions referring to inanimate entities at the onset of definite article grammaticalization, but as the grammaticalization progresses, all indirect anaphors are by default expressed by the definite article. This is connected with the ongoing grammaticalization of the definite article and its extended use in new contexts.

J	Aman, R; Shahidi, AH; Mohammed, SH				Aman, Rahim; Shahidi, A. H.; Mohammed, Siti Hajar			Internal Reconstruction of Miriek Variant	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Indonesian	Article						phonology; sound correspondences; historical linguistics; reconstruction; Miriek variant		The language of Miriek in Sarawak is the original ethnic language of the earliest tribes migrated to Miri but now is less spoken in everyday life. The shift in Miriek language can be seen through the findings of a previous study that shows a clear change in the aspect of language usage when the people of Miri migrated leading to language transitions. In order to prevent the uniqueness of the Sarawak's ethnic language from extinction, a detailed study has been carried out using the framework of Historical Linguistics through the comparative method in order to examine and identify the ancient phoneme forms of Miriek language. This study aims to give an overview of the Miriek language scattered around the country. The internal reconstruction method is used to describe the ancient form of speech in Miri. The study area is located within 5 areas around Miri involving informants that represent 5 variants of Miriek. Data is obtained throughout fieldwork via structured and unstructured interviews. The interviews of informants is conducted based on a list of almost 400 words which developed based on eight type of semantic fields. Findings which based on the order of sound correspondences revealed that the Ancient Miriek Language (BMkP) driven directly to all five variants of Miriek. The result of this study, therefore, is significantly useful input for future study in classifying BMkP in order to determine the close relationships between cognate languages.

J	Cerce, D				Cerce, Danica			Dismantling of the Dominant European Discourse in the Poetry of Jeanine Leane	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Australian Indigenous poetry; destabilising whiteness; Indigenous identity; representation and protest; socio-economic and political critique		Until very recently a marginalised voice in Australian literary studies, Australian Indigenous literature has obtained an important role in the articulation of Indigenous peoples' political thought, constituting an indictment of white Australian racism, a recuperation of neglected Aboriginal history, and a call for change. Based on the premise that literature can play an important role in both maintaining and disrupting the exercise of power, and written against the backdrop of post-colonial theory, the article deals with the collection of poems Dark Secrets: After Dreaming A.D. 1987-1961 (2010) by the contemporary Australian Indigenous author Jeanine Leane. Taking Leane's poetry as exemplary of post-colonial textual resistance to colonialist representations, the article shows how the poet, relying on the "transgenerational blood memory" intervenes in the presupposed irreducible division between subjugating and subjugated cultures, that is, the assumptions about whiteness as a static privilege-granting category and a system of dominance upon which the logic of coloniality often stands. I argue that, by mobilising various techniques and strategies to challenge the reproduction of whiteness and affirm Indigenous Australians' authentic, rather than an imposed cultural personality, Leane's verse performs both personal and collective empowerment of Indigenous Australians, and represents an important site for the renegotiation of inter-racial relationships.

J	Olimat, SN				Olimat, Sameer Naser			COVID-19 Pandemic: Euphemism and Dysphemism in Jordanian Arabic	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Euphemism; Dysphemism; Communication in a Pandemic; Coronavirus; Covid-19		COVID-19 is the major health crisis worldwide nowadays. Linguistic aspects of individuals and communities, including euphemism and dysphemism, were affected by this global challenge because choosing appropriate words to express what speakers intend to say and to reflect what they value or disvalue is a basic part of communication. Euphemism is an acceptable expression used instead of an offensive one to avoid unpleasant connotations, while dysphemism is a derogatory expression with negative suggestions used instead of neutral or polite one to attack something or someone. This paper investigates the use of euphemism and dysphemism in the Jordanian society for dealing with COVID-19. The research was approached from a sociolinguistic perspective and framed mainly within the Theory of Euphemism and Dysphemism by Allan and Burridge (1991; 2006) together with Warren's model of euphemism (1992) and Lakoff and Johnson's Conceptual Metaphor Theory (1980). A sample of 200 Jordanians was asked to respond to a questionnaire including demographic information and closed-ended and open-ended questions. The results show that the Jordanians used different euphemistic techniques in daily COVID-19 conversations, namely, metaphor, shift from Arabic into English, medical terms, and abbreviation. They show that the participants hardly adopted dysphemisms when talking about COVID-19. This paper contributes to the limited investigation of 'pandemic discourse', and to the understanding of euphemistic and dysphemistic tendencies of Jordanians during global crises. Researchers are recommended to explore paralinguistic features of speakers, namely, hand gestures, facial expressions, eye movements, body language, and tone and pitch of voice, while discussing COVID-19 themes.

Building on this argument, this article analyzes the struggles faced by the bicultural character in The Bamboo Stalk (2015), a novel written by the Kuwaiti writer, Saud Alsanousi. Jose is the son of a Filipino maid and a wealthy Kuwaiti man. Upon birth, he was disowned by his paternal family and was forced to leave for Manila with his mother, to be raised in poverty. In this article, the theory of graft by Colin Richards and selected concepts on biculturalism are appropriated to explore the manifestations of the grafted individual's identity construction, demonstrating how grafting carries a negative impact in the formation of the individual's social, religious and national identities. The narrative depicts the protagonist's dilemma and identity crisis, revealing the circumstances that has led to the formation of his split identity. While the grafted individual finds it challenging to ascertain his identity that lies between two vastly different and incompatible cultures, the majority societies in the two cultures do not accept him for who he really his. This paper therefore highlights the experience of the bicultural in establishing a clear grafted identity as presented in Alsanousi's work.	[Almutairi, Areej; Raihanah, M.

J	Ononye, CF				Ononye, Chuka Fred			Linguistic Identity and the Stylistics of Nativisation in Adichie's Purple Hibiscus	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						stylistics; Nigerian English; Igbo variety; linguistic identity; Chimamanda Adichie; Purple Hibiscus		Existing linguistic studies on prose discourse have largely focused on what Nigerian English forms (NEFs) are utilised to better express Nigerian writers' themes, but have not accommodated how the NEFs have creatively been deployed to show the writers' identity in the discourse. In filling this gap, therefore, the paper takes a text-linguistic approach, relying on insights from David Jowitt's view on Popular Nigerian English (PNE), Michael Halliday's systemic functional grammar, and aspects of stylistics discourse, in examining some of the structural features of NEFs in Chimamanda Adichie's Purple Hibiscus (PH), with a view to establishing how the Igbo variety of the PNE has motivated the use of NEFs in the novel. Five preponderant structural patterns were identified through which nativisation occurs in the text: colloquial utterances, transliteration, Igbo-influenced structure of clause, code mixing, and code switching. These structural instances of NEFs in PH have been observed to be tilted towards the Igbo variety of the PNE as motivated by the native language of the author. Thus, the NEFs are constrained by the linguistic pattern and socio-cultural world-view of the Igbo, which give the speakers of English in the region a linguistic identity that includes them in the PNE at large.

J	Khamis, N; Ho-Abdullah, I				Khamis, Noorli; Ho-Abdullah, Imran			Lexical Features of Engineering English vs. General English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						corpus; lexical features; specialized corpus; language description; ESP	VOCABULARY SIZE; DEPTH	The knowledge on the features of the English varieties is essential to understand the differences and similarities of the varieties for second language teaching and learning, either for general proficiency (EGP) or English for Specific Purposes (ESP) classes. This paper demonstrates a corpus-based comparison of the lexical features between an ESP variety (Engineering English) and a General English (GE). Two corpora are used in the study; the Engineering English Corpus (EEC) acts as the representation of the specialized language, and the British National Corpus (BNC) as the General English (GE). The analyses are conducted by employing the WordList functions of a linguistic software - Wordsmith. Discussions on the differences (or similarities) of these two corpora include general statistics, text coverage and vocabulary size. The empirical findings in this study highlight the general lexical features of both corpora. The analyses verify that the Engineering English has less varied vocabulary, but higher text coverage than the GE; in other words, most of the words are used repeatedly throughout the EEC. Thus, this study further emphasizes the importance of corpus-based lexical investigations in providing empirical evidences for language description.

J	Rajandran, K				Rajandran, Kumaran			From Matter to Spirit: Metaphors of Enlightenment in Bhagavad-gita	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Bhagavad-gita; philosophy; metaphor; yoga; enlightenment		The article examines the use of metaphors in a prominent Hindu scripture named Bhagavad-gita. Although Hindu scriptures have been analyzed for centuries, the focus is rarely on metaphors. Bhagavad-gita has 700 verses in 18 chapters and it records a historical conversation between Lord Krishna and Prince Arjuna. Krishna teaches Arjuna philosophical concepts, which are frequently articulated through metaphors. The article selects an English translation of Bhagavad-gita by Swami Prabhupada and it pursues a text analysis, which is grounded in conceptual metaphor theory (CMT). The analysis identifies the source and target domains for the metaphors, and interprets their functions. The article only explores metaphors of enlightenment, as Bhagavad-gita instructs people to become enlightened. The concept of enlightenment is conceptualized by ENLIGHTENMENT IS A JOURNEY, KNOWLEDGE IS SIGHT, KNOWLEDGE IS TASTE and KNOWLEDGE IS AN OBJECT. Bhagavad-gita conceives people as body, mind and soul because a body and mind (matter) are required to understand a soul (spirit). It endorses four yogas or methods (devotion, meditation, transcendental knowledge, virtuous acts) to obtain the results of enlightenment, which terminate reincarnation and grant Paradise. Bhagavad-gita lists two guides (mentor, scripture) although personal endeavor must be invested to move from matter to spirit. The article traces the choice of metaphors to physical and cultural experiences, besides the motivation of the translator. These metaphors may be inspired by the human body or ancient India but they should resonate with modern people. Moreover, Prabhupada's translation utilizes the metaphors to make Vaishnavism comprehensible to Westerners and to validate the denomination.

For this purpose, two chick lit novels, Tanuja Desai Hidier's Born Confused (2002) and Kim Wong Keltner's The Dim Sum of All Things (2004) are selected. By employing a conceptualised framework, influenced by Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems of development and Berry's model of acculturation, the present paper focuses on the ethnic community and the American society in which the individuals are set. Comparing the love relationships as represented within both novels indicates how the connections and interactions between the selected heroines' and their self-identity development influence the ways they acculturate with the mainstream culture as well as retain their own ethnicity. Although the theme of love has always dominated the chick lit genre, the present paper aims to fuse the notion of romance with culture and diaspora. This investigation shows how the selected theme is significant in the identity development process of the female protagonists. Therefore, this paper explicates the different aspects of a love relationship with regards to the heroines' interactions with the ethnic community and the American society. The findings show different cultural orientations between choosing a love target who belongs to the same minority group of the selected heroine and that of the mainstream Caucasian society. Furthermore, the findings indicate the influential role of a love relationship on identity development as represented within the selected novels.

J	Banikalef, AAA; Maros, M; Aladdin, A; Al-Natour, M				Banikalef, Ala'Eddin Abdullah Ahmed; Maros, Marlyna; Aladdin, Ashinida; Al-natour, Mouad			Apology Strategies in Jordanian Arabic	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Apology strategies; Jordanian Apology; intercultural differences; speech acts; Jordanian Arabic	ENGLISH	Most apology studies in the Jordanian context have investigated apologies based on a corpus of elicited data. Rarely have apologies been observed in the natural data; nor have the contextual factors that obligated these apologies been considered. This study is based on a corpus of 1100 naturally occurring apology events, collected through an ethnographic observation. Semi-structured interview was also used to examine the influence of contextual factors (social status, social distance, and severity of offence) on the choice of apology strategies. The respondents for this study were selected via convenient sampling. The naturally occurring apologies were coded using a modified version of the apology strategy typology outlined by Olshtain and Cohen (1983). There are series of findings that are worth noting; the first is that, acknowledging responsibility was the most common apology strategy in Jordanian Arabic. Second, acknowledging responsibility and swearing by God's name, formed the most frequent combination of apology strategies in this language. Third, another strategy that was high on the percentage of occurrence and deserving discussion was the non-apology strategies. Fourth, the selections of apology strategies were influenced by social status more than the degree of the severity of the offence or the social distance. Last but not least, new culture-specific apology strategies were detected in the corpus and elaborated in the paper. The findings of the study will assist material developers in preparing for resource books or modules for teaching and training of language and cultural awareness. The findings can also be used to raise the awareness about the sociocultural rules that govern the use of language functions.

J	Ying, HS; Heng, CS; Abdullah, AN				Ying, How Soo; Heng, Chan Swee; Abdullah, Ain Nadzimah			Language Vitality of Malaysian Languages and Its Relation to Identity	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						language vitality; vitality indicators; ethnic identity; Malaysian languages; primary education	ETHNOLINGUISTIC VITALITY; ATTITUDES; ENGLISH	Bahasa Malaysia is the national language in Malaysia, which acts as a national symbol that raise a sense of national unity, and maintains a sense of cultural value and identity. As the country is multicultural and multilingual, the use of Bahasa Malaysia, English, Mandarin, and Tamil invite questions of comparative vitality, which is a strength evaluation of language relative to other languages that coexist in the linguistic sphere. The present study, via the indicators such as language use, dominance and preference, language attitude and motivation, and language proficiency, aims to examine the vitality of these languages and to obtain comparative information about their connections to national and ethnic identity. Vitality Questionnaire was distributed to Malaysian primary five students fromvernacular Tamil and Chinese schools. Findings indicate that Bahasa Malaysiaand English do not have high vitality. Yet, vernacular languages are rated as having high vitality. It is suggested that ethnic languages dominantly shape ethnic identity and that they play animportant role in the students. lives at early age as compared to Bahasa Malaysia which has not gained a stronghold. Thus, the sense of national identity appears to have taken a back seat. National aspiration in this aspect of nation building is still far from being realized if it is to be nurtured and expected to be developed at this stage of growth. Within a multilingual milieu, establishing national identity appears a complex issue and language choice and use may have long term effects on the moulding of a Malaysian national identity.

The findings show positive attitudes towards Japanese language because of the closer social distance as well as the positive ethno cultural stereotypes. Positive attitudes towards international society and good perceptions towards Japanese community made integrative orientation more positive than instrumental orientation. Both integrative and instrumental orientations are closely connected with attitudes towards learning Japanese. When comparisons are made, significant differences are found based on gender and race, but not with regard to which faculties the students are from. Female students show more positive integrative orientation because they are willing to communicate in Japanese and they also have deep interest in Japanese traditional culture. Where race is concerned, Chinese students have more positive attitudes towards the characteristics of Japanese language due to the similarities of the Japanese language with their mother tongue. Malay students show more positive attitude in both integrative and instrumental orientations because they tend to explore the new world and believe the benefit of Japanese language proficiency. As a conclusion, Malaysian students, especially the students taking Japanese courses in UKM show positive attitudes towards Japanese language and have the motivation to learn Japanese.

It is necessary to become familiar with students. objectives, attitudes, learning habits and expectations of the course in order to have an appropriate and suitable syllabus and course design. This study was an attempt to investigate the perceived English language needs of students in university General English course in Iran. This is an obligatory three-credit course offered for all non-English majors, for which no specialized syllabus is proposed by the Ministry of Education and as a result different teachers would select different syllabuses, methods and textbooks based on their own beliefs and experiences while hardly considering students. real needs and wants. In order to detect students. views toward what they need to learn, their preferred learning style, and their attitudes, motivation and interest toward learning English, a revised version of questionnaire developed by Sihong (2007) was utilized. The results revealed that the students considered vocabulary as the most important component of the language which needed the most practice, whereas they found grammar as the component that they most resented and had the least expertise in. In addition, they perceived reading as the most important skill, while they considered listening and speaking as their most problematic skills. The students also showed positive attitudes and high motivation toward learning English. It is hoped that findings from this study can assist Iranian teachers and curriculum and syllabus designers to consider the importance of the students. real needs and try to develop and design materials which can fulfill the present gap.

The aim of this paper is to examine the translation of emotive metaphorical expressions of happiness from Persian to English in the Persian novel "Savushun" written by Simin Daneshvar. To achieve this aim, emotive metaphorical expressions relating to happiness from the source text and two target texts were collected. Subsequently, the conceptual metaphors underlying the metaphorical expressions in the source text and the target texts were investigated based upon the metaphor identification procedures (MIP), proposed by the Pragglejaz group (2007) and general framework of the conceptual metaphor theory (CMT). This paper attempts to identify the strategies used in the translation so that the translational equivalences of these metaphorical expressions were identified in the target texts. The conceptual metaphors of the translation were identified and compared with the conceptual metaphors in the source text. Preliminary results of the study revealed the nature of both similarities and differences in the conceptual metaphors of the source text to the target texts. The similarities are mostly attributed to the universality metaphor, whereas the differences are related to two different concepts and different culture in the translation of metaphors.

J	Kaur, N				Kaur, Naginder			A Case Study Of Tertiary Learners' Capability In Lexical Knowledge	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						lexical; vocabulary; capability; Academic Word List; Malaysian tertiary learners		Lexical competence is crucial in ensuring academic success at all levels. At tertiary level, sufficient word knowledge and lexical comprehension ensure sufficient literacy of language skills as learners need to cope with challenging academic tasks in their respective field of study. This paper reports findings of a case study of pre-degree Malaysian learners enrolled at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Perlis. The study was undertaken to find out if these learners have sufficient lexical ability before they embark on a degree programme. Nine learners of varying proficiency levels of high, average and low language proficiency were selected for this study. The data were collected in sequential two-phased procedure. The first phase involved diagnostic stage of probing learners' level of word knowledge with online Vocabulary Levels Test by Laufer and Nation. Subsequently, learners' capability within the scope of word form, spelling and pronunciation was explored through the Academic Word List Test and indepth interviews with the participants. The findings revealed that the learners' word mastery level is only between 1,000 and 3,000 words, which is far below the minimum level required for tertiary education. These insights thus inform the researcher that urgent measures must be taken in order to redeem the situation. Hence, a structured vocabulary learning programme is deemed necessary in the Malaysian English language curriculum to help learners acquire sufficient lexis before embarking on tertiary education. This would also provide our tertiary learners with the avenue to make them employable and marketable graduates with firm language proficiency in general and lexical competence in particular	[Kaur, Naginder] Univ Teknol MARA Malaysia, Acad Language Studies, Shah Alam, Malaysia	Universiti Teknologi MARA	Kaur, N (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA Malaysia, Acad Language Studies, Shah Alam, Malaysia.	naginder.kaur@gmail.com	Kaur, Naginder/AAZ-7378-2021	Kaur, Naginder/0000-0001-6041-8220				Abdullah Sarah Abedi, 2004, PREPARING STUDENTS M, P100; Baftim Sharifah Sheha Syed Aziz, 2005, ORACY IN FOCUS, P87; Carter R, 1998, VOCABULARY APPL LING; Jackson H., 1998, WORDS THEIR MEANING; Jalaluddin N.

J	Shah, PM; Ahmad, F				Shah, Parilah Mohd; Ahmad, Fauziah			Comparative Account of the Bilingual Education Programs in Malaysia and the United States	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						bilingual education; linguistics; challenges; immigrants; implementations; problems		This paper looks at major challenges encountered in the stipulation and implementation of bilingual education in Malaysia and the United States. It analyses in a comparative manner the language history and profile; the rationale and types of bilingual programs; the challenges faced in the development and implementation of bilingual programs in the aspects of linguistic perception and resources; and the general solutions to overcome the problems. With respect to the linguistic situation, English has a strong influence on the society in the two countries, with English holding a much higher position in the United States. Bilingual education in Malaysia is geared more towards the maintenance of the mother tongue than the one in the United States. The United States' bilingual program is more transitional in nature, although there are some schools that conduct maintenance programs. Some of the problems faced by the two countries are linguistic perception, shortage of teachers, lack of materials and the allocation of funds. Both countries embark on the same solutions to the problems. To improve the linguistic perception, the media plays a significant role by holding a system-wide public relation campaign to reduce linguistic competition. Availability of resources is made easily accessible by the two countries so that there is an increase in number and amount. These two countries accept constructive criticisms on their existing bilingual education programs; evaluation of this nature could ensure the best bilingual education for all.

J	Rahim, HA; Abu Hasan, R; Hong, AL; Joharry, SA				Rahim, Hajar Abdul; Abu Hasan, Raihana; Hong, Ang Leng; Joharry, Siti Aeisha			The Diachronic Malaysian English Corpus (DMEC): Design, Development and Challenges	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Malaysian English; diachronic corpus; diachronic changes; corpus development; corpus design		Malaysian English (ME) has received much research attention in terms of its linguistic system, and use. In the last two decades, with the development of language corpora and corpus methods, research in ME as an Outer Circle and postcolonial variety increased significantly. These corpus-based studies are important and indeed interesting but they are limited to descriptions and discussions on contemporary ME, as they are based on synchronic ME corpora. Research in diachronic changes in ME, to date, is rare to say the least. To address this gap and facilitate systematic examination of changes in ME necessitates the development of diachronic ME corpora. This article reports on the design and development of the first diachronic Malaysian English corpus (DMEC), comprising Malaysian English written texts from the 1960s until the 2010s. The six decades represent three phases of English in Malaysia, end of colonial era, postcolonial and contemporary ME. The corpus is designed to facilitate research in ME changes in terms of its linguistic system, identity and trajectory. Besides the design and development of the DMEC, three sample analyses based on the existing corpus are discussed to demonstrate the value of the corpus as a resource for diachronic research in ME. The current article, overall, contributes to existing knowledge on the development of language corpora in Malaysia and foregrounds the potential of diachronic research in ME.

J	Bin Aziz, J; Hashim, F				Bin Aziz, Jamaluddin; Hashim, Fuzirah			Rhetoric of Food Authenticity and National Identity in the New Media	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						food; authenticity; nationhood; rhetoric; new media		The global discourse on food often pivots around the issue of food security. With the new media, the discourse of food as a signifier of a national identity is constantly renewed and contested. This constant renewal and perpetual debate about food authenticity as the nexus of national identity from the Cultural Studies perspective is both the significance and the problem that the present study acknowledges and addresses. The aim of this paper is to identify, analyze and interpret the rhetorical strategies used by the media audience to reveal their attitude towards the issue. Using convenience sampling technique, a set of discourse samples is selected from the comment sections of articles on food authenticity across the new media. The corpus is analyzed using key concepts or canons in rhetoric, which are Logos, Ethos and Pathos. In addition, three rhetorical canons, invention, arrangement and style, are also used as units of analysis. The study finds that rhetors did not use the Logos (logic and fact) as one of their strategies to persuade readers to be on their side. Instead, they appealed to ethos (character and credibility) and Pathos (emotion). This evinces the idea that the media audience writing in a comment section in the new media are not basing their writing on the need to appeal to logic and fact (Logos), or proactively, but instead they are more reactionary (personal and emotive). This finding contributes towards the understanding of the media audience's rhetorical strategies in the new media.

J	Al-Ghamdi, NA; Albawardi, AH				Al-Ghamdi, Naimah Ahmad; Albawardi, Areej Hammad			Multivocality of Saudi COVID-19 Discourse in Social Media Posts: A Socio-Semiotic Multimodal Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						multivocality; multimodality; mediated COVID-19 discourse; social semiotics; Saudi context		This paper examines the discourse of COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) in social media posts and argues that the mediated COVID-19 discourse in Saudi Arabia enacted a variety of voices and thematic discourses that cannot be fully evaluated without reference to the locality of the sociolinguistic semiotics of the speech community. It attempts to construct the various non-verbal multivocalities in written and visual COVID-19 discourse present in 24 texts obtained from Saudi social media platforms, namely WhatsApp and Twitter, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the months of February, March and April, 2020. WhatsApp and Twitter are chosen because they are considered the platforms most used by Saudis in Saudi Arabia (GlobalWebIndex, 2020a, 2020b). The study employs a socio-semiotic approach to the analysis of collected data following Kress & Van Leeuwen (1996), mediated discourse analysis (Norris & Jones, 2005; Scollon, 2001) and systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA). The analysis aims at integrating the social semiotics and multimodal approaches to better understand the dynamic Saudi discourse on COVID-19. The discourse on COVID-19 has revealed the dynamic multi-layered nature of governmental, individual and public voices pertaining to COVID-19 multi-discoursal themes, novel multimodal resources and the specific cultural semiotics of Saudi Arabia. The findings of the study revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic mediated discourse is relevant to the local speech community diglossic situation, cultural semiotics, social norms and integrated national identity.

J	Shah, M; Pillai, S; Sinayah, M				Shah, Mujahid; Pillai, Stefanie; Sinayah, Malarvizhi			Identity Construction through Code-Switching Practices at a University in Pakistan	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						code-switching; hybrid identity; Pakistan; Pashto; academic setting	LANGUAGE; ENGLISH	Code-switching can be used to express and create different meanings and ideologies, as well as different identities. Speakers can choose various codes in their linguistic repertoires to do these things. In academic settings in Pakistan, English is likely to be used with Urdu and regional languages, such as Pashto, resulting in the expression and construction of different identities. In order to examine the link between code-switching and identity in a multilingual academic setting, this paper examines the construction of identity that emerges from code-switching practices among a group of lecturers and students at a university in Pakistan. Data were collected through recordings of interactions supplemented with semi-structured interviews, which were then ethnographically analysed from a micro-macro perspective. The findings revealed a seamless and dynamic use of code-switching, which was mainly in English and Pashto. The fluid nature of the code-switching makes it seem as if speakers have developed a different 'language' combining Pashto and English. Such use of code-switching reflects their socialisation in a multilingual and multicultural environment, which in turn, has led to the emergence of their hybrid identity orientations. The study contributes empirical evidence of the link between code-switching and hybrid identities in a multilingual context. The findings also imply that interactive practices should be examined from a dynamic micro-macro perspective because changes in the social environment can affect the thinking, perceptions, behaviours, and identity-orientations of the speakers.

J	Jaafar, MF; Awal, NM				Jaafar, Mohammad Fadzeli; Awal, Norsimah Mat			Linguistic Variation in Greater KL	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						pronunciation; speech; code-mixing; dominant language; social class		After six decades of independence, it is often questioned the ability of non-Malays speaking Malays. Furthermore, non-Malays, such as Chinese and Indian, still prefer vernacular schools as opposed to national schools. The study aims to investigate the competence of Chinese and Indians in Malay language, in terms of pronunciation and speaking. This study applies sociolinguistic techniques proposed by Labov (1997) and Trudgill (1997), which aims to elicit linguistic data in various contexts. In terms of pronunciation, this study uses the Reading Passage Technique. A total of 100 Indian and Chinese informants were involved in the reading test. The phonological variable tested is / r /, to be measured against standard pronunciation. While for speaking, this study uses Casual Speech echnique. A total of 20 non-Malay conversations were recorded and transcribed. The aspect studied is code mixing. The location of the study is Greater KL (Kuala Lumpur). The results showed that both races recorded over 70% for the standard pronunciation of / r /, i.e. at the beginning, middle and end syllables. While non-Malay speech showed a typical form of code-mixing (Malay-English). Malay is the dominant language (matrix language) in the non-Malay speech, while English and Chinese language particles are the embedded languages. In general, this study has successfully demonstrated the competence of non-Malays was influenced by social class and formality. This shows that the working groups were able to produce better pronunciation compared to the schoolchildren as was reported in previous studies.

J	Yang, W				Yang, Wenhsien			A Keyword Analysis of Stance and Engagement in Three-Minute Thesis (3MT) Presentations	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						three-minute thesis presentations; attendant genres; stance and engagement; personal pronouns; promotional academic discourse; keyword analysis	CROSS-DISCIPLINARY; GENRE; DISCOURSE	Due to the increasing influence of promotional culture on academic discourse, new marginal genre texts with informative and promotional purposes are emerging. In this study, we investigated a novel promotional but under-researched academic spoken genre, 3MT (three-minute thesis) presentations, which only allow the speakers 3 minutes to promote their research findings. We generated keywords of this genre using size effect metrics to identify the features of 3MT presentations delivered by PhD candidates and trained undergraduate ESP learners. The addressors were compared in their use of personal pronouns to present their stance and to interact with the audience. The results revealed that the PhD candidates tended to highlight the values and rationale of their research, whereas the ESP learners placed greater emphasis on their methodology. The PhD candidates were better at using rhetorical devices, i.e. reader pronouns and inclusive we, to invite the audience into their discourse community. Some similarities between the two groups were also identified. For example, 'you' was less deployed by both groups compared with its use in other academic spoken genre texts. Our study shows that genres are not only evolving and changing but are also heavily affected by technology advancements. Findings can also help ESP practitioners better prepare learners to make persuasive presentations in minimal time by employing personal pronouns.

J	Dwijatmoko, BB				Dwijatmoko, Benedictus Bherman			Honesty in Indonesian Literature: Its Social and Cultural Factors	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						honesty; human characteristics; social and cultural factors; Indonesian literature; corpus study	VALUE ORIENTATIONS	As an important life value, honesty is well reflected in Indonesian literature. It appears in a large number of talks and events, which involve the characters of many of its literary works. This paper is a report on a corpus study of the social and cultural factors that influence the characters' honesty as shown in the use of the words jujur (honest), sejujurnya or sejujur-jujurnya (most honest), and kejujuran (honesty). The result reveals that social position, intimacy, life and work norms, and erotic capital may affect a person's view of honesty and its practice. A person with a high social position may influence a person with a lower social position to be honest or dishonest, and the person finds it difficult not to obey him. A person having an intimate relation with another person does not hesitate to talk about matters which may threaten the addressee's negative face or his own positive face. In real life and work place, honesty is required as a norm for a person to be fully accepted. A person with a big erotic capital may gain trust from other people more easily and be considered honest. The study also reveals that the words jujur (honest) and sejujurnya or sejujur-jujurnya (most honest) are often used as a hedge to avoid a negative face-threatening act to the addressee and maintain the speaker a positive face. The speaker requests the addressee's understanding that he is a position which requires him to say something the addressee does not like.

While it accentuates that the world has evolved from simple to complex, and it moves from disorder to order, the second law preaches the opposite totally. Such inconsistency remains unsolved until the advent of chaos theory, which emphasises that the universe has the capacity to renew itself from within through a process called self-organisation. As a new paradigm shift in science, it pushed scientists to re-read Darwinism from an entirely different perspective. The paper intends to trace the various interpretations of Darwinism in Timberlake Wertenbaker's After Darwin (1998) through characters' responses to evolution, utilising chaos theory as a theoretical and methodological framework. The play, which offers a Darwinian-Dawkinsian vision of competition, ends by embracing Margulis and Sagan's view of cooperation inspired by the new science of chaos. As the only species endowed with an independently functioning brain, Man is able to adapt and turn the table against the brutality of natural selection to establish his own values.

J	Abdul-Ghafour, AQKM; Awal, NM; Zainudin, IS; Aladdin, A				Abdul-Ghafour, Abdul-Qader Khaleel Mohammed; Awal, Norsimah Mat; Zainudin, Intan Safinaz; Aladdin, Ashinida			Meanings of Near-Synonyms and Their Translation Issues in the Holy Qur'an	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Connotative meaning; contextual meaning; denotative meaning; near-synonyms; and translation		The Holy Qur'an includes near-synonyms which have seemingly similar meanings but convey different meanings upon deeper analysis of the semantic constituents of these words. Such near-synonyms usually pose a challenge that often presents itself to the translators of the Holy Qur'an. This study investigates the meanings of near-synonyms and their translation issues in the Qur'an. It aims to identify the contextual meanings of Qur'anic near-synonyms based on different exegeses of the Qur'an. Then, it explains the nuances that exist between the pairs of Qur'anic near-synonyms and how such nuances are reflected in two English translations of the Qur'an. The study adopts the Relation by Contrast Approach to Synonyms (RC-S) as a theoretical framework for data analysis. It also employs the qualitative approach for collecting and analyzing the data of the study. Besides, it makes use of different exegeses of the Qur'an to identify the differences in meaning between each pair of the Qur'anic near-synonyms. The analysis of the data reveals that there exist some nuances between the pairs of Qur'anic near-synonyms in terms of denotative and expressive meaning. The findings also show that the differences in meaning between the pairs of near-synonyms are not reflected in the English translations. Therefore, the study recommends that readers as well as translators should look for nuances between Qur'anic near-synonyms whenever they find two words with similar meanings in order to perceive the Qur'anic text appropriately and translators should make an effort to reflect the nuances between the pairs of near-synonyms in their translation.

J	Omar, RC; Kaur, J				Omar, Rozita Che; Kaur, Jagdish			The Use of Communication Strategies in Negotiation of Meaning Routine	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Communication Strategies; Negotiation of Meaning; Communicative Competence; Collaborative Communication; Synchronous Computer Mediated Communication	LEARNERS; ONLINE; CLASSROOM; SPEAKERS; SPANISH	The nature of cooperation in communication among learners and native speakers are seen to assist in enhancing the learners' communicative efficiency. Communicative competence is an approach that focuses on interaction and communication. This study is a qualitative study that analyses data from the students and native speakers' online interaction. The study is conducted to identify the communication strategy (CS) in negotiation of meaning employed by the Spanish Language learners in synchronous computer mediated communication during their interaction with native speakers. 12 types of CS were researched in this study. Apart from that, this study also elaborated on the types of CS used in the meaning negotiation routine phase. 60 students who took the Spanish Language course as elective from 3 universities, namely National University of Malaysia, Universiti Utara Malaysia and Universiti Putra Malaysia were chosen as the respondents for this study. The respondents consisted of Level I, Level II and Level III students. The main data for this study was the conversational texts between the students and the native speakers via online chat rooms. The type of interaction done was free conversations that went on for 2 hours for each session. The total time duration for all of the conversations was 120 hours. The purpose of the use of CS is to increase the fluency and continuity of the conversations without considering too much on the accuracy of the target language context. The models by Zhao (2010) and Smith (2003) were also used as guidance to view the meaning negotiation routine phase. The findings of showed that Spanish language learners, regardless of their level of language proficiency applied CS in meaning negotiation routine phase. The application of appropriate CS in meaning negotiation routine phase helps the students to succeed in communication and enhance their communicative competence in the foreign language.

J	Ismail, S; Sim, TS				Ismail, Shahril; Sim, Tam Shu			Regulation Activity in Zone of Proximal Development during Spanish Sentence Structuring	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						sociocultural theory (SCT); zone of proximal development (ZPD); mediation; regulation; sentence structuring process		Most studies which explored the concept of Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky, 1978) focus on the collaboration with experts. These studies are often designed and measured by pre and post test designs. In fact, these studies revealed the linguistic improvements of learners by comparing the global scores of the pre and post results. On the other hand, the mental process on how mediation occurs and what is the nature of the regulation activities during the learners' engagement in collaborative activities or interaction with experts are rarely examined. Moreover, in most scenarios of foreign language studies (particularly Spanish) in Malaysia, learners carry out written tasks at home, and the expert or teacher assistance is often limited. Hence, this study endeavours to explore the mental processes of how the learners solve problems during the writing of Spanish sentences especially without the presence of an expert; secondly, the study examines the nature of the regulation activities that occur during the structuring process. Using Think Aloud Protocol (TAP) on 72 Spanish basic level (novice) learners, the study was able to display the mental processes of mediation and regulation activities; it also provided a picture of the mental activities when learners are structuring the lexical and syntactic aspects of sentences in Spanish. The study also found that in the absence of an expert or a teacher, the learners who are at the novice level of their Spanish language knowledge, are able to reach the level of self-regulation through mediation with Google Translate, friends and books.

J	Jamil, NS; Yusof, M				Jamil, Nurul Shahida; Yusof, Maslida			Analysis of Kedah's Dialect Deixis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						deixis; person deixis; time deixis; space deixis; social deixis		Deixis is directly concerned with the relationship between the structure of a language and the context in which the language is used (Huang, 2007). The previous studies on deixis by local scholars focused on indigenous languages and advertisement texts. Notably that of Kamila (2006), who studied person deixis and space deixis (ini, itu, di sini and di situ) in Mah Meri. Burenhult (2004) also examined the spatial deixis in Jahai language in Hulu Perak, while Mohammad Fadzeli (2009) described the ambiguity of person, time and spatial deixis contained in a housing advertisement text. Based on these observation, studies that put forward Malay dialect in investigating deixis are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the categories and functions of the deixis elements in Kedah dialect particularly Kubang Lintah village, Lepai parish and Kota Setar district (will be referred to as DKKS henceforth). Data was obtained through observation and recorded conversations to catagorize the types of deixis and the functions of deixis in this dialect. The deixis categorisation is analysed in accordance to Huang. s deixis (2007). The study found that DKKS contain elements of person deixis that is expressed by personal pronouns and vocatives, which can be expressed by calls or summonses. DKKS also exhibits categories of time deixis and space deixis. In addition, the finding shows that social deixis is closely associated with person deixis which is concerned with codification of the social status of the speaker, the addressee, or a third person or entity referred to, as well as the social relationships between them. Analysis of the deixis also describes the categories and the functions of the deixis elements in the Kedah dialect. In DKKS, the usage of these elements also creates aspects of multifunction. In conclusion, an analysis of the deixis gives an overview of the socio-cultural and the courtesy in conversation, as exemplified by the participants from DKKS.

J	Kang, MS; Shunmugam, K				Kang, Myoung Sook; Shunmugam, Krishnavanie			The Translation Profession in Malaysia: The Translator's Status and Self-Perception	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						translator; status; perception; translation; profession		This paper aims to discuss the current status of translators practising in Malaysia and their perceptions towards the profession. The study was motivated by the dearth of literature on the status of the translator's profession in Malaysia. Past studies have shown that translation is not considered a full-fledged profession in many other countries. Translators also do not perceive their own job as belonging to a profession due to a number of reasons. This study which adopts hermeneutic phenomenology as its method of inquiry is mostly qualitative in nature with an inclusion of some basic quantitative measures. The findings of this study has revealed that though Malaysian translators regard themselves as professionals in society, clients and the public unfortunately do not share the same views. The translators also cited unfair competition from amateur translators and unprofessional practices in their profession due to a lack of code of ethics, as challenges which seriously undermine the status of their professions. The findings of this study markedly highlight the concerted effort that is needed to set up a professional body to represent the translators in Malaysia.

J	Jalaluddin, NH; Mokhtar, M; Ahmad, Z				Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah; Mokhtar, Mariati; Ahmad, Zaharani			Image Of Women In Undang-Undang Melaka: A Linguistics Evidence	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						cognitive semantic; typology; image schema; conceptual metaphor; law		Undang-Undang Melaka is considered as one of the traditional texts masterpiece. The making of Undang-Undang Melaka was commanded by Sultan Muzaffar and has been widely referred by other Malay states in constructing their traditional rule of laws. This text discusses criminal, commerce and family laws. One of the aspects discussed was on the position of women. Apparently, issues on women have always attracted attention from various perspectives such as law, history, sociology and literature. Linguistics perspective is not an exception. This article attempts to explore the positioning of women in traditional law established in Undang-Undang Melaka (UUM), 2003. The positioning of women is seen based on the linguistics evidence that is from the cognitive semantics approach. The study managed to identify two typologies of women that are derived from the Quran and Hadith. The two typologies are: 'women are from the ribs of man', and, 'women's witness is half of a man. s witness.. This paper also elaborated on the marriage relationship -divorce or sustenance of marriage due to illnesses and discusses the witness status for men and women. It is understood that the status of men in becoming a witness is more dominant as compared to women. The findings show that the position of women is best described with cognitive mechanism, namely the image schema and conceptual metaphor. The image schema produced for these two typologies is the image schema PART-WHOLE. The analysis also proves the intellectual of Malays in outlining the laws. Obviously, linguistic analysis on women has further uncovered the superiority of this text and simultaneously enhances the corpus as a research data.

To this aim, by drawing upon Robinson's (2007) Triadic Componential Framework (TCF), four levels of task complexity were operationalized. Sixty-five Iranian students studying English as a foreign language at the intermediate level participated in this research. The obtained results revealed that manipulating different dimensions of task complexity exerts differential effects on complexity, accuracy, and fluency of learners' narrative task performance. Additionally, it was shown that keeping tasks simple along the resource-dispersing dimension, while making them more demanding along the resource-directing dimension results in a simultaneous increase in complexity and accuracy, a finding which conforms to predictions based on Robinson's Cognition Hypothesis. These findings suggest that task complexity can be used as a robust basis for making grading and sequencing decisions in task-based syllabi.

J	Said, NEM; Darus, S				Said, Nur; Darus, Saadiyah			Workplace Writing In English: Insights From Malaysian Bank Managers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						workplace writing; bank executive; computer-aided; second language; Malaysia		This paper discusses the findings of a series of interviews with three local commercial bank managers, describing workplace writing among Malaysian bank executives as writers of English as a second language (ESL). Existing studies on workplace writing are found to be limited in number, particularly those that investigate writing among bank executives. In addition, the status of English as a second language (L2) poses an inherent linguistic challenge for Malaysians and, thus, results in a different set of writing needs than for native writers of English. These factors illustrate the need for an in-depth investigation of the Malaysian banking institutions context. This study is part of a larger research, and data from this study was collected through semi- structured interviews, involving three managers as experienced informants. Their feedback was divided into four categories: the language of correspondence, the writing responsibilities at each bank, the roles of computers and writing software to assist in writing tasks, and the future of writing software programs in Malaysia. The findings can be summarized as follows: English was the correspondence language in two out of the three banks; writing was a frequent responsibility among most of the executives; the executives were generally not provided any assistance with regard to writing; and, a writing software program tailored for ESL writers was deemed a necessary form of assistance in consideration of the multiple tasks that need to be performed by the bank executives.

J	Sew, JW				Sew, Jyh Wee			Alternative Views On A Semantic Cognitive Analysis Of The Affix BeR	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						academic accountability; bound morpheme; cognitive semantics; cognitive grammar; image schema		An academic discourse on ethical practice in linguistics research is an indirect education for the community of practice. Researchers are indebted to the use of research material hence the need to acknowledge the original ideas of their predecessors. It is necessary to cite the sources including diagrams, schematic representations, mainstream ideas, intellectual opinions as well as any findings in the existing research literature of the related studies in linguistics. The matter becomes relevant when cognitive linguistics is invoked as the framework for analyzing Malay prefix. The similarities between subareas of cognitive linguistics, namely image schema and cognitive grammar could be juxtaposed as mutually dependent notions so much so that the original differences in each foundation may be blurred due to a lack of distinct citations. This discussion tracks the origins of the so-called image schema in a study, which paid little attention to the original research literature. The research on beR- is found to be problematic with the combination of varrying cognitive reasonings into a web of analysis for a Malay bound morpheme.

Forty-eight students enrolled in a reading class were guided in the use of websites for language learning through completing and creating scavenger hunt-type of assignments using websites that were not specifically designed for language learning. Data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and evaluation of students' work. They revealed that despite the amount of time needed to complete the assignments, the students' attitude towards using websites to complete English assignments was generally positive. They also became more web literate during the process of completing the assignments, especially when they collaborated to create a reading assignment using sites of their own selection.

The present study sought to analyze a) the rhetorical structure of individual sections of Forestry RAs in ISI journals, and b) analyze the cyclical patterns appearing in each section. A corpus of 40 research articles from five ISI journals were selected for this study. The selected articles were extracted from high impact factor journals in Forestry. The corpus was analysed based on Kanoksilapatham (2005) model as the analytical tool to explore the rhetorical moves in the corpus. Analysis of the research articles revealed that all sections did not follow the same rhetorical structure as specified in Kanoksilapatham (2005) model. On the basis of the analysis, some new moves or steps were realized. In terms of cyclical patterns, the findings pointed to the pervasiveness of salient move cycles in each section. Awareness of the rhetorical structure of RAs functions as an avenue to empower scholars, particularly novice writers, to integrate robustly into the academic community of their discipline.

J	Alkhawaldeh, AA				Alkhawaldeh, Asim Ayed			Persuasive Strategies of Jordanian Government in Fighting Covid-19	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Covid-19; Persuasive Strategies; Interviews; Corpus; Jordanian government	METADISCOURSE; MARKERS	Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March 2020 in Jordan that has continued to grow and impact all spheres of our lives, the government has been struggling to curb the pandemic through a range of safety and health measures. To this end, the government officials have employed diverse linguistic strategies in different media outlets to realize persuasion on the target audience in order to increase their awareness about the ongoing crisis and win public compliance and cooperation. Therefore, the present paper seeks, as its overriding goal, to explore the common linguistic strategies used by the Jordanian government to enhance its credibility and convince the public of the importance of effective adherence to its Covid-19 related policies (e.g. social distancing, face mask wearing, and self-hygiene). As an eclectic method of inquiry, the study draws generally on the perspective of discourse analysis and pragmatics. In addition, our analysis is informed by a corpus-based approach. The synthesis of our findings demonstrates that the government consistently and systematically utilizes various strategies for its persuasive intention (e.g. metaphor, repetition, and religious quotation). It also shows that the rationale beyond the respective persuasive techniques seems to win public compliance and cooperation, reassure the public, undermine opponent's counterclaims, and project a trustworthy and praiseworthy image.

J	Alias, S; Sainin, MS; Mohammad, SK				Alias, Suraya; Sainin, Mohd Shamrie; Mohammad, Siti Khaotijah			Bilingual Extractive Text Summarization Model using Textual Pattern Constraints	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Indonesian	Article						Textual Pattern Constraint; Text Summarization; Sequential Pattern-Growth; Malay language	SENTENCE COMPRESSION; GROWTH	In the era of digital information, an auto-generated summary can help readers to easily find important and relevant information. Most of the studies and benchmark data sets in the field of text summarization are in English. Hence, there is a need to study the potential of Malay language in this field. This study also highlights the problems in identifying and generating important information in extractive summaries. This is because existing text representation models such as BOW has weaknesses in inaccurate semantic representation, while the N-gram model has the issue of producing very high word vector dimensions. In this study, a bilingual text summarization model named MYTextSumBASIC has been developed to generate an extractive summary automatically in Malay and English. The MYTextSumBASIC summarizer model applies a text representation model known as FASP using three Textual Pattern Constraints, namely word item constraints, adjacent word constraints and sequence size constraints. There are three main phases in the framework of MYTextSumBASIC model, which are the development of the Malay language corpus, the development of MYTextSumBASIC model using FASP and the summary evaluation phase. In the summary evaluation phase, using the Malay language data sets of 100 news articles, the summaries produced by MYTextSumBASIC outperformed the summary generated by Baseline (Lead) and OTS summarizer with the highest average for retrieval (R) is 0.5849, precision (P) is 0.5736 and the F-score (Fm) is 0.5772. For manual evaluation by linguists, the MYTextSumBASIC method yielded a reading score of 4.1 and 3.87 for summary content generated using a random data set. Further experiments using the 2002 DUC English benchmark data set of 102 news articles have also shown that the MYTextSumBASIC model outperformed the best and lowest systems in the comparison with the mean retrieval values of ROUGE-1 (0.43896) and ROUGE-2 (0.19918). These findings conclude that the FASP text representation feature along with the textual pattern constraints used by our model can be used for bilingual text with competitive performance compared to other text summarization models.

The aim of the current study was to examine the association between complex sentence comprehension and working memory (WM) in Malay adults. We predicted that WM storage (as indexed by performance on a WM listening span task) would be invoked during the processing of complex Malay sentences (object relatives), but not simple sentences (subject-verb-object). Sixty adults participated in the study; 30 Malay- and 30 English native speakers. The experimental tasks were developed in both Malay and English versions for both groups respectively. Participants completed (i) two sets of sentence comprehension tasks (whereby comprehension was determined via selection of the agent of the sentence), and (ii) a conventional WM listening span task. Tasks were designed to be structurally similar in terms of length (within the language) and meaning (across both languages). Both groups performed significantly better on the comprehension of simple sentences as compared to complex sentences and obtained similar mean scores on the WM listening span task. For Malay comprehenders, WM storage did not significantly correlate with comprehension of simple sentences as well as complex sentences. The same correlation pattern was also revealed for the English comprehenders. Our predictions were partially borne out. Findings suggest that participants' comprehension of complex sentences did not invite WM storage, as it would seem that both Malay and English participants were still able to comprehend these complex sentences without having to tax their WM capacity. Although we anticipated a relation, the absence of such an association is not entirely unexpected. Potential explanations are discussed in this article.

Thus, many economic issues are seen through the eyes of political beliefs. This paper reports on a corpus-driven analysis around the word ekonomi (economy) in the Malaysian Hansard Corpus. The objectives are to analyse the trend concerning the word ekonomi and to find out the representations around the word ekonom. The analysis showed that the word ekonomi was at its peak in Parliament 6 and Parliament 9, but declined in Parliament 8. The analysis also involved examining the collocational meaning of the word ekonomi and its collocates to determine the categories in which the word ekonomi (economy) was referenced. Positive noun collocates such as pertumbuhan (growth) and kekukuhan (stable) are mainly categorised into the government's policy, government's plan and economic activities in the country. Whilst negative noun collocates such as kemerosotan'(decline) and kelembapan (sluggish) are mostly categorised into economic situation in the country and globally and the government's effort to handle sluggish economy in Malaysia. The findings also revealed binary conceptualisations of 'us' vs. 'them', which is common in political discourse. The binary conceptualizations demonstrated that the government's efforts are commended. On the other hand, the unfavourable economic situation which happened in the country was due to factors which are beyond the government's control. The paper concludes that the representations around the word ekonomi involved justifying or legitimizing government's course of action.The study suggests a comparison of Hansard data from other Asean or Asian countries, focusing on representation of the word 'ekonomi'.

It is a challenging task for a non-native speaker to learn a foreign language, especially if the grammar of the student's dominant language is different from the grammar of the foreign language. Among the many methods employed in foreign language learning, the translation method continues to remain a controversial issue. This study is primarily designed to understand the role of translation for non-native speakers in the learning of German as a foreign language, specifically in ascertaining students' beliefs about using translation in their studies of the foreign language, and to find out the learning strategies, which involve translation. A total of 60 Malaysian undergraduates studying German as a foreign language in a public university participated in this study. Data collection was carried out using a questionnaire on the use of translation in learning German language and semi-structured interview. It can be concluded from the findings of the study that the majority of the participants believed that the use of translation is a helping strategy for learning the German language. Although a small number of the participants preferred to learn the German language without using translation, they agreed that translation really helped to develop their learning strategy, especially in a situation where they did not understand the German language spoken by their lecturer in class. It is hoped that the findings of this study will shed light on the use of translation in teaching and learning the German language.

Based on the concept of identity, this study aims to find out the concept of identity among Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) staff and to identify what needs to be done to foster a sense of identity towards UKM. The underlying theory in the present study is the Social Identity Theory (Turner & Tajfel, 1979). This study involved the participation of UKM employees from the management and professional group, academicians and support staff. The research instrument is interview sessions with the informants. Interview questions are developed based on the three constructs of identity, namely loyalty, love and pride. Data analysis shows that there is different level of understanding regarding the self-identy concept among UKM staff and this depends very much on the job position of the informants. Although there are differences whereby some informants are willing to leave UKM if they are offered better deals from outside organizations, in general UKM employees have a spirit of loyalty, love and pride towards UKM. Further research in the future can be done to solve the problems that arise among UKM staff to strengthen the self-identity concept and their association with UKM.

Fairy Tale Traditions in Amateur and Professional Young Writers' Creativity	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						fairy tale; literary traditions; narrative structure; Russian writers; modern literature		The turn of the 21st century has seen Russian writers' increased interest in the genre of fairy tale. This paper discusses young Russian writers' approaches to fairy tale traditions in texts of their own. The subjects of the study consisted of the Debut Prize winners and the so-called amateur writers (fans of Tolkien's and Rowling's books, and gamers) and their literary works. The study is aimed at establishing main trends in usage of folklore traditions in the first two decades of the 21st century; the paper is also concerned with examining similarities and differences between two generations of modern Russian writers in the matter of their approaches to classical heritage. To compare fairy tale texts, Vladimir Propp's narrative model has been applied. One of the central claims of the study is that young authors tend to emulate literary samples by prominent contemporary Russian writers (mostly by Lyudmila Petrushevskaya). Thus, an efficient way of creating a contemporary fairy tale by a young author is to immerse its characters into the modern reality that is presented in a variety of its manifestations - from everyday routine to philosophic ideas. The young writers' texts display such traditional features of literary folklorism as genuine fairy tale plots and motifs, their structural and style models, characters, magical objects, and the artistic device of estrangement.

J	Cho, S; Kim, S				Cho, Sookyung; Kim, Suyeon			L1 Translation as Scaffolding in Tutor Talk: A Case Study of Two Korean Tutors	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						writing center; scaffolding; tutor-tutee interaction; L1 translation; feedback	2ND-LANGUAGE WRITERS; WRITING CENTER; DISCOURSE; TASKS	With the increasing popularity of the communicative approach in the mid-20th century, the use of the L1 was discouraged and stigmatized in foreign language education. Since the emergence of the sociocultural perspective, however, L1 use has been reconsidered as a key mediating tool for second language learning. Utilizing this sociocultural approach, this study examines how L1 translation is used in tutor-tutee talk during writing center appointments by analyzing the talk of two Korean tutors with their seven tutees. The analysis reveals that L1 translation not only helps the tutees clarify their intended meaning in their texts, but also serves as a successful tool for cognitively scaffolding tutee learning-in the forms of pump, hint, and prompt-by helping both the tutor and tutee negotiate meaning and arrive at a solution together. The results bring new insights regarding the use of L1 translation in tutor and tutee interaction by highlighting the usefulness of L1 translation as scaffolding for language learners, particularly when their language proficiency is not advanced. This study implies that the use of L1, in particular, L1 translation may contribute to L2 learners' learning of English by facilitating their negotiations of meaning with their teachers as to finally arrive at mutual understanding of each other.

J	Gao, XW; Asmawi, A; Samuel, M				Gao Xianwei; Asmawi, Adelina; Samuel, Moses			Critical Peer Feedback For Business English Writing Through Qzone Blogs: A Mechanism Among Chinese Undergraduates	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						critical peer feedback; Qzone blog; Business English Writing; critical thinking; mechanism	PERCEPTIONS	This study explored critical peer feedback with critical thinking to improve Business English writing. Higher-order thinking skills in peer feedback is conducted to facilitate higher-level writing. This study focuses on the participants' mechanism of critical peer feedback, Qzone blog for critical peer feedback, and issues in critical peer feedback. A qualitative case study is conducted with six Chinese undergraduates. Three kinds of data including semi-structured interviews, Business English writing assignments and artifacts of critical peer feedback, are analyzed by QSR Nvivo 8. The findings reveal that critical peer feedback is a strategy of higher-order peer feedback to improve the higher-level writing. The Revised Bloom's Taxonomy is accepted for critical peer feedback. Critical peer feedback improves the quality of peer feedback and the quality of Business English writing. Qzone blog is a convenient ICT platform for critical peer feedback with many strengths. However, six issues are also perceived in the practice of critical peer feedback. The finding is significant to the process of critical peer feedback in second language writing.

J	Zakaria, S; Jalaluddin, NH				Zakaria, Suriati; Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah			The Concept of Space in Anggun Cik Tunggal: An Inquisitive Semantics Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						space; inquisitive semantic; folklore; implicit utterances; Anggun Cik Tunggal	RELEVANCE; MALAY	The civilisation of Malay literature which began as early as the 16th century has promoted witnessed oral and written traditions through the great works of Malay scholars. These works are rich with implicit meanings that are not only meant for entertainment but also serve as advice and philosophical considerations to the keen eyes of the readers. One interesting aspect is space. Space is a significant element that becomes a manifestation of social relationships, time and thoughts. The implicitness is conveyed when an addresser uses particular lexical which concurrently is able to clearly extend the concept of space to the addressees. Apart from that, space in the Malay society is not just about physical space; it reaches beyond social space as well as temporal space. At other times, the concept of space may share functions within two different domains. For instance, physical space concept may also explain the concept of temporal space. This article examines and analyses the implicit utterances in Cerita Anggun Cik Tunggal that reveals the concept of space in Malay folklore. An observation on the implicit utterances will be discussed using inquisitive semantic approach. The analysis using inquisitive semantic approach that combines the data, theory, and the speaker's cognitive as well as the philosophy not only demonstrates the Malay wisdom but also reflects the Malay mind behind the use of these utterances. The research findings show that the implicit utterances in Cerita Anggun Cik Tunggal relates space with power, physical size, strength and distance horizontally and vertically. The use and selection of these utterances also show that the Malays are sensitive towards their surroundings. Interestingly, the implicit utterances based on the physical spaces are intricately woven into the life of the Malays hence they become the reflection of the Malay mind.

J	Ong, WA				Ong, Wei Ann			Using Genre-based Writing Instruction to Teach the Writing of Literary Criticism	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						genre-based; literary criticism; ESL; teaching writing; teaching literature	DISCOURSE	Literary criticism requires students to interpret and critique a literary text using literary theories. This study examined the use of genre-based writing instruction to teach the writing of literary criticism to a group of first year undergraduate students. The genre approach used was based on the Teaching Learning Cycle (TLC) developed by Systemic Functional Linguistics scholars. Past studies have shown that there is a dearth of research studying the use of the genre approach in teaching writing for literature in the ESL context. This study was undertaken as an exploratory case study, using pre-post tests and interview as data collection methods. An analysis of respondents' essays revealed that they have improved in their ability to demonstrate all but a few of the rhetorical and linguistic conventions of a literary criticism. However, respondents who participated in the interview opined that they struggled in relating the exemplar studied during the deconstruction stage and felt that the writing instructor was too prescriptive in the joint-construction stage. Hence, the study revealed a need to hone students' mastery of the subject content and language use. Writing instructors need to cater to the needs of the learners in carrying out the TLC.

J	Roohani, A; Asiabani, S				Roohani, Ali; Asiabani, Shiva			Effects of Self-Regulated Strategy Development on EFL Learners' Reading Comprehension and Metacognition	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						reading; Self-Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD); metacognition; TWA strategy; EFL teaching	STUDENTS; COMPONENTS; KNOWLEDGE; AWARENESS	In most academic courses, success in school depends, in large part, on students' ability to read effectively and implement the reading content to their future learning. Nevertheless, the lack of evidence-based instructional strategies in reading makes reading comprehension in a foreign language more difficult. In this light, learning about reading strategies has become an important issue because it provides the basis for a substantial amount of learning in literacy education and foreign language teaching/learning. This study then examined the effectiveness of a reading comprehension instruction (self-regulated strategy development, SRSD) on Iranian EFL learners' reading comprehension of argumentative texts, and compared the effectiveness of such an instruction with nonstrategic-based (i.e., traditional) instruction. Additionally, it examined the metacognitive effects of participation in the nonstrategic-based instruction and strategic-based one, drawing on the TWA strategy (i.e., thinking before reading, thinking while reading, and thinking after reading). To achieve of this study aims, 70 Iranian EFL learners from a language school participated in the study with a pre-test and post-test control-group design. To collect data, reading summaries and a metacognitive awareness inventory (MAI) were used. Also, eht Oxford Placement Test was used to ensure the homogeneity of the participants at the entry phase, in terms of the target language (English) level. The analysis of covariance on the data indicated that the strategic-based i.e., SRSD, instruction had a positive impact on the participants' reading comprehension of argumentative texts in the experimental group (i.e., SRSD group). Also, the effect of SRSD instruction on the participants' reading comprehension of argumentative texts was significantly greater in the SRSD group than the non-SRSD (control) one. In addition, SRSD instruction significantly improved the L2 participants' metacognition (including metacognitive awareness and regulation). The results draw L2 teachers' attention to the importance of teaching self-regulated strategies as a way to improve argumentative reading and metacognition of L2 learners.

J	Li, LJ; Kaur, S				Li, Lijuan; Kaur, Sarjit			Textbook Reading Strategies and Its Relationship to Reading Test Performance	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						reading strategies; reading strategy use; reading test performance; relationship; Chinese EFL tertiary students	STUDENTS	Research studies on reading strategy use among ESL/ EFL readers are increasingly becoming one of the most attended topics for researchers and educators. This study investigated the reading strategies used by 290 Chinese EFL second year undergraduates and examined the relationship between their reading strategy use and reading test performance. The participants reported their use of reading strategies through the Survey of Reading Strategies (SORS) in three categories: global reading strategies (GLOB), problem solving strategies (PROB) and support reading strategies (SUP). Students' reading test performance was measured by using the national College English Test Band-4 (CET-4). Results showed that students used overall reading strategies at a medium frequency level. They used PROB strategies most frequently (at a high level), followed by GLOB strategies (at a medium level). The least frequently used were SUP strategies (at a medium level). The most frequently used individual strategies were re-reading, regaining concentration and guessing the content of the text. The least frequently used strategies included reading aloud, questioning, paraphrasing, and translating. There was no significant relationship between students' overall reading strategy use and their general reading test performance. However, significant relationship was found between some individual reading strategies and different test formats. Students' banked cloze test performance was positively correlated to GLOB strategies. SUP strategies were negatively correlated to students' skimming and scanning performance. Most PROB strategies were related to student performance in fast reading either positively or negatively. Pedagogical implications are discussed in relation to the Chinese EFL context.

J	Hassanpour, F; Hashim, RS				Hassanpour, Forough; Hashim, Ruzy Suliza			Reading Forough Farrokhzad's Poetry From The Perspective Of Systemic Functional Linguistics	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Farrokhzad; woman; systematic functional linguistic; Green Delusion; Iranian poet		Forough Farrokhzad was one of the most important poets in twentieth century (1935-1976) in Iran. A poet, who for the first time in the history of Persian literature broke boundaries, wrote from a feminine point of view and accentuated the experiences of being a woman. In this paper, we aim to explore her depiction of women in "Green Delusion" through a stylistic and lexico- grammatical method known as "transitivity" which is one of the most prominent part of Halliday's Systemic Functional Linguistic approach. We have shown in the present study how socially constructed meaning and linguistic structure in the poetic discourse is related. By focusing on the microelements of words, we reveal the poet's stance toward the situation of women in her society. The findings reveal that many of Farrokhzad's poems represent feminine sensibility, voicing the inner self of a woman who speaks about love, hate, death and life, simultaneously. Her poetic gesture in most of her poetry was totally feminine.

J	Aladdin, A				Aladdin, Ashinida			An Analysis Of The Usage Of Communication Strategies In Arabic Oral Communication	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						communication strategy; Arabic language; second language; lexical; oral communication		This study aims to examine how secondary school students overcome the shortage of lexicals when communicating in Arabic. The study also investigates the most frequent communication strategies used by the students as an effort to ensure that the messages are conveyed to the listener. The study is qualitative in nature, where data is collected through semi-structured interviews in Arabic with six (n=6) Form 6 students from one of the secondary religious schools in Selangor, Malaysia. Data from the interview sessions were recorded, transcribed and analysed using Tarone's (1983) taxonomy, which was conceptually rearranged by Faerch and Kasper (1983b; 1984) and Bialystok (1990) to identify the communication strategies used when dealing with the lack of lexical during oral communication. The results of the study show that the respondents have extensively used achievement strategies rather than avoidance strategies. Thus, the use of communication strategies as a systematic technique for conveying messages can assist students in improving their communication in the target language which is Arabic although they have limited linguistic competence.

J	Lan, TW				Lan, Tsang Wai			English Metalanguage Awareness Among Primary School Teachers In Hong Kong	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						metalanguage awareness; primary English teacher; grammar		With the introduction of the English Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers in Hong Kong, local English teachers' performance in the assessment has been in the spotlight. Among the five papers in the assessment, teachers' scores for the writing paper, a composite of two tasks---expository writing and error correction and explanation, have consistently recorded the lowest since the implementation. One recurrent comment is teachers' insufficient understanding and use of metalinguistic terminology. It is against this background that the present study was conducted. It aimed to explore the extent to which local English teachers in primary schools were aware of English metalinguistic terms at different structural levels. 20 in-service primary English teachers participated in an English grammar metalanguage test, modelled on Andrews (1999), and their performance revealed three key patterns: (1) the lowest mean score in the explanation component, (2) recognition of examples of grammatical functions being much harder than that of grammatical forms, and (3) errors at the word level being more readily to be corrected and explained than those at the phrasal and clausal levels. Their performance also suggested one possible discrepancy between primary English teachers and the secondary counterparts, where the primary teachers were better at the lower level of metalanguage application (e.g., recognition of examples for metalinguistic terms) and the secondary teachers at higher-level applications (e.g., error correction). The paper concludes with a suggestion that systematic micro-metalinguistic input be integrated in teacher training courses and be used more actively among in-service teachers in their teaching context.

This study involved 235 language trainee teachers at the University of Syiah Kuala. A questionnaire was used to measure emotional quotient and language achievement. Descriptive statistics of frequency, percentage and mean were used to report the respondents' profile. The descriptive findings show that the emotional intelligence of language trainee teachers in term of self awareness, self regulation, self motivation, empathy, social skills, spritual and maturity are at a high level. The analysis shows that there is a significant relationship between emotional inteligence upon years of the study. However, there is no significant relationship between self motivation, social skills, spritual and maturity upon years of the study.

J	Azyze, IJ				Azyze, Ismaznizam Jesmaj			Conservative And Antirevolutionary Ideology In The Scarlet Letter: A New Historicist Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Hawthorne; the Scarlet Letter; new historicism; ideology		This essay presents a New Historicist analysis of Hawthorne's most acclaimed novel, The Scarlet Letter. 1 The analysis focuses on the interplay between Hawthorne's nineteenthcentury ideology and the novel's seventeenth-century cultural setting. The inclusion of "The Custom House," an authorial introduction to the novel, is treated as highly significant as it presents a form of historical and ideological juxtaposition of Hawthorne's nineteenth-century ideology with the novel's seventeenth-century cultural setting. Biographical narratives on Hawthorne and historical narratives on nineteenth-century America are used extensively in this analysis as they offer valuable insights into the fictional formation of The Scarlet Letter. By historically establishing Hawthorne's conservative attitudes towards forms of revolutionary activities, this essay explicates how the structure, characterizations and themes of The Scarlet Letter are carefully formed to serve those very conservative attitudes.

J	Musaev, T; Aziz, J; Mohd, J				Musaev, Talaibek; Aziz, Jamaluddin; Mohd, Jamila			Translation and Linguistic Strategies of English Oxymora into Japanese by Japanese Language Learners	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						oxymora; translation strategy; English; Japanese; figurative language		An oxymoron is a complex term as it contains inherent contradictions. This often results in confusion and miscommunication. In translation studies, despite the existence of quite a rich body of research on figurative language, the dearth of research that focuses on oxymoron further compounds this complexity. The objectives of this research are two-fold. First, is identifying whether or not the Japanese language learners are aware of the existence of oxymoron, whereas the second objective is to determine strategies used in translating English oxymoron into Japanese. This study used written translation tasks and follow-up online interviews as the methods. The study utilises purposive sampling technique and the respondents are 12 undergraduate students from the Universiti Malaya majoring in Japanese Language and Linguistics. Six of the respondents are Malay and six are Chinese. The oxymora are taken from the corpus of English texts at english-corpora.org/iweb. Data were manually collected and analysed using Aixela's Culture-Specific Items classification as the framework for analysing translation strategies. The research found that the respondents have difficulties translating some English oxymora and the challenges lie in finding correct words to describe, if not similar oxymoron in the target language. Other than their existing knowledge, the respondents refer to online resources to help them with translation such as Google Translate and online dictionaries. However, with some unfamiliar oxymora, this strategy is insufficient as most online dictionaries directly translate figurative language. This study is intended to raise interest in the translation of oxymoron, because this topic is not often the subject of study and application in practice. This study will help language instructors in understanding the process of translation of oxymoron and in implementing this subject as a syllabus in the translation studies.

J	Dezhkameh, A; Layegh, N; Hadidi, Y				Dezhkameh, Ali; Layegh, Nasim; Hadidi, Yaser			A Critical Discourse Analysis of Covid-19 in Iranian and American Newspapers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Covid-19; Critical Discourse Analysis; Ideological Micro-strategies; Newspapers; Van Dijk		The policies and ideologies of countries are reflected in the propagated media of that country, and newspapers are no exception. Covid-19 has affected the lives of people all around the world. The present study investigated the ideological differences in reporting the news related to Covid-19 in light of Van Dijk's ideological square framework. To do so, a representative sample of 56 news articles was chosen over a period of one year (from January 2020 to the end of January 2021) from one Iranian and one American newspaper, the Tehran Times and The New York Times. Overall, 2,977 clauses were analysed both qualitatively, to find out the reason of occurrence, and quantitatively, to determine the frequency of occurrence for each microstrategy. Evidentiality, Hyperbole, Metaphor, National Self-Glorification, Negative Lexicalisation, and Number Game were the most frequent micro-strategies. Such high frequencies of the strategies can make for effective discursive apparatus to make readers believe what news articles claim is true. The most salient implication of this study would be raising readers' and academics' awareness of the need to view news articles critically to avoid negative ramifications of ideological propagandas. In the same vein, newspapers need to be cognizant of the micro-strategies they consciously or sub-consciously employ since certain micro-strategies can be used to manipulate readers' minds and help news agencies to feed their readers certain ideological and political agendas.

J	Wu, DP; Buripakdi, A				Wu, Daping; Buripakdi, Adcharawan			Writer Identity Construction in EFL Doctoral Thesis Writing	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						writer identity; identity construction; EFL doctoral thesis writing; novice writer; non-native English-speaking context	LANGUAGE; WRITTEN; VOICE; DISCIPLINE	Research on EFL doctoral thesis writing is booming. The literature indicates a link between doctoral thesis writing and identity formation. Despite the call for scholarly attention on doctoral thesis writers, writers of doctoral theses in English as a Foreign language (EFL) settings have not been well represented in the previous studies. Moreover, although writer identity has been proposed as consisting of four aspects, most of the research has mainly adopted a corpus approach to discuss the discoursal self or authorial identity. To bridge these gaps, this study explored how multicultural writers at a university in Thailand constructed identity through EFL doctoral thesis writing and how their multiple aspects of writer identity interplayed. With the data triangulated from a questionnaire, written narratives, and semi structured interviews, the study revealed that 1) multiple identities are developed through writers' self-adjustment and social acculturation; 2) passive alignment to institutional conventions leads to an actual distancing from discoursal construction of writer identity; 3) self-marginalization as EFL learners, negative external voices, and the role of student writer most hinder the development and representation of the authorial self. The research recommends EFL learners should be explicitly informed of the notions of constructing an authorial voice in the writing of doctoral theses.

J	Sultan, FMM; Othman, SA				Sultan, Fazal Mohamed Mohamed; Othman, Syafika Atika			Topic And Focus Phrase In Malay Language: Minimalist Program Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Topic Phrase; Focus Phrase; Minimalist Program; Malay language; corpus data		This study reanalyses the existence of Topic Phrase (TopP) and Focus Phrase (FocP) in the Malay language. This study arises from issues related to Topic and Focus differences, Topic and Focus markers, Topics and Focus positions in a sentence structure and movement within the structure among the constituents. The purpose of this study is to identify TopP and FocP, describe TopP and FocP and analyse both phrases using Minimalist Programme. Focus and Topic are often an issue due to its position in a sentence structure. The study data is derived from the UKM-DBP corpus data, which contains sentences containing the word yang and the particle-lah which are present in simple sentences. The word yang and the particle -lah are chosen to determine whether they function as Focus, Topics or Markers. The data were theoretically analyzed using the Minimalist Program framework. This study found that the Malay language has Topic Phrase (TopP) and Focus Phrase (FocP). A new discovery is the existence of a hierarchy that is unique to the Malay language. FocP is seen to be higher than TopP in the hierarchy. This study claims that the Malay language has a different structure compared to the universal structure that was proposed by Rizzi (1995). Even TopP and FocP in Malay have different positions in a sentence that contains the word yang and particles -lah or both. This analysis found that FocP precedes TopP in a Malay sentence structure, which is a different finding from Rizzi's claim that TopP precedes FocP universally.

GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						adaptation; ludic; younger audiences; hypertextuality; text simplification		Studies on adaptation for younger audiences tend to mull over around the film adaptation of children classics. Adaptation of textual, visual, and operative elements for younger audiences in the context of literary texts with ergodicity like apps, comics, animation films, and games is understudied. This case study based descriptive qualitative study aims at exploring and investigating the phenomenon and how this adaptation is exercised. This study employs Siddharthan's text simplification, Genette's hypertextuality, Nikolajeva's Barthesian proairetic decoding for younger audiences, and Huizinga's play-function and play-mood to address the language aspects of ludic adaptation, Aarseth's ergodic literature and Sander's adaptation to address the literary aspects, and Rajewsky's intermediality to address the medial aspects. Drawing upon the theories and employing Spradleyan analysis, we argue that adaptation for younger audiences is best termed ludic adaptation, an adaptation aimed at establishing a playful communication involving textual, visual, and operative adjustments for younger audiences through transmodalization, transstylization, and transformation of the source texts. In adapting the apps, comics, animation films, and games into their simplified versions, the adapters employ what we call as babyfication, chibification, bambification, and cherubification. Scholars of language and literary studies might apply ludic adaptation to reveal how adaptation for younger audiences is carried out. App, comic, animation film, and game adaptation practitioners might employ ludic adaptation as a guideline in their process of adapting these literary texts.	[Purnomo, S. F.

J	Saad, NHM; Jalaluddin, NH				Saad, Nurul Huda Mohd; Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah			Prefix meN- with Concrete Nouns of Natural Elements: A Relevance Theory Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Indonesian	Article						Prefix meN-; concrete nouns; Relevance theory; bridging cross reference; ad hoc	MALAY	The Malay prefix meN- is one of the most productive prefixes in Malay grammar. Grammarians like Za'ba, Arbak, Asmah and Nik Safiah et al. have discussed this prefix thoroughly. They focused on the form or allomorph of meN- and its function in a sentence. On the contrary, this study emphasized on the ambiguity of prefix meN-, namely the combination of concrete nouns of natural elements like busut (the molehill), langit (the sky), gunung (the mountain), laut (the sea), batu (the rock), and bukit (the hill). There is a significant overlap of meanings in this prefix for cases of menjadi seperti (being like), seperti/berkeadaan (such as /state-of-being) and berlaku seperti/menyerupai sesuatu (behaving like/resembling something). This is due to the use of different terms for the same concept and aspect. In relation to this, the study aims to overcome the problem of the overlapping meaning of the ambiguous prefix meN- with concrete nouns of natural elements. This is a qualitative study. The data in this study is obtained from the Corpus Database of Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. This study identifies each element of prefix meN- with concrete nouns of natural elements that is ambiguous. The research data were analysed individually using Relevance theory, based on the concepts of bridging cross reference and ad hoc. The findings have contributed to the new categorisation of the ambiguity of prefix meN- with concrete nouns of natural elements. The prefix meN- with the concrete nouns of natural elements have produced the metaphorical meaning of 'perbandingan eksplisit seperti' (explicit comparison 'like'). Hence, this study offers an alternative cognitive account on how the prefix meN- can be elegantly explained.

Understanding the cultural representation of health and illness of particular communities becomes urgent especially when the community concerned is underserved in healthcare. In this project, we sought to examine the representations of health and illness by members of the Semai indigenous community through the use of metaphor analysis, a qualitative method in applied linguistics that attend to how people use language in real-world discourses to understand their conceptualisations of abstract ideas and emotions. From semi-structured interviews with the indigenous Semai people in a village in Malaysia, metaphors of health and illness were identified from the oral stories told by participants. Metaphors were identified and analysed following Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) conceptual metaphor theory that explains how people understand one idea in a conceptual domain through accessing resources in another conceptual domain. The results show that universal metaphors are dominant in representing embodied experiences while culturally influenced metaphors are important as vehicles of expression derived from their environment and folk beliefs. We argue that while culturally influenced metaphors may mark the participants as strange in their ways of thinking, a closer look at their underlying frameworks finds that they connect with universal bases that are intrinsic to all human experience. Understanding conceptual metaphors can contribute to the expansion of the locus of shared understanding between healthcare providers and the communities they serve.

J	Lian, AP; Sangarun, P				Lian, Andrew-Peter; Sangarun, Pannathon			Precision Language Education: A Glimpse Into a Possible Future	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						precision education; precision language education; individualized; diagnosis; intervention		This is a reflective article on "precision language education". This concept is derived in part from "precision education" which, in turn, is derived from "precision medicine". Precision language education heralds a new way of dealing with individual differences by effecting as precise a diagnosis as possible on each language learner, thus triggering specific interventions designed to target and respond to each person's specific language-learning problems. The article develops the logic of precision language education, including the ways of eliciting and making visible, for both learner and observer, problems and difficulties to be diagnosed and remedied. It then briefly discusses the connection between personalized education and precision education before moving on to offer illustrative examples of precision language education at work which draw on a multiplicity of ways of addressing learning issues, including exploiting neuroplasticity. They include: an answer-evaluation and markup system, a phonetic correction system for three pairs of vowels and a neurological profiling system for guiding the forms of intervention applied. The article concludes with an argument that, in addition to offering a framework for action, precision language education enables the development of a flexible, coherent, "precision" mindset that is of benefit for generating individualized language learning systems to better meet the demands of the highly mobile, globalizing world of the 21st century.

We argue that a priori and a posteriori are unable to comprehensively analyze the relationship between fictional conlangs with game elements. This research aims at constructing a new taxonomy on fictional conlang design approach that adheres specifically to video game. To do so, first, we analyze 62 game titles with 94 fictional conlangs to prove that a priori and a posteriori display deficiencies in pointing their relationship with video game elements. The next step is constructing a taxonomy based on the integration of Crystal's notion on ludic linguistics, language studies for playful purposes, and Aarseth's textonomy, the study on how texts are accessed. The research findings indicate that a priori and a posteriori fail to classify 29 fictional conlangs into either category and to indicate the relationship between the conlangs with game elements. In response to this failure, we construct a taxonomy consisting of three approaches namely interpretive, explorative, and configurative. These three approaches are able to indicate a structural relationship between fictional game conlangs, game genres, and the immersion level of the players and to patch the weaknesses a priori and a posteriori taxonomy has. Linguists, departing from this new taxonomy, might cooperate with game designers to design comprehensive conlangs, specifically designed for video games, which conform and correspond to the game genres and immersion levels.

J	Jaafar, MF; Aman, I; Awal, NM				Jaafar, Mohammad Fadzeli; Aman, Idris; Awal, Norsimah Mat			Morphosyntax of Negeri Sembilan and Minangkabau Dialects	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						morphosyntax; grammatical; syntactical aspects; morphological aspect; Negeri Sembilan dialect; Minangkabau dialect		There are several studies that show the similarities between Negeri Sembilan and Minangkabau dialects, such as the phonological system and greetings. However, this paper attempts to compare the morphosyntax of both dialects. It is the assumption of this study that there is almost no comparative study on the morphosyntax that has been conducted on the dialects of Negeri Sembilan and Minangkabau. Therefore, it is the aim of this study to examine the grammatical categories of the Negeri Sembilan and Minangkabau dialects. In this study, the grammatical category consists of the morphological and the syntactical aspects. The morphological aspects focused on are affixation and determiner while for syntax the aspects focused on are possessive, pronouns and auxiliary. The research was conducted in Bukit Tinggi and Paya Kumbuh in Indonesia; and in the districts of Rembau and Kuala Pilah in Negeri Sembilan. The research samples are based on recordings of interviews conducted in the abovementioned areas. The recordings consist of conversations with 15 informants, representing both dialects studied. Data were transcribed by research assistants who are native speakers of both dialects. The data were also tested for their authenticity and validity, in terms of spelling and structure. The major findings are the use of prefix on nouns (perosak - parusak, kesudahannya - kasudahannyo, sesudah - sasudah), verbs (terjatuh - tajatuh, bersatu-basatu/bertigo-batigo, menyapu - manyapu); circumfix (meN-,,,-kan, such as mambarasiahan membersihkan), and possessive (punya, such as 'Den punyo kodai' - 'Ambo punyo'/'Punyo ambo) in Negeri Sembilan dialect are different from Minangkabau dialect. On the other hand, similarities were found in the use of pronouns (den, awak), auxiliary of verbs (sudah/bona, hendak, mau). As a conclusion, this study found that the Negeri Sembilan and Minangkabau dialect differ in terms of sound and lexical, but has similar grammatical system. This study contributes towards the understanding of grammatical categories of the two dialects that share similarities in terms of language and culture.

J	Tohar, SNAM; Ab Halim, A; Samsu, KHK				Tohar, Siti Nor Azhani Mohd; Ab Halim, Adlina; Samsu, Ku Hasnita Ku			Measuring the Level of Upholding the National Language among Institute of Higher Education Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						National language; multiethnic; Malaysia's civilization; young generation; unity		The primary role of language in a multiethnic society is to be an instrument of solidarity that unite people of various races through the sharing of thoughts, world views and cultures based on a country's national identity. However, the issue of upholding the rightful position of the national language in Malaysia is still on-going, whether at the level of the policy makers or that of the masses. Therefore, there is a need to identify the actual level of the national language in the present scenario in terms of three aspects, namely i) fluency, ii) recognition, and iii) sophistication in the use of the language. Hence, a study was conducted among 407 students of University of Malaya (UM), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), University of Selangor (UNISEL) and Multimedia University (MMU) using the Stratified Random Sampling method. The results of the analysis showed that the levels of fluency and recognition of the Malay language among IHE students are high. However, the level of sophistication in their use of the language is moderate. In fact, the overall ranking of the national language is also moderate. Thus, although the IHE students are fluent and they do recognise the national language, their levels of fluency and recognition are not very high. Instead, they have not fully mastered their skills in poetry, pantun and the use of proverbs, which are the benchmarks of sophistication in the use of the language. The implication is that after almost six decades of Malay language being formulated as the national language in the Federal Constitution, this language has yet to achieve its rightful position as a language that is not only being fluently spoken and recognised as the national language, but that is able to add to the aesthetic beauty of a language to show that it has its own level of dignity. Therefore, the scenario of upholding the national language in its rightful position among IHE students cannot be taken lightly because this generation will determine the pattern of stable social relations and the vitality of the national language in the civilization of Malaysia.

J	Kim, Y; Yoon, H				Kim, Youngran; Yoon, Hyunsook			The Use of L1 as a Writing Strategy in L2 Writing Tasks	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Second language writing; L1 use; writing strategies; writing genre; writing task		Numerous studies have investigated how students integrate L1 for the function of acquiring L2 writing proficiency. However, there is still no consensus that relates the degree of L1 use and various writing strategies in L2 writing to student proficiency levels and writing genres or writing tasks. The present study explored these issues over the course of 14 weeks with nine Korean university students of three different proficiency levels performing six writing tasks in two genres. The data were collected from the students. think-aloud protocols and retrospective interviews. The think-aloud and interview data were analyzed to examine the students. use of L1 during the L2 writing. The think-aloud protocols were also coded into their functions for what purposes each language type was used. The results showed that lower level students used their L1 more than the advanced students, but all students used L1 to different degrees depending on each task. In other words, the students reacted differently in accordance with task familiarity and the relative ease or difficulty of the task. The study also found that there was no consistent relationship between language proficiency and the types of writing strategies the students used in L2 composition. On the other hand, this study showed that although the types of writing strategies the students employed were similar, the students of various proficiency levels applied L1 strategies to their writing in different ways. The findings showed that L1 use in L2 writing can play an encouraging role for both the ideational and compensatory purposes, suggesting that the strategic use of L1 can contribute to improvement in L2 composition. The paper discusses that writing instruction should focus more on the topics of how to use writing strategies as well as what writing strategies to use.

J	Azman, H; Bhooth, AM; Ismail, K				Azman, Hazita; Bhooth, Abdullah Mohammad; Ismail, Kemboja			Reading Practices Of EFL Yemeni Students: Recommendations For The 21(st) Century	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						EFL reading practices; Four Resources Model; Multiliteracy Framework; tertiary academic literacies; Arab EFL learners	LITERACY; ENGLISH	This paper investigates the reading practices of forty-five second year EFL Yemeni undergraduate students using the Four Resources Model of multiliteracy practices. The Four Resources Model of multiliteracy practices organizes reading practices into four key practices: code breaking, text participating, text uses and text analysing levels. Quantitative and qualitative methods, designed based on the Four Resources Model constructs, were used to collect data from a sample of students studying English as a Foreign Language at a university in Yemen. Quantitative data was collected through a questionnaire, while qualitative data was gathered using semi-structured interviews guided by the research objectives. The findings reveal that Yemeni students were medium users of the code breaker and text user practices whereas the meaning making and text analysis practices were reported to be used in low usage. On the whole, these early findings suggest that the reading practices and reading abilities of the Yemeni students are still limited even at the tertiary level and have not developed fully with regard to reading in English. This paper reports in detail, the use of the Four Resources Model as a tool to determine reading efficacy while examining the aforementioned findings. Discussion is put forward on the implications for teaching of reading and its approaches in a Yemeni context, especially in view of the students. reading needs at the tertiary level in Yemen.

J	Othman, Y; Pakar, DR				Othman, Yahya; Pakar, Dayang Raini			Effectiveness of Metacognition Strategy Instruction in the Teaching of Reading and Comprehension Skills Using Expository Text	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						metacognition strategy; teaching; reading and comprehension; expository text; quasi-experimental	ACHIEVEMENT	This study examined the effects of metacognition strategies in the teaching of reading and comprehension of Bahasa Melayu using expository text. The purpose of this study is to assess students' achievement in comprehending text using metacognition strategies and also to assess the impact of the strategies used in the teaching of reading and comprehension. In addition, this study also aims to identify metacognition strategies used by students in the three reading processes (before, during and after reading). This study used a quasiexperimental design. The study sample involved 60 students of Year 4 from one goverment primary school in Brunei Muara District. The sample was divided into two groups, the experimental group and the control group. Each group consisted of 30 average students. The results of this study were analyzed using t-test of independent samples to assess whether there are significant differences in the mean performance of reading comprehension between the control and experimental groups in pre and post test. One Way ANCOVA analysis is used to determine the effect of metacognition strategies for teaching reading comprehension. T-test analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the mean of reading comprehension performance scores between the experimental group and the control group, t (60) = 12.96, p < 0.0. Meanwhile, One Way ANCOVA data analysis showed, p = 0.00 < 0.05 (F-ratio = 493.22/2.25 = 219.41 p < 0.05) also demonstrated the significant effect of metacognition strategies in teaching comprehension. The study also showed that metacognition strategies used by the respondents during their reading process are varied. As a whole, metacognition reading strategies used by the respondents in this study can enhance comprehension of reading text.

J	Scheb-Buenner, P				Scheb-Buenner, Patcharee			Do Scaffolding Interactions Exist in the Thai Classroom?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						scaffolding; teacher-fronted instruction; low proficiency learners; engagement; verbal interactions	STUDENTS; LEARNERS	This study reports on how five Thai teachers in a private university scaffold their students in an EFL classroom. The context of this study is teacher-fronted instruction and low proficiency students. A case study using an observation method is employed. The study reveals basic types of instructional activities: focus on form and focus on meaning. Scaffolding is explored using frameworks adopted from Wood, Bruner and Ross (1976) and van Lier (1996). The findings illustrate that the verbal interaction of Thai teachers with their students reflects scaffolding features described by Wood, Bruner and Ross (1976) while slightly reflecting van Lier's description. The study summarizes the features of scaffolding in the teacher-fronted instruction. This embraces all the findings in relation to form and meaning-focused activities. Scaffolding in the form-focused activities displays long sequentiality, less contingency, and less contextual support, while scaffolding in the meaningfocused activities consists of short sequentiality, more contingency, and contextual support. The study offers the EFL teachers teaching in a university level and dealing with low proficiency learners and teacher-fronted instruction an approach to teach and earn their learners' engagement. The teachers who employ scaffolding should be aware of the usefulness of it by combining the strengths of form-focused and meaning-focused activities. Scaffolding attributes should be gradually provided in order that low proficiency students can engage in interaction with the teachers. Most importantly, the teachers who adopt scaffolding in their teaching should be aware of the concepts of both frameworks which will make scaffolding a practical and effective approach.

It seeks to investigate its distribution, the structures and syntactic patterns of a compliment expression, the attributes praised, and how compliment is influenced by the sex and social status of both the complimenter and the receiver of the compliment. The corpus of the study consists of 400 compliments collected by the author through an ethnographic method. 20 students studying at Taiz University in Yemen participated in the study. The study reveals that a compliment in Yemeni society is formulaic. 65.75% of compliments in Yemeni Arabic fall into major identifiable syntactic patterns and 55% of the compliments contain adjectives, almost two thirds of which are fixed adjectives. This formulaic nature of compliments in Yemeni society supports that their function is to consolidate solidarity and maintain relationship. The corpus also reveals that 60% of compliments occur among females, and the majority of compliments are on 'Appearance', followed by 'Personal Traits'. The majority of compliments are paid and received among equal status, and the least frequent compliments are given by lower status to higher status	[Qanbar, Nada] Taiz Univ, Fac Arts, Dept English, Taizi, Yemen		Qanbar, N (corresponding author), Taiz Univ, Fac Arts, Dept English, Taizi, Yemen.

The main focus of the study is on perceptive data elicited from Iranian informants (male vs. female) with respect to the using of such strategies. Role-play interactions taken from 10 American speakers and a perceptive questionnaire constructed based on the interactions were used to collect the required data. Results of the questionnaire showed that more indirect complaints were perceived as more polite by EFL learners. Furthermore, social variables of power and distance made a difference in the degree of politeness perceived; Iranians (irrespective of their genders) were more concerned about the social power of the complainee than the social distance between the interlocutors. Subjects' gender did not have significant relationship with how the participants assessed the politeness degree of complaints.

J	Lie, KY; Fei, WF; Ismail, K				Lie, Koo Yew; Fei, Wong Fook; Ismail, Kemboja			Students' Critical Consciousness Through Critical Literacy Awareness	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Critical Literacy Awareness; pluriliteracy; multiliteracies; postgraduate students' voices; classroom intervention		To think critically is undeniably one of the major elements of "first class human capital" in a knowledge economy. It is most regrettable that Malaysian students, even at the tertiary level, tend to be uncritical due to socialisation processes in the educational and sociocultural environment. Responding to this identified need to raise the critical consciousness of students, this paper examines how a Higher Education teacher challenged her postgraduate students to be critical learners through the use of CLA (Critical literacy awareness) strategies in her Language and Literacy course. The paper suggests that the use of CLA strategies has increased student engagement and strengthened student voices. This paper concludes by proposing that CLA should be included in pedagogical practices in Higher Education given that active participation in knowledge economies is the vision of the Malaysian Higher Education Action Plan (MoHE 2007a, b).

These perceived causes may be classified into three causal dimensions: locus of control, stability, and controllability. Using attribution theory, this study examines Malaysian university students' attributions for success and failure in learning English as a second language. The study attempts to investigate their perceived reasons for successes and failures on actual language learning tasks, and explores whether their attribution tendencies vary depending on their actual and perceived proficiency. Based on attribution theory, two versions of a questionnaire (one for success and one for failure) were administered to 2152 students at six different universities in Malaysia. Students were required to pick an activity at which they had scored particularly poorly in the previous semester. In the second part of the questionnaire, the students were asked to rate the twelve causes for success or failure on a six point Likert scale. The findings showed that high proficiency learners and those who perceived themselves as high proficiency learners attributed success to their own effort and ability more than mid and low proficiency learners. On the other hand, when it comes to failure experiences, high proficiency learners and those who regarded themselves as having high proficiency showed a stronger tendency to ascribe their unsuccessful outcomes to class and interest-related factors such as class atmosphere and interest in the task whereas those with lower proficiency tended to blame their failure on the lack of their own effort and ability.

J	Kabilan, MK; Seng, MK; Kee, OA				Kabilan, Muhammad Kamarul; Seng, Mak Kem; Kee, Ooi Ae			Reader-Text Transaction In Text Comprehension	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						reader-text transactions; lower order thinking skills (LOTs); higher order; thinking skills (HOTs); literal; interpretive and applied thinkers		The complexities and dynamics of reader-text transaction have become important issues in the teaching of reading comprehension. This study examines how tertiary level readers engage internal dialog with the text. It also seeks to provide the much needed insight of it onto the aspects of text comprehension processes. The aim of this study is to explore and provide descriptive analyses pertaining to the issues of questioning the text in invoking active interactions with the text. A total of 62 students pursuing semi-professional courses at diploma levels in one of the premier institutions of higher learning participated in this study. Qualitative data was obtained through students' written reports of the adapted verbalisation of thoughts of self-generated questions, semi-structured interviews with the students and field notes extracted from the researchers as participant observers. Thematic analysis was then used to identify emergent themes grounded in the data. The findings indicate that readers are able to take ownership of the text when they engage inner dialog through active interaction with the text, and gain better understanding of the text. This article will argue that readers are transformed from passive to active participants if they are able to activate thinking skills through reader-text transaction in the form of questioning the text. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on developing reader-text transaction towards the use of thinking skills in text comprehension. Such reader-text interactions will enable readers to take control of purposeful learning with far reaching results in text comprehension.

J	Ahmed, T				Ahmed, Toqeer			Political Violence and Necropolitics in Omar Shahid Hamid's The Prisoner	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Violence; necropolitics; state of exception; Karachi; Pakistani fiction		This article examines violence and necropolitical experiences in the management of life and death in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi and its representation by Omar Shahid Hamid in his debut novel The Prisoner (2013). Pakistan's western border and the largest city Karachi have long been epicentres of violent actions in the backdrop of wars (for instance, the Soviet and the 'War on Terror') in neighbouring Afghanistan. The relationship of governing authorities with violence and necropolitics is analysed in the light of critical approaches from the works of Michael Foucault (2008), Achille Mbembe (2001 & 2003), Giorgio Agamben (1998 & 2005), and Judith Butler (2004). Through the analysis of the fictional narrative, this paper examines local and global deployment of various strategies of occupation, domination and subjugation that aims to manage human bodies through social, economic, political and religious discourses. This article argues that violence and death are used as a means of control over human bodies as represented in the novel, a situation in which some lives are disposable and are reducible to 'bare life' by state and non-state actors. Against this backdrop, the article highlights how some lives matter more than others in Karachi's political landscape. This article also suggests that the landscape in The Prisoner is an embodiment of what Agamben called the 'state of exception', a state where (some) people are deemed unworthy of life, and are therefore, removed. It is hoped that this article will be useful to understand complex issues of Karachi.

J	Imani, A				Imani, Aliakbar			What 'Corona War' Metaphor Means in Iranian Political Discourse	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Iran; COVID-19; War Metaphor; Public Cooperation; National Solidarity		Political leaders' discourse plays a significant role in directing the public opinion during crises. Hence, this study analyzed 71 speeches delivered by Hassan Rouhani, President of Iran (20132021), during the first and the second waves of COVID-19 pandemic (February 20 till August 30, 2020) as the most critical period of the pandemic attack. This study drew upon Lakoff & Johnson's (1980) Conceptual Metaphor Theory as its theoretical background, and the analysis of the speeches was comprised of metaphor identification using the Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP) and metaphor interpretation. The findings of the study reveal employment of metaphorical representations of coronavirus as a discursive strategy to deal with the situation. The main metaphorical representation of coronavirus was framing public cooperation and national solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic as participating in a war. As argued in this paper, the employed metaphors not only remained loyal to general war features, but they also entailed a specific sociocultural image of war for the Iranian people based on their experience and memories of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Finally, this study recommends for future studies to include the specific sociocultural context and historical background of the addressed audience. This provides further insight into what metaphors specifically mean to the addressed audience, which is beyond general metaphor use. This study is hoped to be a small step towards bringing into spotlight the significance of sociocultural aspects and historical background as necessary information to provide in-depth insights into what makes metaphors effective communicative tools to specific audience.

J	Lee, SS; Azman, H				Lee, Sze Seau; Azman, Hazita			Integrating Facebook as a Web 2.0 Tool in a Responsive Pedagogy for Multimodal Oral Presentation Skills	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Facebook; multimodal oral presentation skills; pedagogy; higher education; Web 2.0	LEARNING-ENVIRONMENT; PUBLIC-SPEAKING; ENGLISH	Technology both complicates and liberates oral presentation pedagogy in higher education. On one hand, 21st century communication realities require students to deliver multimodal oral presentations but educators have only begun to experiment with the relevant pedagogy. On the other hand, Web 2.0 offers vast pedagogical potential which practitioners have just begun to explore. Confronted by a pedagogical predicament and intrigued by the affordances of Web 2.0, we designed the Responsive Multimodal Oral Presentation Pedagogy (RMO2P) to enhance the learning of multimodal oral presentation skills among EAP (English for Academic Purposes) students. RMO2P integrated Facebook as a Web 2.0 tool with videos, collaborative learning and feedback. A teacher-researcher implemented RMO2P in a public speaking class of 20 EAP students for a semester. Thematic analysis of multiple sources of data which included student artifacts, observational data and inquiry data contributed to the findings. The findings indicated that Facebook was a feasible Web 2.0 tool that can be effectively integrated with other pedagogical techniques. As a result, the participants demonstrated enhanced conceptual knowledge and heightened self-awareness as presenters of multimodal oral presentations. Since Facebook was integrated as a Web 2.0 tool in a responsive method for multimodal oral presentation skills to overcome situational constraints including inadequate learning management systems (LMS), stakeholders who are seeking alternative methods to enhance the teaching of oral presentation skills may adapt the intervention to enhance learning outcomes.

J	Sah, MFM; Jaafar, SRS				Sah, Muhammad Firdaus Mohd; Jaafar, Sharifah Raihan Syed			Loan Word Adaptation Strategy in Bugis: Correspondence-OO	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						loanword; adaptation strategy; Bugis language; Optimality theory; Correspondence-OO	LOANWORDS	As a minority community in Malaysia, the Bugis community tends to utilise lexical items from other languages, particularly from local languages as a result of the assimilation process that took place. Thus, this study was conducted to answer the following questions: (1) how are the loanword adaptation strategies used in absorbing foreign language lexical items into the Bugis language, and (2) how can these adaptation strategies be explained by using the Correspondence-OO approach developed in Optimality theory. Data were collected through field methods and interviews using questionnaire, word list and recording. The field studies were conducted in Pontian and Pasir Gudang, Johor as well as in Klang, Selangor. A total of 144 informants from three age groups, namely among the youth, adults and the elderly who were involved in answering the questionnaire and wordlist. The results revealed that eight loanword adaptation strategies were used in Bugis language, namely fusion, deletion, segment substitution, epenthesis, vowel reduction, nasal substitution, glottal stop formation and gemination. The Correspondence-OO analysis showed an element of Bugis language which is intolerant of foreign grammars by prohibiting the full absorption of borrowed foreign lexical items. This can be observed from the needs to comply with a markedness constraint *SAME LEXICAL, that dominates other constraints in the grammar of the Bugis language. The findings of the study can shed input on the language aspects of the Bugis community in Malaysia that were previously excluded. In addition, it has successfully demonstrated the capability of Correspondence-OO in explaining the issue of loanwords without denying the important concept of Optimality theory, namely Parallelism.

The selected metaphorical data was the idiom "kepala angin" with the highest frequency at 531 occurances. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the process of forming the meaning of the idiom "kepala angin" using the principle of integration. The research method used is a qualitative method based on a computerized corpus approach. The two databases selected were Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP) and Malay Concordane Project (MCP). The selected data were analyzed using integration principles modified from the Blending Theory introduced by Fauconnier and Turner (2002). To obtain "kepala angin" idiom, concordances of "kepala" lexical units were generated from a total of 12,227 in DBP and MCP corpora from over six million data sets. A computerized corpus descriptive analysis approach was used to parse the "kepala" data. The findings proved that the meaning of idioms occur in an orderly manner through four separate mental mindset of the Malays, namely a first input, a second input, the generic space and space integration. Indeed, this study adds new information in the field of cognitive linguistics on the basis of the uniqueness of the Malay mind.

Google Autocomplete Search Algorithms and the Arabs' Perspectives on Gender: A Case Study of Google Egypt	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Arabic; Google's Autocomplete; Anonymity; Stereotypes; Gender; Online Discourse	WOMEN; STEREOTYPES; REPRESENTATION; PREFERENCE; DISCOURSE; CONFLICT; DIVISION; CORPUS; LABOR; MEN	Search engines have become an essential part of everyone's life, with Google being the most popular. Google Search provides the autocomplete feature for faster and easier search results, offering 10 top suggestions at a time, and these may influence how users view different social groups. Different scholars have explored online discourse to reveal stereotypes about certain groups. However, little or no attention has been paid to technological affordances to reveal broader gender biases and stereotypes in the Arab World. This study examines how Google autocomplete searches can reflect the Arabs' perspectives on gender. Google Egypt is selected since it is top-rated in the number of internet users. Google is queried by entering a combination of Arabic question words followed by the Arabic equivalents for men and women. One hundred and ninety questions were generated and categorized according to the qualities they referenced. The most common assumptions about men indicate that they are cheaters, liars, self-dominant, emotionally strong, and smarter than women. They are also stereotyped as being more likely to admire young women, prefer sons over daughters, and desire polygamy. Women, on the other hand, are stereotyped as plotting, materialistic, emotional, and sensitive. The study concludes that since such generalizations may entail exaggerations and are not evidently right all the time, one must be careful about adopting such stereotypes and making them part of each gender's views of the other. Bearing in mind the perpetuating function that technology may have of existing stereotypes and social norms, users and developers of Google alike must pay more attention to gender biases that algorithms may establish and disseminate.

J	Abu-Ayyash, EAS				Abu-Ayyash, Emad A. S.			Context and Culture via Cohesive Devices in Higher Education Students' and Professional Writers' Opinion Articles	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						exophoric reference; homophoric reference; cohesive devices; opinion articles; context and culture		The literature on cohesive devices is marked with evident dearth in studies that consider the context-text ties. The current paper attempts to fill this gap, and, therefore, combat an idealised 'villain' in research, which is confining textual analysis to in-text relations. The study propounds the idea of expanding the analysis to include ties between the written text and the surrounding context and culture. The specific purpose is to explore the use and function of the cohesive devices which link the text to the context (exophora) and the ones that relate the text to the culture (homophora). The methodology involved explaining the cohesive devices to a postgraduate TESOL class of eight students (non-native speakers of English) in one of the universities in the UAE. After that, the students were asked to work in pairs and produce four opinion articles about a recent newspaper topic of their choice. They selected the United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP) leader's call to ban the burqa in the UK. In addition, two articles from the Independent and the Guardian on the same topic were also discussed. Comparative analysis was conducted on the six articles vis-a-vis the use and functions of cohesive devices. The analysis involved four categories: person deixis, spatial deixis, temporal deixis, and the definite article. The findings showed that exophoric and homopohric cohesive devices were employed abundantly, with exophora occurring in more instances. The study also revealed the relevant functions that have evident implications about assumptive and supportive roles of cohesive devices.	[Abu-Ayyash, Emad A.

J	Hun, PG; Liu, OP; Chuang, LH				Hun, Pue Giok; Liu, Ong Puay; Chuang, Loo Hong			Kelantan Peranakan Chinese Language and Marker of Group Identity	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Malay language; Chinese stereotype; Kelantan Peranakan Chinese youth; communicative competence; group identity	ENGLISH	Although the status of the national language of Malaysia has been consolidated in the Constitution, the Malay language remains commonly associated with a specific segment of Malaysian society, i.e., the Malays. The language is often seen as a distinct marker for Malayness whereas the non-Malay ethnic groups, particularly in Peninsular Malaysia, are not widely associated with the language. The Chinese as the largest minority ethnic group in the Peninsular, are often stereotypically depicted as relatively less fluent or knowledgeable in Malay language, at times not beyond the colloquial `bahasa pasar'. Such a scenario suggests that language-wise, Malaysian society remains divided along ethnic lines. This paper seeks to highlight Malay language use among Peranakan Chinese youth in Kelantan. While their higher level of Malay language proficiency vis-a-vis mainstream Chinese is readily acknowledged, findings from content analyses of qualitative data collected in a focus group discussion also suggest that such proficiency in Malay language is achieved due to it being pivotal to the continuity of their identity as both Kelantan Peranakan Chinese and Kelantanese. In short, the Kelantan Peranakan Chinese community is a good example that proficiency in Malay language as national language can exist in tandem with the group's mother tongue language, and thus should be celebrated and supported towards building a common identity as part of nation-building in Malaysia.

J	Zahid, I; Johari, A				Zahid, Indirawati; Johari, Arina			Malay Politeness: Conversational Context Analysis in Talk Show	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Malay politeness (KM); communicator; conversational context; factors and context free situation		Malay politeness is the politeness used in the Malay community - bound by the norms and values of society. Malay Politeness (KM) is a result of merging and modification process of Asmah (2000), Awang (2007) and Tenas (2011) model. KM was formed by three factors, which are role, power and differences in social status (PKS), titles (T) and rules (Per.). Air muka (dignity) is included in PKS. KM was used to analyze conversational context of content structure of the talk show titled "Celik Mata, Reset Minda Orang Yang Tenang" published by radio IKIM. fm. Communicator consist of host (PC), invited guest (TU), callers (PG) and FB (FB) questions. There are 16 conversational contexts with 484 dialogues in this structure. The analysis has two objectives, the application of KM and the tendency of KM used by the cast. Text analysis and quantitative research design are employed in the study. Findings show variation of KM is applied, which includes complete KM PKS+T+Per. and incomplete - involving two KM and one KM. Findings show that TU tend to use PKS+T and PKS+T+Per. factor. PC was bound to the Per. factor. While PG is bound by the T and Per. and FB, which showed a tendency of T+Per. factor. This shows that KM is applied by the communicator in accordance with their role. In conclusion, KM is absolutely controlled by the context and the communicators.

J	Rad, HZ; Tiun, S; Saad, S				Rad, Hamed Zakeri; Tiun, Sabrina; Saad, Saidah			Lexical Scoring System of Lexical Chain for Quranic Document Retrieval	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						lexical chain; information retrieval (IR); semantic retrieval; lexical scoring system; Quranic semantic retrieval system	SEARCH	An Information Retrieval (IR) system aims to extract information based on a query made by a user on a particular subject from an extensive collection of text. IR is a process through which information is retrieved by submitting a query by a user in the form of keywords or to match words. In the Al-Quran, verses of the same or comparable topics are scattered throughout the text in different chapters, and it is therefore difficult for users to remember the many keywords of the verses. Therefore, in such situations, retrieving information using semantically related words is useful. In well-composed documents, the semantic integrity of the text (coherence) exists between the words. Lexical cohesion is the results of chains of related words that contribute to the continuity of the lexical meaning found within the text are a direct result of text being about the same thing (i.e. topic, etc.). This indicates that using an IR system and lexical chains are a useful and appropriate method for representing documents with concepts rather than using terms in order to have successful retrieval based on semantic relations. Therefore, a new Lexical Scoring System is proposed in this study, in addition to determining the semantic relation that exists between words whereby WordNet was used as the semantic knowledge base. The proposed scoring system helped to retrieve 86.58% of the total relevant documents in the Al-Quran based on the relevance judgment, using the lexical chain approach. Based on the findings, the study concludes that, the proposed approach on representing verses using lexical chains is appropriate and suitable for a Quranic IR system.

J	Abu-bakar, K; Abdullah, MF				Abu-bakar, Kaseh; Abdullah, Muhammad Faiz			Word Stress of Arabic as a Foreign Language Amongst Malay Speakers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Arabic language; phonetics; phonology; word stress; language acquisition	DURATION	Stress (al-nabr) is a type of suprasegmental or prosodic phonological feature. It is one of the characteristics or attributes of sound that overlaps certain phonemes. Studies investigating the acquisition of Arabic word stress among non-natives are scarce. Therefore, this study is aimed at observing the stressed pronunciation phenomenon of four-syllable words among non-native speakers of Arabic, and further compare this particular phenomenon with the rules proposed by Arabic linguistic scholars. The subjects were five final year undergraduate students of the Department of Arabic Studies and Islamic Civilisation, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). Six four-syllable word patterns \CVC\CV\CVV\CV\, \CVC\CV\CVC\CVC\, \CVC\CV\CV\CV\, \CVC\CV\CVV\CVC\, \CV\CVV\CV\KVK\ and \CVC\CV\CV\CVC\ were chosen as the stimuli. Three words were chosen to represent each word pattern; hence altogether a total of 18 words were tested. These audio recordings were analysed using the Praat software to obtain the readings of intensity value (dB), thus identifying the stress. The stress frequency data for each word pattern are reported in the form of percentages. The research outcome shows that the participants tended to give a primary stress on the antepenultimate syllable of each of the \CV\CVV\CV\CVC\, \CVC\CV\CV\CVC\ and \CVC\CV\CV\CV\ word patterns, and on the penultimate syllable of the word pattern \CVC\CV\CVC\CVC\. The tendency of the primary stress for the \CV\CVV\CV\CVC\ and \CVC\CV\CVV\CV\ word patterns is difficult to identify. Based on the analysis of the primary stress, the participants easily conformed to the rules of the main stress as suggested by Arabic linguists for the \CV\CVV\CV\CVC\, \CVC\CV\CV\CVC\, \CVC\CV\CV\CV\ and \CVC\CV\CVC\CVC\ word patterns, but the same cannot be said for the remaining two words patterns. Therefore, focusing on aspects of word stress in teaching and learning Arabic needs to be further emphasized. Future research could also include a larger population of participants in order to obtain better insights.

J	Ramin, Z; Roshnavand, FN				Ramin, Zohreh; Roshnavand, Farshid Nowrouzi			Mimicry of Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Formation of Resistant Slave Narrative in Ishmael Reed's Flight to Canada	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						flight to Canada; Uncle Tom's Cabin; Ishmael Reed; Harriet Beecher Stowe; mimicry; parody	REED,ISHMAEL 'FLIGHT-TO-CANADA'; 'UNCLE-TOMS-CABIN'; NATION; STORY	Postmodernism has as its major tenet the eradication of master-narratives in favor of marginalized voices. In so doing, it puts forward various strategies which, though different in methodology, are all critical of the dominant exclusionary discourses. Parodic mimicry is one of these subversive strategies which allows the anti-establishment artist to employ the discriminatory discursive practices and skillfully turn them on their heads. African American novelist Ishmael Reed adopts the postmodern technique of mimicry to severely criticize and disrupt the racist structure of the United States. In his "resistant" slave narrative Flight to Canada (1976), he takes to task the traditional historiography, showing how a so-called antislavery novel like Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin employs racial essentialism to reinforce the stereotypical representations of blacks and distort history to the benefit of white dominators. Through a parody of Stowe's canonical work, Reed's novel provides a space for the black consciousness to serve as an agentic subject and re-narrate the history of slavery, abolitionism and the Civil War. This paper aims to depict how Reed manages to rewrite the history of slavery in Flight to Canada by mimicking Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin.

J	Zainal, MZ				Zainal, Muhammad Zuhair			Teacher's Illocutionary Act in Teaching Malay Language	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						pragmatics; illocutionary act; grammatical act; Malay language teaching; illocutionary function		Illocutionary act is the speech intention act of a speaker in an utterance. There are certain illocutionary acts specifically uttered with certain aim and function in utterances spoken by a teacher during the teaching process, Therefore, this research is carried out to identify the form of illocutionary acts used by teachers in teaching Malay Language in order to identify the type of grammatical acts and to explain the function of such illocutionary act. This study uses a pragmatic approach based on the categorisation of illocutionary acts and illocutionary function introduced by Leech (1983) in the Politeness Principle. Unobtrusive research has been performed by sampling the utterances spoken by three teachers during the Malay language lesson as the research data. There are twenty one selected utterances which contain illocutionary acts such as assertion, instruction, commissure and expressive. The data revealed that under the stated illocutionary acts, there exits multiple grammatical acts such as claiming, expressing, requesting, advising, appealing, urging, ordering, recommending, motivating, ordering, applying, making promises, inviting and persuading. The research outcome has shown that teachers have been using such illocutionary acts in order to compete, to be friendly and to collaborate with the students. The study has also revealed that the utterances which were spoken contained two different forms of illocutionary acts with different function of illocutionary act. This research is important as a guide for the teachers so that the utterances spoken by them during the lesson contain appropriate illocutionary acts which are suitable for students' cognitive ability to ensure that the function of illocutionary acts can be understood clearly by the students.

In a communicative event interview, communication patterns uttered through certain speech are in agreement to the utterance of the participant. Effective communication discloses information on who, when, how, and what, all of which are able to explain any doubts in a communication pattern. This indirectly reveals detailed components regarding the rules of interaction. Therefore, questions on language etiquette must be emphasized for language etiquette pays attention to how language is expressed based on the speaker's social rules and culture of the community. The objective of the study is to describe and explain the rules of interaction in this communicative event through the communication patterns uttered by the participant. Accordingly, the study focused on interview patterns in Mingguan Malaysia and Utusan Malaysia newspapers, with emphasised on the rules of interaction that occur in the press' communicative events interview. The data was analyzed using ethnography communication approach, focusing only on one component, which is the rule of interaction. The findings showed that the interaction through the use of spoken language in a formal setting and understanding of the participants'cultural background contribute to the effectiveness of a communication in a social relationship. In conclusion, language etiquette is a very important element in order to achieve the goal of an interactive discussion. The ability of participant in complying with the rule of interaction which became the tradition of a community can be used to ensure that effective communication is achieved. Furthermore, in an interactive discussion, the maturity of each participant in relaying an argument can be judged from the participant's ability to understand the culture that underlies a particular community.

This study investigates the power relations between local identities and global identities over the discursive legitimation of human values in global media discourse. Yemen Times (YT) is the most circulated English-language newspaper in Yemen. YT can be voice of Yemen to the world through the use of the English language and the online version of the paper. With the notion of English and globalization, the newspaper published discourses for maxims in the context of Improve Your English series produced by a non-local journalist. A maxim is extended in the form of an argumentative paragraph that contextualizes a single value. Employing an empirical research design, the study data were built of 152 maxims. As a theoretical and analytical approach, Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is concerned with globalization, discourse, power and ideology. The study adopts these concepts to show how the processes of globalization are ideological choices that serve the interest of global agency. After identifying human values through thematic analysis, a three-dimension analysis of discourse was used to reveal the competing legitimation discourses. Clause complex was used as the unit of analysis where the focus was on the social actors of the projecting clauses. The discourse analysis reveals that local identities were suppressed or backgrounded in the texts. Global identities dominated the texts in the form of global literary discourse, global political discourse, global religious discourse, global philosophical discourse and global anonymous discourse. The exclusion of local identities shows that human values were employed in intercultural communication to serve the interest of global hegemony.

This study aims to identify the arguments used in advertisements; particularly on its claims, warrants and data to influence the automobile buyers in a diverse international market. It analyses the rhetorical devices and language equivalence used in the English and German print advertisements. A contrastive analysis of three cars. print advertisements, namely Mercedes Benz, BMW and Volkswagen from the German and Malaysian English dailies was carried out using Toulmin ' s model to identify the arguments and the rhetorical devices used in the advertisements. The study reveals two main similarities, particularly in the arguments put forth as well as the stylistic approach of the advertisements. The BMW and Mercedes Benz focused on their technological superiority and advancements, while the Volkswagen focused on its affordability. The German adverts were more persuasive and directed the buyers for action compared to the English adverts that provided more data and warrants. The BMW adverts also utilised a closed form compound adjectives such as "ConnectedDrive" to sustain the "hybrid concept" stylistic in line with the contemporary automobile advancement that focuses on hybrid cars. The use of figurative language was more prevalent in the English adverts compared to the German adverts to portray its internationalisation status of the car. These elements contribute to the pedagogical implications of teaching and learning foreign language; particularly for diverse writing purposes as well as planning business language for the different genres.

J	Ahmad, Z; Jalaluddin, NH; Osman, M				Ahmad, Zaharani; Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah; Osman, Maizura			Vowel Harmony and Degemination in Arabic Loanwords: A Constraints-Based Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Optimality theory; Arabic loandwords; vowel harmony; degemination; consonant cluster		The present study describes and explains the phonology of vowel harmony and degemination of Arabic loanwords which are incorporated into the Malay language. The data used in the study is secondary data gathered from a computerized data-based corpus of UKM-DBP consisting of five million words. The data are generated by using Oxford WordSmith Tools software, and the phonological phenomena are analyzed by employing a constrain-based approach of Optimality theory. It is apparent that Arabic loandwords have to undergo phonological changes in order to conform to Malay phonological system, particularly its basic syllable structure. The Malay language disfavors the occurrence of consonant clusters either in the onset or coda as well as geminates. It is observed that the phonological motivation that triggers the processes of vowel harmony and degemination is attributed to the obligation to comply with the basic syllable structure and minimal word requirement of the Malay language. The structure of each syllable must be (C)V(C) and this is governed by *COMPLEX and *LS constraints. Disyllabic word requirement is controlled by a PrWd=BF-sigma s constraint. The consequences of satisfying these constraints are violations of other constrains, namely *SPREAD, MAX-IO, MAX-mu, dan DEP-IO. All these constraints must be ranked, and the hierarchical ranking that is proposed in the study is *COMPLEX, *LS >> PrWd= BF-sigma >> MAX-IO >> DEP-IO >> *SPREAD >> MAX-mu. The present constraint-based analysis can adequately account for the phenomena of vowel harmony and degemination in the language. The findings show that the nativisation of Arabic loanwords is the outcome of grammatical differences between the source and the target languages. It is also observed that the native ranking of constraints operates actively on the loanwords.

J	Kaur, S				Kaur, Sarjit			Critical Literacy Practices of English Major in a Tertiary Institution	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						critical literacy practices; tertiary students; comprehension difficulties; opinion-based text; literacy		Being able to read texts critically is a much sought after skill in today. s globalised work environments. However, it is increasingly being reported that many tertiary students in Malaysia find this skill difficult to acquire. Students need to learn how to analyse a wide range of reading texts as it is seen as a response to the social construction of one. s peers, culture, family, classrooms, neighbours, communities and world (Lesley, 2004). Responding to local concerns about the lack of attention accorded to the development of tertiary students. critical literacy practices, this paper examines the challenges faced by 25 students majoring in English in an undergraduate programme in trying to comprehend an opinion-based text. The findings show that many students still experience the following reading difficulties: understanding the author. s message, distinguishing fact from opinion, understanding main ideas, guessing meaning from context and making inferences. The paper suggests that teachers can actively incorporate critical literacy theories into their classroom practice as it can generate more meaningful learning experiences among their learners as it encourages students to use their voices and life experiences as valid sources of knowledge (Hass-Dyson, 2001). Teaching instruction on developing readers to be more critical should be included in the pedagogical practices of undergraduate programme given that such instruction can hone students. critical literacy practices in the higher education sector.

J	Bidabadi, FS; Yamat, H				Bidabadi, Farinaz Shirani; Yamat, Hamidah			The Relationship between English Listening Proficiency Levels and Learning Styles	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						learning styles; learning process; English listening proficiency; EFL learners; communicative learners		Several factors have been investigated in order to understand how learners attempt to learn a second language, one of which is learning style. Learners particularly EFL learners from different English language backgrounds and listening proficiency may vary from one another in their learning style preferences. With such a view, it is essential to consider the differences in learning styles and listening proficiency levels in teaching because this would have an impact on the learning process. The aim of the study was to identify Iranian freshmen's levels of English listening proficiency and their learning style preferences as well as the relationship between them. A group of 92 freshmen from a population of 120 freshmen were randomly selected from a university in Esfahan, Iran. The Oxford Placement Test was first administered to identify the freshmen's listening proficiency levels and the learning style preferences. Questionnaire was employed to identify their preferred learning styles. Based on the results obtained from the Oxford Placement Test, 19 freshmen were identified as advanced learners, 39 intermediate learners, and 34 low proficiency learners. The descriptive analysis of the learning style preferences indicated that all the learners preferred high level learning styles and considered themselves as communicative learners. The Pearson Correlation analysis also indicated that there was a significant positive correlation between the learners' English listening proficiency levels and their learning style preferences. The implication of the study is that all lecturers should be aware of their learners' learning style preferences and their English listening proficiency levels in order to match their teaching styles with their learners' learning style preferences.

Research has shown that appropriate input and suitable contexts for interaction among students can lead to successful second language acquisition (SLA). This study examines the relationship between negotiated interaction and the ability to retain vocabulary items among a group of primary school English as a Second Language (ESL) learners with similar first language (L1) backgrounds. 48 participants took part in a one-way input task which involved traditional teaching/learning methods where the teacher used translations and pictures to teach vocabulary. 24 of the 48 participants took part in an additional two-way interactive task in the form of an information gap task. Learners worked in pairs to describe target vocabulary items in pictures. The interactive sessions were audio/video taped and transcribed. All the 48 participants sat for a pretest and three posttests (both immediate and delayed). The results showed that learners who negotiated for meaning in the two-way task achieved higher vocabulary test scores. The 24 students involved in the interactive task demonstrated their ability to negotiate for meaning despite their lack of proficiency in the language. As negotiated interaction has proved successful in enabling students to acquire and retain vocabulary items, such interactive tasks should be encouraged in the classroom.

Personal Pronouns as Guiding Strategies in Academic Lectures across Two Institutions	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						pronouns; engineering lectures; Malaysian lectures; lecture discourse functions; English as a medium of instruction	DISCOURSE; LANGUAGE; ENGLISH; METADISCOURSE; INSTRUCTION; IMPACT	Studies on linguistic features employed by native-speaker (NS) and non-native speaker (NNS) lecturers when delivering academic lectures have been scarce, perhaps due to the difficulty and complexity of collecting data for analysis. This paper attempts to fill the gap by analyzing how personal pronouns I, you and we are used in undergraduate engineering lectures in two instructions across different backgrounds to emphasize the way lecturers guide their students throughout the unfolding texts. Ten lectures (five each from a Malaysian university and a British university) covering fundamental engineering courses attended by second-year Civil Engineering students delivered by different lecturers were video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Based on eleven discourse functions that could facilitate students' understanding of lecture contents, pronouns I, you and we that occurred in phrases and clauses that manifest the identified lecture discourse functions were analyzed and compared. Findings reveal apparent similarities in the use of pronouns by NS and NNS lecturers in guiding students to follow their lectures. You and we have been identified as the most common pronouns used by both NS and NNS lecturers among the three pronouns. The findings reveal that factors that underline lectures as a genre override all others in the lecturer's delivery as far as pronouns are concerned. The findings are nevertheless valuable for training young lecturers to improve delivery efficiency, especially for academic mobility for both students and lecturers.

Nor Faridah Abdul Manaf's anthology of poetry, The Art of Naming (2006) reflects the people and locations that played a significant role in crafting her poems. Using the role of a flaneur, which is closely related to the theory of psychogeography, we investigate how Nor Faridah, as a flaneuse (a female flaneur), wanders and strolls through the places she reconnoiters, and how her mental and behavioural aspects as a human being are affected by her environment. Her poems depict a strong perception, involvement, and representation of images focused on the immediate encounter of the urban cities visited, which serve as valuable pieces of evidence flaneurs while walking. Based on the analysis, the different places visited by the poet exhibit her values of humanity including empathy, generosity and love. Thus, Nor Faridah's works illuminate the position of flaneur and flaneuse, demonstrating how spaces, contrary to what is thought to be pointless roaming, actually offer insights into understanding relationship between people and their locations. As a consequence, space and position are dialectically organised in human environmental history, since her sense of space is related to the locations she inhabits, which derive meaning from their spatial significance.

A corpus-driven approach was employed to identify the adjective collocates for the node word mental health, determine the semantic grouping of the collocates and investigate the portrayal of mental health issues in two newspapers. A total of 585 news articles, from January 2020 to December 2020 were collected from the New Straits Times and The Star Online. The Antconc 3.5.8 software was used to generate the collocates and a discourse analysis approach was employed to examine how mental health issues were portrayed. 22 adjective collocates were identified in the New Straits Times, while 34 adjective collocates were extracted from The Star Online. 13 similar adjective collocates were found and based on the 13 adjective collocates, four semantic group of adjectives (emotive, miscellaneous, size and evaluative) were identified. A discourse analysis on the portrayal of mental health issues in the two newspapers seemed positive because the reports concentrated on the initiatives taken by the government and NGOs to handle mental health situations in Malaysia, with the aim of educating the public and raising their awareness about mental health. The present study has contributed significantly to research on mental health in the Asian context, since the review of literature revealed that research on mental health were mostly from the West.

J	Al-Mwzaiji, KNA				Al-Mwzaiji, Khaled Nasser Ali			The Political Spin of Conviction: A Critical Discourse Analysis of the Origin of Covid-19	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Politics; Post-truth; Covid-19; Controversy; Critical Discourse Analysis		Covid-19 has flared a match of accusation between U.S. and China. Both of the nations have alleged each other for the origin of the virus and the incompetence to contain it within the respective national boundary. The allegations have emerged at a critical period when the virus has infected the entire global population. The study identifies a political discourse, that is, 'Lab origin theory' out of these allegations and investigate the form, structure, and pattern of language in use following the methodology of Critical Discourse Analysis. The article contends that these allegations are based not on facts but on conviction, opinions, and beliefs which are expressed in the 'spin' or turn of retaliatory responses. Forming a series of exchanges these allegations promote certain truth-claims which are, in fact, subjective interpretations and hypothetical assumptions of the origin of Covid-19. The claims of 'Lab origin' are established with certain linguistic strategies and symbolic models, and their nature can be only understood with the phenomenon of Post-truth. The concept of Post-truth has been developed against the backdrop of controversial as well as political events of Brexit vote and the U. S. presidential election in 2016. Like these events, Covid-19 is an occasion of Post-truth and its Lab origin theory is a compromise between fact and belief.

J	Amzah, N; Zainudin, IS				Amzah, Normalis; Zainudin, Intan Safinaz			Hakase no Aishita Suushiki and its Malay translation Rumus di Hatinya: A Cognitive Analysis based on Meta-Model	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						cognitive; retrospective; perceptions; Meta-Models; generalization; deletion; distortion		Cognitive exploration in the field of translation studies examines the translation process through two types of approaches, namely concurrent verbalization, which is the result of research using tools such as Think Aloud Protocol method, keylogging analysis or eyetracking while retrospective verbalization records data from translators after the translation is done. Cognitive studies in translation are still too focused on the steps that occur when translation work is carried out and less is focused on the cognitive processes related to cultural backgrounds that influence translators when making decisions while performing translation tasks. A translator is an intermediary who processes the source text in the original context and culture and produces the target text in different contexts and cultures. The cognitive process that occurs in translation in particular is the perception of the translator as a result of the processing the reality around the translator. This study aims to conduct a retrospective study which looked at the cognitive analysis of perceptions of the translator Normalis Amzah when she translated the Japanese novel by Yoko Ogawa Hakase no Aishita Suushiki into Malay Tumus di Hatiku'. The Model-Meta theoretical framework is applied to see how the translator performs cognitive processes specifically how she perceives the reality' of the source text and the target text in the translation process. The Meta-Model theory' argues that translators' cognitive processes are formed by three main perception forming processes namely generalization, distortion and deletion. Exploring translators' cognitive processes will provide an overview of the processes that occur before a translator makes the decisions when choosing the appropriate techniques or approaches. Apart from looking at the translator's perceptions, this study also discusses whether the translator's approach retains the foreign elements known as foreignization or trying to retain the target cultural elements presented as domestication. The findings of the study found that the generalization process is the most frequently used that is the domestication approach. When the translator applies the deletion process, the translator is seen to favour the foreignization approach in translating. The distortion process occurs when the translator feels there is a conflict between the cultural elements of the source language and the culture of the target language in order to ensure that the storyline or coherence of the text is not disturbed. The findings of this study also show that retrospective studies can record the cognitive processes of the translator's perceptions when translating a text containing deep culture consisting of beliefs, traditions and values to suit the appropriateness and acceptance of the target reader.

J	Fathillah, MZB; Vengadasamy, R				Fathillah, Mohd Zaimin Bin Haris; Vengadasamy, Ravichandran			Solitude as an Act of Hedonism in Bryce Andrews' Badluck Way	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Solitude; Pleasure; Hedonism; Intrinsic Attitudinal Hedonism; Ranch Literature		This paper argues that the author's preference for solitude in Bryce Andrew's Badluck Way is essentially hedonistic in nature. Solitude constitutes human existence and experience. The concept of 'pain and pleasure' predicates hedonism. The intersectionality between experiential solitude and hedonism is unfortunately inconceivable despite a plethora of discourse including literature. In numerous literary texts, solitude has been the pivotal entry point to ascertain and expound both fictional and nonfictional characters' actions and behaviours. The same can be said about hedonism. However, there is little to no literary studies conducted to explore the common linkage between solitude and hedonistic views. Fred Feldman's (2004) Attitudinal Hedonism theory and his six Intrinsic Attitudinal Pleasure features underpinned the study. Findings disclosed that many pleasure taking aspects in solitude are inherently hedonistic. Selected excerpts revealed that hedonism and pleasure taking played a predominant role in asserting the author's predilection for solitariness. This paper responds to the need for investigation of the singularisation of solitude-hedonism concept as a means of heightening interdisciplinary awareness and enabling inter-discourse studies of literary and philosophical scholarship alike.

J	Zhang, YM; Pramoolsook, I				Zhang, Yimin; Pramoolsook, Issra			Generic Complexity in Bachelor's Theses by Chinese English Majors: An SFL Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						bachelor's thesis; SFL; genre analysis; macrogenre; generic complexity	GENRE; LITERACY; LANGUAGE	For Chinese English majors, bachelor's theses are regarded as the most substantial piece of writing in their undergraduate study. However, in the field of EAP/ESP and genre research, thesis writing at the undergraduate level has been relatively neglected. From the perspective of genre in Systemic Functional Linguistics, the macrostructure of a bachelor's thesis constitutes a macrogenre which combines more than one elemental genre to accomplish complex goals. An understanding of the deployment of elemental genres in this macrogenre can further help reveal the rhetorical values circulating in this thesis writing community. Based on the genre taxonomy developed by SFL genre theorists (e.g., Rose, 2010, 2015a, 2015b), this study analysed the genre deployment of 40 highly-rated bachelor's theses written by English majors at a Chinese university, triangulated with semi-structured interviews with thesis writers and advisors. The results show that the 40 theses contained 776 shorter texts instantiating 22 types of elemental genres across 7 genre families. Specifically, reports were most extensively used by the thesis writers to transmit their received disciplinary knowledge. Arguments and text responses, though ranking lower in number, were essential to the writers' projection of evaluative meanings and authorial selves. Stories, chronicles, explanations, and procedural genres were deployed sporadically, but empowered the writers to perform a constellation of social roles. The findings of this study may assist novice thesis writers by heightening their genre awareness, and more practically, increasing their knowledge on the specific types of elemental genres over which they need control to produce a rhetorically well-developed bachelor's thesis. This paper then concludes with implications for teaching and researching thesis writing in non-English dominant contexts.

J	Zolkapli, RBM; Salehuddin, K				Zolkapli, Rasyiqah Batrisya Md; Salehuddin, Khazriyati			Lexical Access Patterns of Second Language Speakers of English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Lexical Access; Semantic Mapping; Vocabulary Learning; Mental Lexicon; Semantic Relations	VOCABULARY ACQUISITION	Vocabulary plays a major role in concept formation, acculturation, articulation, and all aspects of learning. Unfortunately, although learners may have internalized complex vocabulary through formal learning, they may not have the ability to retrieve known words and concepts or have access to the right words, or lexical access, effectively. This study explores the lexical access patterns of second language speakers of English (ESL). Fifty students from the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, participated in this research. Twenty-five represented the more proficient ESL speakers whereas the other 25 represented the less proficient ESL speakers. Four pieces of paper, each with a high-frequency word (i.e., "man", "people", "time", "day") printed at the centre of the paper, were distributed to the participants as stimuli for them to create four sets of semantic maps. This paper thus presents a qualitative analysis of the semantic mapping of the word "man" and results show that English language proficiency does affect the way participants activate the words from their mental lexicon. The frequency of the words that were activated from the word "man" in the participants' environment also affects the mapping. The semantic maps produced by the participants reflect ESL speakers' pattern of lexical access, particularly in the manner the words are categorised in their mental lexicon. This study proposes that semantic mapping activity can be used to reflect and analyse ESL speakers' vocabulary development, as well as to reflect ESL speakers' weaknesses in accessing words and their thought patterns in the English language.

J	Aziz, RA; Don, ZM				Aziz, Roslina Abdul; Don, Zuraidah Mohd			Tagging L2 Writing: Learner Errors and the Performance of an Automated Part-of-Speech Tagger	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Learner Corpora; Learner Errors; Part-of-Speech Tagging; Tagging Accuracy		This paper is concerned with the application of technologies developed in other disciplines, in particular with the use of text processing techniques to investigate the problems of second language learner writing in English. The question addressed is whether learner texts produced by L1-Malay learners at the University of Malaya can usefully be processed using the Constituent Likelihood Automatic Word-tagging System (CLAWS); a part-of-speech (POS) tagger developed for and trained on texts written by native speakers of the language. The study adopts the procedure employed by van Rooy and Schafer (2002).CLAWS was used to automatically POS tag a subset of the Malaysian Corpus of Learner English (MACLE), and the texts were then analyzed for tagging accuracy. CLAWS was found to perform less well on learner text than on native speaker texts, but still with an accuracy rate of over 90%. The sources of error are traced, and spelling errors are found to be the most common source. Closer inspection indicates that successful tagging is likely to lead to problems downstream in later processing, which suggests that to optimize performance, some modifications will be required in tagger design.

J	Salleh, RTAM; Kawaguchi, S; Di Biase, B				Salleh, Rabiah Tul Adawiyah Mohamed; Kawaguchi, Satomi; Di Biase, Bruno			A Case Study on the Acquisition of Plurality in a Bilingual Malay-English Context-bound Child	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Bilingual development; Context-bound; Language environment; Malay; English; Plural	GRAMMATICAL DEVELOPMENT; LANGUAGE	The early development of simultaneous bilinguals has been at the core of heated controversy since the mid-seventies. The Unitary Language System Hypothesis by Volterra and Taeschner saw early development as a single language system gradually diverging into two systems. On the contrary, Meisel (1989), De Houwer (1990) and Paradis and Genesee (1996) suggested the early separation of two linguistic systems. Neither position, however, considered language environmental conditions constraining development as key variables. This paper aims to show that the predominant environmental languages to which the Malay-English bilingual child in the current study was alternately exposed might have played an important role in shaping the child's acquisition of plurality in each language. Throughout the period of investigation (from age 3;4 to 3;10 and at 4;8) the child's interactions were regularly audio and video recorded. The current study focuses on the development of plural marking in a simultaneous Malay-English bilingual child. Interestingly, at a point when English was environmentally predominant, the child would occasionally use the English plural suffix -s on Malay nouns. After moving back to Malaysia, the child used reduplication to mark plurals in both languages. The findings of this study indicate that the predominant linguistic environment in which the child grows and develops plays an important role in shaping the child's language production.

Despite the cornucopia of research on speeches, budget speeches are rarely selected and speeches from Malaysia have not been examined in detail. The discourse in these speeches can display how a developing country tackles economic decision-making. The article explores the portrayal of economic competence in Malaysian federal budget speeches. It conducts a linguistic analysis grounded in critical discourse studies. The analysis employs frequency, concordance and the representation of social actors to decipher monetary amount, politonyms, ethnonyms and toponyms. The discourse in budget speeches can portray economic competence, which has three characteristics. First, the government can claim to be financially solvent and propose significant initiatives. Second, the government introduces desirable initiatives because it intervenes to ensure economic growth. Third, the government helps citizens of several ethnicities and regions although Bumiputeras, Sabah and Sarawak are prioritized. The portrayal entails an ideological government-citizen binary because the government is the source of initiatives while citizens are the target of initiatives. The portrayal was reproduced in other texts and was repeated in the media. The portrayal became the endorsed way to think about the former Barisan Nasional (BN) government but other parties questioned it. The article argues that BN sought to legitimize its political power but its legitimacy became compromised, and it was defeated in the 2018 general elections.

J	Ariffin, SNAN; Tiun, S				Ariffin, Siti Noor Allia Noor; Tiun, Sabrina			Part-of-Speech Tagger for Malay Social Media Texts	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						part-of-speech; informal Malay text; Malay POS tagger; Malay tweet; QTAG		Processing the meaning of words in social media texts, such as tweets, is challenging in natural language processing. Malay tweets are no exception because they demonstrate distinct linguistic phenomena, such as the use of dialects from each state in Malaysia; borrowing foreign language terms in the context of Malay language; and using mixed languages, abbreviations and spelling errors or mistakes in sentence structure. Tagging the word class of tweets is an arduous task because tweets are characterised by their distinctive style, linguistic sounds and errors. Currently, existing works on Malay part-of-speech (POS) are based only on standard Malay and formal texts and are thus unsuitable for tagging tweet texts. Thus, a POS model of tweet tagging for non-standardised Malay language must be developed. This study aims to design and implement a non-standardised Malay POS model for tweets and performs assessment on the basis of the word tagging accuracy of test data of unnormalised and normalised tweet texts. A solution that adopts a probabilistic POS tagging called QTAG is proposed. Results show that the Malay QTAG achieves best average POS tagging accuracies of 90% and 88.8% for normalised and unnormalised test datasets, respectively.

J	Mohajer, L; Jan, JM				Mohajer, Leila; Jan, Jariah Mohd			Building Solidarity through Interruption in Face-to-Face Interaction amongst Iranian Men	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						interruptions; cooperation; turn-taking; power; Iranian men	GENDER; CONVERSATION; SPANISH; SEX	This paper investigates interruptions among upper middle-class Iranian men and the way they strategize and manipulate turns in face-to-face interaction. The recordings of informal conversations of these well acquainted men were transcribed and Beattie's Interruption Model (1981) was adapted and applied as the framework of analysis. This study employed qualitative research design whereby natural-occurring conversation of participants from 15 participants from five groups, with each group comprising three participants, was recorded in the living room of one of the participants. The recorded conversations were transcribed according to an adapted version of Jefferson's (1979) transcription convention and were qualitatively analysed. The transcribed data were analysed using Beattie's interruption model (1981) and conversation analysis (CA) to examine the utterances and occurrences of interruptions based on turns being successful and complete at the time of interruptions. The findings of this study suggest that Iranian males interrupt each other cooperatively in order to show their support and solidarity. Although interruptions provide an opportunity for the interlocutors to dominate the interaction, there were no instances of dominance or any traces of intrusive behavior. In fact, the strategic use of interruptions denotes a collective effort to create in-group power that emphasizes solidarity amongst men in this study. This paper yields findings that go against stereotypical characteristics of men who exert power in their interactions. Such findings can be the result of the moderated patriarchal norms in Iranian society, which may have implications for studies on men's interactional attitudes.

In order to explore the process of world creation in the play, the writers draw on the works of Marie-Laure Ryan, a key theorist in 'possible worlds theory,' one of the orientations in cognitive poetics. Considering Shepard's highlighting of the bonds among the family members figuring in his plays, the interactions of characters with Textual Actual World (henceforth TAW) are of paramount importance and contribute to what Ryan calls 'tellability.' Central to our analysis is the consideration of the characters' private worlds' interactions and their intrafamilial and extrafamilial conflicts. Shepard is also centrally concerned with American ( popular) culture and its underlying myths, hence the prominence of the theme of American Dream in his oeuvre. As such, the projection of the characters' wish worlds is central in Shepard's play. Considering these "wish worlds" in terms of possible worlds-theory could be rewarding. Many of these wish worlds, it is argued, hinge on the notion of American family whose consideration by Shepard stems from his interest in the questions of origins, identity, selfhood, and autonomy.

J	Rahim, PRMA; Hashim, F				Rahim, Puteri Rohani Megat Abdul; Hashim, Fatimah			Facilitating Reading Engagement by Foregrounding Students' Voices through Epistolary Writing: A Case Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						epistolary writing; students' voices; reading engagement; reading in a second language	2ND-LANGUAGE; INSTRUCTION; LITERACY; COLLEGE	Engaging students in reading permits students to experience reading in a more meaningful manner as well as develop their identity as effective readers. Currently, the teaching of reading does not allow students to experience reading in an engaging and meaningful manner because the process of retrieving the required information at the end of the reading text has hindered them from experiencing reading in this manner. This exploratory study presents an approach to facilitate students. reading engagement through the employment of epistolary writing. The purpose was to explore the employment of epistolary writing in facilitating ESL students. reading engagement. The students wrote their understanding and interpretation of printed texts in the form of a letter to their instructor. Three third year students participated voluntarily in this case study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and documents such as students. letters, instructor's reflective notes, and pre-teaching and post-teaching questionnaires. Findings showed that the students appreciated that their voices were being considered throughout the teaching and learning process. They also described how relating their ideas through epistolary writing contributed to personal changes of viewing reading as an active process. The research highlights the value of including students. voices in the teaching and learning process. Allowing students to voice and share their learning experiences with their peers and the instructor, enabled the instructor to construct a better instructional approach to assist the students in their progress as engaged readers. In addition, this study extends knowledge that writing plays a key role in L2 tertiary level academic literacy development.

J	Kaur, N				Kaur, Naginder			The Need For Autonomous Vocabulary Learners In The Malaysian ESL Classroom	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						autonomy; vocabulary; lifelong learning; Malaysian ESL learners; Malaysian National Education Philosophy		One of the many predicaments faced by language learners at all levels is lack of lexical competence, resulting in lagging proficiency levels and inability to relate to the four language skills. There are many factors which explain this state, one of which is the learner variable. The learner is deemed to be of utmost importance because it is ultimately the learner who has to learn for himself and by himself. In view of this, fostering learner autonomy is becoming one of the most important goals in language teaching as the ultimate goal of education is to produce lifelong learners who are able to learn autonomously. This paper proposes that in the Malaysian context, as is elsewhere, it is imperative that we train our learners to become autonomous in realising the National Education Philosophy which espouses lifelong learning. By learning vocabulary autonomously, several benefits are derived, namely, learners can improve both receptive and productive language skills, consequently see improvement in language proficiency. Good language proficiency also ensures the ability to respond appropriately to the pervading era of knowledge economy and globalisation, which will in turn, enable Malaysian learners to be assured of employability. Hence, the initial seed of autonomous learning of vocabulary must be planted by the learner to ensure a fruitful harvest at all stages of learning and post-learning.

J	Baharudin, R; Jalaluddin, NH; Ho-Abdullah, I				Baharudin, Rusmadi; Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah; Ho-Abdullah, Imran			The Contribution Of Framenet To Corpus Lexicography: A Case Study Of The Elicitation Of The Meanings Of The Verb Melihat	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						frameNet; frame semantics; the verb melihat; corpus lexicography; elicitation of meaning		The current trend in the development of electronic corpora over the past two decades has had a profound effect on lexicography in many languages all over the world. Both in its current status and the future practice of lexicography, it seems certain will be corpus based, or even corpus driven. Hence, corpora are now indispensable tools in language research. From the large corpora, the patterns of usage and the semantic behaviour or the meaning potentials of a word can be easily recognised. Meanwhile, the development of the online lexical resource such as FrameNet (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu) has the potential to support the lexicographical tasks, such as the elicitation of meanings and sense differentiation. FrameNet is an on-line lexical resource for contemporary English that is based on the principles of the theory of Frame Semantics. As product of a project in computational lexicography, this database provides information about the semantic and the syntactic combinatorial possibilities, especially the valency pattern of each lexical item analyzed. This paper discusses the benefits that can be derived from the FrameNet project in analysing the meanings of words and forimproving the writing of a new entryfora Malay dictionary project. The word melihat from the semantic class of Malay verbs as related to visual perception is used as a case study to test the potential of FrameNet as an on-linelexicographical reference database that can be used by a language other than English.

The research method utilized for this study is both quantitative and qualitative. Data was collected through questionnaires, focus group interview as well as personal interview. Altogether 100 Japanese participants were selected to answer the questionnaires. Five participants were involved in the focus group interview and two were selected for the personal interview. The findings of the study reveal that the main attraction of joining this MM2H programme is the "reasonable price of goods" in Malaysia and the "suitable weather" of the country. Findings about the use of language show that the English language use among the participants is higher compared to Malay which is the national language of the country. This is due to the fact that they have more experience learning English rather than Malay. Without sufficient interaction with the locals, their proficiency levels for both languages were just basic. However, they could live their life here in Malaysia as they have a strong support system in Japanese. Despite that, they feel that there is a need to upgrade their proficiency in English and Malay. Their willingness to study English and Malay shows that they are in favor of an easier life and to have good relationships with the locals.

J	Widodo, ST; Saddhono, K				Widodo, Sahid Teguh; Saddhono, Kundharu			Petangan Tradition In Javanese Personal Naming Practice: An Ethnoliguistic Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Tradition; petangan; Java; personal name; primbon		This study investigates petangan, a form of tradition which belongs to the Javanese cultural heritage. Petangan (a study of calculation) plays an important role in Javanese culture. The petangan tradition first appeared centuries ago, at which time it has been developed and recorded in both written and oral traditions. The scope of this research focuses on a study of the petangan tradition in relation to personal naming practices. This study applied a qualitative research method - elaborated in order to identify various ways in which the Javanese give meaning to, evaluate, and predict the character of the name given to their children using the petangan tradition. This tradition is very popular in Java. However, in its development, it has started to become less prevalent among the Javanese community since it must compete with many forms of counter culture which are more modern, rational and instant. Data are collected from the sources of data obtained from documents and observation. The data analysis technique employed in this research is interactive analysis technique which involved three simultaneous activities: data reduction, data presentation, and verification. To obtain the validity of data, data verification was done through data triangulation by comparing the data presented to previous researches and petangan books. The finding of the research shows that petangan has important role in Javanese naming tradition in terms of its form, use, and social function in Javanese society. This study also discovers the development of personal naming practice, ideas, cultural taste, and various other changes which are taking place in the Javanese society from one era to another.

J	McGinty, S				McGinty, Sue			Engaging Indigenous Knowledge(s) In Research And Practice	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Indigenous knowledge; graduate studies; cultural meaning making; research; practice.		Researching education for students of Indigenous Studies means addressing the philosophical,theoretical and practical questions that arise when a researcher from one culture begins research with people from another language and culture.Specifically,Indigenous peoples across the world contest research that frames them within a deficit discourse,as well as research that is done ' on them ' rather than ' with them '.Indigenous people have advocated for their ontologies and epistemologies to be recognised within the academy,alongside the Western Canon of knowledge and research processes.In this context,this paper will address three issues of importance for non- Indigenous researchers working with Indigenous peoples.Firstly,preparing yourself to do Indigenous research by being a top quality researcher yourself and,when invited,to learn from Indigenous peoples about their knowledges.This is,of course,regulated by factors such as gender,age,expertise and relationships with Indigenous peoples.Secondly,preparing Indigenous students to become top quality researchers themselves,seeking opportunities to create new knowledge in that culturally diverse space.This includes challenging the boundaries of the academy to include Indigenous knowledges and practices in thesis production (McGinty,Koo,& Saeidi,2010).Thirdly,preparing non- Indigenous students to do quality Indigenous research which includes knowing your limitations,having a commitment to building Indigenous research capacity and operating in an environment of deep respect for those you are working with.Examples from research projects and student theses will illustrate these issues.

J	Abu Bakar, K; Sulaiman, NF; Rafaai, ZAM				Abu Bakar, Kaseh; Sulaiman, Nil Farakh; Rafaai, Zeti Akhtar Muhammad			Self-Determination Theory And Motivational Orientations Of Arabic Learners: A Principal Component Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						second language acquisition; motivation in education; individual differences; language - study and teaching; Arabic	2ND-LANGUAGE; VARIABLES	Recognizing the value of motivation in language learning, some scholars attempt to gain insights into this abstract psychological state by exploring models of motivation developed by educational and social psychologists. The present study extends an earlier research on motivational orientations for language learning based on the Self-Determination theory. Unlike the previous study which involved the learning of French in a bilingual English-French setting, this study explored the motivational orientations of Muslim learners of Arabic. A 45-item questionnaire was administered to 228 students in a tertiary education institution in Malaysia where Arabic is a requirement. With a total of 28 statistically reliable items, the Intrinsic Motivation-Knowledge, Intrinsic Motivation-Accomplishment, Extrinsic Motivation-Identified Regulation, Amotivation and Religious Motivation components accounted for 64.6% of the variance. Religious motivation emerged as a new statistical subdimension of motivational orientation as Muslim learners in the study showed strong religious motives for learning Arabic, a psychological state which practitioners would want to capitalize on and sustain alongside with other orientations. However, further research needs to be done to study the relationship between the intensity and types of motivational orientations, efforts and learning outcomes, and to compare and contrast the motivational orientations of learners of sacred languages such as Arabic and Hebrew in three different settings: highly religious setting, less religious and non-religious affiliated purposes.

J	Wilhelm, KH; Pei, BC				Wilhelm, Kim Hughes; Pei, Betty Chen			University Teachers And Students' Perceptions Of ELT Methodologies And Their Effectiveness	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						ELT in Asia; curricular reform; methodology; perceptions of students; perceptions of teachers		Since the mid 1970's, a number of Asian countries have been concerned with economic reform and a firmer position in the global market. As such, a great deal of attention has been devoted to the improvement of English language teaching and learning, especially at the tertiary level. The purpose of this study was to investigate English language teaching and learning at three universities located on China's mainland so as to identify issues worthy of more in-depth investigation. Perceptions sought from 25 English teachers and 312 English majors included: degree of satisfaction with materials and facilities; importance of English skill areas; effectiveness of teaching methods used; and factors contributing to effective language learning. Questionnaire data also included teacher/student talk time and how classes were typically structured. In addition, teachers were asked to give their views of their roles in the class and the importance of various assessment factors. Students were asked to indicate their perceptions for learning English, their perceived responsibilities in class, and their mastery of various English skills. One issue which emerged was the perception by students that they have little opportunity to practise English in the class. Teachers dominate "talk time" and this, combined with a lack of group work, indicate that little actual change has taken place regarding traditional teacher and learner roles in the classroom. Both groups were dissatisfied with textbooks and felt a lack of involvement when selecting materials or deciding syllabi. An interesting finding was the emphasis students placed on the importance of the social university environment for their success in English.

J	Asl, MP				Asl, Moussa Pourya			Leisure as a Space of Political Practice in Middle East Women Life Writings	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						leisure; counter-conduct; political spaces; alternate subjectivities; patriarchy	WESTERN EYES; RESISTANCE; MODE	Middle East women's active participation in resisting against socio-political impositions and constraints has received scant attention in the existing scholarship within the field. Much of the literature is focused on the socially victimized, subjugated and passive state of the female subjects in facing patriarchal authoritarianism and repression. In contrast, this article aims at exploring the subjected women's investment in multifarious acts of resistance through their leisure time and practices. To this end, Foucault's notion of "counter-conduct," a mode of resistance to be governed differently, is used to examine women's leisure activities in Jean P. Sasson' s (1992) Princess: A True Story of Life Behind the Veil in Saudi Arabia, Azar Nafisi' s (2003) Reading Lolita in Tehran and Manal al-Sharif s (2017) Daring to Drive. The analysis of these narratives within the power/resistance framework underlines the shifting complexities of the female participants' life course, and reveals that the subjugated women's trajectory in the stories is a gradual progression from pure submissiveness towards an active engagement in social, cultural and political realities. Throughout the narratives, women use leisure time and activities such as driving, reading and bonding in parallel to dominant techniques of governmentality to produce alternative subjectivities. The study concludes that the life accounts do not merely provide an oversimplified depiction of Middle East women as passive victims of a misogynistic cultural tradition, but rather chronicle women's active protests-i.e., individual and collective revolts of conduct, acts of opposition and violations of established norms-similar to the forms of counter-conduct theorized by Foucault.

In Malay language context, research in this area is limited to machine translation approaches. This study is divided into three phases: analysis of news discourse, development of headline generation technique and evaluation of the quality of generated headlines. The study aims to develop headline using statistical and linguistic methods. The statistic method used to identify significant words and sentences based in term weighting approach. The linguistic method is used to increase its preciseness. 140 news and their corresponding headlines model were constructed. Analysis of the news collection shows that the main idea of written text can be identified based on four characteristics: word location in sentences, sentence location in texts, acronym word types and words that represent the person name. Significant words with main idea of written text are determined based on the words weighted values. The values are determined by combining the frequency of words and word location in sentences. The content of the first two sentences are suitable candidates for recognising important sentences in text. Results showed that mean percentage for important sentence recognition 82.9%, mean quality of generated headlines are 0.3194 (precision), 0.5656 (recall), 0.4012 (F-measure), 0.5656 (ROUGE-N), 0.3392 (ROUGE-L), 0.1186 (ROUGE-W) and 0.1232 (ROUGE-S). In conclusion, the consideration of language factors in headline generation technique is capable of producing quality headlines with higher degree of fidelity as compared to the compared benchmarks.

J	Radzi, NSM; Hamid, BDHA; Abu Bakar, K				Radzi, Nur Syuhada Mohd; Hamid, Bahiyah Dato' Hj Abdul; Abu Bakar, Kesumawati			The Discursive Construction of Modern Masculine Identities in Contemporary Malaysia	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						masculinity; gender identity; discourse analysis; perceptions; contemporary identity; men's studies	GENDER; YOUTH; WOMEN	In recent years, the emphasis on studies of western masculinities has caused studies on local masculinities not only to be ignored but marginalised. The underrepresentation of studies relating to Asian masculinity, particularly on Malaysian men, has caused a significant gap in theorizing about Asian men in general and Malaysian men in particular. With globalization and the shift in societal expectations of gender roles, men are urged to redefine and reconstruct their contemporary identities in their personal and professional lives. Despite the growing interest in masculine studies, research concerning men, especially in the social transformation of masculinity within the contemporary society is largely absent. This study examined the perceptions and experiences of Malaysian men in their negotiation of masculinity. Drawing from in depth semi structured interviews and content analysis of survey questions, the study explores the discursive construction of new masculinity among 28 Malaysian men aged between 25-35. Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was used for the analysis of interview transcripts. The study sought to investigate how new masculinity is constructed by analysing the interview discourse of the 28 respondents by paying close attention to the linguistic and lexical choices they used to describe masculine identities. This study examined whether the current notion of masculinity sustains or challenges the hegemonic concept. The findings of this study indicate that being seen as independent, competitive and a risk taker are among the important determinants of self-perceived masculinity. In some instances, traditional male identities which is linked with being dominant, muscular and being a provider are no longer considered as ultimate masculine identifications. The findings are of great importance to provide a refined and contextual understanding of how masculinity and complex male identities are constructed in contemporary society.

J	Lee, HYH				Lee, Hugo Yu-Hsiu			The Effect of Multicultural Family Structures on the Language Attitudes of Children and Adolescents	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						bilingual; children; cross-cultural marriage; language attitude; Thailand	ENGLISH; THAI; MAINTENANCE	Attitudes toward languages of bi- and multilingual children and adolescents have not yet become a focus of research. Despite rapid growth in the number of bi- and multilingual children and adolescents across the globe, surprisingly few studies have been devoted to this significant phenomenon. Bi- and multilingualism is a major consequence of immigration and cross-cultural marriages. Regardless of whether cross-cultural marriage is involved, the immigration of families has considerable linguistic consequences on children and adolescents. This paper draws on five case studies in examining the complex factors determining the attitudinal patterns evinced by bi- and multilingual children and adolescents from immigrant families in Thailand. Five households agreed to participate in this research endeavor and data were also collected from surveys, interviews, observations and field notes acquired through the employment of ethnographic investigative methods. The data collected were analyzed through constant comparative method and content analysis. Findings showed consistent patterns for those bi- and multilingual children and adolescents whose Thai-speaking mother was linguistically dominant in a family with an immigrant father speaking a minority language. The results showed that these children were more likely to perceive Thai as more highly regarded language. By contrast, it was also found that Thai was not as highly regarded by the children of parents if both were minority-language speaking immigrants. It was concluded that the family structure of immigrant families is associated with the language attitudes of their children. By the same token, the type of marriage of immigrant families has long-reaching effects on the development of children and adolescents' language attitudes. Moreover, data showed that a non-migrant mother's dominant language played a more influential role in contrast to the minimal role-played by the migrant father's minority language in the development of children and adolescents' language attitudes.

J	Ai, JCA; Seong, GS				Ai, Jennica Chin Ai; Seong, Goh Sang			The Methods Used in Translating the Abstract Words 'Typical Yuqi Zhuci' into Malay	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Typical yuqi zhuci; abstract words; short stories of Mahua; Chinese- Malay translation; translation methods		Yuqi zhuci refers to abstract words that carries grammatical functions and is typically used at the end of sentences. It has multiple functions that could affect the meaning of the text. This paper aims to identify and describe the translation methods used by translators in handling the yuqi zhuci found in the Chinese - Malay translation. For the purpose of the analysis, this study utilizes the definition of yuqi zhuci by Zhang Bin, the categorization of yuqi zhuci by Shao Jingmin, the categorization of typical yuqi zhuci in Chinese sentences by Zhang Bin as well as the translation methods of yuqi zhuci by Liu Xu. The analysis of this research is descriptive in nature, and based on the context of the text. The results of this study show that the extension and merging methods and the method of changing the sentence structure can be used to deliver the functions of typical yuqi zhuci from the source text in Chinese into the targeted text that is in Malay. The couplet translation method, which is the combination of any of the methods proposed by Liu Xu can also be employed. Factors which determine the methods for translating yuqi zhuci are the functions of typical yuqi zhuci in the source text, the context of the story, the speaker's intention as well as the accuracy of the speaker's intonation. In addition, findings from the study suggest that Zhang Bin's (2010) classification of sentences containing yuqi zhuci can be expanded to include another type of sentence namely the ellipsis sentence. The grammatical function of yuqi zhuci evidently plays an important role in delivering a text's meaning and message. Thus, it is imperative for this linguistic item to be handled with care in translation.

J	Velasco, YP				Pedria Velasco, Yvonne			Navigating through Time and Space: Deixis in Atwood's "This is a Photograph of Me"	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						deixis; deictic shift theory; text-worlds; text-world theory; linguistic analysis		This stylistics analysis of Margaret Atwood's poem examines the persona as a paradoxical element whose interpretation was derived by applying the deictic shift theory. The use of the theory demonstrates how meaning was derived from the literary work that allows anchor-points in time and space to position the reader. While Atwood's poem has always been interpreted along the sphere of feminism whereby women are perceived as being marginalized and relegated to the domestic fold and are unworthy to express their identity and rise above the surface of a sea of domestic responsibilities, by using a more formalist approach, the process enabled an analysis of the theme, effects and meaning based on the language of the poem as evidentiary support. Deixis, as a linguistic feature, was employed as a tool of analysis, deriving meaning from verb tense and aspect, personal pronouns, and adverbs of time and place. These linguistic features were viewed and interpreted on the context of their utterance. Additionally, the concurrent use of the text-world theory facilitates the reader's capacity to build the world of the text. Hence, the formalist approach employed in the analysis enabled recourse to the language of the poem that allowed the persona to be revealed.

Lexical Variations of Dialectal Pronouns along the Perak Riverfront: The Geogaphical Information System Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						dialect; GIS; lexical variations; dialect geography; pronouns		This study examines the variations of lexical pronoun of the first person 'I' (saya)", second person 'you' (kamu) and third person 'they' (mereka) of Malay dialects spoken along the Perak Riverfront area. The analysis is based on geo-dialectology study which employs linguistics and nonlinguistic information such as the geographical factors, boundaries, migration and history. A total of 200 respondents comprising 100 old citizens and 100 adults were selected from 20 different villages. They were interviewed and asked to complete the established questionnaires. The given data were analyzed by a technology-driven analysing tool called Geographic Information System (GIS). The study accomplishes its objective which aims to identify the usage of lexical variations involving the three personal pronouns spoken along the Perak Riverfront area. In addition, the distribution of each lexical variant produced by GIS can perceptibly be mapped and compared. Subsequently, the application of GIS serves to explicate the role of geographical factors in determining the formation and distribution of lexical variations for the three personal pronouns in the area. The GIS software is an effective tool in assisting the researcher to present and display the map of each variation and the highest lexical variant of personal pronouns of the Malay dialect spoken along the Perak Riverfront. This study offers an empirical evidence that Central Perak is the authentic vicinity of the Perak dialect with a precise geographical boundaries as compared to previous studies. Evidently, a few villages in Central Perak speak Kuala Kangsar variant due to the topographic and migration factors. Simultaneously, exist three variants for mereka (they), that are /dem partial derivative/ for Kuala Kangsar, /dem epsilon/ for Central Perak and /depa/ for Kedah dialect. It is assumed that /de/ has become the basic syllable for the pronoun 'they' (mereka) variants. To conclude, the description of the Malay dialect and its distribution along the Perak Riverfront can be depicted adequately and systematically by using the GIS tool. Non-linguistic factors such as topography, geographical boundaries, migration and history play significant roles in determining the distribution of a given dialect.

J	Zeiny, E; Yusof, NM				Zeiny, Esmaeil; Yusof, Noraini Md			The Said and Not-Said: New Grammar of Visual Imperialism	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						visual imperialism; Muslim; west; east; representation		Since the European colonization of the East, stereotypical depictions of their perceived Orient as exotically backward and Muslim women as submissive and lecherous have been appearing as major themes in Western visual discourses. These representations, manifested to justify Western presence in the East, pervade even after the tragic events of 9/11. The West, especially the United States, now has to exercise new strategies to justify their imperial 'war on terror' project. The post-9/11 Western mass media and visual discourses are still fraught with stereotypes that consolidate stereotypical representations. Thus, by deconstructing the layers of Western misrepresentations of the Orient and studying the history of visual imperialism, this paper investigates, in the course of post-9/11 contexts, the grammar of visual imperialism in representing the East and Muslims have both negative and positive depictions. However we reveal that even the positive depictions would eventually consolidate the orientalist stereotypes and legitimize racist policies and practices. By drawing on Whitlock's concept of 'soft weapon', we argue that using Muslim women to relate their own stories of oppression and victimhood through memoirs is another new strategy to confirm the pre-existing notions of the East. These Muslim life narratives become soft weapons when they elicit sympathy from Western readers. Therefore, while the rule in the representation of Muslims after 9/11 has changed through the use of different strategies to apparently dispel the stereotypes, they ultimately reinforce the preexisting notions about the East and Muslims.

Followership: Boosting Power and Position in Popular TV Fiction	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						narrative exchange; conversation analysis; TV fiction; Malay adat; power	MALAY; DRAMA	Research by Andaya (1999) has shown that the "expansion of authority" in Southeast Asia is jostled through culture. In Malay archipelago, such authority and legitimacy are manifested in the regulation of "dress, language, and custom," reinforcing powerful gains emanating from wide cultural control. Following this premise, we seek to provide insights that work in tandem with how culture evolves to signify one's power and position through conversational exchanges palpable in popular TV fiction. Specifically, in this paper, we argue that reasons related to culture including religion and communal beliefs are employed by the " dominant knower" to prevail in TV fiction's narrative exchanges. Based on Conversation Analysis (CA) of Julia and On Dhia, we show that " dominant knowers" triumph using Malay adat (customs), as a reasoning firstly to justify the behavior of everyday discourse (friendships, relationships, and parenthood) and secondly to explicate one's choices in instituting the roles of women and men in the Malay world. Through such analysis, it is also found that any arguments through logic are denied and eliminated. Given these findings, this study demonstrates whether followers do or do not possess agency and whether followership does or does not dwell on loyalty to friendship and kinship over the course of navigating their private and public lives. By focusing on the narrative exchanges, we also contend that although TV fiction evokes issues that are decidedly modern and liberal in response to forces of globalization, Malay adat is still powerful for boosting power and authority in everyday Malay discourse.

J	Vrbinc, M; Vrbinc, A				Vrbinc, Marjeta; Vrbinc, Alenka			Diasystematic Information in Learner's Dictionaries: The Usability of Multiple Labels	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						mulitple labels; diasystematic information; monolingual learner's dictionaries; foreign learners; comprehension of labels		Labels in dictionaries provide information about restrictions and constraints on the use of certain words or senses in the contexts in which they occur or in relation to other words described in a dictionary. These restrictions are referred to as diasystematic information. This contribution deals with diasystematic information in four British monolingual learner's dictionaries (OALD8, LDOCE5, CALD3, and MED2) with the emphasis on multiple labels. A detailed classification of labels is presented and an in-depth overview of labels used in combination with one another in the dictionaries under investigation is given. Then follows a discussion of labels which are often used in combination, the aim being to establish whether labels belonging to one and the same category combine with one another or whether multiple labelling consists of labels from different categories of labels. The findings of this study show that labels belonging to different groups are mostly combined, and apart from that, labels expressing diaevaluative information and those expressing diastratic information can be combined within the group. Possible reasons for this are discussed in the contribution. The inclusion of diasystematic information largely depends on the type of dictionary and especially on its intended users. Therefore, lexicographers. decisions about whether to use a label and how to use it appropriately should be based on the user profile. This is especially true of monolingual learner's dictionaries, where one of the main functions is to promote the active use of a foreign language where every single piece of information included in the dictionary counts.

J	Safaei, M; Hashim, RS				Safaei, Mohammad; Hashim, Ruzy Suliza			Ophelia Transformed: Revisioning Shakespeare's Hamlet	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Ophelia; revisioning; sexuality; agency; mobility		The critical literature on Ophelia has been constrained to the scope of her characterization within Hamlet and to the corpus of literary criticism that has drawn upon the Shakespearean play to portray the contours of her personality. She is often regarded as the mirror of fragility and frustration; she is lascivious and prone to promiscuity; she has no significance in the structural design of the Shakespeare's play except to serve as an object of pleasure for Hamlet. Despite all this, Ophelia, within the domain of revisioning literature, has obtained new dimensions which stand in stark contradiction to her traditional figure. This article intends to address the new aspects of her character within the scope of three twenty-first century novels, namely Ophelia, The Prince of Denmark, and The Dead Fathers Club, which have transformed the Shakespearean play. Though Ophelia's sensuality is emphasized in all these novels, she is endowed with agency, voice, and a skeptical cast of mind. She is defiant of patriarchal and divine authority; and she at times serves as a haven for the young Hamlet. It is argued that these new dimensions of Ophelia's characterization should be construed not only as a response to the Shakespearean text but as a reaction to the bulk of literature which has yielded to the predominantly male-oriented readings of Ophelia.

J	Shabudin, M; Aman, I				Shabudin, Maserah; Aman, Idris			Interdiscursivity in Women Beauty Products Avertisement in Japanese Language	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						interdiscursivity; description of ingredients; description of functions; beauty products advertisement; Japanese language		The advertising strategies of beauty products in Japan has undergone an innovative change. The cosmetics advertisements are not tied to a particular genre, but is a combination of scientific and pharmaceutical genres that play a more extensive function. This paper discusses the interdiscursivity mechanisms and syntactically analyses the two paradigms that identify relationship between the genres and discourse used in 24 selected texts. From the interpretational analysis, it is found that the discourse used in the advertisement is a combination of two genres, namely description of ingredients and description of functions. The description for ingredients employs dermatological discourse and scientific solutions. Meanwhile, the discourse employed for a mascara and fake eyelashes advertisement is a combination of functional description and mathematical discourse. The description of ingredients is a strategy to inform the consumers of the special ingredients used, why they are included and how the ingredients can help to improve their complexion. Scientific jargons that are pharmaceutical in nature is used in describing the ingredients in order to provide an aura of credibility that could help stress on the quality of the product. It is also hoped that by describing the functions, the audience will understand the product better and is able to realize the desired result. Products that are functionally described also appears in the form of mathematical discourse where mathematical visual images form an intuitive understanding through symbolism and language use.

J	Mohammed, TMQ; Ho-Abdullah, I; Hua, TK				Mohammed, Turki Mahyoub Qaid; Ho-Abdullah, Imran; Hua, Tan Kim			The Semantics Of (fii) In Taizzi Dialect: A Cultural Variation Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						cultural variance; Cognitive Grammar; prepositional semantics; Arabic language; Taizzi dialect		In this paper, we adopt the framework of Cognitive Grammar developed by Langacker (1987) to provide a unified account of the different senses of the Arabic preposition (fii) as used in the Taizzi dialect, one of the dialects spoken in Yemen. The use of (fii) in the Taizzi dialect differs from its use in other dialects of Arabic or even Standard Arabic. That is, (fii) is cognitively characterized differently in the Taizzi dialect from (fii) in other Arabic dialects or (fii) in Standard Arabic. It remains a fact that despite the number of studies that dealt with prepositions, in general; prepositions received little attention and semantic analyses of prepositions remain inadequate (Cienki, 1989; Hamdi, 2002; Lunt, 1982). With regard to prepositions of Arabic, the main problem with the previous studies that dealt with them, in general, is that they examined them from a grammatical point of view focusing on their functions rather than their meanings. Moreover, these studies dealt with prepositions as used in Standard Arabic and were basically established upon the views of old Arab grammarians. The data presented and analyzed in this paper show that speakers of the Taizzi dialect developed the use of (fii) and extended its semantics to cover cognitive domains different from its use in Standard Arabic or other dialects of Arabic. However, what proves to be true about the use of (fii) in the Taizzi dialect need not necessarily be so about other dialects of Arabic. This reflects the cultural variance of prepositional usage in the Taizzi dialect in particular and other dialects of Arabic in general. The paper demonstrates that though speakers of the Taizzi dialect use (fii) in cognitive domains different from its use in Standard Arabic they still cognitively characterize the relation holding between the Trajector (TR) and the Landmark (LM) as a containment relation.

J	Yamat, H				Yamat, Hamidah			Developing Identity In Diversity: A Second Language Acquisition Experience	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						second language acquisition; experience; diversity; identity; ethnographic case study		This paper discusses how three young Malaysian children aged six developed an identity while experiencing second language acquisition (SLA). It illustrates how language difference which is an aspect of diversity has lead learners to develop an identity as language learners. The discussion is based on the findings of an ethnographic case study on three young Malaysian children's SLA experiences in the United Kingdom (U.K). The aim of this study is to gather insights from these children about their SLA experiences while attending a mainstream school and living in the U.K. This is to enhance our understanding about the process. The children were interviewed as individuals and as a group; and were observed at school and home. Transcripts of the interviews and observations were examined closely to identify themes for analysis and discussion. The findings indicate that the children experienced SLA as a socialization process in which the target language was being used to get on with life in a mainstream classroom and at home. The findings indicated several factors that might have an impact on the children's SLA. One that had a significant impact was that the children, without their awareness, were developing an identity in dealing with diversity.

J	Sew, JW				Sew, Jyh			Learning Malay Online At Tertiary Level	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						blogging Malay literacy; e-learning; educational social technology; new-age classroom; tertiary foreign language learning		This is a discussion on technology assisted language learning at tertiary level that delimits blogging as a form of e-learning for enhancing foreign language acquisition.Examining the dynamics,rather than the outcomes,behind the integration of weblog as part of a Malay module puts the spotlight on the efficacy of blogging in developing Malay literacy.The reflections of the tertiary learner blogging Malay as a literacy development are presented for consideration towards practical internet-based pedagogy in line with Y generation's current social-interactive practice.One observation derivable from blogging Malay literacy,i.e.developing written Malay proficiency with online journaling,is that a foreign language learner may learn collaboratively by tapping on the overlapping techniques of decoding and encoding a target language online at the intersection of cognitive-digital interface.The interactivity suggests that diversified stimulation is required in e-learning pedagogy not least foreign language acquisition involves multi-faceted cognitive,verbal,and auditory coordination.It is observed that digitalized asynchronous interaction contains synchronous learning stimulations,especially from the repeated viewing of the digital social media incorporated into the blogging practice.Arguably,educational social technology,in the form of embedded YouTube video clips in the weblogs,offers a foreign language learner with an affordance to generate a simulated face-to-face interactivity serving as a useful scaffold to improve foreign language proficiency.Applying the weblog to learn Malay,in turn,amplifies the cognitive receptiveness on the learner's part,which is an advantage of introducing and maintaining a collective of diverse learning stimulation in accommodating foreign language learning.

This is due to the fact that the same question word can occur at two different positions: at the initial or the final end of a sentence. Therefore, a field work was carried out in Baling, Kedah. A descriptive analysis of the North Malay dialect at Baling, Kedah evidenced that the question word bila can occur at two positions, specifically at the initial and at the final end of a sentence. The former position is known as in situ while the latter is known as moved position. The in situ phenomenon is against the rule of standard Malay language system. Therefore, this paper will elucidate the question word bila through syntactic analysis based on the framework of Minimalist Program (Chomsky, 1995). Syntactic analysis found out that C has a strong (uwh) feature but the strength does not require the word to move to the scope position. Instead, this analysis claims that the scope position Spec CP is attended by Op (empty category) in order to check the strong uninterpretable feature (uwh) at C'. At the same time, the presence of Op prevents the movement of the question words to the scope position. This analysis claims that the question word bila, that is in situ or moved, can check all the features before spell out. Therefore, these two phenomenon of the question word bila is language specific phenomenon for the Kedah Malay Dialect.

This paper explores the satirical devices employed in Sonallah Ibrahim's novel, The Committee (2001). Through the means of satire, Ibrahim skilfully explores the devastating effects of global capitalism on third world nations, by unravelling the mask that shields the domination and exploitation of Egypt. The discussion seeks to identify the hegemonic and the exploitative nature of the capitalist system on third world countries, specifically the creation of a web of conspiracy that controls the economic and governmental policies of Egypt through multi-national corporations as seen in The Committee. The discussion will show that said corporations ultimately transformed Egypt into a mere consumer market. The discussion concludes with the significance of satire as a mode of expression that is employed to bring about awareness among the public of the destructive consequences of capitalism on Arabic society.

J	Kim, S; Siong, K; Fei, WF; Ya'acob, A				Lee, Su Kim; Siong, Lee King; Fei, Wong Fook; Ya'acob, Azizah			The English Language And Its Impact On Identities Of Multilingual Malaysian Undergraduates	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						language and identity; multilingualism; Malaysia; tertiary education		Despite the increasing prominence of English as a world lingua franca, there is little research on how the use of English affects the identities of Malaysian speakers. Asmah Haji Omar observed that interest in language and identity seemed to be confined to studies on national identity. A doctoral study by Lee Su Kim of the identity of Malaysian speakers of English found that there was resentment in certain localized contexts amongst the Malay respondents in the study towards the use of English. Expressions of resentment and ambivalence towards the use of the English language were also prevalent amongst the non-Malay respondents within certain contexts. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative research study which sets out to investigate the impact of English on the identities of young Malaysian undergraduates in selected private and public universities in Malaysia. Using qualitative methods, this research study essentially takes off from Lee Su Kim's doctoral research study, and aims to explore on a larger scale the role of English in the identity construction of a younger Malaysian cohort from both public and private universities. The findings presented here are from a few selected case studies that provide the qualitative data. The discussion will focus on how different multilingual Malaysian undergraduates regard English vis a vis the other languages in their repertoire and how it has affected their identity constructions and everyday negotiations. Three dominant themes arising from the findings will be discussed, 1) Multilingualism with English emerging as the dominant language, 2) English viewed as a pragmatic language and a language of empowerment, and 3) Varying degrees of 'othering'.

J	Sultan, FMM				Sultan, Fazal			Syntactic Structure Of Bateq's Noun Phrase	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Bateq language; Austroasiatics; X-bar theory; noun phrase; Malaysia		Malaysia has some distinctive speakers who can speak Austroasiatics languages. However, the number of Austroasiatics languages in Malaysia is comprised of only 18 languages (Jabatan Orang Asli, 2009). These languages are very small in numbers; therefore, this has contributed to the criticality of these languages because they may extinct (Benjamin, 1976). One of these languages that is experiencing the process of extinction in Malaysia is Bateq language, which is spoken by Orang Bateq at Perkampungan Pos Pasir Linggi, Kelantan. The total number of Orang Bateq at the moment is only as many as 300 people. However, this study has a very narrow focus, which is the syntactic analysis of Bateq's noun phrase (NP). The descriptive analysis will elucidate the noun phrase and the word order, which form the noun phrase of Bateq.Further, guided with the descriptive analysis, writer will argue the syntax of the NP structure of the Bateq language using the X-bar theory framework (Chomsky, 1986). Resulted from this analysis, the writer will put on view the adjunction structure of Bateq's NP.

J	Yusof, M				Yusof, Maslida			Analysis Of Malay Locative Prepositions Within The Framework Of Role And Reference Grammar (RRG)	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Aktionsart; locative prepositions; Logical Structure; semantic representation		The purposes of this article are to reveal and to discuss the characteristics and the patterns of Malay prepositions based on verb semantic structures. This article proposes that the verbs classes which share the same semantic structures have the similar relationship with the occurrence of the prepositions in the clause. In this article, the discussion of the relationship between the verbs and the presence of the prepositions is based on the notation and semantics concept of Role and Reference Grammar Theory - Van Valin and LaPolla (1997) and Van Valin (2005). Semantic representation in RRG is based on predicate representation, namely the verbs which are constructed by Aktionsart decomposition. Aktionsart is a lexical class to which a verb belongs by virtue of the type of process, state, and so forth, that it designates. Aktionsart class is divided into states, activities, achievements, accomplishment, active accomplishment, and a causative version of each of them. Representation for the Aktionsart decomposition class is called "Logical Structure" (LS). Three types of locative prepositions are scrutinized to examine the link, namely di, ke and dari. In this regard this article will reveal the LS of prepositions and also investigate how the occurrence of locative prepositions can be predicted and determined by the LS of Malay verbs. The data are amassed from two novels, namely Biuh and Noni.

J	Ahmad, F				Ahmad, Fauziah			Presage, Context, Process And Product: Influencing Variables In Literature Instruction In An ESL Context	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						literature; language education		The premise of this research is on the theoretical assumptions that teachers' mental constructs can have significant pedagogical consequences (Clark and Peterson, 1986). It is necessary to describe the thinking and planning strategies so that one can fully understand classroom processes. National Institute of Education or NIE (1975a) cited in Clark and Peterson (1986) proposed a rationale for a program of research on teachers' thoughts and processes. They assert that innovation in the contexts, practices and technology of teaching be mediated through the minds and motives of teachers. As teachers are able to understand and observe (thought processes) classroom behavior, student's cognitive processes, students' level of capability and ability and students' inert interest and motivation, they can steer and adjust the classroom learning process according to the needs of the students. The success of any learning and teaching situation will depend a great deal on the teachers (Safiah Osman, 1992). Improving the ability of students to understand what they read is a never-ending process. Based on the theoretical premise and the consensus of views of other researchers, teachers' thought processes have significant pedagogical consequences. The purpose of this research is to investigate systematically and empirically the teachers' level of belief, background knowledge, attitude and perception towards literature and literature teaching, the extent of the influence of student factor and evaluation factor on literature teaching, the forms of teaching; student centered or teacher centered.

The appropriate and accurate use of the Malay language is influenced by a multitude of factors including users' attitude. This study analysed the standard of the National Language (BK) usage on signboards namely business signage, banners, and buntings located in areas under the jurisdictions of Kuching North City Hall (DBKU) and Kuching South City Hall (MBKS). It also reviews the public's sentiment towards the use of the national language at public spaces throughout Kuching city. The field work approach benefited images of business premises signage, banners and buntings around Kuching and a survey was done using the Google Form distributed to 351 respondents. The research data was analysed using the approach proposed by Zaharani Ahmad et al. (2010) in order to determine the standard of BK used. The data from the survey focused on five dimensions, namely (i) enforcement, (ii)language loyalty, (iii) language pride (iv) language norms, and (v) aspiration. The findings revealed that the standard of BK used under both the DBKU and MBKS jurisdictions, in all three categories of business premises signage, banners and buntings at public spaces, were at a very low and unsatisfactory level. From the perspective of the public's attitude towards BK, it was found that the respondents support the dignification of BK in public signage through all five dimensions studied. This clearly suggests that the respondents collectively, regardless of race and age group, support the importance of upholding the national language in the city of Kuching. The implication is, an increased effort from various parties, especially the PBT, to enhance and strengthen the use of BK in their jurisdiction should be made accordingly as despite the positive attitude shown by the public towards the importance on the use of BK at public spaces, the findings of this study have shown that the standard of use is very low.

J	Ibrahim, S; Pakri, MR				Ibrahim, Syazliyati; Pakri, Mohamad Rashidi			Bonded beyond Time and Place - Exploring Malay Archetypal Images in Hanna Alkaf's The Weight of Our Sky (2019) and the Malay Historical Texts	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Malaysian literature in English; archetypes; Iser's reception theory; historical female characters; Malay court narratives	PERSONALITY; IDENTITY	Malaysian literary works in English produced by the current generation of writers have been gaining recognition both locally and internationally in recent times. Among such is Hanna Alkaf, whose debut novel The Weight of Our Sky (2019) was critically acclaimed in Malaysia and abroad. As part of the new generation of writers in the Malaysian Literature in English scene, Hanna Alkaf places Malay women as the main characters in this young adult novel. Henceforth, this paper endeavours to study this novel in the attempt to uncover the archetypes that represent the female characters. Other studies on archetypes in Malaysian Literature English have not explored the similarities of characters in the current fiction to other characters in the Malay historical texts, hence this analysis is significant to fill such a gap. To achieve the stated objective, this paper has utilised the theories on collective unconscious established by Carl Jung focusing on the archetypes, the reception theories posited by Wolfgang Iser with the emphasis on gaps and blanks and the theories postulated by Ruzy Suliza Hashim which bring into light the historical females in Malay court narratives. The findings have revealed that the main female characters have certain similar attributes to the historical females in the Malay court narratives written hundreds of years ago. Such similarities have managed to collapse the boundaries of time and place and concomitantly, create a link binding these characters together through the nexus of Malayness.

J	Stepkowska, A				Stepkowska, Agnieszka			Language Choices between Partners in Bilingual Relationships	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						bilingual couples; intercultural communication; language proficiency; in-depth interviews; Poland		The paper focuses on the language choices among a sample of bilingual heterosexual couples in the less studied Polish context. Drawing on 24 in-depth interviews I examine the reasons for language choices in the couple, with the most engaging arguments being when the minority language is chosen. In the results section, I give the voice to the couples by inserting extracts from the interviews, illustrating the dyadic communication between the partners. The analysis is grounded in the sociolinguistic perspective bringing together linguistic and cultural aspects. Through these themes, I come to a more detailed account of communication scenarios conditioned by the L2 command of either of the partners. I report on the couples' language repertoires and the languages of their first contact that result from the individual trajectories of their L2 acquisition and impinge on the agreed language choices. My data suggest that bilingual couples do not, as it might otherwise be expected, always end up using the language of the surrounding society. The findings reveal a relative stability of linguistic choices, but also some deviations from once adopted communication patterns. The paper shows that language choice and proficiency are closely connected, but also that other factors come into play.

This study investigated the discursive recontextualisation of national unity through newspaper congratulatory announcements (NCAs) within Nigeria's ethnically diverse society, focusing on the pseudopatriotic undertones of the privately sponsored NCAs. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) and the agenda-setting theory informed the theoretical underpinning of the study. The data is drawn from four major dailies, covering the period between 2011 and 2016. Multimodal critical discourse analysis (MCDA) and the visual grammar (VG) are used as analytical methods to examine 97 privately sponsored NCAs. Dominant themes in the NCAs are highlighted along with the type of national unity projected in the NCAs. The analysis revealed that, in the name of promoting unity, private individuals and global conglomerates utilize pseudo acts to boost profits, enhance customer index, and construct their corporate image in the eyes of the ruling regimes and the general public in their host communities. It was also found that the envisioned future of the country as a united reality appears to contradict the common perception and lived experiences of the people. This study is meant to highlight the way certain ideologies are promoted and further interests are realised through the print media in the name of pseudo-patriotism. Further research may investigate comparable representations likely found in other newspaper genres as well as additional semiotic resources such as Nigeria's Civil War artefacts and monuments, statues, and other national symbols.

J	Hussain, G; Zahra, T; Abbas, A				Hussain, Gulfam; Zahra, Tehseen; Abbas, Akhtar			Discourse Functions of Lexical Bundles in Pakistani Chemistry and Physics Textbooks	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Academic discourse; Corpus-based study; English for academic purposes; Lexical bundles; Pakistani science textbooks	ENGLISH	Lexical bundles (LBs) are indispensable building blocks and essential constituents of academic discourse. The appropriate utilization of the lexical bundle's approach can effectively enhance students' understanding of academic discourse. LBs in various academic genres have extensively been studied concerning written and spoken language. However, less research has been conducted to explore the occurrence, nature, and frequency of LBs in Pakistani academic discourse, especially in textbooks. Therefore, the present study aims to explore four-word common LBs and their functional taxonomies employed in Pakistani Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSSC) level textbooks of Chemistry and Physics. A specialized corpus of these textbooks was built which was run on Antconc software for the identification and extraction of the LBs in the corpus. The classification of the identified LBs was then carried out utilizing Biber functional taxonomies of LBs. The study found 102 LBs occurring in the selected textbooks. In functional categories, there was a dominant use of discourse organizers and referential expressions. The findings related to frequent strings of words which can have significant educational implications for teachers, language material developers, and syllabus designers. The list of LBs with discourse functions provided by this study can significantly be used to enhance students' academic writing and their ability to comprehend different types of scientific texts.

The article aims to examine three (3) different aspects of research on metaphors from the perspective of corpus linguistics, namely: (1) to identify the lexicogrammatical metaphors of the lexical ukuran, which refers to the linguistic metaphorical collocation patterns; (2) the probability of the lexical metaphor ukuran as an examination for possible lexicons of MUWs; and (3) dimensions of metaphor variations of the lexical ukuran based on the variables of topic and vehicle. This research developed a specialised corpus of the Korpus Petua Membina Rumah (KPMR) (Household Building Tips) based even (7) manuscripts from which were MSS741, MSS1521, MSS1849, MSS1415, MSS2001, the Book of Abu Masyar and the Clause of Tajul Muluk. This research utilised a quantitative study design and corpus statistics analysis based on the LancsBox 4.5 software. The lexical ukuran was chosen since it is amongst the top 10 lexicons in the list of content words (nouns). The lexical ukuran occurred 54 times in raw frequency and 36.865101 times in relative frequency. Based on the KWIC generation, there were 24 lexicons that collocated with the node ukuran. The findings showed that the lexicogrammatical metaphor representation of the node ukuran collocated with the lexicon 'tiang' (pillar) and 'bendul' (sill). This lexical collocation provides the lexical metaphorical pattern that occurred and was coded as non-literal (metaphors). Second, the results of metaphorical probability exhibited how the MUW may occur based on the relationship of the co-occurrence of the node ukuran with the lexical collocation. Third, the dimensions of metaphor variations took into account the MUW related the topic and vehicle metaphors such as humans, abstracts, actions/locations, objects/buildings, and others. These findings proved that the lexical of ukuran was used as metaphors throughout the KPMR corpora. Thus, the exploration of corpus linguistics frequency data presents a research paradigm in the study of Malay language metaphors based on corpus linguistics.

The current article focuses on learning to read in the most widely spoken languages of Malaysia, namely, the national language Bahasa Melayu, Tamil and Chinese. These three unrelated languages have quite distinct writing systems. Bahasa Melayu uses alphabetic Rumi or Roman script, Tamil has an alphasyllabary, and Chinese has a logographic or morphosyllabic writing system. Moreover, many of these children are learning to speak and read in more than one language. When we consider the task of these biscriptal learners, a complex picture emerges, as they may have to learn to map different phonological and orthographic systems. Furthermore, many children in Malaysia have the additional challenge of learning English as a second language. First, a brief review of the characteristics of the three main languages and their orthographies is given. Subsequently, research on phonological awareness, an important skill associated with success in reading, is reviewed. Initially, phonological awareness and reading in single language studies is examined prior to reviewing some research on bilingual learners. As these three languages have rich morphological systems, we will also briefly examine some research on morphological awareness and reading. A review of the literature reveals that children who speak a language with a similar orthography to a second language may have some advantage when learning to read that second language in comparison to children whose first and second languages and orthographies are unrelated.

J	Alzarieni, MM; Zainudin, IS; Awal, NM; Sulaiman, MZ				Alzarieni, Manal Mahmoud; Zainudin, Intan Safinaz; Awal, Norsimah Mat; Sulaiman, Mohamed Zain			Rhetorical Structure of the Arabic Patent Abstracts	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Abstract section; Arabic; genre analysis; move analysis; patent	INTRODUCTIONS; ARTICLES; GENRE	Patent abstracts function as an essential part of patents, in which drafters summarize their invention and try to persuade the evaluators to accept their invention. These abstracts also have a crucial function as a useful alternative tool for effective and quick information retrieval. However, there is a scarcity of work on how these abstracts are constructed in Arabic context despite a considerable number of studies in different languages. This study, therefore, examines the rhetorical structure of 60 patent abstracts written in Arabic by Arabic-speaking drafters in the field of Human Necessity (HN) _ one of the eight classifications that includes patents related to social life_following Swales' (1990) Create a Research Space (CARS) model. The results revealed that Arabic patent abstract section consists of five obligatory moves and an optional one. Based on the genre analysis conducted, a proposed rhetorical move/step model which may be useful for patent drafters is developed. These findings are useful for Arabic-speaking drafters and novice inventors for a better understanding of the rhetorical structure commonly applied in their drafting of patent abstracts. A better understanding of how patent abstracts are drafted can improve not only their drafting skills to meet the expectations of the target discourse community, but also the chance for successful patent grants.

J	Jamshidian, S; Pourgiv, F				Jamshidian, Sahar; Pourgiv, Farideh			Local Heritage/ Global Forces: Hybrid Identities in Le Guin's The Telling	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Ursula K. Le Guin's The Telling; Postcolonialism; Globalization; Homi Bhabha; Hybridity; Third Space		This paper examines Ursula K. Le Guin's The Telling (2000), her last novel in the Hainish Cycle, which addresses intercultural communications among her imagined worlds. These relationships, which resemble those of our globalizing world, are analyzed in the light of Homi Bhabha's theories of mimicry, hybridity and the Third Space. It is suggested that in this novel, Le Guin criticizes cultural imperialism and rejects both conservative and assimilative attitudes toward the other; instead, she praises hybridity as the culture of our globalizing world. Besides warning against the hegemony of the West in international relationships, through analogy, The Telling highlights the ways the developing countries could be responsible for their own colonialism and the annihilation of their own culture. In this context, this paper proposes that the Dovzans, lured by Hain's advanced technology, as an act of self-colonization, impoverish their lives and deny their entire culture by criminalizing the Telling. The article further argues that indigenous peoples and groups of minorities, through hybridity and focus on their difference, not only can survive and conserve their local heritage and identity in the face of intense globalization pressures but also affect the dominant power. Accordingly, Sutty and the people of Okzat-Ozkat are introduced as courageous hybrid characters who finally succeed in asserting their voice in the third space. The article concludes that through bargaining with the Ekumen and remaining faithful to their own culture, the people of Okzat-Ozkat can save the Telling from extermination.

People in both vicinities speak the same Malay dialect known as Satun Malay. Besides similarities, there are also some elements of disparity between the two subdialects. Generally, the subdialect spoken in Langkawi is dubbed as Langkawi Satun Dialect (LSD) and the one in Thai is called Thai Satun dialect (TSD). The main objective of this study is to examine and describe the similarities and dissimilarities between these two dialects. The description merely focuses on the phonological aspects in general and the distribution of its variants. Data were gathered through field work which involved 240 informants classified as young, adult and old. The collected data were transcribed and keyed into ArcGis software for producing dialect maps. The findings show that there are three aspects worth comparing and depicting, which are the sound features of LSD and TSD, the distribution of LSD and TSD, and the influence of Thai phonology in LSD and TSD. The phonological behaviours that are evidently shared by the two dialects comprise of four phonological processes which systematically operate on native lexical items, namely monosyllabification, aspiration, assignment of tone and long vowel. The implication of this study illustrates that the influence of Thai phonology through lexical borrowing demonstrates that there are significant distinctions between LSD and TSD. It is apparent that if this linguistic behaviour continues to develop, the two subdialects of Malay will gradually be dissented and finally lose their intelligibility.

J	Asaari, A; Aziz, J				Asaari, Azlina; Aziz, Jamaluddin			The Conflicts Between the Semiotic and the Symbolic in the Mother-Daughter Relationship in Malay Contemporary Horror Films: A Case Study film Senjakala	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						semiotic; symbolic; mother-daughter relationship; psychoanalysis; abjection	ABJECTION; WOMEN; SAKA	Contemporary Malay horror films indirectly illustrate the conflict between mothers and daughters as a representation of the conflict between the semiotic and symbolic. This conflict often occurs in the relationship between mother and daughter in a horror movie narrative. Various studies have been done on women characters in horror films in Malaysia. However, a few emphasize the conflict of these linguistic realms in mother-daughter relationships. Thus, this article will examine the conflicts between the semiotic and symbolic in a mother and daughter relationship within contemporary Malay horror films using Senjakala (2011) directed by Ahmad Idham as a case study. Adopting the Feminist Psychoanalysis Theory, especially the concept of Abjection highlighted by Julia Kristeva (1982), textual analysis method is used to unravel the conflicts between the semiotic and symbolic in mother-daughter relationship. The analysis found that the film was trying to escape from the traditional notion of patriarchal ideology that everything in the world is stable and manageable. The conflict in the realms of semiotic and symbolic is able to empower the women characters and challenge patriarchal ideology. The conflicts of the semiotic and symbolic in this film prove that patriarchal ideology is not as stable as it seemed.

J	Ismail, HH; Yahya, WRW; Barani, F				Ismail, Hanita Hanim; Yahya, Wan Roselezam Wan; Barani, Forough			Heterotopias and the Enabling of Masculine Power in Richardson's Pamela and Defoe's Moll Flanders and Roxana	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						eighteenth-century English politeness; Fairclough's Three-tier Analysis; Foucault's heterotopias; desired and deviant masculinity; masculine power	18TH-CENTURY; POLITENESS; LONDON	Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740) discusses the tribulation of a lady servant and her triumphs against the vicious young master while both Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders (1724) and Roxana (1744) present the distress of two low-class women in the eighteenth-century man's world with great drive to champion for good fortune. All three novels are clear discussions of eighteenth-century femininity and domestic issues. Yet, the literature review is absent of specific discussions on ideas and types of masculinity during the eighteenth century, particularly its power operationalization. Hence, this paper aims to associate the operationalization of masculine power and the presence of heterotopias, which is linked heavily to the period's emphasis for politeness. The eighteenth-century English politeness, I argue, is instrumental at constructing masculinity and those without are emasculated of their manliness. As such, this paper depends on socio-historical framework as means to trace eighteenth-century masculine power which is enabled by specific heterotopias. Masculine power is firstly analysed through the use Fairclough's Three-tier Analysis Framework. Then, types of heterotopias are identified and evaluated in order to associate the presence of this variant with the operationalization of masculinity by using Foucault's heterotopia where this paper shows that certain heterotopias are the enablers of both desired and deviant masculinity. The novelists also pay different focus in urban and rural heterotopias. Finally, characters' choice for certain heterotopias empowers deviance and desired masculinity.

J	Idrus, MM; Nor, NFM				Idrus, Mohd Muzhafar; Nor, Nor Fariza Mohd			Legitimation Analysis: Exploring Decision-Making and Power in Hot Bench	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						courtroom discourse; discourse analysis; legitimation; power; Hot Bench	DISCURSIVE LEGITIMATION; DISCOURSE; STRATEGIES; REPUTATION; TALK	Research in discourse analysis has demonstrated that power can be illuminated through analyzing discourses. Centered on the notion that power and legitimation go hand-in-hand, these discourses are distinguished by specific linguistic components. One of the ways to explore how legitimation is tranquilized is to scrutinize its discourses, which some scholars (Wang, 2006; Van Leeuwen, 2007) argue have the precedence to control some of everyday, social, and public spheres. Following this premise, this paper examines how legitimation is jostled in selected decision-making scenes in a popular syndicated three-judge panel TV court show, Hot Bench. Two objectives are set out for this study; firstly to examine how organization and resolution of cases are generally settled and secondly to identify the types of legitimation employed by the judges in their decision-making processes. Premiered in 2014, Hot Bench draws over 2 million viewers in October 2014, jumping to a staggering 2.5 million viewers in November 2014, emerging as one of the most watched syndicated legal reality TV programs in United States of America with its second season renewed through 2017. By analyzing selected conversations by judges who deliberate verdicts, this study which employs Van Leeuwen's framework of legitimation concludes that the judges typically employ three types of legitimation, namely, authorization, moral evaluation, and rationalization over the course of adjudicating TV's court proceedings. This study ultimately contributes to the broader field of discourse analysis by tapping onto the belief that language, through discourse analysis, serves as a vehicle within which specific discourse community maintains power.

In finding a suitable pedagogy to address issues of low employability among Malaysian university graduates, academia prefers to implement a learning pedagogy such as multiliteracies approach from Western countries. However this practice is creating issues of adaptability among Malaysian students. Therefore this study investigates the implementation of the Multiliteracies pedagogy, a Western teaching approach; in a Malaysian university classroom that taught English as a Second Language (ESL). The method of the study was grounded to the philosophy of a participatory action research and data was collected through classroom observation, informal conversations and classroom artefacts. 30 Bakti Polytechnic students. experiences using the multiliteracies approach in learning ESL was the focus of this study. Due to the importance of reflection and action in a participatory action research, data was analysed through a Critical Reflective Analysis Steps, which included the process of observing and noting personal reflections, confronting and thinking, and taking action. The findings suggest that students had issues with working in teams, completing critical analysis and participating actively in classroom discussions. The study proposes a framework to guide the implementation of a Western-based pedagogy in a Malaysian context. Indeed, the practice requires deep deliberation of the students. socio-cultural practices and cultures of learning to ensure that optimum result could be achieved from the introduction of the new pedagogy.

J	Mei, HC; Shuib, M				Mei, Hooi Chee; Shuib, Munir			An Analysis of Hedging Devices in Complaint Business Letters	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						hedging devices; complaint business letters; native speakers of English; rhetorical sections; Hyland ' s model		Hedging devices are important tools and have been used widely in academic and scientific writing, but their usefulness in business writing has seldom been explored. In a business setting, very few studies have been carried out on hedging in business letters. Some scholars have indicated that the use of hedges is also important in business letters. However, not many business writers are aware of the use and importance of hedging devices in business letters, especially complaint business letters. The aim of the paper is to present findings in the use of hedging devices in complaint business letters among 30 native speakers of English, who have working experience in the business context. The study aims to determine the types and forms of hedging devices that native speakers of English commonly use when writing business letters, as well as, to determine the types and forms of hedging devices that commonly occur in the rhetorical sections (introduction, body, and closure) of business letters. The study employs Hyland. s model of hedging to identify the forms and types of hedges commonly used by native speakers of English. The findings show that content-oriented hedges are used more frequently in terms of types of hedging devices, while reader pronouns are the forms of hedging devices that are used most frequently in terms of forms of hedging devices in complaint business letters. In all the rhetorical sections of complaint business letters, contentoriented hedges and reader pronouns are commonly used. From the findings, it is clear that hedging is an important aspect of business writing because hedges make a text more readerfriendly since those hedges allow negotiation to occur between the writer and the reader. Hedges also allow the message to be carried across more clearly and precisely.

J	Kim, MS; Kim, HJ				Kim, Mi Soon; Kim, Hyun Jung			Investigating Chinese Language Learners' Reading Comprehension for Different Meaning Types	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Chinese as a second/foreign language; second language reading ability; reading test; New HSK; reading item type		The Chinese government has published an official guide specifying the aims for reading in Chinese and the expected comprehension levels for different proficiency learners, with regard to teaching and learning Chinese as a second or foreign language. However, due to lack of teacher training for its implementation, this guide has rarely been used for teaching reading to Chinese language learners and has rarely been used for evaluating their reading ability. Therefore, it appears that teaching and assessing reading comprehension have not been based on a theoretical background of reading ability. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to provide validity evidence of a Chinese reading test developed based on a theoretical model of reading ability; and (2) to examine reading test performance of Chinese learners with various reading ability levels. For the purpose of this study, reading ability was defined based on a meaning-based model that included three layers of reading comprehension: literal, intended, and implied meanings of a reading text. A total of 248 Korean university students were divided into three levels, and their test performances were analyzed and compared for the three meaning types using structural equation modeling and regression analysis. The results suggest that the test performance structure represented the meaning-based model in general, thereby providing validity evidence of the test. Further analyses revealed that the three groups differed from one another with respect to their understanding of literal, intended, and implied meanings. The findings provide pedagogical implications for teaching Chinese language learners with different reading proficiency levels.

Integration of an Interactive Program in Learning Arabic Language for Non-Native Speakers via Virtual Tutor	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						e-learning; Arabic language learning; interactive program; non-native speakers; Virtual Tutor		This research presents the integration process of an interactive program specifically dedicated in teaching Arabic language to the non-native speakers. This program is established based on the complete awareness of the language contents and its four levels of language study (phonological, morphological, syntactical and semantic) with distinct focus on prominent foundations and theories concerned with academic accomplishment as derived from the elearning data system. The research is established on textual and phonological database involving vocabulary comprehension and its manners of pronunciation and inferring to the most highly expected errors from the non-native speakers of Arabic. More than 120 users participated in the process, under the supervision of a specialized teamwork between the administrative, linguistic, educational and engineering departments. The tentative results statistically reflect the program. s efficiency and its distinctive role in prompting the academic process and the increase in the cognitive outcome among the students who are assigned as the experimental sample group in comparison to the results of the realizable control sample from similar conventional education. This program garners practical and academic features ensuring more worth in studying it compared to other e-learning programs. In essence, Virtual Tutor does not only embody theoretical foundations which are supported with modern methodological designs, but it also simultaneously ensures efficient participatory role of the users.

This research investigated the level of sensitivity and application of French grammatical gender by university students. The research was intended to identify strategies utilized by the students in acquiring the grammatical gender. The respondents were 60 intermediate level students who are learning French. A total of 20 questions with vocabularies that have grammatical gender and which have been learned were given to the respondents to examine their sensitivity to gender cues and their ability to apply the grammatical gender analysis. An error analysis using the Surface Strategy Taxonomy by Dulay, Burt and Krashen (1982) was conducted and the result showed that the students exhibited a low degree of awareness of gender associations to prepositions. The students also had difficulties in associating the adjectives with gendered nouns, particularly when the adjectives involved inanimate objects. The researcher found that misselection, omission and addition of errors by the learners were due to their insensitivity and misunderstanding of the grammatical gender and its application. A few strategies were used by the learners in applying their knowledge in sentences with grammatical gender.

J	Zhang, JP				Zhang Jin-pei			Compliments And Compliment Responses In Philippine English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						compliments; compliment responses; discourse completion test; varieties of English; Philippine English		Compliment is a speech act that frequently occurs in everyday conversations. It is often used to start a conversation or to, lubricate. the conversational interaction by reinforcing the rapport between the interlocutors. One line of academic research on compliments is to investigate similarities and differences across varieties of English (Jucker, 2009). So far, many varieties of English, such as American English, New Zealand English, and African English have been explored and it was found that compliments are formulaic in terms of both the meaning and the syntactic forms (e.g. Manes & Wolfson, 1981; Holmes, 1986; Herbert & Straight, 1989). However, only few studies have been done on Philippine English. This paper aims to fill the gap. A Discourse Completion Test (Henceforth DCT) was used to elicit data of giving and receiving compliments from 30 college students in a Philippine University. An analysis is provided of the compliment strategies, the syntactic and lexical patterns characterizing compliments, and the compliment response strategies. It was found that Philippine English speakers tend to use explicit compliments plus a bound semantic formula most frequently. The compliments in Philippine English are as formulaic at syntactic and lexical levels as other varieties of English. Filipinos are more likely to accept the compliment, rather than reject it, when they receive one	[Zhang Jin-pei] Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Sch Foreign Languages, Shenzhen, Peoples R China	Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology	Zhang, JP (corresponding author), Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Sch Foreign Languages, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.	zhangjinpei@gmail.com						Bautista M.

This study was based on the concept of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) by Shulman (1986). The aims of this study are to explore and examine teachers' PCK in secondary schools in Sarawak. This study also strives to investigate how PCK is implemented in the form of pedagogical reasonings and actions during teaching in classrooms. This study employed a case study design. Qualitative data were gathered through interviews and teaching observations of four Iban language teachers from the District Education Office of Subis, Sarawak. The research data in the form of transcripts of interviews were analysed using Nvivo 8 software. Research findings indicate that PCK of Iban language teachers are influenced by their disciplines of knowledge as all the respondents have different teaching options. The findings also show that there are no significant differences of PCK between novice and experienced teachers. Instead, teachers experience is known to be a minor factor. In conclusion, PCK Iban language teachers are found to be influenced by their respective options.

It is applied in various visual communication language endorsed through the elements of graphic design comprising pictures, letters, colours, compositions and design layout. All these are done to send messages through visual, audio and audiovisual communication to target audiences. This research analyses a design of an industrial logo, that is, Starbucks Coffee. The study on media language to understand semiotics is vital, as language is the main component in channeling media information as communication processes, and generates meaning of messages. It functions to send messages visually that display pictures, signs or information that can be easily deciphered by all. Fittingly, semiotics is a study of signs or symbol (theory of signs). Semiotics analysis is employed in this research through taxonomy analysis (classification) focusing on a domain that will be the object of analysis. This research finds that the choice of logo made a difference in promoting a product which gives a lasting effect to consumers. The positive image created by industries via visual images or logo can contribute significantly towards industries and gives positive impact on the image of the industries.

It is a technology that is transforming our educational institutions and how we conceptualise and experience teaching and learning. Teaching online is becoming more flexible and innovative in its preparation and delivery, as content and activities can be placed on websites for students both as supplement to lectures or as replacement for them. This paper discusses how a doctoral dissertation was designed to gather information on three areas related to the synchronous online delivery of English courses namely teaching and learning, technology, and management in a virtual institution of higher learning. It explains the design of the study and its rationale within the qualitative and quantitative paradigms. The discussion in this paper also attempts to highlight plausible issues that researchers may encounter when conducting research in a technology enhanced context and suggests practical way to consider.

J	Piotrowska, A; Skrzypek, D				Piotrowska, Alicja; Skrzypek, Dominika			Alienability Splits in Swedish from a Diachronic Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						alienability; split possession; Swedish; definite article; prepositional construction		The paper discusses possessive expressions with body-part nouns in Swedish (1300-1550) with particular focus on the so-called alienability splits, i.e., separate patterns of marking possession for alienable and inalienable entities. The key problem to be addressed is to what extent such splits can be found in Swedish and the aim of the study is to establish when they arise and what motivates their formation. The inalienable possessive constructions with bodypart referents in Modern Swedish include the so-called implicit possession, where only the definite article is used and the inalienable prepositional construction of the type `the head on him'. The analyzed material consists of Old Swedish prosaic texts written between 1300 and 1550. The corpus includes eight texts and amounts to ca. 250,000 words. The material is studied both quantitatively and qualitatively; collostructional analysis is used for the statistical overview of the data. The results of the collostructional analysis confirm that the implicit possessive construction first appears in Period II (1350-1450) and becomes grammaticalized in the late 1400s. The inalienable prepositional construction is not found in the material studied and thus must be of later origin. The results suggest further that the inalienable possessive constructions do not arise as a result of the speaker's wish to disambiguate the notion of inalienability but are a by-product of other diachronic processes, such as the grammaticalization of the definite article in the indirect anaphoric context.

Taking into account the public perceptions on the issue may assist decision-makers in producing appropriate strategies to ameliorate the impacts of climate change. A corpus-driven sentiment analysis approach was done to classify the polarity of Malaysian public perceptions, identify the sentiment lexicon, and analyse the public sentiments. A part of a specialised corpus namely the Malaysian Diachronic Climate Change Corpus (MyDCCC) was developed from The Sun Daily and was used as the data for this study. The methodology involved the employment of Azure Machine Learning software to conduct sentiment analysis to explore the polarity of public sentiments, corpus analysis approach to identify the sentiment lexicon and discourse analysis to analyse public sentiments based on the identified sentiment lexicon. The results revealed that the majority of public sentiments appeared to be negative, depicting sentiment words such as long, critical, and serious. Positive sentiment words also prevailed such as better, best and hope. The discourse analysis revealed that the public is reasonably insightful of climate change although their sentiments appeared to be negative. However, the negative stance was largely influenced by the public's indignation with how decision-makers handle the climate change issue. Ironically, the negative sentiments may be an indication for the decision-makers to improve their approach in addressing climate change. This study has contributed significantly to research on public perceptions of climate change in the Malaysian context.

J	AlJazrawi, D; AlJazrawi, Z				AlJazrawi, Dunya; AlJazrawi, Zeena			Metadiscourse as a Way of Achieving Persuasion in Literary Criticism Texts	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						metadiscourse; persuasion; literary criticism; essays; critical theory	DISCOURSE	This study aims at examining the use of metadiscourse markers in literary criticism texts to identify the role of the reader and how these markers are used to produce more persuasive essays. The data of 72,727 words from 17 texts were written by three well-known authors, namely, T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf and Stanley Fish. Hyland's (2005) model of interpersonal metadiscourse markers was used to analyze the data. The analysis revealed that metadiscourse markers are used by literary critics to create coherent and persuasive texts. It was found out that the theory of criticism adopted by the literary critics does not affect the use of metadiscourse markers only maybe in terms of relying more on logos, ethos or pathos. The results of this study comply with those of previous research showing that metadiscourse markers are frequently used in literary criticism texts. This study will contribute to both the literary genre and the genre of critical essays by identifying the linguistic features to be used to produce more effective and convincing literary criticism texts. It will also help future critics to write more persuasive texts by highlighting the means that enable them to influence their readers and to produce more coherent and convincing texts.

J	Diamante, JT; Cadiente, GD; Mabuan, RA				Tabernero Diamante, Jennifier; Doroja Cadiente, Glenda; Atibagos Mabuan, Romualdo			Linguistic and Discursive Features of Mining News Discourse in the Philippines	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						sociolinguistics; discourse studies; critical discourse analysis; discourse themes; Philippine mining discourse	LANGUAGE; POLICY	The Philippines is one of the mineral-rich countries in the world with an estimated US$840 billion worth of untapped mineral wealth, catapulting the mining industry as a significant economic player providing substantial contribution to the national revenue and generating employment opportunities for the Filipino people. However, the detrimental impact of mining to the country has also been heavily criticized as it causes massive potential destruction to environment and wildlife ecology such as acid mine drainage and contaminant leaching, soil erosion, and tailing impoundments among others. These conflicting interests are reflected in the mining discourses stoked or dimmed by media, which influence the readers' construal of meanings in the mining texts, social actors' roles in the mining industry, and the urderlying contexts of the mining reality. Drawing on critical discourse analysis, this study described the linguistic and discursive features of Philippine mining discourse in media texts. The study used 224 news articles published by three online portals within five years. Local news reports and peripheral discourses obtained through interviews with local "symbolic elites" in the identified mining communities and other archival documents supplemented the news texts. The UAM Corpus Tool, a software for linguistic tagging, complemented the manual analysis in identifying the social actor theme. Findings revealed that government actions, economic phenomenon, and political actors are the most prevalent themes in the mining news reports. Moreover, results showed that local news tends to focus more on the mining's environmental impact, whereas the national news tends to put more premium on the mining's economic impact. This means that the media allotted a much lesser spatio-temporal space for the environment and Indigenous Peoples' cause. The findings further invalidate the assumptions that mining discourse is primarily concerned with environmental related issues.

J	Mohamad, H; Malek, NKA; Abd Razak, NH				Mohamad, Hasnah; Malek, Noorul Khairien Abdul; Abd Razak, Noor Husna			Formation of Health Science Terminology by Users in General Malay Language Texts	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Indonesian	Article						vocabulary; terminology/term; general corpus; intensional definition; health science		The emergence of terminology in various fields contributes to the enrichment of Malay vocabulary, and is crucial in supporting the development of the Malay language as a language of knowledge. However, studies on terminology in general Malay language texts are still somewhat lacking. Most studies focus more on the aspects of formation and acceptability of terminology. Apart from that, the phenomenon of excessive borrowing of foreign terminology in Malay language vocabulary, especially in the field of science and technology, also indicate that society nowadays frequently coin terms easily through the absorption of foreign terms for current needs. Thus, this study describes the formation of terminology in Malay language medical (health science) field texts. The first objective is to identify health science terms in general texts, namely newspapers. The method used in identifying the terms is by making comparisons between terms in general texts, and the existing terminology data bank which are terms in the Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu, Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. The analytical definition approach is used to explain terms in the texts through the clues given by the general text writer. The second objective is to describe the terminology corpus in terms of frequency and presence of the terms in the Malay language general corpus. Then, the relationship between the terms and existing terms is described based on the form generated, and description of the term in the text that is being studied. This study used the textual analysis method which involves medical field (health science) text corpus from online newspapers, namely Berita Harian, Harian Metro, Utusan, Kosmo, and Info Sihat, from January 2015 to February 2018, involving 41000 words. The TextStat texts analysis program is used to display study data in the form of word frequency, and concordance for terminology identification. The various Malay language medical health science terms by related field users, and their methods of formation were documented. In conclusion, this study has shown that terminologies are readily created by users in general texts and can fulfill the requirements of standard terminology in the field of health science.

J	Mustaffa, AR				Mustaffa, Amir Rashad			Null Expletives in Malay	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Malay; Expletive; Pleonastic Subject; EPP; Existential		Malay is not known to have expletives due to their absence in the grammar, but this does not necessarily entail that expletives do not exist altogether. Gaps are observed in constructions with positions in which one would expect an expletive in a strictly non-pro-drop language such as English, hence making it seem as though Malay has a phonetically null variety of expletive. This phenomenon is common in attested pro-drop languages; however, data from Malay have not been properly documented and a principled account of the hypothesised existence of null expletives in Malay is lacking in the literature. This paper attempts to confirm whether Malay does have expletives by examining certain null-subject constructions through Chomsky's (1982) Extended Projection Principle and comparing Malay with English and Irish. All cited examples in Malay are from the online archive of Utusan newspapers and those in Irish are from McCloskey (1991) and McCloskey (1996). All other examples are from consultants who are native speakers. It is found that Malay obeys the EPP, based on the obligatory movement of a subject into TP, which consequently makes it necessary for the use of a null expletive when no other constituent is able to raise to satisfy the EPP. The merging of a null expletive therefore creates an expletive-argument chain that causes the definiteness restriction in the existential construction, which can be overridden by substituting the expletive with clitic -nya on the verb.

J	de Schryver, GM; Wolfer, S; Lew, R				de Schryver, Gilles-Maurice; Wolfer, Sascha; Lew, Robert			The Relationship Between Dictionary Look-up Frequency and Corpus Frequency Revisited: A Log-File Analysis of a Decade of User Interaction with a Swahili-English Dictionary	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						lexicography; online dictionaries; log files; corpus frequencies; Swahili; English; language universals		In an earlier publication it was claimed that there is no useful relationship between Swahili-English dictionary look-up frequencies and the occurrence frequencies for the same wordforms in Swahili-English corpora, at least not beyond the top few thousand wordforms. This result was challenged using data for German by a different team of researchers using an improved methodology. In the present article the original Swahili-English data is revisited, using ten years' worth of it rather than just two, and using the improved methodology. We conclude that there is indeed a positive relationship. In addition, we show that online dictionary look-up behaviour is remarkably similar across languages, even when, as in our case, one is dealing with languages from very dissimilar language families. Furthermore, online dictionaries turn out to have minimum look-up success rates, below which they simply cannot go. These minima are language-sensitive and vary depending on the regularity of the searched-for entries, but are otherwise constant no matter the size of randomly sampled dictionaries. Corpus-informed sampling always improves on any random method. Lastly, from the point of view of the graphical user interface, we argue that the average user of an online bilingual dictionary is better served with a single search box, rather than separate search boxes for each dictionary side.

J	Lin, DTA				Lin, Debbita Tan Ai			Language and Political Psychology: Can Grammar Influence Electability?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						framing; political communication; grammar; electability; psycholinguistics		Daily, the public is plied with political messages from various sources and millions are invested in campaign ads each election year. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the influence of linguistic details in such messages on attitudes about political candidates, especially within the context of Malaysia. The present study is grounded within the structure of framing and grammar, and suggests that grammar can influence attitudes towards a candidate's electability. The study involved 387 male and female Malaysian university students (19- to 25-year-olds) of various ethnicities. The researcher designed two comprehensive questionnaires based on Fausey and Matlock's (2011) work. Participants were randomly assigned Version A (n=192) or Version B (n=195) of the questionnaire. Both versions were about the conduct of Members of Parliament, unnamed and without party labels, to avoid bias about actual politicians. The conduct or actions were of negative and positive valence; Version A was framed using the imperfective form ['was verb + ing'] and employed the modal verb 'must', whereas Version B was framed using the perfective form ['verb + ed'] and employed the modal verb 'have to'. Primarily, results revealed that imperfective descriptions of negative actions resulted in negative responses to the re-election of a candidate. However, the participants were largely insensitive to grammatical alteration when judging a candidate's past positive actions. The results on modality demonstrated a preference for the modal verb 'must' which carries more "emotional value" than 'have to'. The present study is novel in that it covers the dimension of modality (which has never been explored in previous studies) and that to date, there is no available research similar to it in the Malaysian context.

Scripts are a set of graphical representations used to express a particular writing system as well as subsets belonging to a particular writing system. The writing styles of more than one script family may then be adopted by one language, such as in the cases where the old Malay language (Jawi) adopts the Arabic script while the modern one adopts the Roman script. The seven major scripts used in this research are in handwritten style including Arabic, Devanagari, Hebrew, Thai, Greek, Cyrillic and Korean. Automatic Multi-lingual Script Recognition (AMSR) is one of the main challenges in DIAR domain. Currently, only few attempts have been made for automated script identification of off-line handwritten documents images. Most available AMSR applications only deal with printed documents and script types, and they neglect handwritten and multilingual documents. The objective of this study is to propose a multi-lingual AMSR framework. The research methodology consists of a proposed multilingual AMSR framework. The multilingual AMSR framework is tested on Multilingual-HW datasets, which contains more than seven international unconstraint handwritten scripts, using Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix and Local Binary Pattern. The average accuracy of both methods is about 97.01% and 85.29% respectively. This proposed multilingual AMSR is hoped to be beneficial to a group of community which requires automatic sorting multilingual documents. This research can also be extended to document forensic area or international relations agency to identify unknown native document.

However, previous studies have reported learners' problems during corpus consultation. Corpus consultation refers to learning activities in which a group of learners explore concordance lines in a corpus as to observe language patterns. It is assumed that the integration of group work into corpus consultation tends to facilitate the learning process. The study therefore investigated the effects of cooperative corpus consultation on the acquisition of L2 English adjective + preposition collocations. The participants were 74 first-year Thai undergraduate students divided into a control and an experimental group with 38 and 36 learners, respectively. The instruments were corpus-based materials and activities covering both paper-based and online activities, a pre-test and a post-test. While the control group consulted the corpus individually, the experimental group employed the cooperative corpus consultation approach before both groups took the post-test. The statistical results showed a significant difference in the pre-test and the post-test results of the experimental group, in both production and perception of the targeted collocations. The findings suggested that cooperative corpus consultation could promote discussion and cooperation in the experimental group, resulting in the acquisition of the adjective + preposition collocations.

J	Zahid, I; Hashim, N				Zahid, Indirawati; Hashim, Nasihah			Strategies and Structures of Malay Politeness in Criticism on Mentor: A Reality Television Programme	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						strategies; structure; politeness; Malay politeness; criticism	FACE	Criticism is often labelled as a negative comment. However, it can also be treated as a positive comment. The word 'criticism' has broad meanings, such as review. In Malay culture, criticisms are presented in various ways by using certain strategies and structures. The purpose of criticism is to achieve an objective. This can be seen in the criticism given in Mentor; a reality television programme. The data of this criticism will be analyzed by applying Brown and Levinson (1987) and Asmah (2000) theories. The combinations of these two theories are based on the concept of face and personal honour. These formed patterns of politeness strategies from Malay perspectives. The strategy patterns will be structured in the Sandwich technique (Davies & Jacobs, 1985). This study used data from Mentor seasons 1, 2 and 5. Data were downloaded, transcribed and text analysis was conducted on the texts. Utterances from fixed juries, recurring juries and invited juries were analysed and grouped into strategy patterns of politeness. The findings of the analysis show that all the juries tends to use patterns of strategies (on record baldly) + (with redressive action positive politeness) + (with redressive action negative politeness), (BTP)+(BPKP)+(BPKN) with G3 and G1 Malay politeness; with a positive criticism flanking the negative criticism. This proves that while conveying criticism, Malay speakers are still concerned about politeness in communication.

Since the abolishment of English for Teaching Mathematics and Science policy (PPSMI), the Ministry of Education has introduced an initiative named the Dual-Language Programme (DLP) in 2016. This study aims to identify the level of readiness and confidence among the students in this programme. In tandem, it also aims to discover the difference in the level of readiness between Form One and Form Two DLP students as well as gender influence. Respondents were 145 DLP students comprising 80 Form One and 65 Form Two students. This study employed five-point Likert scale questionnaire as the instrument and open-ended questions to validate the findings. From the data analysis generated by SPSS 19, the level of readiness and confidence among the DLP students was moderate. The findings further revealed that there was no significant difference concerned between the variables, class and gender. English language mastery was found to be one of the main factors influencing the students' readiness towards this programme. To sum up, the DLP is a positive move put forward by the government aimed at valorising the standard of English among the students via the learning of Science and Mathematics.

J	Zainuddin, SZ; Shaari, AH				Zainuddin, Siti Zaidah; Shaari, Azianura Hani			Contextual Layers in the Establishment of Research Niche in Doctoral Thesis Introductions by Malaysian Writers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						doctoral thesis introductions; genre analysis; establishing niche; ESL; discourse community	ENGLISH	One of the key moves in thesis introductions in terms of Swales's CARS is Move 2: Establishing the Niche. It is where researchers provide the justifications of the study after introducing the general area of the research. However, research findings of prior work have focused on thesis introductions which relates to how texts are constructed and organised in systematic ways in terms of Swales's (1990) CARS moves and steps, and how these two organisational elements assist in achieving the overall purpose of the genre. These move analysis studies of Introductions do not examine and explain why each move and step are written the way they are through the lens of various contextual layers. The current study views genre through the Contrastive Rhetoric (CR) lens in looking at context as multilayered. The study examines how different levels of context influence how eight ESL Malaysian writers establish their research niche. Adopting the functional-semantic approach to analysis, it can be concluded that apart from the multi-layered discourse community of their academic setting, the socio-cultural and socio-political contexts have a significant effect on the establishments of the writers' research niche.

The unquestionable presence of computers in all aspects of human life and the inner desire of human beings to enjoy learning through the use of computer educational games prompt the integration of computer-based games in EFL teaching and learning environments. This study investigated the effect of computer educational games on Iranian elementary learners' grammar and vocabulary gain. A total of 58 female, who were selected out of 80 elementary institute EFL learners participated in the study. Their age range is between 13-15 one experimental and one control group took part in this study. The study followed a quasi-experimental pre-and post-test design. In order to compare the results of their performance, an independent samples t-test was conducted. In comparing the pre-test and post-test scores, the results demonstrated no significant differences between the experimental and control groups. However, the involvement of all learners, their enthusiasm to use the new technology in language learning and learners' positive attitudes toward learning was apparent in the experimental group. The presence of such a high motivation among the learners in experimental group could contribute to their active involvement in the process of learning. This implies that computers have a significant role in motivating learners' involvement in the learning process.

J	Tahir, UMM				Tahir, Ungku Maimunah Mohd			When A Feminist Theory Is Decidedly Superfluous: A Case Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						feminism; feminist; story; knowledge; persuratan baru		Malay critics largely favour Western literary theories as analytical frameworks of choice to deconstruct Malay novels. Feminist theories are often a favourite particularly among Malay women literary critics, among whom Associate Prof. Dr Siti Hajar Che Man ranks as one of their more consistent users. In two working papers, Siti Hajar uses a feminist theory to analyse Azizi Haji Abdullah's Harga sebuah maruah, a wining entry of the novel-writing competition to commemorate Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka's golden jubilee celebration in 2007. According to Siti Hajar, Harga sebuah maruah sees Azizi dismantling the patriarchal cocoon to free his woman protagonist, Cah, then centre-stage and empower her, and in so doing effect a paradigm shift in Malay literature. This article uses as its analytical framework several main ideas of persuratan baru, which make a distinction between knowledge and story and emphasise discourse as the vehicle to body forth knowledge. It examines the two working papers to determine whether a feminist theory is called for, and whether the findings thus reached are academically sound. This article argues that the use of a feminist theory is decidedly superfluous, while the findings are academically untenable	[Tahir, Ungku Maimunah Mohd] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Alam dan Tamadun Melayu ATMA, Bangi, Malaysia	Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia	Tahir, UMM (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Alam dan Tamadun Melayu ATMA, Bangi, Malaysia.	ungkumaimunah@yahoo.com						Abdullah Azizi Haji, 2007, HARGA SEBUAH MARUAH; Al-Karim Al-Qur'an, 2008, TERJEMAHAN SA BASMEI; [Anonymous], 2005, DEWAN SASTERA    MEI; Bakar Kesumawati A, 2005, GEMA ONLINE J LANGUA, V5, P1; Hashim Ruzy Suliza, 2010, KUNAPIPPI, VXXXII, P67; Hassan Mohd.

In keeping with this trend in using blogs for reflection, first year law undergraduates who are required to take a course in English for Law had to write a reflective journal to allow students to reflect on their learning and record their responses to what they have learnt. This paper was based on an action research study to investigate the extent to which blog writing facilitates students' reflection and the effectiveness of teacher input to enhance their reflection. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to collect data. Two questionnaires were used to collect data on students' response and experience on blog writing to facilitate reflection and effectiveness of teacher input. Blog postings were also collected and analysed for instances of reflection. The findings indicated that blog writing enhances and facilitates students' reflection and that introducing a model of reflection enhanced the quality of reflection in students' entries to a great extent. Blogs have proven to be useful platforms for students to reflect on their learning although students need much guidance on how to better structure their reflections	[Krishnaiyer, Sithaletchemy S.; Mushahar, Raja Hanani Raja; Ahmad, NuretnaAsurah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia	Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia	Krishnaiyer, SS (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia.	sitha@ukm.my; rhrm@ukm.my; etna@ukm.my						Abu Bakar Nadzrah, 2005, THESIS; Arena C, 2008, TESL EJ, V11; Bakar N.

J	Wang, XM				Wang Xiaomei			Emergent Grammatical Structures of Bahasa Pasar: Based on Hakka-Malay and Cantonese-Malay Glossaries	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						bahasa pasar; language contact; Hakka; Cantonese; Zheng Ke Yin Yi Yi Mu Lai You Hua; Ma La Yu Yue Yin Yi Yi		The Malay language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. It is the mother tongue of the Malay ethnic group and the second language of the Chinese and Tamil ethnic groups in Malaysia (Asmah 1976). Since the mass migration of the Chinese from China to Malaysia in the 19th century, a colloquial form of Malay, Bahasa Pasar, has come into being with the contact of Malay and Chinese language. Various text books on colloquial Malay were published to meet the needs of communication between the local residents and migrants. However, the research on Bahasa Pasar from the perspective of language contact is still not adequate. This paper aims to describe the grammatical features of Bahasa Pasar based on two glossaries published one century ago, Ma La Yu Yue Yin Yi Yi (1890/ 1912) and Zheng Ke Yin Yi Yi Mu Lai You Hua (1909/ 1926). Four grammatical structures emergent from the two glossaries will be analyzed, the nominal structure, verb-object structure, yes-no question, and passive structure. The analysis shows that Bahasa Pasar adopts many grammatical features of Chinese dialects. This result indicates that language contact has induced a new variety of Malay, which has syntactic features transferred from Chinese dialects.

J	Ahmad, Z; Jalaluddin, NH; Malek, S				Ahmad, Zaharani; Jalaluddin, Nor; Malek, Shariffulizan			The Phonology Of Vowel Sequences And The Diversity Of Malay Dialects: An Optimality Theoretic Account	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						vowel clusters; constraint ranking; diphtongization; ambisyllabification; vowel coalescence		This paper discusses the phonology of vowel sequences in four major dialects of Malay, namely Johor dialect, Kedah dialect, Perak dialect and Kelantan dialect. The present study utilizes secondary data cited from previous works (Asmah Haji Omar, 1985; Raja Mukhtaruddin, 1986; Ajid Che Kob, 1984; Teoh Boon Seong, 1994). The phonological analysis proposed in this study is set within the constraint-based approach of optimality theory (Prince & Smolensky, 2004; McCarthy, 2008). It is apparent that all these dialects generally disfavor the occurrence of vowel sequences in the surface representation as they incur onset violation. In the ruled-based approach, underlying vowel sequences are resolved by phonological processes, such as V-deletion, V-coalescence, diphtongization, and ambisyllabification. Each dialect employs different strategy in resolving the sequences, which consequently gives forth dialectal variation in the language. In the constrained-based approach of optimality theory, phonological variation in the Malay dialects is analyzed as the result of satisfying and violating of the universal wellformedness constraints, and each dialect is imposing a particular ranking on those universal constraints. The following constraints, namely *COMPLEX, *VC], CONTIGUITY and WRD >= FOOT are highly ranked and unviolable in the dialects. The constraints that can be violated are ONSET, UNIFORMITY, INTEGRITY, MAX-IO, *CODA, and these constraints are ranked differently in each dialect.

J	Seong, GS				Seong, Goh Sang			The Translation Of Verbs From Chinese Into Malay: An Analysis On Accuracy Of The Equivalences Meaning	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						translation; semantic meaning; componential analysis; verbs; thematic		This article discusses the studies on verb-equivalence in the translation of Chinese- Malay anthology of short stories which is entitled Selected Short Stories of Mahua III: Dalam Hujan Renyai. The objective of this study is to examine the accuracy of the meaning of verbs. Ten (10) Chinese verbs, which comprise one hundred and twenty six (126) different Malay equivalences from the translations of six (6) short stories by the six (6) translators of the short stories, serve as the data for the study. This study utilises a number of theories, which have been identified eclectically i.e. the translation approaches on word equivalence by Newmark (1981), the semantic theories of Kempson (1977), Chierchia & McConnell (1990) on the meaning of verbs, the Componential Analysis of Meaning by Nida (1975) on the inherent and compositional meaning of arguments as well as on the contextual meaning, the classification of verbs according to semantic meaning by Li Kong Zhi (1998), and the defination of meaning by Lyons (1977). This study shows that 'one versus several' equivalences do exist in translating Chinese verbs into Malay. Such phenomena cause various types of equivalances i.e., accurate translation, over translation, under translation, inaccurate translation and ambiguous translation. It appears that the semantic meaning of a verb will determine the choices of its equivalence. This is followed by the appropriateness of the word equivalence towards the emic of the target language as well as by the contextual meaning.

J	Pillai, S				Pillai, Shanthini			Essentialism And The Diasporic Native Informant: Malaysia In Hsu Ming Teo's Love And Vertigo	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						diaspora; multiculturalism; native informant; Malaysian Chinese; ethnicity		Hsu Ming Teo's (2000) novel Love and Vertigo oscillates between three countries, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia. Though Teo is seen to be affiliated with Malaysia, and certainly appraised as articulating her ethnic history with clarity of creative and artistic skill, the image of Malaysia that she shapes come to the fore as a remembered reality, through the glimpses caught from the morsels of both memory and filial visits to this estranged home/ancestral land. The most significant issue that resides at the heart of such writings is the repudiation of the Chinese community by the Malays in Malaysia. The images of Malaysia in the novel are fleeting, yet when they do appear they seem to be the most macabre amongst the spectres of the past that haunt the main protagonist, Grace. This article discusses the almost ghostly role that Malaysia plays in the novel and argues that the cultural memory of the older country lies entombed with the ghost of the 1969 racial riots. It concludes that when writings by diasporic native informants such as Teo and others around the globe are taken to be authentic renditions of ethnic heritage as part of multicultural politics in the cosmopolitan, the implications of these are highly serious as they are largely constructions of decidedly essentialist discourses of the older country.

J	Jalaluddin, NH; Syah, AH				Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah; Syah, Ahmad Harith			The Prefix peN-In Malay: A Bridging Cross Reference Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						prefix; bridging cross reference; atribute; reference assignment		Many Malay grammarians describe the semantic of peN- based on its structure and functions. Za'ba ( 1965), Asmah ( 1993), Nik Safiah et al. ( 1993), Abdullah and Liaw ( 1994) and few others agreed that the prefix peN- semantically refers to as an agent and instrument. Some grammarians noted that the prefix peN- as a patient, habitual manner and abstract marker. For instance, petani (farmer) is an agent, perokok (smoker) is habitual, pemarah (bad tempered) is an abstract, penimbang (scale) is a measurement and so on. It is apparent that the description on peN- seems to be quite broad and overlapping and this can lead to ambiguity in meaning. Based on 5 million DBP-UKM data bank, peN and its concordance are extracted for analysis. Relevance theory that focuses on communication and cognition with reference assignment as one of its traits can offer a better description on peN-. In reference assignment, bridging cross reference ( BCR) which allows the dependent on context in utterances facilitate the hearer to determine the intended meaning. 'Pemakan sayur' ( vegetarian) and 'perosak bahasa' (language corrupter) need no modifier to determine that they are referring to human, as opposed to 'burung pemakan bangkai' - (carnivorous bird) and serangga perosak ( destructive insects). The latter needs a modifier such as 'burung' (bird) and 'serangga' (insect) to show that it is non-human. In sum, with BCR we are able to differenciate the prefix peN- either referring to human and non human based on context and attributes.

J	Sandaran, SC; Selvaraj, S				Sandaran, S. C.; Selvaraj, S.			Government Agencies and their Discourses of Flood Disaster Preparedness: Impact on Response, Action and Community Empowerment	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Representation of Social Actors and Social Action; Discourse; Flood Disaster Mitigation and Management; Government; Community Based Disaster Preparedness		One of the severe global threats facing the world today is flooding. Similarly, Malaysia is faced with monsoon and flash floods which are the most severe "climate-related natural disasters" for the country. The Malaysian government is the main stakeholder and provider of aid in every stage of disaster. Consequently, the involvement of flood risk communities is said to be minimal and overlooked. Researchers have also stated that there is still a lack of research on human involvement and response. Thus, addressing these gaps, we take on a social constructionist view to situate flood disaster as a social practice and discourse to investigate how government officials 'talk' about their involvement in flood disaster mitigation and management. Our analysis is based on the perspective that their 'talk' evokes specific disaster discourses which relate to the different ways of understanding flood disaster, and that these discourses in turn shape and impact their response and action for flood mitigation and management as well as community empowerment. To this end, we adopt Van Leeuwen's representation of social actors and social action framework to identify the disaster discourses drawn upon by the officials. The findings show that government officials employ various discourses that draw on the 'traditional framework of relief and rehabilitation' and a 'top-down government centric approach' that focus less on community empowerment. We see a need for the inclusion of a 'discourse of shared responsibility' that is part of a 'proactive approach', and sees all parties as partners, and in particular, flood risk communities.

Political speeches are a medium through which ideas and ideologies are communicated through language use for the sake of the listener's understanding. The success of delivering a political speech depends on the use of persuasive arguments. This study presents an analysis of the use of speech acts as an effective argumentative strategy. Its two objectives are to compare the use of speech acts in two different situations, and to explain the results obtained from the comparison. The data of the study comprise two keynote addresses by Zahid Hamidi. The first is the keynote at the 2017 UMNO General Assembly before the 14th General Election (PRU14) in 2017, and the second is his keynote address at the 2018 UMNO General Assembly, after the party's defeat in PRU14. The analysis used qualitative method, adopting Bach and Harnish's (1979) theoretical framework. Overall findings show Zahid Hamidi used constatives, directives, commissives and acknowledgements in his speeches. Constatives and directives were specifically utilised to influence and convince the audience of his arguments more in his 2017 speech than in the 2018 one. After PRU14, Zahid used more of commissives and acknowledgments. Commissives stand at 10.3% in the 2018 speech, compared to 4.5% in 2017 and acknowledgements is at 9.3% in 2018 compared to 5.4% in 2017. The change in use of the speech acts across the two years suggests that Zahid has had to adjust his use of words and language to fit in with the 2018 socio-political scenario. The results show that socio-political scenario clearly has an impact on the type of speech acts used in politicians' speeches. The findings also send a message to politicians that their speeches should contain speech acts appropriate to the current scenario, which can be understood clearly by their supporters.

J	Abubakar, S; Yaapar, MS; Muhammad, S				Abubakar, Sadiya; Yaapar, Md. Salleh; Muhammad, Suzana			(Un)reading Orientalism in Sherry Jones' The Jewel of Medina	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Orientalism; Childbride; Islamophobia; The Jewel of Medina; Contrapuntal reading		Oriental representations of Muslims are often manifested in a society's media, literature, theatre and other creative means of expression. However, these representations, which are often historically and conceptually one-sided, have adverse repercussions for Muslims today, potentially leading to Islamophobia. Orientalism of Muslims in Western writings and discourses have been much discussed, debated and disproved, yet some works of literature continue to disseminate many of the earlier Oriental assertions about Islam/Muslims: that of being terrorists, misogynists, barbaric or uncivilized compared to the civilized West. Sherry Jones' The Jewel of Medina (2008) chronicles the history of Islam from the time of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, through the voice of his youngest wife Aisha. This paper argues that there is more to the image of the Muslim than what is portrayed by Western writers. Through an "(un)reading" of Sherry Jones' text, this paper unravels the misconceptions regarding early and forced marriage with a view to address the ways in which these misconceptions could lead to Islamophobia. Using Edward Said's theory of Contrapuntal reading, which urges the colonized to unread Western canonical texts to unearth the submerged details, this paper identifies and puts to question non-conforming depictions of Muslims in Sherry Jones' The Jewel of Medina (2008) while placing the text in its historical space-in an effort to mitigate the growing stereotyping of Muslims and to address misconceptions with regard to Islamic history.

J	Sulaiman, MZ; Wilson, R				Sulaiman, M. Zain; Wilson, Rita			Translating Adventure Tourism: From Action to Relaxation	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						tourism translation; tourism promotional materials; cultural conceptualisation; English-Malay translation; advertising translation; adventure tourism discourse	EXPERIENCES; HERITAGE	Adventure tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors in the tourism industry and, therefore, one of the most important categories marketed and promoted globally. However, the way adventure tourism is represented and perceived differs markedly from one culture to another. Based on how tourism is conceptualised in a particular culture, themes are carefully selected and exploited in promoting 'adventure' tourism. The differences in how tourism is conceptualised across cultures pose a key challenge for translators of tourism promotional materials (TPMs), whose role is to produce an effective translation in the target language and culture. Translating TPMs effectively for different cultures often requires changes and adjustments to be made in order to preserve the most vital aspect of TPMs, that is, their functionality. This paper explores the challenges involved in translating English TPMs into Malay and investigates the extent to which the action theme of adventure employed to lure Anglophone tourists is compatible with Malay culture. Three types of textual analysis are carried out: source text analysis, parallel text analysis and target text analysis. The textual analyses are then complemented by findings derived from focus groups. The findings of the study demonstrate how adventure tourism is conceptualised within the notion of action in the Anglo culture, and how this contrasts with the way it is framed within the notion of relaxation in Malay culture. Based on the findings derived from the textual analyses and focus groups, we conclude by proposing potential strategies for the production of functionally adequate translations, which take into consideration the cultural conceptualisation of the target culture.

J	Osman, WRHM; Wahab, HA				Osman, Wan Robiah Hj. Meor; Wahab, Hamidah Abdul			Language Courteousness Among Counsellor Trainees in Counseling Sessions	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Polite language; counselling; trainee counselors; speaking strategy; culture		Language politeness, in general, refers to the use of polite language in oral communication. It is important for interaction between individuals to establish good impression and relationship. Often, it is also associated with the culture of a society. In a counselling session, the main objective is to guide the clients to solve problems that they experience. Therefore, speaking courteously in a counseling session is important to create good and comfortable relationship between the counselor or the trainee counselor with their clients. Hence, this study investigates whether the act of speaking courteously is present in the interaction between trainee counselors and their clients by applying the politeness principle (Leech, 1983). This study utilizes data from 30 trainee counsellors from UNIMAS counseling program that was collected by recording and transcribing the conversation between the trainees and their clients. The result from this study indicated that the six maxims; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty, agreement, and sympathy, as proposed by Leech (1983) were applied by UNIMAS trainee counsellors in the counseling sessions. The presence of the six maxims based on Leech's politeness principle showed that the use of language politeness is an important strategy in speaking to create a comfortable environment between the trainee counselors and their clients. Therefore, the use of language politeness in a counselling session is one of the strategies in speaking that needs to be given specific attention by counselors or trainee counselors to ensure the goal of guiding and solving the clients' problems can be dealt well and effectively.

J	Haroon, H; Daud, NS				Haroon, Haslina; Daud, Nurul Syafiqah			The Translation of Foreign Words in an English Novel into Malay	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						language appropriation; Khaled Hosseini; literary translation; translation strategies; translation procedures	FILM; L3	One aspect of language appropriation is the inclusion of foreign words in an English text with the aim of highlighting certain aspects of a culture. This results in a text in which the dominant language, English, is interspersed with foreign words. In the context of translation studies, this phenomenon raises the question of how these foreign words are dealt with when the text is translated. This paper aims to examine this issue by analysing the translation into Malay of foreign words in the English novel by Khaled Hosseini entitled A Thousand Splendid Suns. More specifically, the aim is to determine the translation procedures and the translation strategy used. Foreign words in the English text are first identified and then mapped to their translations in the Malay text. Using Pedersen's (2011) taxonomy of strategies in rendering cultural references, the word pairs are analysed in order to determine the translation procedures used. The analysis reveals a total of 174 foreign words in Hosseini's English novel. The mapping of these foreign words to their target language equivalents shows that the procedure used most frequently is retention. In addition, the procedures of retention and specification make up approximately 70 per cent of the procedures used. This in turn points to the adoption of a source-oriented strategy in translating the text. The findings suggest that the translator places priority on faithfulness to the source text; however, measures are also taken by the translator to ensure the comprehensibility of the translation for the target readers.

J	Majid, AA				Majid, Amrah Abdul			Reading the Hijab as a Marker of Faith in Randa Abdel-Fattah's Does My Head Look Big in This?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Muslim women writers; the hijab; Randa Abdel-Fattah; Saba Mahmood; Islam		Randa Abdel-Fattah's 2006 novel, Does My Head Look Big in This?, is about a teenage Australian Muslim protagonist who voluntarily chooses to wear the hijab to her elite private school in Melbourne, and the personal and social challenges that she faces after making this decision. In this paper, I suggest that the novel portrays the action of wearing the hijab as mainly apolitical, and that it is instead a spiritual and religious act which demonstrates aspects of the hijab as empowering to an individual's life. This subverts the stereotypical understanding of the hijab, particularly by the West, as either a tool of control and subjugation of Muslim women, or as a stand against Western society and ideology. By using Saba Mahmood's (2005) study of Muslim women piety, which argues that Islam and its practices can be used as a tool for women's empowerment, particularly for achieving self-improvement and self-actualization, this paper pays attention to the representation of the hijab in the novel. The decision to wear the hijab opens a path for the protagonist to become more adherent to her religion, as well as improving her attributes and individuality as a whole. This creates a wholesome young woman who is not only committed to her religion, but is also mindful of her character.

J	Singh, MKM				Singh, Manjet Kaur Mehar			An Emic Perspective on Academic Writing Difficulties among International Graduate Students in Malaysia	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						academic writing practices; academic writing difficulties; international graduate students; Master program; qualitative study	EXPERIENCES; LANGUAGE	The number of international graduate students choosing Malaysia as their destination of study is increasing. These students arrive to Malaysian shores with diverse academic, cultural and linguistic background with the intention of upgrading their academic qualification especially at graduate level. The students are confronted with a mismatch between the literacy practices in their native country and at graduate level currently. This leads to challenges in adapting to the current academic writing practices at graduate level. Academic writing is a productive skill that is pivotal to ensure academic success. However, students for whom English is a foreign language struggle in writing various sections of academic work at graduate level such as the methodology and discussion sections. This qualitative study focuses on academic writing difficulties faced by the non-native English speaking international graduate students while pursuing their Master's degree at a public university in Malaysia. Focus group interview was used on 70 international graduate students from taught Master programs to elicit qualitative data. The main objective of the focus group interviews was to analyze how these students negotiate academic writing from an emic perspective. Through this approach, the students were able to share their own experiences of struggling with academic writing practices in higher education. The findings indicate that non-native English speaking international graduate students faced difficulties coping with academic writing especially in English as a medium of instruction setting. This study highlights the need of host institutions in providing academic support to improve the most crucial literacy skill that contributes to academic success at graduate level.

To achieve this, likert-scale survey questionnaires were distributed to Tahfiz students who are currently studying at higher learning institutions. The selected respondents are those who have studied Arabic language at the Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM) level. This study employs purposive sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to respondents via WhatsApp application using Google form. 109 students from 21 higher learning institutions, locally and abroad, participated in this study. 70.6% of them have memorised 30 juz' of the Qur'an, and a large percentage of them (89%) achieved excellent results in the Arabic examination of Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM). A factor analysis using the Principle Component Method showed validity of the established construct items, while Alpha Cronbach exceeding 0.7 showed the reliability of the items under study. Two factors which are the constructs have been extracted from 15 items presented. The first factor is the importance of Arabic grammar as a memorisation strategy, and the second factor is the importance of Arabic syntax as a motivational factor. Descriptive analysis has showed that Tahfiz students have high perception towards the construct of the importance of Arabic grammar as a motivational factor. As for the importance of Arabic grammar as a memorisation strategy, respondents gave moderate perception. The findings of this study highlights the importance of Arabic grammar as a motivating factor and a memorising strategy in the process of memorising the Qur'an among Tahfiz students.

In this study, the data obtained shows that /up/in word final position realized as [partial derivative?] as found in /tutup/. [n (u) over tilde .t partial derivative?] 'tutup' (close), /hidup/ -> [i.d partial derivative?] 'hidup' (life) and /sangup/ -> [san.g partial derivative?] 'sanggup' (able) and etc. Based on the data shown, vowel /u/lose its [+ high] feature, resulting in the realization of schwa [partial derivative] through the implementation of the vowel reduction rule in the closed final syllable. Segment /p/ meanwhile lose its [+ labial] feature, thus realized as glottal stop [?] due to the glottal formation in the same position in the word. The informants were chosen from among those native speakers of Kerinci. s Semerap dialect in Kampung Batu 23, Sungai Lui, Hulu Langat, Selangor. The data were obtained from literature reviews, observations and interviews. The data were analysed based on the theory of generative phonology introduced by Chomsky and Halle (1968), which was later extended by Roca and Johnson (1999), and Roca (2003). According to the theory of generative phonology, every sound changes occur in one derivation process explained and described step by step using the formalization rules, distinctive features and rule ordering. The results showed that the word ends with the /up/ sound in Kerinci language will be realized as [partial derivative?].

J	Hoomanfard, MH; Meshkat, M				Hoomanfard, Mohammad Hamed; Meshkat, Maryam			Writing on a Computer and Using Paper and Pencil: Is there any Difference in the Internal Cognitive Processes?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						English as a foreign language; writing; cognitive processes; paper and pencil writing; computerized writing		The present study attempted to unveil the differences in the cognitive processes employed in writing in a second language while writing on computer, and with paper and pencil. In doing so, eleven upper-intermediate, Persian-speaking English Language learners wrote texts in response to two International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing tasks on computer and with paper and pencil. The Cognitive Processes Questionnaire (Weir, et al., 2007) and stimulated recall interviews were employed to collect data. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the collected data indicated that the participants spent less time on pre-writing planning, in the computerized condition, but they paused more often during the writing process for online planning. Furthermore, the participants, in both conditions, spent less time for planning when they wanted to write examples pertinent to their own life experience. The participants, in the computerized writing, tended to evaluate and review the text during the process writing, while in the paper and pencil condition, the evaluation was postponed to the end of the writing process. Longer text revision and a higher number of the rearrangements of sentences and ideas were other features of computerized writing. These findings along with those of other studies can deepen our understanding of second language writing cognitive processes which can benefit second language teachers, curriculum developers, and test developers.

J	Ramachandran, I; Hashim, RS				Ramachandran, Indrani; Hashim, Ruzy Suliza			Revalorising Paraiyar Ethnic Identity through Literary Writings	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						paraiyar; dalit; untouchability; rituals; pollution		The present genre of Indian literary writings on untouchability encompasses fictional or semiautobiographical narratives produced by writers who are mostly untouchables themselves, and the more widely-accepted of such writings are those that solely focus on the oppression of the untouchable community. In the process of privileging oppression, these writers often fail to provide a balanced portrayal of the community's ethnic characteristics. The key concerns of this paper, therefore, are to analyse the motivation of untouchable writers who choose to stereotype their people as "the victimized other", and to bring to the forefront works of writers who have made conscious efforts to infuse aspects of ethnicity, culture and rituals into their writings. This paper analyses two short stories on untouchability written in Tamil and translated into English, The Binding Vow (2009/2012) by Imayam, and Eardrum (2000/2012) by Azhakiya Periyavan, with the aim of investigating the writers. stand on the ethnic and ritualistic culture of their people. The findings of this study reveal that the writers. privileging of oppression over ethnic issues reflects a strong influence of Dalit ideologies, and that despite such a pattern, there are those who continue to employ culture and rituals as tools to empower their people. The study also implies that the ethnicity and rituals of the untouchable community deserve equal attention as the portrayal of oppression in Indian literary writings on untouchability, and that by privileging oppression, writers are misleading their people into abandoning and rejecting their true ethnic and cultural identity.

J	Daud, N; Pisal, NA				Daud, Nadwah; Pisal, Nadhilah Abdul			Speaking Problems in Arabic as a Second Language	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						single demand task; dual demand task; planning; contextual support; speaking fluency	SELF-EFFICACY; STUDENTS	The study was carried out on a number of students who attended the Arabic Language speaking skill course (LQS 0415) offered by the CELPAD (Centre for Languages & PreUniversity Acadamic Development), IIUM, Gombak, to those majoring in Islamic Studies and Arabic Language (IRKHS) only. The course was expected to help students improve their academic performance by mastering communication skill in the language. However, it was found that 70% of the students were unable to participate effectively in class discussions due to poor speaking skill. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to identify students' problems in speaking with Arabic, focusing on the students themselves by looking into difficulties faced by them while performing speaking tasks. The methods employed are observation and interviews. Three speaking tasks, which were single and dual demand, were assigned to the students. The tasks were acting out situations, retelling and sharing of experiences. Each task, either with context support or without it, has different levels of difficulty. The study found that language difficulties might hinder the students' ability in speaking skill activities. Students found themselves with more problems while performing individual tasks because they need to be independent. Lack of vocabulary also may disrupt the fluency of speech during presentation. Having identified the students. problems in speaking, teachers are encouraged to have learning activities which focus on vocabulary usage as well as expanding the usage of vocabularies, with an emphasis on group activities. Promoting communication in Arabic within the group itself while performing such activities must also be encouraged. Group activities provided the opportunity for students to overcome communication problems encountered with their peer. s help. The findings show that group activity also presents language situations which can stimulate the use of the learned language.

J	Marzuki, E				Marzuki, Ernisa			Linguistic Features in SMS Apologies by Malay Native Speakers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						SMS/text messages; linguistic features; Malay NS; apology; pragmalinguistic		The emergence of communication channels such as the Short Message Service (SMS) gives rise to a different variety of language use, also known as textism. Textism is viewed as a hybrid form of communication as it merges the forms of both spoken and written language. Textism features are arguably part of the pragmalinguistic domain, which looks at the selection of strategies which can be applied in conveying illocutions. This study sheds some light on the pragmalinguistic conventions reflected in apologies conducted via SMS or text messages. Twenty six Malay native speakers responded to Written Discourse Completion Tasks (WDCT) via SMS. The WDCTs were categorised into two levels of offence which required the participants to apologise by texting their apologies. Data were categorised and coded based on adapted versions of coding schemes by Supyan (2006) and Crystal (2008). The results indicated that there were three significant variations in the SMS linguistic features used by the Malay Native Speakers (Malay NS) when apologising via SMS in their first language, Malay, and their second language, English. Differences were also identified when the apologies were sent because of more serious transgressions compared to when they were sent because of less serious offences. The findings suggests that the first language contribute to these differences in the selection of textual features when the participants texted their apologies.

J	Othman, J; Nordin, AB				Othman, Juliana; Nordin, Abu Bakar			MUET As A Predictor Of Academic Achievement In ESL Teacher Education	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						MUET; English language testing; predictor; academic achievement; correlation	LANGUAGE; ENGLISH	One of the indicators of English language proficiency used by Malaysian public universities is the Malaysian University English Test (MUET). This study seeks to examine whether MUET is an accurate predictor of academic performance of a group of English teacher education students. The participants for this study consisted of 111 first and second year students who were enrolled in a B. Ed Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL) program at a local public university. A general linear multivariate regression was conducted using the SPSS for the overall score of the MUET together with their scores on each of the test components and the students CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). The analysis was carried out to identify important predictors of academic achievement by correlating each of the independent predictor variables with each other as well as with the academic achievement criterion. The results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that reading and listening components were significant predictors of students' academic achievement. These findings seem to indicate that the different components of the MUET can be used to predict students' academic performance more accurately than the overall MUET score itself. However, there is a need for continuing predictive validity studies in different contexts. Context specific studies are important as they provide empirical evidence and contribute to an increasing literature on the relevance of MUET in higher education settings	[Othman, Juliana; Nordin, Abu Bakar] Univ Malaya, Fac Educ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia	Universiti Malaya	Othman, J (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Educ, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	juliana@um.edu.my; a_bakarnordin@um.edu.my	Othman, Juliana/B-8724-2010	Othman, Juliana/0000-0001-5151-099X	University Malaya Short Term Grant [FS347/2008C]	University Malaya Short Term Grant	The authors would like to thank University Malaya for sponsoring this research under the University Malaya Short Term Grant FS347/2008C.

J	Abu-Asba, A; Azman, H; Mustaffa, R				Abu-Asba, Angela; Azman, Hazita; Mustaffa, Rosniah			Learning Styles Of Yemeni Undergraduate Science Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						learning styles; learning preferences; science students; perceptual learning style preference; academic literacy		The aim of this paper is to investigate the preferred learning styles of 179 Yemeni students studying science at the Faculty of Science, Sana'a University, Yemen in response to a need for improving the learning of science among Yemeni students. A learning style refers to the ways of learning that include how learners perceive, interact with and respond to the learning environment. This paper applies Reid's (1995) taxonomy of six learning style preferences: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, tactile, group, and individual styles to classify the styles of the students in this study. Data was collected through questionnaires, interviews, observation checklists, and field notes. The questionnaire data was coded and analyzed using the SPSS program while the interview data was transcribed, organized, coded, categorized, and analyzed. The findings show that the tactile and kinesthetic styles were the most prevalent styles among the students, followed by the auditory style. This has pedagogical implications for the teaching of science in Yemen.

J	Ismail, SAA				Ismail, Sadiq Abdulwahed Ahmed			ESP Students' Views Of ESL Grammar Learning	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						language; learning; grammar; perceptions; education.		Grammar has always been viewed as playing an essential role in the success or failure of formal communication. This research will show that grammar education should be 'descriptive' rather than 'prescriptive' in order to offer students a set of choices to make them effective speakers and writers. The main objective of this study was twofold. First, it focused on students' views about a new grammar model that includes four stages: confrontation, clarification, confirmation and consolidation (CCCC) and students' perceptions regarding grammar learning in general. Second, it investigated the recurrent patterns of interaction during the process of learning grammar within the framework of the model. The subjects of this study were forty female students from three ESP for education classes in the UAE University. Three research instruments (a questionnaire, classroom observation notes and semi- structured interviews) were employed to establish data triangulation and to attain validity. The results from the collective data demonstrated that students had positive views about the use of the CCCC grammar model. Another crucial result highlighted the students' beliefs about the positive influence of explicit grammar teaching on learning the conventions of sentences and utterances. Finally, the study concluded with recommendations to direct future research.

J	Ho, V				Ho, Victor			Constructing Identities In The Workplace Through Request E-Mail Discourse - How Does One Benefit From It?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						workplace identity; systemic functional linguistics; transitivity; mood and modality; appraisal	MODALITY; INTERNET; ENGLISH; EMAIL	This paper discusses the construction of personal identities through the request e-mail discourse by a group of professional English language teachers of a public education institution in Hong Kong. Facing the downsizing of the civil service, the revised appraisal system, and the tighter budget of the Hong Kong SAR government following the Asian financial crisis, teachers working in Hong Kong public schools have less chances of getting promotion and pay rises. To put themselves in an advantageous position in relation to get a promotion and a pay rise, as argued in this paper, the teachers constructed two personal identities online before their peers and superiors in their workplace. A total of 50 e-mails met the two criteria that follow and formed the corpus of the present study: containing at least one request, and having teachers of the same rank as the author and recipients. The request e-mail discourse is analyzed at the clause level with respect to transitivity, mood and modality by drawing upon systemic functional linguistics. It is found that the teachers, using the resources available in the English language grammar, constructed for themselves the identity of a responsible, hardworking member, and of a member with authority and power. This paper hopes to achieve three aims - (1) to contribute to the understanding of the constitutive effect of discourse; (2) to illustrate how such effect could be manipulated by discourse producers in order to achieve both their communicative and political aims; and (3) to enhance people's e-mail communication competency in the workplace.

Lingua franca in this study refers to a language used to communicate between speakers with different native languages. The language of communication is usually the language often used in everyday life based on language choice theory. In the state of Sarawak, there are many ethnic groups with their own native languages. However, at the same time, they also use a common language of communication which is appropriate, comprehendible and does not raise communication problems. In Sarawak, the language with the highest number of speakers is the Iban language. This is based on the distribution of population in the said state. This research includes a field survey which employs questionnaires and informal interviews. The findings of this research illustrate that the Iban language and Sarawak Malay dialect are chosen as the lingua franca in Sarikei, Sarawak. Iban is used in informal settings while Sarawak Malay is used in formal ones.

Malaysia has acknowledged the importance of proficiency in a third language in order to develop human capital that drives the k-economy as well as competes in the international arena. This study investigated Malaysian students' motivation to learn a foreign language. Triangulation of methods consisting of survey questionnaire, document analysis and focus group discussion were employed for data collection. A survey based on a 16-item questionnaire was formulated and more than 500 students from University Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) responded to the survey. Responses to the survey were subjected to the Rasch and descriptive analyses in order to capture salient features of students' responses. The findings of the study indicate that UKM and UiTM students were extrinsically and intrinsically motivated to learn a foreign language. The results of the t-test, however, indicate a significant difference in terms of the motivation of students from the two universities.

J	Loucky, JP				Loucky, John Paul			When Eastern and Western Language Systems Meet: Crossing the English Vocabulary Threshold Versus Breaking the Kanji Barrier	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article							DEPTH; CHINESE; WORDS	Many lessons can be learned from relevant research in vocabulary- and language-learning strategy training as well as from comparative studies of those learning Oriental languages, which could greatly help language teachers and learners in Kanji-background countries. This article contrasts the minimal threshold levels of vocabulary needed for reading common English text, versus that required for reading basic texts using Kanji characters, whether Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Both mnemonic and Semantic Field Keyword approaches hold great potential for helping such learners from Kanji-block countries by building upon their well-known strengths of rote-memorization, especially of visual images necessary for mastery in reading Kanji-based languages. These areas with a high potential for language learning strategy skill transfer are examined in this study. It compares methods of teaching a Kanji-based language like Japanese to non-natives, with more effective methods for teaching students from Kanji-based countries how to develop better EFL vocabulary and reading skills. Since this is written from an Asian language learners' perspective, the term "Kanji" will be used in a generic sense to mean Chinese characters or language systems based upon them. When not capitalized, "kanji" will refer to specific use of these characters in Chinese, Japanese or Korean.

J	How, C				How, Cherish			A Critical Discourse Study on Meghan and Harry's CBS Primetime Interview	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Ideological square model; critical discourse analysis; narrative inquiry approach; self-other representation; discursive strategies		This study focuses on Meghan and Harry's narratives in the CBS Primetime interview with Oprah Winfrey where they highlighted the issues they faced before moving to America. During the interview, the couple raised several bombshells ranging from the lack of freedom, to Archie's royal title and security, racism, and the lack of support and guidance from the Royal Family, which negatively portrayed the Royal Family and British tabloids. Using van Dijk's ideological square model and its discursive strategies as a framework, this study examines how the Duke and Duchess of Sussex linguistically construct the self-other representations that are evident in their interview via critical discourse analysis and narrative inquiry approach. Findings show that the couple most commonly employed discursive strategies such as victimisation, vagueness, disclaimers, comparisons, evidentiality, hyperbole, history as a lesson, generalisation, pseudo-ignorance, implications, distancing, openness, and polarisation of us versus them. In doing so, they represented themselves as positive, while portraying the British tabloids and the Royal Family as the negative-other. Consequently, the use of language in this interview narrative may legitimise the Duke and Duchess of Sussex while suppress the Royal family and British tabloids. This paper is timely as it is only through in-depth analysis of the linguistic features that we are able to unveil ideological presupposition and biases underlying the interview. It also serves to educate the public that there is always more than one side to a story. Therefore, we should avoid having any biases or ideological presupposition towards anyone in any event before the truth is revealed from both sides.

J	Boginskaya, O				Boginskaya, Olga			Adversarial, Ludic and Ritual Nature of Discursive Interactions in a Trial	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						agonality; courtroom discourse; competition; game; ritual	LEGAL; REPRESENTATION; DISCOURSE; VIOLENCE; FACE	This article makes a contribution to the study of courtroom discourse assuming that interactions in a trial are of agonal nature. The study aims to identify and explore key aspects of agonal interactions (adversarial, ludic and ritual) and rhetorical agonal strategies employed in a trial. The study revealed the following adversary strategies used by the prosecutor and the defense attorney to win the struggle: discrediting, refutation and objection. The components of courtroom interactions such as participants struggling to win, referees overseeing the game and selecting the winner and spectators observing the performance indicate its ludic nature. Rituals as an integral component of both games and competitions ensure fair proceedings, regulate participants' behavior, and organize agonal interactions, being the backbone of courtroom trials. The adversary, ludic and ritual components of agonality determine the nature of courtroom activities whose formal goal is to restore justice, and the actual one is to select the winner. The study concluded that these three components of agonality are interrelated: competition is a sign of game, and ludic elements are an integral characteristic of any competition as a product of culture; both competition and game are regulated by rituals and involve participants pursuing opposing goals.

J	Pung, WC; Ho, AP				Pung, Wun Chiew; Ho, Ai Ping			A Comparative Study on Online Advice-Seeking Strategies between Malaysian and Australian Women	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						women's forum; online advice -seeking; infertility; culture	QUALITY; LIFE; ME	Advice discourse is common in our everyday life. As such, research on advice is diverse and covers advice-related communicative practices such as advice-seeking, advice-giving and reception to advice. Past research on advice has also examined various factors affecting advice -related practices such as the relationship between advice and politeness, gender, and characteristics of interlocutors. Although advice is a much-researched area, comparative studies that attempt to compare advice-seeking strategies in two similar contexts are scarce. The present study seeks to fulfill this gap, hence a comparative study that compares the strategies used by women in Malaysia and Australia when they seek advice on infertility treatment in a Malaysian online forum and in an Australian online forum is carried out. A total of 100 advice-seeking messages from each forum are examined using Locher's (2006) content analysis method that involves analysis of the discursive moves, relational work, and linguistic realisations of moves in the advice-seeking messages. The results show that although there is homogeneity in many aspects in both forums, there are still variations in the women's advice -seeking strategies due to cultural backgrounds, specifically on the frequency and levels of problem disclosure, as well as the use of local slangs and syntax constructions that are typical of their cultural community. The study provides insights about how cultural elements shape one's advice-seeking strategies, subsequently contributing to our understanding of cross-cultural pragmatics.

J	Deckert, M				Deckert, Mikolaj			Spelling Errors in Interlingual Subtitles: Do Viewers Really Mind?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						interlingual subtitling; spelling errors; cognitive processing; audiovisual content; reception	TRANSPORTATION; COMPREHENSION; ENJOYMENT; ADULTS	Our overarching objective is to see how unambiguous deficiencies in interlingual subtitles influence the viewing experience. To that end, we conducted a reception experiment in which participants viewed a foreign language film sample with subtitles which were manipulated across conditions for the number of spelling errors. We find that while viewers succeed in identifying spelling errors in subtitles, the presence of errors nonetheless generally has no effect on a range of viewer experience dimension like cognitive load, enjoyment, comprehension or transportation. What is more, while participants were able to make different subtitle authorship attributions (professional subtitler vs. amateur subtitler) depending on the presence of typos, deficient spelling did not shape the viewer's perception of the subtitler in terms of their estimated amount of experience or their diligence. Critically, the findings also indicate that typos have no effect on translation quality assessment scores which remain high even when there are as many as 20 typos in subtitles for a 14-minute clip. This work therefore offers new insights into translation reception with consequences for the didactic and professional settings. By embedding spelling errors in a dynamic and multimodal context where processing is not self-paced, the study importantly expands our understanding of how spelling errors are received, which has implications beyond translation studies as well.

J	Hadi, NHA; Asl, MP				Hadi, Nurfarah Hadira Abdul; Asl, Moussa Pourya			The Objectifying Gaze: A Lacanian Reading of Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Refugees	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						The Refugees; Lacan; gaze; objectification; Vietnamese American	INTERVIEW	With the recent prevalence of white supremacist discourses in the United States, Asian Americans have unavoidably been subjected to xenophobic gazes and tendencies. The white gaze has traditionally enjoyed the privilege to objectify and fix the diasporic subject both racially and ethnically, foregrounding a relationality that naturalizes the immigrant as the inferior subject. The Vietnamese American writer Viet Thanh Nguyen recounts similar unsettling experiences and sufferings of the Vietnamese (refugees) in his debut short story collection The Refugees (2017). This essay seeks to explore the narratives to outline the patterns of looking dynamics and stratified and interracial gaze operating among the characters. To this end, Lacanian theories of the gaze, the jouissance drive and the mirror stage are employed to examine the subtle nuances and complex mechanisms of looking relations that are instrumental in the development of Vietnamese characters. It is easily noticeable that the growing consciousness among the characters of their prescribed inferior position in the scopic order engenders in them feelings of anxiety and/or conflicting sexual impulses, or the jouissance drive. Nonetheless, the hierarchal gaze is not depicted throughout the collection as an essentialized and fixed phenomenon. Rather, some of the Vietnamese characters succeed to control, recodify and reassert the prevailing structural domination of the looking relations, and hence reclaim their agency and subjectivity in relation to the Other. It is concluded that Nguyen successfully upends the dominant discourses of representations in which the Americans' centrality is eternalized while the Vietnamese' is prescribed and nihilated.

J	Rajandran, K				Rajandran, Kumaran			'A Long Battle Ahead': Malaysian and Singaporean Prime Ministers Employ War Metaphors for COVID-19	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						COVID-19; discourse; politics; metaphor; Malaysia; Singapore	UK; REPRESENTATIONS; COVERAGE; DISEASE	The short article reports a preliminary exploration about how the Prime Ministers of Malaysia and Singapore frame COVID-19 through metaphors. The framing can shape our understanding of the virus. The Prime Ministers gave public broadcasts on or to the media in March, April and May 2020. The analysis of the broadcasts is comprised of metaphor identification using the Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP), and metaphor interpretation. COVID-19 in the Prime Ministers' broadcasts is conceptualized by a few metaphors. The Prime Ministers utilize similar metaphors about the virus because metaphors of direction, journey, liquid and war are noted. COVID-19 IS WAR is selected because war metaphors have been recognized for other diseases and they have been commonly deployed during this pandemic. War metaphors frame several aspects of the virus, which cover its description, impact on multiple areas, the actors involved and their reactions. The war scenario can evoke a sense of alarm regarding the threat and severity of COVID-19.

J	Selmistraitis, L				Selmistraitis, Linas			Semantic Preference, Prosody and Distribution of Synonymous Adjectives in COCA	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Semantic Preference; Semantic Prosody; Collocates; Synonymous Words; COCA	ACADEMIC-WORD-LIST	Synonymous word pairs often become an obstacle on the road to favourable result in composing academic texts because semantic prosody and semantic preference of these words are neglected. The current study examined the concordance lines with synonymous adjectives succinct & concise, coherent & cohesive, precise & accurate in the academic texts of Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) and identified semantics of co-occurring collocates, interchangeability of synonyms and their distribution across nine academic disciplines. The research describes the semantic arrangement of collocations with synonymous pairs of words and encourages persons with academic pursuits rely on corpus data based tools to improve knowledge of semantic prosody and preference of words with similar meanings. The study showed that near synonyms succinct & concise, coherent & cohesive, precise & accurate have different semantic preference and distribution across registers which should be taken into consideration while building collocations with these words. However, semantic prosody tendencies of these synonyms are similar. The analysed synonyms cannot be used interchangeably in all contexts. They are also unevenly scattered across registers. The current study will help to improve learning, teaching, and research of English academic vocabulary in its many contexts.

J	Lulu, RA; Alkaff, SNH				Lulu, Reem A.; Alkaff, Sharifah Nurul Huda			A Cross-Cultural Study of Persuasive Strategies in Relationship Advice Articles in Women's Magazines	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Media; Women's Magazines; Relationship Advice; Culture; Cross-Cultural Analysis	DISCOURSE; ADVERTISEMENTS; SEX	Women's magazines have become the subject of an increasing scholarly exploration as they are widely seen as mirrors of social change in society. They typically cover a variety of topics but one enduring genre is the relationship advice genre. This study presents a cross-cultural analysis of the linguistic constructions of articles in relationship advice columns in women's magazines. We examine the strategies, which are employed by them to persuade the reader to accept the advice given. We also examine the positioning of the implied reader in these texts by the writers of these articles. Data drawn from six English-language women's magazines from three contexts which are, the US, Malaysia and the Middle East, was analysed with reference to the linguistic features used as persuasive strategies by the producers of texts, as investigated by several Discourse Analysis (DA) scholars. The findings of the study reveal that in all three contexts, the writers of advice articles in women's magazines are often seen in a 'balancing act' as they set themselves up as experts while at the same time constructing themselves as a friend of the reader. However, we also found evidence of differences in how the reader is positioned as well as the strategies of persuasion used in the different contexts which we believe is attributed to the differences in the cultural norms and values of the respective societies.

J	Smirnova, A; Tolochin, I				Smirnova, Alexandra; Tolochin, Igor			Terrible Angels: Semantic Ambivalence and Polysemy	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						lexicography; polysemy; semantic ambivalence; archetype; collocational patterns		This study deals with the problem of ambivalence at the semantic level of word meaning. We argue that semantic ambivalence determines the whole structure of polysemy of certain English words and propose a method of establishing contextual markers indicating the presence of semantic ambivalence as the essential element of word meaning. Having studied a large variety of contexts for the word 'angel', we have identified three typical collocational patterns of its use in texts. Therefore, we suggest that this word has three main senses that are distinguished by their evaluative properties: ambivalent, positive and negative. In the ambivalent type of context 'angel' collocates with both positively and negatively charged words at the same time, which creates verbal sequences of high emotional tension. This fact proves the idea that certain words in the English language can convey simultaneously positive and negative aspects of human experience in a particular type of their usage as intrinsically inseparable from each other. Ambivalent word senses are referred to as archetypes, for they represent the legacy of the archaic syncretism of the human mind, which has been handed down to us in religion and poetry. Most modern monolingual English dictionaries do not take into account the distinction in the evaluative characteristics of collocational patterns when defining the word ` angel'. This leads to a number of problems in their lexicographic descriptions of this word. Taking into account its semantic ambivalence would contribute to a more coherent picture of its sense structure.

J	Hiloh, MAF; Ab Aziz, MJ; Zakaria, LQ				Hiloh, Muhammad Azhar Fairuzz; Ab Aziz, Mohd Juzaiddin; Zakaria, Lailatul Qadri			The Effectiveness of Bottom Up Technique with Probabilistic Approach for A Malay Parser	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						parsing technique; probabilistic context-free grammar; CYK; ambiguity; Malay language		Parsing is a process of analyzing the input string in a sentence to define the syntax structures according to rules of grammar. This task is performed by a parser which will produce a parse tree as output. However, a problem occurs when the parsing process produces two or more parse trees in which the parser unable to represent a precise parse tree. This limitation is caused by ambiguity in the structure of sentences. Ambiguity is occurred when a word is classified more than one category of syntax and its usage will affect the semantics of the sentence. Thus, the parser needs to have an approach to solve the ambiguity problem and is able to process the most appropriate parse tree to present a sentence. Like other languages in the world, Malay language, a national language for Malaysian, is not exempted from ambiguity problem. However, due to its grammar being context-free grammar, the probabilistic context-free grammar approach can be used to support the parser in determining a more accurate parse tree. This study focuses on the development of statistical parser using a bottom-up technique for Malay language. The training data, in the form of simple Malay language sentences, are collected from various sources. Based on this training data, a statistical lexical corpus of Malay language which consists of vocabulary, grammar rules and their probability was developed. The bottom up parsing will be supported by implementing Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm. The parser's performance is evaluated based on its effectiveness to overcome ambiguity by suggesting a more precise parse tree.

J	Omar, N; Al-Tashi, Q				Omar, Nazlia; Al-Tashi, Qasem			Arabic Nested Noun Compound Extraction Based on Linguistic Features and Statistical Measures	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Arabic multi-word expressions; noun compound; nested noun compound; association measures; POS tagging		The extraction of Arabic nested noun compound is significant for several research areas such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, word categorization, grammar checker, and machine translation. Much research has studied the extraction of Arabic noun compound using linguistic approaches, statistical methods, or a hybrid of both. A wide range of the existing approaches concentrate on the extraction of the bi-gram or tri-gram noun compound. Nonetheless, extracting a 4-gram or 5-gram nested noun compound is a challenging task due to the morphological, orthographic, syntactic and semantic variations. Many features have an important effect on the efficiency of extracting a noun compound such as unit-hood, contextual information, and term-hood. Hence, there is a need to improve the effectiveness of the Arabic nested noun compound extraction. Thus, this paper proposes a hybrid linguistic approach and a statistical method with a view to enhance the extraction of the Arabic nested noun compound. A number of pre-processing phases are presented, including transformation, tokenization, and normalisation. The linguistic approaches that have been used in this study consist of a part-of-speech tagging and the named entities pattern, whereas the proposed statistical methods that have been used in this study consist of the NC-value, NTC-value, NLC-value, and the combination of these association measures. The proposed methods have demonstrated that the combined association measures have outperformed the NLC-value, NTC-value, and NC-value in terms of nested noun compound extraction by achieving 90%, 88%, 87%, and 81% for bigram, trigram, 4-gram, and 5-gram, respectively.

J	Hassan, R				Hassan, Roshidah			Malay Language Learning Styles and Strategies among French Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						learning style; learning strategy; language acquisition; Malay; French	FOREIGN	This paper discusses the learning styles and strategies used by the French students in the Malay language learning. The study was conducted at the National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilisations (INALCO), Paris. Subjects of the study consist of 19 students of the Indonesian/Malaysian Language Bachelor Degree Programme, Department of South-East Asia and Asia Pacific (Centre du Asie du Sud-est et Pacifique), INALCO. The study aims at understanding and describing what are the learning styles and strategies used by the students in their language learning. Data were collected through a questionnaire adopted from Wang (2015) and were analyzed using simple statistic which looks at the frequency and percentage of the styles and strategies used by the students. Analysis of learning styles applied by the student in their Malay language learning was done according to the 4 language skills which are reading, writing, listening and speaking based on Christison's (2003) theoretical framework. Analysis for the learning strategies were done based on the Oxford's (1990) theoretical framework which divides strategies into 6 main categories; memory, cognitive, compensation, metacognitive, affective and social strategies. Questions related to strategies used by the students cover all these categories. Findings show that most of the French students prefer employing visual, global, field-dependent and reflective learning styles and tend to use memory, metacognitive, affective and social strategies in their language learning.

J	Palacio, MA; Gustilo, L				Palacio, May Antonette; Gustilo, Leah			A Pragmatic Analysis of Discourse Particles in Filipino Computer Mediated Communication	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						discourse particles; internet language; young talk; CMC; pragmatics	PREFACED RESPONSES; MARKERS; COHERENCE	As the English language continues to evolve through time, many of its structures and functions changed, which made it even realizable that the smallest unit in a discourse can play a crucial role in communication. Hence, this present study is an attempt to investigate the phenomenon and further delve into the discourse-pragmatic functions of discourse particles (DPs) in digital genres, particularly on Facebook, since DPs are commonly used by Filipino youths when posting and commenting online. Thirty tertiary-level students from different universities in Metro Manila, Philippines, were selected to participate in the present study. Using both qualitative and quasi-quantitative methods, results revealed a surprising number and interesting types of combined English and Filipino Relational DPs having several micro functions. Generally, they serve as a device that can let the interlocutors convey their emotions, relationships, and attitudes towards the receiver of their message. Discourse particles have crucial and prominent implications in the way Filipinos, particularly the youth, express their message, gain understanding of the received message, and establish speaker-receiver relationships and attitude on Facebook.

The use of literature materials can produce students who think about goodwill, virtues and prioritize politeness. Therefore, such good practice can produce individuals who are proactive in dealing with various situations. Therefore, the politeness aspect needs to be emphasised in oral or written communication in order that no party is offended or is in conflict. In the context of literary writing, language politeness display is manifested through speech events, using certain structures in dialogue in order that the information communicated is conflict-free. The analysis focused on the mapping structure of speech events' of the main character and a supporting characters' dialogue in Chapter 16. This study employed a combination of Leech's Model of Politeness (1983) and Grice's Model of Cooperation (1975) which forms the General Maxim Combination Pattern Model (MPKMU) to analyze the research data. This study used library research, text analysis and quantitative method as the instruments. The finding shows that the mapping structures of speech events are varied to fulfil certain requirements for the purpose of creating a situation of conflict free communication. The existence of these situations assure that all sides are in a comfortable zone apart from escalating effectiveness of communication when each speaker's objectives is achieved. Thus, these situations have manifested the importance of politeness in language. In conclusion, mapping of structure events using the combination of the two models managed to reflect politeness speech events in the 'Melunas Rindu' novel.

As a result, electronic communication has become part of the present-day multinational professionals of all fields who work daily in front of their digital monitors. At times, these professionals may receive Nigerian 419 scam e-mails in which fraudsters target victims to make advance payments for financial gains that do not materialise. In these e-mails, situations in which persuasion techniques are intertwined are well crafted. As a result, the victim who is susceptible to the offer is more likely to respond and be lured into losing money eventually. The present study, consequently, analysed a corpus of 50 Nigerian 419 scam e-mails through a textual analysis to examine language aspects in terms of persuasion strategies fraudsters used as a compelling force to achieve their communicative purposes of lures and deceits. The study has revealed two major types of deceptive techniques which are used in combination, namely framing-rhetoric triggers, disguised as the traditional genre of electronic communications and human weakness-exploiting triggers, intended as incitement of recipients' emotions. Finally, the paper includes not only pedagogical suggestions for business English teachers when implementing classroom activities, but also warnings for either pre-experienced or experienced business professionals in relation to interpreting the unknown e-mails' messages they receive with great caution.

J	Joodaki, AH; Elyasi, Z				Joodaki, Abdol Hossein; Elyasi, Zeinab			Deconstructing Phallogocentrism in Shahrnush Parsipur's Touba and the Meaning of Night: A Psycho-Feminist Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Shahrnush Parsipur; Touba and the Meaning of Night; Lacan; Cixous; Phallogocentrism		Shahrnush Parsipur (1946) is a celebrated and courageous Iranian novelist. This study deals with her controversial, epic novel Touba and the Meaning of Night (1989). The novel is analyzed based on Lacanian theory of subject formation and Cixousian concept of 'ecriture feminine. In this essay a psychoanalytic-feminist discourse is used to intervene between a phallogocentric discourse and a feminist discourse. The pivotal aims of the study are to deconstruct Lacan's concept of phallogocentrism, to redefine the concept of womanhood and to reconstruct feminine identity. According to the French psychoanalyst, Jacque Lacan, it is language that ultimately structures our conscious and unconscious mind and our identity. He introduced a tripartite scheme of psychic development: imaginary, symbolic and real. The symbolic order and its accompanying concept of phallogocentrism is the main focus of this study. By deconstructing symbolic phallus as the transcendental signified which signifies everything including female identity, the researcher's aim is to focus on the need for a female framework and a feminine discourse free from male assumptions in order to reconstruct feminine identity. Helene Cixous, in her essay The Laugh of Medusa (1975), introduces a particular kind of female writing and tries to reconstruct the women's shattered, colonized and marginalized identities in order to deconstruct the dominant symbolic order and phallocentric discourse. The task of this studyis to deal with and to follow the trace of masculine ideology and discourse in women's identity in the novel Touba and the Meaning of Night. The study also, inspired by Helene Cixous'sprophecy of women's experience of writing in a male dominated atmosphere claims that through deconstruction and break down of phallogocentrism, female subjects are constructed and a new discourse for women is established based on which they can reconstruct and forge their new identities.

This article attempts to explore the turntaking, overlap, aizuchi, insertion and politeness in Japanese conversation. This article is a part of the research output on Malaysian licenced tourist guides in their interaction with the Japanese tourists. The research was based on a two-hour conversation which was recorded using IC recorder. It was found that although the tourist guides in this study spoke Japanese fluently, they had yet to identify the language characteristics and the Japanese culture. They interrupt and disrupt the flow of conversation.

J	Shabudin, M; Aman, I				Shabudin, Maserah; Aman, Idris			Discourse And Ideology In Advertisements Of Beauty Products In The Japanese Language	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						ideology; occidental; advertising discourse; beauty products; Japanese language		The purpose of this article is to identify, formulate, and elucidate the implicit ideology in the Japanese language advertising discourse based on the combination of texts, semiotics, and the discursive nature in 24 advertising discourse of women beauty products in the Japanese language. The interpretation shows that even though the studied discourse is advertisements of Japanese beauty products written in the Japanese language for the Japanese domestic market, the occidentalisation practice of beauty stands out through the textual characteristics and discursive practices in the advertising texts that were studied. The occidental ideology based on the value of beauty is oriented towards the concept and characteristics of the beauty of the Occidental women, specifically the Euro-Americans. They value the `symbols of world culture' and 'universal beauty'. This ideology is also closely related with the 'ethno-cultural stereotype'; a positive and prestigious stereotype image specifically referring to the language, culture and identity of the Occidental ethnics. In other words, even though Japan is one of the most advanced and economic superpower in today's world, where Japanese products are recognized as quality product and can penetrate markets around the world, in reality Japan is still dependent, and oriented towards ideological intervention from the Occidental countries to communicate with the Japanese society, which is renowned for its uniqueness and homogeneity.

J	Tahir, UMM				Tahir, Ungku Maimunah Mohd.			Women As Sex Objects: Its Treatment In Bila Hujan Malam	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Persuratan Baru; discourse; story; sex object; erotic novel		This article analyses Azizi Haji Abdullah's novel Bila hujan malam to determine critical claims of its literary merit. The article uses as its analytical framework Mohd. Affandi Hassan's (1992) Persuratan Baru, giving particular attention to taklif, its philosophical underpinning of responsibility and accountability towards God, as well as to the crucial distinction it makes between 'knowledge/discourse' and 'story'. The article unpacks "women as sex objects" as the novel's main perception, which Azizi structures into the story through four narrative strategies. The strategies centre round using selected aspects of the 'unexplained antecedent' technique, making molestation that strips women of control and agency as the only form of sexual union available, providing a context fully supportive of and conducive to sexual exploitation, and denying a role for women other than that of a sex object. The article argues that, contrary to claims of its literary merit, the novel prioritises vice as a valid aesthetic and literary expression, at the same time as it makes discourse/knowledge irrelevant to its structuring. In so doing, it operates as a novel only on the level of story and story-making. This article thus concludes that Bila hujan malam is no more than an erotic novel devoid of intellectual content and literary merit.

J	Wei, LX; Wong, BE				Wei, Lixia; Wong, Bee			A Corpus-Based Study On Snake Metaphors In Mandarin Chinese And British English	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						snake metaphorical expressions; Mandarin Chinese; British English; Conceptual Metaphor Theory; the GREAT CHAIN METAPHOR		This study is based on the data obtained from the Modern Chinese Corpus compiled by the Center for Chinese Linguistics of Peking University (CCL Corpus) and the British National Corpus (BNC). Via exploring snake metaphors across the two languages within the framework of Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the GREAT CHAIN METAPHOR, this study aims to identify the existence of both universality and individuality of metaphors cross-linguistically when the snake is mapped onto human beings. It investigates the snake metaphors from three aspects. The findings show that, first, the metaphorical expressions in Mandarin Chinese and British English are both mainly generated from the snake's characteristic and appearance. Second, in terms of the conceptual metaphor of HUMAN BEINGS ARE ANIMALS, Mandarin Chinese and British English share the same metaphor of HUMAN BEINGS ARE SNAKES. However, when the gender of human beings is taken into consideration, the specific conceptual metaphors generalized for the man and the woman from these two languages are different. This provides evidence to show that cross linguistically, like other kinds of conceptual metaphors, the universality of snake metaphors exists at the generic level and the individuality of these metaphors exists at the basic level. Third, in terms of evaluation, the snake metaphorical expressions have a much more derogative meaning for the man in Chinese but a more derogative meaning for the woman in English.

Crosslinguistic studies on categorisation propose numeral classifiers as a linguistic manifestation of human categorisation and conceptualisation. Thus, studies on numeral classifier acquisition enable researchers to examine how children learn to categorise objects in their environment using a constrained framework, and how this ability becomes more refined as children grow older. This study investigated the strategies children utilise in categorising objects into eight Malay shape-based numeral classifier categories using a paired discrimination task. One-hundred-and-forty-eight children ranging in age from 6 to 9 years and a comparison group of adults participated in this study. Results revealed that children categorised objects more readily when there was a strong (two-perceptual feature distinction) than weak (one-perceptual feature distinction) contrast, and when exemplars were typical rather than atypical. There appears to be a gradual transition from a perceptually biased to a broader, more rule-based system.

J	Isam, H; Awal, NM				Isam, Hishamudin; Awal, Norsimah Mat			A Corpus-based Analysis To Restructure The Position Of The Core Meaning Of Setia	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						values; loyalty; core meaning; meaning restructuring and domain mappings		Speakers' creativity in manipulating lexical usage has resulted in the emergence of new meanings and these meanings have the potential to be recorded in dictionaries. This emergence, therefore, calls for the restructuring of the new meanings to determine the position of the existing meaning vis-a-vis the new meanings. The restructuring process should begin by analyzing the position of the core meaning of the lexical item; whether the position should be maintained or replaced with the peripheral or new meanings or dropped altogether as it has no relevance to the current situation. This study attempts to restructure the core meaning associated with values specifically the value of setia (loyal). The analytical procedure begins by analyzing every sentence in the selected corpus that has the lexical item setia. The lexical meanings are determined from the context of usage. Every meaning that is predicted and discovered is then categorized based on the domains of its usage. The categorization process displays the most frequently used meaning, and identifies meaning that is predicted to be more effective or better able to explain other meanings. Findings from the research show that the core meaning of the lexical item setia (loyal) remains in the metaphorical form teguh hati (unwavering loyalty). Based on the corpus examined, it is discovered that not only the core meaning is expanded to other peripheral meanings but that there are proofs that could explain the motivation of the conceptual structure in deciding teguh hati (unwavering loyalty) as the core meaning of the lexical setia (loyal).

GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						blog; bloggers' attitudes; bloggers' field dependency; online discussion	STUDENTS; TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE	The prevalence of using blogs among college students has great impact in online communication. It is therefore important to identify how learners with different characteristics use this technology. This study examines if bloggers' cognitive styles particularly field-dependency affects students' attitudes toward blogs. The subjects were a class of undergraduate students enrolled in an obligatory course. The Group Embedded Figures Test was administered which classified them as either field dependent or field independent. Then, they were requested to respond to a questionnaire designed to assess their attitudes toward blogs on three factors: blog anxiety, blog desirability, and blog self-efficacy. Although field-dependents had lower blog anxiety, blog desirability, and blog self-efficacy than field-independents in using blogs, the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, conclusions drawn from the interview questions support the notion that both field dependents and field independents appeared to have positive attitudes towards using blogs in a learning environment.

J	Aziz, J; Hashim, F				Aziz, Jamaluddin; Hashim, Fuzirah			Exploring Global Decolonising Projects and English Studies in the 21st Century: A Thematic Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Decolonisation; English Studies; Thematic Analysis; Culture; Imperialism		Decolonisation projects have proliferated with the increasing awareness of the hegemony that comes with globalisation. Decolonising English studies (both language and literature) is nothing new and often manifested at the implementation levels with the use of local literary texts and localised Englishes in the classroom. What collective voice has decolonising English studies achieved in relation to other decolonising projects, however, has not been fully scrutinised. The aim of this paper is to review past studies on some areas affected by the decolonising project and to try establishing its relationship to English studies itself. The overarching concern is expressed by these research questions: 1) What are some examples of decolonisation projects that can be found?; 2) What are the common themes of past studies on decolonisation projects?; And 3) How are these past studies contributing to the decolonisation of English studies? To achieve this, the review of literature is organised thematically to create links and synthesis. This paper adopts the definitions of decolonisation by Meera Ashar (2015) and Shahjahan et al. (2022). The thematic analysis reveals three main themes which are privileging indigenous knowledge, a re-evaluation of the curriculum, and the questioning of the epistemology of knowledge itself, with the first two themes bookending the last theme. We conclude that English studies should be coded as a tool of cultural-political literacy that is useful in helping us make sense of how inequalities are being reproduced via literary texts and the English language. This finding contributes toward an alternative understanding of the evolution in pedagogy and the innovative approaches in English studies so that its cultural imperialism is eliminated while providing a vanguard of possible retheorisation.

The changing view of masculinity demands for an exploration of how popular media, particularly men's magazines rewrite the discourse of masculinity. Attempting to answer the overarching question of `what does masculinity mean today?', this paper explores identity as a linguistic phenomenon. Drawing on both Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Halliday's Transitivity system of the Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) frameworks, we examine ideational meanings realised by lexicogrammatical selections and discourse-semantic-choice involving process types and participants' role that form counter hegemonic masculinities. This study argues that as men negotiate their identities, magazines play a critical role in challenging patriarchal masculinity and normalising alternative masculine practices via ideologies embedded in a text. The investigation focuses on how transitivity is drawn on to produce counter hegemonic formations and how different enactments of masculinities are articulated in magazine texts to present alternative forms of male identities. Drawing from 584,600-word corpus of selected men's magazines titles published from 2016 to 2020, findings revealed the use of material, mental, relational and behavioural processes that manifests counter hegemonic identities or non-traditional representation. Evidence from the corpus reflects various projections of men as emotionally vulnerable, aesthetically conscious, domestically competent and antihomophobic. The implication highlights the different ways media language creates and facilitates the changes in masculine practices and how magazine texts infuse or indoctrinate alternative identities as a stable performance of masculinity.

J	Tran, HM; Waluyo, B				Hoang Minh Tran; Waluyo, Budi			Receptive Knowledge of Nouns and Collocations and the Impact on English Skill Performances	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						English skill performances; grammatical collocations; lexical collocations; nouns; receptive vocabulary knowledge	VOCABULARY SIZE; LEARNERS	Interests in examining the roles of receptive vocabulary knowledge and collocational knowledge and competence on EFL learners' proficiency have grown considerably; yet, the extent of how EFL learners' receptive knowledge of noun, verb-noun collocations, and noun-preposition collocations impact their English skill performances is still insufficiently researched. To address such gaps, this study specifically explored Thai EFL learners' receptive knowledge of nouns and collocations and its impact on English skill performances. Three types of receptive vocabulary tests were created by using high-frequency nouns taken from the Academic Vocabulary List (AVL), which became the basis of selecting verb-noun lexical collocations and noun-preposition grammatical collocations. The tests were validated by a pilot study, then distributed to the 2nd year students (N = 135; 28 males; 107 females) at Walailak University, Thailand. The results of the tests were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, independent t-test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regressions. It was revealed that Thai EFL learners, who participated in this study, had insufficient knowledge of noun, either in form or in meaning, and encountered complexities in identifying lexical and grammatical collocations. Receptive knowledge significantly predicted learners' performance in reading tasks. The findings of this study indicate the urgent need to include collocations into English teaching as Thai EFL learners seem unable to acquire them on their own; besides, the insufficient knowledge of the form and meaning of nouns may imply a deeper problem in Thai EFL learners' proficiency in grammatical structure. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that English teaching and learning materials, e.g., textbooks and modules, as well as course design and instruction at the university level in Thailand need to include explicitly integrated lessons of nouns (form and meaning) and collocations to facilitate the development of knowledge in such areas.

J	Ibharim, MZT; Omar, HC				Ibharim, Mohamad Zakuan Tuan; Omar, Hasuria Che			The Strategies Of Subtitling Humour In Deadpool: Retain, Eliminate Or Add?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Indonesian	Article						humour; subtitling; audiovisual translation; translation strategies; Deadpool	VERBALLY EXPRESSED HUMOR; TRANSLATION	The rapid development of science and technology encompasses various disciplines, including audiovisual translation. Translation of humour in the audio translation discipline is often regarded challenging. According to Chiaro (2008), the issue on the translatability of humour is impeded by linguistic and cultural constraints. Since humour is relative in nature, its presentation, comprehension and acceptance are diverse. In the audiovisual context, the presentation of a message (humour) does not only depend on the semantic meaning of the dialogues, but its construction is set against four core modes simultaneously which include sound, music, image and language (Perez-Gonzalez, 2014a). This certainly further complicates the work of audiovisual translators in determining the appropriate translation strategies. Accordingly, this study aims to discuss the humour subtitling strategy phenomenon comprehensively. The Marvel film Deadpool (2016), subtitled in the Malay language by ASTRO GO was chosen as the study corpus. Based on Martinez-Sierra's (2006) Taxonomy of Humour and Zolczer's (2016) method of analysis, a comparative analysis of humorous elements between the source and target texts was conducted. The results of the analysis showed that there were three main subtitling strategies: Translated, Untranslated, and Added. To be exact, translation strategies in Deadpool can be broken down into eight classifications: Translated-Retained (Successful), Translated-Retained (Unsuccessful), Translated-Changed (Successful), Translated-Changed (Unsuccessful), Untranslated (Adequate), Untranslated (Unsuccessful), Added (Successful) and Added (Unsuccessful). Apart from describing the patterns of strategies, the findings were also compared to conceptual discussion to explain the humour translation phenomenon in greater detail.

J	Perry, MS				Perry, Melissa Shamini			Multimodal Engagement through a Transmedia Storytelling Project for Undergraduate Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						multimodality; transmedia; storytelling; pedagogy; higher education	LITERACY	Transmedia storytelling has great potential in the field of education and research on its applications and benefits in teaching and learning is growing. This paper explores the use of transmedia storytelling as a multimodal pedagogical tool for tertiary students. This paper explicates the design and application of a transmedia storytelling project in increasing multimodal engagement for undergraduate students from various faculties. A case study of a transmedia storytelling campaign conceptualised and produced by undergraduate students from a Malaysian public university was analysed for evidence of multimodal engagement. Students' project output including campaign pitches, campaign designs and artefacts such as scripts, storyboards, posters, photos and videos submitted via digital formats were collated and analysed using a multimodal framework. Post-assessment reflections submitted by students were also analysed. The findings of the case study revealed that the conceptualisation and production of a transmedia storytelling campaign consisting of a short film, book and social media page enabled students to engage with multiple modalities and develop various skills and competencies. Analysis of campaign artefacts and student reflections found that the use of this novel pedagogy enabled students to engage with visual and spatial, linguistic, audio, gestural and technical digital modes of meaning as well as develop literary competencies and creative thinking skills through this project. This paper paves the way for further exploration of the use of transmedia storytelling as a multimodal pedagogical tool to develop various literacies, educational competencies as well as 21st century skills amongst tertiary students.

J	Shahidi, AH; CheLaeh, M				Shahidi, A. H.; CheLaeh, Mumad			Consonant Lengthening in The Patani Malay Dialect	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Indonesian	Article						Patani Malay dialect; acoustic phonetics; consonant lengthening; plosive consonants; suprafix	PLOSIVES; LANGUAGE	This paper aims to describe the aspect of consonant lengthening/gemination (one double-articulated consonant) in the Patani Malay dialect acoustically. In general, previous studies related to the field of phonetics and phonology are still not sufficient in providing a complete description of the relevant characteristics of a consonant lengthening in Patani Malay dialect. Voice Onset Time (VOT) and Intensity were fully utilized in describing the plosive lengthening in initial word of Patani Malay dialect. Five Patani Malay dialect speakers (men aged 35 - 50 years old from the Muang area in Pattani District) were selected to obtain a total of 300 tokens that were later used in spectrographic analysis. The results of this study indicate that even though consonant lengthening occurs in Patani Malay dialect, it is specific to a particular sound only. Only voiced plosives seem to coincide with the concept of gemination. An in-depth analysis using intensity variables eventually highlighted the differences between the consonants, and their counterparts for the voiceless plosive sound. This study shows that the phenomenon of Patani Malay dialect consonant lengthening involved suprasegmental features. The elongation and emphasis element are phonemic, i.e. suprafix. Word initial plosive in Patani Malay dialect can either be a suprafix or non-suprafix. The study provides important implications in studying cognate languages, and standard Malay language as a second language for some community in Thailand. It will also help the language instructors in the teaching and learning process of non-native speakers in acquiring a second language.	[Shahidi, A.

J	Idrus, MM; Hashim, RS; Mydin, RM				Idrus, Mohd Muzhafar; Hashim, Ruzy Suliza; Mydin, Raihanah Mohd			Postcolonial Civic Identity and Youth (dis)organizing Environment: A Growth into Citizenship Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						civic identities; growth into citizenship; postcolonial; youth narratives	AUTOCHTHONY; TV; STRATEGIES; POSITION; AFRICA; POWER	The fluid realities of youth in postcolonial nation-states can reflect changing and challenging landscapes. Their engagements with environment, for example, are not only elaborated in social, political, and economical contexts, but also generated through values, beliefs, and identities. This article adds to contemporary debates by positing that discussions on postcolonial civic identities have to be accompanied by youth narratives and their considerations on nature, time, and digital world(s) by taking Malaysian youths as examples. Specifically, it attempts to theorize youth civic identity within postcolonial context(s) by scrutinizing personal narratives that are symbiotically yoked with discourses on ecology and technology. Through administering personal narratives at a suburban district in West Peninsular Malaysia, this paper opens 'windows' into what it means for youths to participate in civic projects. Reading these narratives from the lens of growth into citizenship, their wide-ranging experiences in civic affairs can be understood in four ways, namely, recognition, responsibilities, reconciliation, and reciprocity. Two of these emerging themes, recognition and responsibilities, will be discussed in this article. Our attempt at depicting postcolonial civic identity, therefore, is part of a large-scale investigation on civic mindedness that will compel us to reflect on unofficial, continuous accounts of youth reflecting on a sense of belongingness and what the future might bring.

Populism plays a vital role in Indonesia's 2019 presidential election. Various research has been carried out to understand the practice of populism. However, few have explained the way social media and online news in populist communication practices relate to the discourse of the online presidential campaign. This research aims to understand the pattern of the use of populist discourse in Indonesia's 2019 presidential election in online news and social media. The study employed Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) that focuses on social identity construction and the relation of populist discourse practices. Data for the study were obtained from online news from January 15 to February 14, 2019. A total of 81 news articles from online news and 576,782 entries that are disseminated in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube were analyzed by using Nvivo and web crawlers. This research finds that, first, political discourse and populist discourse are amplified by online news coverage and extended in the social media; second, online news does not engage in producing populist discourse but echoes the populist discourse by citing politician's populist utterance. In conclusion, populist keywords and concepts like infrastructure, food, energy, and radical become a hegemonic discourse in Indonesia's 2019 presidential election. There are two important contributions of this study on populist discourse in Indonesia's 2019 election campaign. One, the knowledge of the pattern of the distribution of populist discourse. Two, the understanding about the use of populist discourse in social media and online news.

Language shift issues often occur among minorities. This issue is highlighted because the findings of previous studies indicate that there is a clear change in the language use when the Cham people emigrate thus leading to language transitions. This study aims to investigate the use of Cham language based on domain analysis and social mobility theory. The use of Cham language is studied in family domains, neighbourhoods and occupations. The study was conducted in the area of Perak-Pulau Pinang-Kedah boundary which is a northern socio-economic growth area. 135 respondents were involved, with the age of between 12 and 69 years old. The data were obtained through field work using questionnaire and indirect interview and analysed by using percentage and independent sample t-test. The findings showed that the difference in the score of language use between generations in the three domains is statistically significant. This study concludes that the use of Cham language is decreasing mainly by the second generation and leads to the language shift into Malay. Social mobility factors play a role in this language shift. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the study of language shift and maintenance of minority language.

J	Azar, AS; Hashim, A				Azar, Ali Sorayyaei; Hashim, Azirah			The Impact of Attitude Markers on Enhancing Evaluation in the Review Article Genre	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Review						academic review genres; review article genre; metadiscourse; stance; attitude markers; evaluation	METADISCOURSE; STANCE	Academic review writing is not merely about providing an overview but taking a stance and evaluating other scholars' views in evaluation-loaded texts. In academic review genres, the authors describe, analyse, and evaluate the developments of a research. Perhaps the most noticeable way of such an evaluation in academic review genres is the use of attitudinal lexicon and its categories. The main aim of this research is (1) to investigate what type of attitude markers are frequently used to enhance evaluation in the review articles, and (2) to analyse their functions in the different analytical sections of the review articles. The data, drawn from a randomly selected corpus of thirty-two review articles, was analysed using Wordsmith tools (Scott, 2012) to investigate how evaluation was enhanced by the use of attitudinal lexicon. The results indicated that the attitude markers were more frequent in the Conclusion section than other analytical sections in the corpus. Four types of attitude markers were identified, however only two types (i.e. attitudinal adjectives and adverbs) were the most frequent markers. They appeared more frequently in Move2 and Move3 of the Conclusion sections. This study revealed how the authors professionally communicate with their readers to clarify their evaluation through attitude markers and express importance, limitations and gaps, compare and contrast, and praise and criticize the developments of a research in applied linguistics. The findings of this research can be drawn on in EAP courses for novice writers to facilitate their achievement in academic writing.

The media, despite playing an instrumental role in bringing about social transformation, has the ability to portray the foreign women in a positive way or to discriminate against them. This study, based on qualitative analysis, represents an attempt to study a social problem particularly in the way that foreign women in sex work have been represented in Malaysia by the mainstream English-language newspapers. The analytical tools of the discourse-historical approach (DHA) are employed in the analysis of the news articles. In particular, the argumentation strategy in the DHA demonstrates that a number of topoi (i.e., the topoi of control, number, threat, and victimisation) have been employed to represent foreign sex workers in the media. Investigation of the newspaper extracts from New Straits Times and The Star generally revealed that the media have portrayed foreign women in sex work in the offender orientation frame more so than as victims. Furthermore, foreign sex workers are also positioned negatively because of their illegal migrant status, making them doubly discriminated against. Such representations directly impact the women's lives, leading to further discrimination on the basis of their trade and illegal migrant status, denying them a voice and depriving them of their legal rights. The paper concludes by discussing the contributions of the research and emphasises the need for social justice for these marginalised women.

J	Alkaff, SNH; McLellan, J				Alkaff, Sharifah Nurul Huda; McLellan, James			'Stranger in the Dark': A Comparative Analysis of the Reporting of Rape Cases Against Minors in Malay and English Newspapers in Brunei and Malaysia	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						critical discourse analysis; comparative media discourse; newspapers; rape; reporting	NEWS; COVERAGE	Journalists of Malay and English newspapers from Brunei and Malaysia are found to adopt different stances in terms of their inclusion of detail and their level of involvement or detachment in crime and accident reports. This study combines an analysis of online news reports of rape cases with interview data from journalists and editors of Malay and English newspapers in Brunei and Malaysia. Our original hypothesis is that Malay news reports would demonstrate a more restrained approach to crime and accident news compared to English news stories. Four parallel pairs of rape stories from four newspapers were analysed using Fairclough's (1995) framework and van Leeuwen's (2008) representation of social actors and social action approach. Critical case purposive sampling method was used to collect the news stories. The findings reveal clear differences in how rape cases are reported by the Malay newspapers vis-a-vis their English counterparts, with reports in the Malaysian Malay paper, for example, being longer and containing more details of the crimes while the opposite is found in the Bruneian Malay paper. Our findings suggest that differences in the reporting of rape cases are not just due to linguistic differences but are culturally, ideologically and politically situated.

J	Lee, H; Lee, B; Chun, HC				Lee, Haiyoung; Lee, Bolami; Chun, Hee Chung			Refusal Speech Act Response: Differences between South Koreans and North Korean Refugees in Inducing Speech Acts and Directness	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						language Use; Refusal Speech Act; Inducing Speech Act; directness; North Korean Refugees		The majority of previous studies on North Korean Refugees (NKRs) focused on the linguistic heterogeneity of pronunciation and vocabulary use. Only a handful of studies examined differences between South Koreans' (SKs) and NKRs' language use and they concluded that NKRs prefer direct refusal speech acts rather than indirect ones. However, we hypothesized that NKRs' preference on direct refusal speech acts would vary depending on the types of inducing speech acts; speech acts that induces refusal expressions. 47 SKs and 43 NKRs answered three questions after watching video clips of short conversation in refusal situations. The results were statistically analyzed with independent sample t-tests and multi response analyses, revealing that NKRs preference on direct refusal speech acts varied depending on the types of inducing speech act. In addition, multi response analyses indicated that the NKRs and SKs evaluated the same rejecter's personality differently and that this difference may result in miscommunication. Lastly, NKRs' evaluations on the refusal speech acts did not change over time, as NKRs who stayed less than a year in South Korea and those who stayed more than five years did not show significant difference in their evaluation. This result suggests that explicit education on this may be required. Additionally, it is worth to note that current research confirms that SKs and NKRs react differently toward expressions used only in North Korea, and, therefore, not only the refusal strategy, but also the refusal expression itself are both important for successful communication. Additionally, the results showed that refusing with nonavoidable and non-personal reasons were perceived more positively than personal reasons. These findings suggest that for successful communication to happen between two groups with different linguistic backgrounds, pragmatic awareness in language use is helpful.

J	Ahmed, WK; Maros, M				Ahmed, Wasan Khalid; Maros, Marlyna			Using Hedges as Relational Work by Arab EFL Students in Student-Supervisor Consultations	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Hedges; gender; relational work; EFL Arab students; academic consultations		One of the challenges that Arab EFL male and female postgraduate students in the Malaysian universities have to anticipate is the consultation process with their supervisors regarding their academic projects. During the consultations, the students ask questions and respond to the supervisors' comments and demands. To perform these academic tasks appropriately, these students need to modify their interactional patterns using various linguistic devices. One of these is hedges, the linguistic politeness markers. Incorrect selection of these devices can be interpreted as inappropriate behaviour, which may affect the student-supervisor relationships. To avoid any breakdown in communication between the two parties and maintain effective consultations, a pragmatic knowledge of using hedges is necessary. Previous discourse analysis studies on the use of hedges have focused on the student-student interaction while student-supervisor academic consultations still need to be explored to understand how these learners perform in more formal academic settings. The current study, therefore, aimed to investigate how Arab EFL postgraduate students use hedges to express various types of politeness. It also aimed to find out whether the use of this device is gender specific. The data were collected by means of four one-to-one student-supervisor consultations and a pragmatic knowledge questionnaire. The findings showed that the students are familiar with hedges as they used a huge number of them. Also the female students used more hedges than male students. However, the analysis of the questionnaire showed that the students were not fully aware of the pragmatic functions achieved by these devices.

J	Mahmud, M				Mahmud, Murni			Communicative Styles of English Students at the State University of Makassar	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						communication; communication strategies; communicative styles; classroom presentation; classroom interaction; English language teaching	ADDRESS TERMS; STRATEGIES	Communication has a crucial function in English language teaching because failure in communication will result in unsuccessful process. Therefore, it is important to investigate the styles of communication used in the classroom, especially by students. The focus of this paper is to explore the expressions used by a group of students to communicate in the classroom. This paper is based on a study conducted in 2015 at the State University of Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. This study focused on two English classes which employed classroom presentations as the learning strategy. To collect data, the researcher recorded the classroom presentations of the two classes. Twelve recordings from twelve groups of students were obtained, transcribed, and analyzed by using discourse analysis approach. The communicative styles used by the students were discussed based on the communication strategies of Dornyei and Scott (1997) and the students' talk was analyzed based on Brown's FLINT system (2000). Findings show that students employed various styles to communicate in the classroom presentations. Their communicative styles can be in the form of speech acts, discourse markers, language choices, address terms, and the inclusion of regional terms derived from the Bugis-Makassar language such as the pronoun - ko and softeners -mi and -ji. Findings of this study are relevant in the development of English language teaching, particularly in effort to create effective classroom interaction.

J	Hassan, R				Hassan, Roshidah			An Analysis of the Mastery of French Vowel Sounds by the Malay Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						language acquisition; Malay students; French language; vowel sound; Error Analysis		This study looks at the ability of the Malay students to discriminate and produce the French sounds, especially the vowel sounds. Most of the studies in the second language (L2) or third language (L3) started with the assumption that the first language (L1) is the main source of difficulties in the acquisition of second language (L2). The differences between the L1 and L2 or L3 are assumed to interfere with the acquisition of L2 or L3. This research intends to investigate whether it is true that the L1 is the source of difficulties in the acquisition of the French sound system. The subject of the research consisted of 32 Malay students, who are learning French at one of the higher institutions in Malaysia. The data were collected through two types of test: (1) discrimination test and (2) production test. This research applies the Error Analysis approach proposed by Corder (1967) as the theoretical framework, while the analysis of data was done according to the steps proposed by Van Els et al. (1984). They propose six steps: (1) collect data, (2) identify the errors, (3) classify the errors, (4) identify the source of errors, (5) analyze the data, and (6) propose the remedy for the errors. The results show that the Malay students did not have any major problems in discriminating the French vowels, but they have problems in producing those sounds. The results of the research have proven that the difficulties encountered by the students are not solely caused by the interference of the L1. In fact the difficulties are attributed to the spelling system in the French language. One of the sources of the difficulties in producing French vowel sounds is the spelling system used to represent thosevowels.

J	Cho, S; Park, C				Cho, Sookyung; Park, Chanho			The Role of Scoring In Formative Assessment of Second Language Writing	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						formative assessment; scoring; feedback; second language writing; EFL		This study examines how scoring with feedback in formative assessment affects learning in an English as a foreign language (EFL) writing classroom. Two EFL writing classes were compared: in one class, teacher feedback was given to students on initial drafts, and scores were given only at the end of the semester; in the second class, teacher feedback and scores were given to students on each draft throughout the semester. This study adopted a mixedmethods approach, including a statistical analysis to explore whether teacher feedback accompanied by scoring makes a difference in student writing, and observation, and interviews of focal students to examine how feedback with scores affects students ' perceptions and attitudes towards writing. The results reveal that the scoring class wrote more accurately than the non-scoring class and that the focal students in the scoring class were not only more aware of both their own and their classmates ' performances, but that they also made efforts to emulate the students they considered effective writers. This study implies that scoring can fortify the effects of feedback by motivating high achieving students to do their best in their writing assignments.

Students' Attitude Towards Oral Arabic Learning At Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						attitude; oral Arabic; prior experience; teaching approach	FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; LEARNERS; MOTIVATION; ENGLISH; CONTEXTS; SPANISH	Students' attitude towards language learning has been identified to influence the learning process. This study investigated students' attitude towards the learning of oral Arabic in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) which includes two aspects, attitude towards the teaching of the language and attitude towards the language itself. The objective of the study is to explore students' attitude from the cognitive, affective and conative perspectives. This is a qualitative study engaging 21 series of interviews, comprising 13 series of interviews with students and 8 with subject lecturers. The selection of students took into consideration their prior experience in learning Arabic and the faculty clusters they belonged to. The acquired interview data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVIVO7 software in order to establish the relevant themes. The study found that cognitively, all students affirmed to the importance of the oral Arabic even though they prioritized other subjects. Students' perception towards the difficulty of learning oral Arabic depends on their prior knowledge and experience. Affectively, all students expressed their positive attitude towards learning oral Arabic, except for some who had no foundation of the language expressed their uneasiness, learning in classess where students are of mixed abilities. Conatively, the students had shown their resilience to the learning and would like to continue doing so in the future. This study recommends that the teaching approach used should be appropriate to the students' prior knowledge and experience. Appropriate approach is therefore vital in moulding students' behaviour which consequently effects their performance in learning oral Arabic.

J	Tahir, UMM				Tahir, Ungku Maimunah Mohd			Story: Its Status And Function In The Works Of Pre-war Malay Women Writers	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						knowledge; story; narrative space; structural priority; Persuratan Baru		This article analyses the novelette Jiwa Kebangsaan in order to highlight its structural priority, whether to foreground story-making or discourse-developing, besides identifying the narrative devices which the text employs. To that end, the article makes use of Malaysia's home-grown theoretical framework Persuratan Baru, in particular its distinction between 'story' and 'knowledge'. The distinction can be detected through several means, the most important of which is the use of discourse, defined as substantive and academic arguments, whose creative inclusion is achieved through providing adequate narrative space in the story being unfolded. On the other hand, story, which serves to construct a tale, revolves round and operates on the narrative level and fills up its narrative space with narrative elements. The analysis shows how the text studied employs such narrative elements as character and characterization as well as conflict to move the story forward, at the same time that it closes up its narrative space to discourse, albeit opportunities to do so are available. The analysis makes clear the fact that the principle of story-making structures Jiwa Kebangsaan, at the same time as terms such as 'issues', 'problems', 'themes', 'preoccupations' and the like are used interchangeably with 'story'. These terms, in turn, are defined as 'knowledge'. In making no distinction between story and knowledge, Jiwa Kebangsaan assumes that the construction of a story fulfills the function of knowledge-dissemination. The story so constructed is itself perceived and touted as knowledge. The article argues that such a claim is academically untenable.

The study investigated students' motivation in terms of three motivational constructs: instrumental motivation, integrative motivation and personal motivation based on Gardner's ( 1985) and Cooper and Fishman's ( 1977) works. Learners' attitudes, on the other hand, regarding 1) the use of English in the Yemeni social context, 2) the use of English in the Yemeni educational context, 3) the English language and 4) the culture of the English speaking world were identified. The study sample consisted of 81 petroleum engineering students at Hadhramout University of Sciences and Technology ( HUST). A questionnaire and interviews were used for data collection. For the students' motivation, the findings showed the subjects' greater support of instrumental reasons for learning the English language including utilitarian and academic reasons. Personal reasons were also regarded as important motives by the students. However, regarding the integrative reasons, the results provided evidence that learning English as a part of the culture of its people had the least impact in students' English language motivation. On the other hand, data for the students' attitudes revealed that most of students had positive attitudes towards the social value and educational status of English. In addition, the findings showed the students' positive orientation toward the English language. Interestingly enough, the results indicated that a high number of the students showed their interest in the culture of the English speaking world as represented by English-language films. Finally, some pedagogical implications that would help tap the students' motivation and attitudes were presented.

J	Noora, A				Noora, Azam			Iranian Undergraduate Non-English Majors' Interpretation Of English Structures	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						verb; argument structure; processing; non-English major		The present study sought to determine whether Iranian non-English major students with or without the experience of attending language institutes, were more influenced by the type of verb or the argument structure patterns in their interpretation of English structures. To answer this question, 100 non-English major participants took part in a grouping task which was designed to reveal the participants' preference in sentence interpretation. Except for those who did not have the required knowledge base and displayed no grouping preference, the participants of the study exhibited three different grouping or sorting strategies in their performance: verb-centered strategy and two types of construction-based performance. The results of a Chi square test indicated that regardless of attending language institutes, the said participants were more inclined to group the structures (i.e., through interpreting them) by relying on the structures' verb types rather than paying attention to the argument structure patterns around which the structures were configured. The implication of these findings is that at least in a foreign language context, a verb valency-based reading strategy is needed to enhance the foreign language learners' information processing skills. The pedagogical overtones of the findings would affect both teaching activities as well as syllabus design and material development for non-English majors' English books used in the university.

J	Noora, A				Noora, Azam			Iranian Undergraduates Non-English Majors' Language Learning Preferences	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						learning preference; non-English major; general English; language skills		For effective language learning and teaching, both learner skills and assumptions should be given due attention. In promoting this idea, students should be provided with the opportunity to clarify and assess their preferences. Moved with the conviction that learners and learners' preferences are of crucial importance in the development of language learning, we asked 192 non-English major undergraduates to state their views on how they prefer learning English in the "General English "class. The wide-spread belief among Iranian university instructors is that in General English classes, students' language learning preferences do not differ significantly. However, the results indicate that there is a significant difference among non-English majors' preferences, even in different branches of the same major, regarding preferred teaching method, the most important language skill and their motivational orientations. The results have implications for syllabus and material design and classroom practice.

J	Kuen, NK				Kuen, Ng Kwei			A Collaborative Perspective for Autonomy in Teaching and Learning	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article								This chapter examines how autonomy as a teaching- learning concept can prevail in a predominantly teacher- centered learning environment at the tertiary level. To do so, a comprehensive collaborative paradigm is used to highlight the inter- relationships between the players, the language and the subject in an EAP context. This will demonstrate how instructors and learners can explore autonomy first separately then together. The observations and experiences gathered over a two- year period in a tertiary institution in Malaysia provide the body of data on which this chapter is based. The findings suggest that autonomy, in particular learner autonomy, cannot be "taught." It needs to be developed by the teacher suppressing the desire to lead, and overcoming her phobia of uncertainty. Additionally, the language teacher must be prepared to collaborate with the subject lecturer to authenticate the learning goals.

Another kind of war that opens the floodgates for the passage of neologisms into the English language is the war on health during epidemics or pandemics. The present study utilized the News On the Web (NOW) corpus of English-corpora.org to (1) produce a word-list of COVID-19 pandemic language classified as medical, economic, political, and psychosocial lexemes; (2) identify the word-formation processes operating on the COVID-19 related vocabulary, and (3) determine which words are prevalent and unique in L1, L2 Asian, and L2 African varieties of the English language based on their occurrences in the corpus. The study identified 590 pandemic-related words drawn from the News on the Web (NOW) corpus dating from January 2020 to October 2021. The psychosocial category of the pandemic lexicon constitutes the biggest category of words identified from the corpus. The word-formation processes that operated in the production of the pandemic lexemes are compounds, blends, affixation, acronyms, and back-formation. L1 countries have the highest number of pandemic neologisms, prevalent or high-frequent pandemic lexemes, and unique word combinations. People produce neologisms as a coping mechanism to overcome various stressors and reflect their pandemic-related experiences.

J	Hua, T; Khalis, H; Said, NEM; Howe, OS				Hua, Tan Kim; Khalis, Hamdi; Said, Nur Ehsan Mohd; Howe, Ong Song			The Polarity of War Metaphors in Sports News: A Corpus-Informed Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						war metaphors; news sentiment; adjectives; collocation; sports corpus		War metaphors have long been used in sports news reporting. In reality, war metaphors are also used commonly in daily conversations. The wide usage of war metaphors in sports news reporting is because the two domains (i.e. war and sports) are comparable to each other, thereby enabling the use of war terms to describe the sports domain. Following a corpus-informed approach, the strength of modifiers (adjectives) in reversing or retaining the polarity of war metaphors and subsequently affecting news sentiment was examined. Sports news from the BBC Sports News, Malay Mail Online and the Malaysian Online Sports News Corpus, which amounted to 2.3 million words of sports texts, were subjected to corpus analysis. The UCREL Semantic Analysis System identified possible war terms in the corpora and Collocate 2.0 was used to locate adjectives and their respective collocates. Findings indicated that news writers do not necessarily use adjectives as a tool to negate the positive sentiment of news or intensify the negative sentiments.

J	Hieda, N; Jalaluddin, NH; Jaafar, MF				Hieda, Natsue; Jalaluddin, Nor Hashimah; Jaafar, Mohammad Fadzeli			Declining an Invitation in Japanese by Malay Informants: Analysis of Strategies and Politeness Effects	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Indonesian	Article						Declining an invitation; Politeness strategies; Social networking service; Semantic formulas; Intercultural communication	LANGUAGE	The declining of an invitation is an interesting speech act to study, especially when the language exchange takes place in an intercultural context. The objective of this study is to identify the refusal strategies used by Malay non-native speakers of Japanese as well as to clarify the "politeness effects" on the aforementioned strategies. The data for this study were obtained using open role-play through SNS and by post-task interviews. The study compared the frequency of semantic formula usage and the average usage of semantic formulas per capita between 20 native Malay speakers (MNSs) and 20 native Japanese speakers (JNSs). Comparisons were made in native as well as intercultural contexts. The politeness effects were determined based on the framework of Discourse Politeness Theory. As a result, the general strategies used by the MNSs in Japanese produced positive/neutral-politeness effects because the MNSs could adapt to the target language norms. The MNSs altered their approach to enhance negative politeness in intercultural contexts by reducing the number of semantic formulas and proactively increasing the use of {vague excuse} and {positive opinion} in response to the refusal strategies of the JNSs. The atypical strategies proposed by the MNSs were also accepted by the JNSs because the message recipients set wide "acceptable variations." A case of misunderstanding in intercultural contexts was also found due to the influence of different "home-party" images between the MNSs and the JNSs. This study proves the power of openness in the Malay community when the MNSs communicate in intercultural contexts.

However, the type of infection is different from influenza, avian flu, MERS-CoV or SARS. This new epidemic is known as the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later officially known as COVID-19. As a result of the spread of the disease, on March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention declared COVID-19 a pandemic. From the Linguistics perspective, this pandemic has rapidly germinated the corpus of the Malay vocabularies with the jargon and terms that relate to this virus crisis. For example, there are terms penjarakan sosial (social distancing), droplet, PPE, PKP and meratakan puncak lengkungan (flatten of the curve)'. There are even different terms that refer to a similar concept, such as nyahkuman and nyahvirus (for English term disinfection), and kadar peningkatan kes and lonjakan kes (for English term exponential spike). This may, of course, cause confusion for the user. Terminologically, the diversification of terms being coinaged needs to be taken into account to ensure that the terms are understood and used as these terms relate to the well-being of the community. In this regard, the study aims to analyse and describe the coinage of the terms related to COVID-19 that was initiated by the community. Working from the socioterminological framework, this study will use the Ministry of Health Malaysia press release texts issued from 16th January 2020 to 10th May 2020 as the data of the analysis. Then, the terms studied are compared to the terms in the DBP database, and the findings are analysed by using a socio-terminological approach. The results of the study recorded that 67.0% (96) terms used by the Ministry of Health Malaysia were already standardised by DBP. However, some terms are indeed new terms, their formation is compliant with the term formation guidelines, though not favourable among terminologists. Thus, the popular terms in usage among the community should be respected to ensure that the Malay language is constantly evolving.

The data was drawn from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA), i.e. the latest version with eight different genres. The findings indicate that the get-passive is a linguistic feature of informal English due to its highest frequency in spoken genres, e.g. TV and movie subtitles, and blogs. Furthermore, common verbs constituting the get-passive were explored and their meanings in context were analyzed. In agreement with previous studies, the semantic analysis of get-passives revealed a higher proportion of verbs expressing adversity, followed by those with positive and neutral meanings, respectively. The existence of non-adversative get-passive predicts a decline in the adversative type.

J	Prazmo, EM; Augustyn, R				Prazmo, Ewelina Maria; Augustyn, Rafal			Parasites, Herbivores and Dried Fish: Dehumanising Metaphorical Blends in Japanese	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						conceptual metaphor; dehumanising metaphor; conceptual blending; cognitive semantics; Japanese society	BEHAVIORAL IMMUNE-SYSTEM; DEHUMANIZATION	In the context of a vast body of research on the role and function of conceptual metaphor in linguistic representation of non-dominant or non-normative social groups, the present paper deals with metaphorical blending found in a number of expressions used to describe deliberately single people forming part of the Japanese society. Expressions such as parasaito shinguru ("parasite singles"), soshoku-kei danshi ("herbivorous men"), and himono onna ("dried-fish women") are used as labels designating particular groups of people who do not conform to conventional societal roles because of, for example, failing to marry and establish a family in, what is considered, due time. The Japanese language often reflects very conservative, conformist, and ritual-abiding attitudes and mindsets of its speakers and hence, is rife with derogatory expressions which serve to denigrate non-conforming elements of a society. The expressions analysed here are culturally-determined and mirror, at least partially, the mindsets and opinions of some of the Japanese speakers. The present paper is maintained within the methodological framework of cognitive semantics. We conduct a conceptual blending analysis of selected metaphorical expressions found in the Japanese discourse. We find a strong trend towards employing conceptual blends based on dehumanising, often animalising, metaphors in order to linguistically denigrate groups non-conforming to expected societal norms.

J	Goh, PSC				Goh, Pauline Swee-Choo			Preschool Teachers' Perspectives on Using English Language to Teach	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Preschool teachers; English language proficiency; teachers' perspectives, medium of instruction; gaps in language proficiency	LITERACY; INSTRUCTION; CHALLENGES; SKILLS	In the Malaysian National Preschool Standards-based Curriculum context, preschool teachers are being asked to use English as a medium of instruction for part of their teaching activities. However, there have been criticisms that low English language proficiencies among these teachers may have hindered their ability to provide meaningful educational experiences for the children in their care. Yet, little is understood about the language proficiency of these teachers in their own context. An explanatory mixed methods design has been used in the present study with data collected in two phases. In the quantitative phase, a survey is used to investigate 204 preschool teachers' current levels of English proficiency, the levels they think necessary for using it effectively, and the gap between the two levels. The qualitative phase uses semi-structured interviews with 12 preschool teachers. The preschool teachers believe that high or advanced language proficiency would be needed for its effective use. However, in the interviews, they also consider empathy for the children, a passion for teaching, the ability to make the class fun and interesting as equally important. There is also a lot of 'language switching' between English, the Malay language and the mother tongue to meet the requirements of the day's lesson. Although preschool teachers in general showed positive stances about the decision to use English for part of the instructional time, they also suggest that some form of benchmarks that address the kinds or levels of English language proficiency needed for its effective use would be useful.

J	Shin, C; Gedat, R; Mis, MA				Shin, Chong; Gedat, Remmy; Mis, Mohammed Azlan			A Comparative Study of Remun and Iban in Sarawak	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Remun; Iban; Persamaan; Perbezaan; Leksikal; Fonem		Ibanic is a Malayic language subgroup that exhibited the innovations of *-an, *-ang and *-ar to /-ay/. This language subgroup disperse in western Kalimantan (Indonesia) and Sarawak (Malaysia). In Sarawak, Iban is a well-known Ibanic language variety. Remun, which is also an Ibanic variety, on the other hand has been ignored by scholars. Based on literature reviews, so far there has been no in-depth description and investigation on the relationship between the Remun and Iban language. This study utilizes the descriptive approach to present the similarities and differences between these two languages. The descriptions are focused on lexical and phonology aspecst. The comparison between the lexical of Remun and Iban languages show that there are 82% of similarity within the 150 words compared. Based on the analysis on the phonemes of r and s, it is noticed that r appeared as /y/ in Remun but as /r/ in Iban language. For phomenes s, this study found that s appeared as /h/ in Remun and as /s/ in Iban. This phonological analysis indeed has presented additional evidence to prove that Remun is an Ibanic variety rather than a dialect of Iban although they share an 85% cognate. This study has able to present additional resources for the Iban Language Planning Unit in Sarawak and raise their awareness about the existence of Ibanic variations in this state. Since Iban language is taught as one of the core subjects in school, the awareness on the differences between Remun and Iban are very important to facilitate the learning of Iban language.

J	Lazim, NHBM; Jaafar, SRS				Lazim, Nor Hazila Binti Mat; Jaafar, Sharifah Raihan Syed			Deliquidation of Arabic Loanwords in Kelantan Dialect	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						Arabic; Optimality Theory; deliquidation; loanwords; Kelantanese dialect		Phonological modifications often apply to foreign phonemes in loanwords. Generally, foreign phonemes are replaced by nearest native phonemes. This is because each language has its own rules of onset, nucleus, coda as well as phonotactic system. Hence, this study aims to investigate the issue of Arabic loanwards in Kelantan dialect by focusing on the most dominant phonological modification, namely deliquidation process. Deliquidation refers to the phonological process of liquid consonant deletion which has sonorant features, namely /l/and /r/in the final coda position. This study uses a list of words containing 46 Arabic loanwords. A total of 15 native speakers of Kelantan dialect consisting of six males and nine females aged between 15 and 55 were asked to pronounce the words in the Kelantan dialect. The collected data were transcribed to examine the pattern of Arabic loanwords pronunciation in this dialect. Subsequently, the data were analysed by applying a phonological theory based on constraints hierarchy, namely Optimality theory. The findings show that ALIGN- LIQUID constraint plays a crucial role in explaining the issue of deliquidation where the lateral consonant /l/and rhotic /r/in the final position of the Arab loanwords were deleted as in /hala. l/into [hala.] and /fa.r/into [fa.a]. In the case of Arabic loanwords, the phonological process of deliquidation has dominantly affected the Arabic structure so as to conform to the phonological system of Kelantan dialect.

J	Mehrvand, A; Khorsandi, J				Mehrvand, Ahad; Khorsandi, Javad			"Anonymous Collectivity" and "Sly Civility": Postcolonial Defiance in a Satirical Short Story by Aziz Nesin	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Albert Memmi; "anonymous collectivity"; Aziz Nesin; Homi K. Bhabha; "sly civility"		Until a few years ago, Turkey was usually seen as irrelevant to colonial studies owing to its non-colonial status. More recently, however, there has been a more flexible approach to considering the possibility of studying modern Turkey under the heading of postcolonial studies. By acknowledging the socio-political similarities between Turkey and colonized countries, the current study employs a postcolonial framework to analyze a short story by a Turkish author. In doing so, Aziz Nesin's "Don't you have any Donkeys in your Country?" is studied to show how Nesin contributes to the political and socio-economic status of Modern Turkey and the highlighted controversy over the applicability of postcolonial perspectives to the Turkish context. The present study draws upon Albert Memmi's notion of "anonymous collectivity" and Homi K. Bhabha's "sly civility" as postcolonial means of indirect defiance, to identify the ways in which the narrative contributes to its contemporary milieu. We argue that throughout the story Nesin satirizes the so-called expert colonizer for his fundamentally false assumption about the naivete of the colonized nation. The story reflects that although the Turkish peasant has unconsciously internalized the colonialist ideology of "anonymous collectivity," the very same indirect means of defiance is consciously used by the peasant to overcome inequality and white supremacy in the sphere of selling Turkish carpets as one of the most prestigious products to the Western world. This study contributes to the literature on postcolonialism, first by raising the possibility of including modern Turkey in postcolonial studies, and then by examining Nesin's response towards the postcolonial-like ideology whereby it is concluded that oppression creates contradictions in the ostensible colonized/colonizer, impairing and reversing both groups' identity and humanity. We also conclude that the narrative reverses the dominant ideologies of clever and knowledgeable Americans by giving voice to a subaltern Turkish peasant whose goal is to resist the enduring effects of economic and cultural oppression.

J	Chang, TC				Chang, Tsung-chi			When Politics Meets Gender: Trauma in Edna O'Brien's House of Splendid Isolation	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						politics; trauma; Ireland; Edna O'Brien; House of Splendid Isolation	IRISH	The signing of the contentious Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 was a traumatic experience for many Irish people. This is not only because of the ensuing Irish Civil War, but the psychological adjustments that the Irish people have to make in their partitioned land. Since the Irish Republican Army (IRA) emerged during the Anglo-Irish War (1919-21), it has been bent on terminating the British government's control of Ireland and establishing a truly independent and unified Irish Republic through armed struggles. This traumatic history, which was embedded with the conflicts and compromises of such struggles, became a pivotal issue in many Irish writings. As a consequence, it helped shape subsequent Irish literature and culture when the dream of a free and unified Ireland was constantly recalled and reconfigured. These painful markings are reflected in complex ways in Edna O'Brien's fiction House of Splendid Isolation (1994), in which an IRA fugitive named McGreevy holes up and finally bonds with Josie O'Meara, an aged widow, in a dilapidated house. Apart from the political turmoil, considerable anguishes caused by love and marriage converge to entangle the protagonists' traumas. This paper focuses on how, by shifting between the multifarious narrative perspectives, O'Brien's House of Splendid Isolation stitches the interwoven personal, interpersonal, and national suffering together. In addition, the role women play in facilitating sympathetic understanding and reconciliation amid the violence and traumas in contemporary Ireland is discussed. The findings imply that, despite the ageold traumatic experiences caused by political conflicts in Ireland in the past few centuries, a trauma-free tomorrow via love and reconciliation, mostly with the help of women, is possible in contemporary Ireland.

J	He, MY				He, Mengyu			A Comparative Multidimensional Study of the English Translation of Lunyu (The Analects): A Corpus-based Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						multidimensional (MD) approach; Lunyu (The Analects); lexico-grammatical features; James Legge; Ku Hungming		Although Lunyu (The Analects) is well-known and often mentioned in Confucian scholarship, there have been no focused examinations of the comprehensive linguistic features of its English translations. This study seeks to report a comparative multidimensional investigation into the similarities and differences in the lexico-grammatical features of Lunyu (The Analects) translated by James Legge and Ku Hungming. The comparison is made along five functional dimensions (involved versus informational production, narrative versus non-narrative concerns, explicit versus situation-dependent reference, overt expression of persuasion, and abstract versus non-abstract information), and the prominent lexico-grammatical features (based on a 67-item feature set) in the two texts are singled out. It is found that there are more private verbs, present tense verbs, be as main verb, past tense verbs, third-person pronouns, and public verbs in Legge's The Analects of Confucius, whereas Ku's The Discourses and Sayings of Confucius uses nouns, adjectives, long words, nominalisations, and time adverbials more often. The identified differences in lexico-grammatical patterns are related to the distinct goals of the two translators. The results demonstrate that the multidimensional (MD) approach is effective in differentiating the linguistic features of the two translation versions and motivating a micro-analysis of the texts, seeking to discern the translators' underlying assumptions about the relations of Confucius and his followers. It is considered that these findings may have implications for the understanding of the translations of The Analects.

J	Lian, A; Pertiwi, WHS				Lian, Ania; Pertiwi, Widya Hanum Sari			Theorising for Innovation: Implications for English Language Teacher Education	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						research methodology; CALL research; innovation in CALL; literature review; language teacher education		The paper begins by acknowledging the complexity of the challenges that the introduction of the new international curriculum standards has brought with it. It also acknowledges the role that these policies have played in opening a space for pedagogic research and innovation in teaching programs. The paper argues that while policies are necessary to support change, transformation of practice is an evolutionary process, necessitating critical engagement with the vision that informs new policies, often requiring academics to confront the discourses which support their current practices and analyse the tensions that this process of confrontation may reveal. In relation to English language teacher education, one tension that this study brought into focus is the problem of research innovation. The issue is important since there is research to indicate that stagnation begins early, as a consequence of research training and examination practices. The paper develops a strategy for addressing the problem of research innovation, especially at the level of undergraduate education, and argues that fostering innovation can be as easy as enabling students to explore problems, rather than looking for textbook-based solutions that encourage intellectual compliance.

Following the establishment of the first Speech Sciences academic programme at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) in 1994, there is a need to develop language tests to assess children who might be at risk for language disorders and to provide remediation accordingly by professionals such as speech therapists. The present study aims to adapt a contemporary British English test: The New Reynell Developmental Language Scales (NRDLS) to Mandarin. Since NRDLS is widely-used to assess language comprehension and language production, the aim of the present research therefore is to propose adaptation of NRDLS to Mandarin. The present research also aims to provide preliminary norms (age of acquisition for target structures and errors) for the local children. Underlying factors which might influence child language development i.e. age, gender and socio-economic status (maternal education) are also examined. Using a cross-sectional study of 40 children aged 2;00-6;11, the present study aims to describe child language acquisition based on performance of the adapted NRDLS. The present results show that language skills advanced with age. Gender and maternal education do not affect child language development. Overall, children demonstrated a more superior language comprehension than language production. The adapted New Reynell Developmental Language Scales-Mandarin (NDRLS-M) is developmentally sensitive though further revisions are required. The present findings implicate an influence of universality and ambient language effects on acquisition of Mandarin. The present findings also implicate a need to develop a bilingual Mandarin-English version of NRDLS-M.

J	Yannuar, N; Iragiliati, E; Zen, EL				Yannuar, Nurenzia; Iragiliati, Emalia; Zen, Evynurul Laily			Boso Walikan Malang's Address Practices	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						colloquial language; Boso Walikan Malang; address terms; politeness; cultural value		Address practices in natural conversations are sociolinguistically significant, because they display speakers' socio-cultural values as well as the community's social structure and social change. Focusing on Boso Walikan Malang1 (bcsc wali?an malanan/, hereafter referred to as Walikan), a youth language spoken in Malang, this paper examines how address terms and politeness are practiced in a multilingual setting. Walikan is a colloquial variety of local Javanese and Indonesian that features word reversing (mlaku > uklam 'to walk'; makan > nakam 'to eat'). The youth language was specifically chosen as the focus of this study because it is an important symbol of the socio-cultural identity of the Arema (Arek Malang; the people of Malang). Looking at the underexplored topic of speech levels in youth language, the current research discusses the value of Walikan's address terms and how they are currently used to demonstrate the speakers' linguistic politeness. The analysis compares Walikan's address terms with those of Javanese and Indonesian, two dominant languages spoken in the area. Data for the current study were drawn from recordings, interviews, and observations conducted in an extensive fieldwork. The results of this study reveal a speakers' shift of value that is mainly prompted by a compromised common ground and social distance. The study argues that address practices in Walikan show different degree of politeness than that of Javanese and Indonesian.

J	Safaei, M				Safaei, Mohammad			Terrorism in Two Novelistic Appropriations of Hamlet	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						hamlet; ghost; appropriative literature; terrorism psychology; 9/11	SHAKESPEARE; 'HAMLET'	Shakespeare's Hamlet, as a revenge tragedy, demonstrates an ambience of terror. This ambience emerges in two works which have appropriated the play: The Story of Edgar Sawtelle by David Wroblewski (2009) and The Dead Fathers Club by Matt Haig (2006). However, the present article tends to presume the contemporary history, i.e. post 9/11 era, as the basis for investigating a variety of themes and relations between Hamlet and its two novelistic appropriations. Drawing upon the work of experts in terrorism psychology, I explore the psychological commonalities of the modern Hamlets, who can be distinguished by their isolation, vulnerability, and self-delusion. Attempts are also made to investigate the psychological bases for the juxtaposition of the specters in the two novels with the terrorist leadership in today's world. Appropriative literature is often denigrated for its lack of originality and being indebted to its canonical sources; such a reductionist assumption stems from our conception of appropriative literature as the recycling of previous literary works. This paper attempts to demonstrate that the two novels are not to be readily categorized as cultural or artistic reuse of Hamlet. In the same way that Hamlet reveals the political tensions of Elizabethan reign, its two modern appropriations can arguably reflect the social and psychological symptoms of terrorism in our era.

J	Aman, I; Awal, NM; Jaafar, MF				Aman, Idris; Awal, Norsimah Mat; Jaafar, Mohammad Fadzeli			Discourse Strategy of the Science and Technology Academic Texts	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						discourse strategy; discursive; textual; process; Theme		The presentation of knowledge is a strategic and unique action. It is stated so because the produced discourse conveys a specific area of knowledge, with a specific way and for a specific group of audience. The presentation of knowledge is also a part of communication process between addresser and addressee. This paper explores and analyses the discourse strategy of science and technology (S&T) academic text, which was written in Malay language and published in high impact and indexed journal. The study analysed the Introduction section of the academic texts only. The introduction is a very important section of the text where the writers place the track and direction of their writing. The S&T academic discourse was analysed from two dimensions, namely the discursive properties and textual features. Discursive analysis interprets the property of the text by means of intertextuality and content. Meanwhile, textual analysis describes the features of the text, namely types of process employed in sentences, pre-sentence adverbial type, type of sentences, and Theme type. The findings show that the strategy of introduction section adopted by S&T texts comprises the inclusion of issue and objective of the study, it utilizes intertextuality of stagnant paraphrase technique and situational, and point of view pre-sentence adverbials phrase, and prioritizing action process, simple and marked theme sentences. Identification and explanation of the strategy provides an insight into the S&T academia. This findings can also contribute to understand how the number of academic text published in high impact journal in the medium of the national language can be increased. Indirectly, it would also enrich publications and uphold the Malay language as a language of knowledge, besides benefitting the local students.

Perceived as one's belief in his or her own capabilities in accomplishing a particular task, it affirms that personal behaviours, thoughts, beliefs and environmental conditions pose great impact on achievement. However, in Arabic language learning, research on self-efficacy is still at its infancy, what more of an instrument which precisely measures self-efficacy in Arabic language learning environment. Hence, this paper aims at verification of a newlydeveloped instrument, Arabic Language Efficacy Questionnaire (ALEQ), as well as to explore the relationship between self-efficacy and Arabic language achievement. A sample of 234 undergraduate students majoring in Arabic language was exposed to ALEQ, and a set of tests to determine their achievement in reading, writing and grammar. A principal components analysis with varimax rotation yields a 3-factor solution with satisfactory psychometric properties. The Pearson's r correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between efficacy in reading, writing and grammar and students. achievement. Results clearly document that the ALEQ is a multidimensional measurement of Arabic language efficacy. It is concluded that although ALEQ has broad applicability, the scale herein may have relevance to the students. level of confidence in learning Arabic language and may be used in both research and teaching environments.

J	Ulfah, S; Mahamod, Z; Badusah, J				Ulfah, Syofia; Mahamod, Zamri; Badusah, Jamaludin			Expressive Interpersonal Communication Skill: Creating Righteous Teachers Of Indonesian Subject	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						expressive interpersonal communication; righteous teachers; Indonesian subject; teaching-learning process; case study		The aim of this study is to examine Teachers' Expressive Interpersonal Communication Skill (TEICS) in teaching-learning process of Indonesian classrooms. The focus is on teachers' interpersonal communication when the teacher begins the lesson, explains the lesson, and ends teaching-learning process. It is a case study which applies a qualitative approach involving five teachers of Indonesian subject. Data are collected by observational method, interview, and document analysis. Data are analyzed thematically by using NVivo. In general, the results of analysis showed that the teachers applied TEICS when they began the lesson, explained the lesson, and ended teaching-learning process and had different patterns of expressive interpersonal communication (EIC). However, the purpose is similar, that is, to develop students' learning attitude and enhance the students' understanding of the lessons. The finding indicates that when the teachers began teaching, EIC used are greeting, complimenting, and criticizing the students. During while-teaching, it is also found that teachers used EIC such as complimenting and giving feedback, mock-praising, threatening, and accusing the students. Furthermore, when the teachers are about to end the teaching-learning process, the EIC used are criticizing, accusing and greeting students. In conclusion, TEICS is not optimally used in the teaching-learning process in Indonesia because there are still negative EIC being employed by the teachers like criticizing, threatening, accusing, mock-praising, and alluding the students	[Ulfah, Syofia] Inst Agama Islam Negeri Imam Bonjol, Padang, Indonesia; [Mahamod, Zamri; Badusah, Jamaludin] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fak Pendidikan, Bangi, Malaysia	Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia	Ulfah, S (corresponding author), Inst Agama Islam Negeri Imam Bonjol, Padang, Indonesia.

The participants were a group of ten low proficient Arabic speakers of English and a group of ten high proficient Chinese and Arabic speakers of English. Data elicited from audio recordings of oral group discussions and a self- report questionnaire was used to identify communication strategies used. The findings showed that the subjects resorted to ten out of the twelve types of communication strategies specified by Tarone (1980), Faerch and Kasper (1983), and Willems (1987). The most frequently employed communication strategy was code switching; an interlingual strategy and the least used strategy was word coinage; an intralingual strategy. Further investigation indicated that different levels of oral proficiency influenced the use of communication strategies from two aspects. They are the frequency of use and the selection of types of communication strategies. This implies that international students studying at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) need to be made aware of the use of communication strategies depending on their level of proficiency and the fact that raising the awareness of both low proficient and also high proficient speakers to strategies thatare used by speakers of different proficiency levels may well help ease communication.

J	Chen, RLC				Chen, Richie			Spanish As The Kana For Taiwan Southern Min	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Holo; Hokkien; Southern Min; Spanish; Japanese Kana		Taiwan Southern Min is the mother language for over 16 million people in Taiwan. However, due to a lack of a proper educational system, the use of Southern Min is drastically decreasing. Orthographic systems such as those based on Latin alphabets designed by the European missionaries, Japanese syllabaries by the Japanese government and then Mandarin Phonetic Symbols by the current Kuomintang government have been proposed to transcribe Taiwan Southern Min, but none has become popular or practical enough for a language promotion purpose. Spanish is among the most popular languages in the world, and had once been used as the phonetic system for Southern Min during the 16th and 17th century. From the incunabula such as Doctrina christina en letra y lengua china, Southern Min was expressed in the Spanish way with the diacritical marks such as those for aspiration and nasalization being used sporadically. The author believes that is the result of the similarity between Spanish and Southern Min in terms of pronunciation. Since the pronunciation of Spanish can be precisely determined by its alphabet, Spanish may become a handy platform for romanizing Southern Min. To construct a phonetic system based on Spanish, the author started by simulating the orthographic system of a similar language, the Japanese. By including several minor adaptations such as (1) expressing aspiration and nasalization by h and (n) over tilde (2) introducing the sixth vowel or and (3) modifying the usage of ch, Spanish was proven to be able to simulate the pronunciation of Taiwan Southern Min as the Kana system is to Japanese.

To the nativists and cognitivists,input plays a minor role in language acquisition; however,more recent studies have shown that to a certain extent,the frequency and usage of lexical terms in children's linguistic environment do play a role in language development,especially when they involve interaction.This paper presents an investigation on the usage of eight Malay shape-based numeral classifiers in eleven caretaker-child interactions.A semi-structured elicited procedure was designed to stimulate the caretaker and child to interact with each other in a naturalistic setting.Since Malay numeral classifiers are most prominently observed in counting activities,an interactive game was designed to identify what numeral classifiers caretakers would choose to talk about more in a situation where all numeral classifiers had the same chance to be talked about.Caretakers' usage of numeral classifiers and their reactions to children's usage of numeral classifiers are highlighted in this paper.Results indicate that Malay numeral classifier usage is not pervasive in Malay caretaker-child interactions.They suggest that the degree of obligatoriness of numeral classifiers in the Malay grammar plays a role in caretakers' numeral classifier usage and their reactions to children's usage.

J	Egel, IP				Egel, Ilknur			The Yesterday And Today Of The European Language Portfolio In Turkey	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						European Language Portfolio; primary and secondary education		Concern for research in this area stems from the point that Turkey since 2001 has taken part in the piloting phase of the European Language Portfolio. After the piloting phase, the Ministry of Turkish National Education has decided to officially launch the European Language Portfolio in the academic year of 2009-2010. In Turkey, Ankara University and Bilfen Schools have also developed European Language Portfolio models and have had these models validated by the Council of Europe. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the development of European Language Portfolio models in Turkey. Firstly, the background of the situation on the formation of the European Language Portfolio by the Council of Europe is addressed. Secondly, the origin of the European Language Portfolio within the Turkish national education system is described. The next section dwells upon the issues relating to the present stage of European Language Portfolio implementation in Turkey. Positive outcomes of European Language Portfolio implementation in other Member States are shortly addressed. Finally, while the study illustrates that the European Language Portfolio has proved to be an important innovation in foreign language learning, the implementation change in Turkey necessitates sustained effort to promote the concepts of the European Language Portfolio so as to reach long lasting effects.

Two predominant positions have been categorized to reflect these conceptions. The first conception reflects a surface understanding of learning which includes storing, reproducing and increasing of knowledge On the other hand, a deep understanding of learning include construction of meaning and personal change. Numerous studies carried out have shown similar positions prevalent to different contexts of learning. However, these findings cannot apply a universality of meanings since different types of learning produce different conceptions of learning. Hence, the paper highlights findings from a study involving LEP learners in a higher institution and investigate further their conceptions of reading within an ESL reading context. The findings from open-ended questions and a survey reveal qualitative similarities and differences in these LEP learners' conceptions of reading. In addition, the paper further discusses the implications of the findings and some pedagogical considerations for the teaching and learning of reading within an ESL context.

Nevertheless, most studies on risk management have yet to place much emphasis on language use nor move-step structure employed in the report since more attention is given to the risks faced by the institutions and how they are solved. This preliminary study aims to explore the move-step structure of risk management reporting in the RMR. To achieve this aim, genre analysis was utilised as a method to investigate how language was used in specific contexts to achieve their communicative purposes. Five RMR of an Islamic bank operating in Malaysia were obtained from its official website and analysed for their communicative content as demonstrated by the move-step constructs. The findings revealed that the RMR adhered to five moves. The findings provide an insight into how an Islamic financial institution's reputation is constructed through the appropriations of the textual conventions in the reports. The present study will benefit researchers and readers of RMR.

J	Hadi, NHA; Asl, MP				Hadi, Nurfarah Hadira Abdul; Asl, Moussa Pourya			The Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic: A Lacanian Reading of Ramita Navai's City of Lies	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Life writing; Iran; identity formation; Ramita Navai; Lacan		Contemporary life writings of Iranian diaspora are often censured for promoting a universalizing, dehumanizing and hegemonic image of the nation. The common misgiving is that the narratives project Iranian women as archetypal victims and their male counterparts as essentially powerful subjects. The present study aims at problematizing this assumption by arguing that Ramita Navai's City of Lies (2014) portrays an anti-essentialist character sketch of individuals with diverse identities and complex subjectivities. To pursue this line of argument, this article examines the titular characters' development in the face of the existing tensions between the different psychic and social realities. Lacan's triadic model of the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic is used in relation to his notion of the mirror stage to analyze the ways in which the characters traverse between the three orders in the process of forming a sense of selfhood. The notion of selfhood is explored in light of latent desires, anxieties, and the feelings of loss as determining factors behind the psychic development of each character within the prevailing normativities of a heteropatriarchal government. The findings reveal that while Amir, Leyla, Asghar, Bijan, and Farideh find themselves permanently lost in the unconscious tensions between different psychic orders. Dariush, Morteza, and Somayeh break into the Symbolic order and reassert their subjectivity. In this manner, the life writing challenges the grand narratives about Iranians as a homogenous group of people as it offers an equal chance of attaining selfhood and subjectivity to both male and female characters.

Dhayapari; Pillai, Shanthini; Perry, Melissa Shamini			Semiotic Technology as Material Resonance of Postcolonial Aesthetics in Digital Children's Picture Book Apps	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						postcolonial aesthetics; material resonance; children's picture book apps; semiotic technology; Malaysian identity	SOCIAL MEDIA	Children's literatures presently are produced widely through media production either as remediation of printed stories or originally produced in digital form. The current most sought after digitized communicative practice of the media is the digital children's picture book app due to its multimediality and interactivity. This quality of the picture book app paves the path for an aesthetic and cultural transformative exchange. However, these digital children's picture book apps have been found to contain diversity and multicultural gaps. Furthermore, the noncognitive/affective quality of these interactive digital book apps that is evoked through senses like touch, hearing and sight needs further investigation. Hence, through a qualitative approach, the digital children's picture book app version of the Malaysian animated series Upin and Ipin: Storybook: The Rain and The Sea Part 1 was selected as case study for this paper. Selection criteria consisted of three aspects; narration being in English and contained Semiotic Technology i.e. digitized meaning-making modes, the contents reflect characters, symbols and narratives that portray Malaysian culture, history and identity. The research reveals a postcolonial aesthetic that extensively operates based on the ideologies of the dominant class or culture through the representations of ethnic nationalism. This shows a builtin intrinsic value according to the context of the dominant culture that can be found in the aesthetic engagement in the transcultural space of this picture book app. This article contributes to scholarship cross-cultural engagement in the affective space of postcolonial digital picture books.

J	Afzal, MH; Pakri, MRM; Abdullah, NFL				Afzal, Malik Haroon; Pakri, Mohamad Rashidi Mohd; Abdullah, Nurul Farhana Low			Pre-9/11 Politics of Islamophobia and Hanif Kureishi's The Black Album (1995)	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Islamophobia; New Historicism; Literary vs Non-literary Texts; Historical Development; Power		The rising tide of Islamophobia and the consequent acts of violence pertaining to it over the past couple of years, is inflicting misery on Muslims living across the globe. This situation calls for a clear understanding of the phenomenon of Islamophobia. Using the New Historicist approach, this paper embarks on reading Hanif Kureishi's The Black Album (1995) in the backdrop of the politics of Islamophobia in the pre-9/11 context. It thus attempts to highlight the working of the West-driven anti-Muslim political and literary discourse prevalent during the pre-9/11, or post-Cold-War era. The application of Stephen Greenblatt's thesis of power, subversion and containment enables us to examine the selected novel by situating it within the actual political discourse prevalent during the time of its production to examine its treatment of the Western political narrative of Islamophobia. The study finds that since the 1990s, the West has been relying heavily on the political discourse that intensifies the narrative of Islamophobia in order to contain the subversion it encountered in the form of rising Muslim influence and immigration crises in the West. In the case of literary discourse however, we suggest that while The Black Album (1995) may seem to comply to the Western narrative of Islamophobia, it also offers sights of subversion to the anti-Muslim narrative by exposing Western bias and racist tendencies; and, in return, it ultimately demands negotiation and change.

J	Phoocharoensil, S				Phoocharoensil, Supakorn			Multiword Units and Synonymy: Interface between Collocations, Colligations, and Semantic Prosody	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						synonymy; collocation; colligation; semantic prosody; semantic preference	ENGLISH	Appropriate use of near-synonyms in English often poses difficulty for learners. This study aims to compare and contrast the near-synonyms predict and foresee, focusing on genres, collocations, colligations, and semantic prosody which specifically characterize each synonymous verb. The study consulted the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA), i.e. the largest corpus representing American English (Davies, 2020), for the distribution of the target synonyms across genres and the top-20 noun collocates the MI-score of which is 3 or above. The total frequency of predict in the corpus is far higher than that of foresee. Of all the eight genres of COCA, predict is the most common in academic texts, whereas the highest number of occurrences of foresee is found in webpages. Interestingly, both target synonyms are not characteristic of colloquial English as their frequencies in speaking, fiction, and TV and movie subtitles are relatively low. The data from COCA also reveal that both synonymous verbs are common in written English, with predict being far higher in frequency. Although sharing certain object noun collocates, it is indicated through semantic prosody, i.e. occurrences of adjacent collocates and surrounding lexical items, that foresee is associated with negative connotations, while predict does not primarily express adversity. As near-synonyms of each other, the target words share colligational patterns. However, two corpus-informed syntactic structures, i.e. foresee + somebody + V.ing and predict + somebody + to-infinitive, clearly distinguish between both verb synonyms. It is concluded from the corpus data that predict and foresee are near-synonyms rather than absolute synonyms since they clearly differ in connotations and collocational/colligational patterns.

J	Lim, JMH; Chung, VL				Lim, Jason Miin-Hwa; Chung, Vui-Lin			Arousing Readers' Interest: An Inquiry into Chinese Argumentative Essays	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Genre analysis; language for academic purposes; Chinese language; teaching materials; argumentative essays	JUSTIFICATIONS; ENGLISH	Arousing readers' interest constitutes a major component in argumentative essays, but how writers use language resources to capture readers' interest in the written discourse remains a fascinating area for a qualitative exploration. Based on a genre-based analytical framework, the researchers studied the salient linguistic resources used by professional writers to attract readers' attention to their argumentative essays. Additional information was elicited from specialist informants to examine the circumstances under which the rhetorical move was used. It was found that writers arouse readers' interest using five different strategies aimed at highlighting recent unusual situations, underscoring current relevance of alarming situations, reporting attention-grabbing observations, indicating rapid changes in the modern era, and foregrounding the severity of the problems encountered. Apart from identifying writers' appeals in the five communicative functions, the researchers ascertained how writers vividly depict situations using a range of salient language resources, particularly temporal adverbials signalling noteworthy situations during previous time periods, noun phrases accentuating the significance of specific circumstances, and adjectival modifiers highlighting abundance or prevalence. Aside from illustrating how writers deploy four-character idiomatic expressions indicating deteriorating situations and rapid social transformations, this paper will reveal how writers capture readers' attention by using adjectival phrases denoting the severity of situations, verb phrases signalling undesirable behaviours, and predicator-object structures denoting annoying habits. Recommendations are given on how instructors can use a broad array of rhetorical strategies and language resources to design exercises aimed at helping learners to aptly attract readers' attention to their argumentative essays.

J	Saidalvi, A; Samad, AA				Saidalvi, Aminabibi; Samad, Adlina Abdul			Online Peer Motivational Feedback in a Public Speaking Course	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						motivational peer feedback; online learning; online peer feedback; peer feedback; public speaking	STUDENTS; ATTITUDES	Providing peer feedback is commonly practiced in teaching and learning of public speaking courses. However, there is limited research examining peer motivational feedback in an online setting. This study adopted a qualitative, descriptive approach using document analysis to investigate the frequencies of peer motivational feedback which students' use in a public speaking course within an e-learning system of a local university. In addition, the specific public speaking skills and the nature of the feedback offered by students were also examined. Twenty-three final year undergraduate students video recorded their speeches, uploaded their videos, offered and received online peer feedback in the e-learning platform. All of the recorded online peer feedback went through a thorough classification process to identify, arrange, and systemize into the specified types of feedback. The data was examined at three levels of analysis to ensure concrete conclusions were drawn. Frequencies and examples of online peer motivational feedback were also presented. The results indicated that students provide relatively more motivational feedback on delivery and voice control skills, while paying less attention to language and proficiency skills. The process of giving and receiving feedback has acted as individualized feedback in which peers helped clarify the goal, criteria and expected standards of good performance. Thus, this study suggests that online peer motivational feedback could be used as a form of practice in the teaching of online public speaking courses due to its ability to motivate and sustain students' interest in learning public speaking while creating a student-centered learning environment.

J	Cho, S; Park, C				Cho, Sookyung; Park, Chanho			Students' Responses to Tutor Feedback: Focusing on Their Writing and Perceptions	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						student response; tutor feedback; incorporation of feedback; feedback type; feedback style	FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; WRITERS; L1	Studies on students' responses to tutor feedback have been conducted in large scales, in particular, focusing on students' perceptions of tutor feedback. However, few of these studies have examined how students respond to tutors' written feedback in their writing. In order to broaden the understanding of a student's response to a tutor's feedback, this study examines tutors' written feedback, students' writings, and their perceptions of the feedback. Based on this examination, this study aims to see what types of tutor feedback do students incorporate in their revisions and what the students think of tutor feedback. The participants were 11 tutors and 18 college students. Each student received tutor feedback on two writing assignments-a compare-and-contrast essay and an argumentative essay- and filled out a questionnaire that asked about their experiences with the feedback they received. The analysis of students' writing and tutor feedback reveal that error type and feedback type seem to affect a student's incorporation of feedback; in particular, students incorporated content-oriented, indirect, and coded types of feedback more than the other feedback types. The questionnaire data show that most students valued the tutor feedback; however, low incorporators had more problems in incorporating tutor feedback. Based on these results, suggestions on tutor feedback and implications for future studies are discussed.

J	Hamid, HA; Nasri, NF; Ghazali, N				Hamid, Huzaifah A.; Nasri, Nur Farhana; Ghazali, Norlizawati			Colours as a Form of Corrective Feedback in EFL Learners' Writing	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						colour corrective feedback; EFL; writing; grammatical errors; performance	ERROR-CORRECTION; HYPOTHESIS; LANGUAGE	The study aims to explore the effect of colours as a form of corrective feedback in EFL learners' writing and how the foregrounding of such feedback is related to the learners' performance in EFL acquisition. Data were collected from a group of EFL learners, in which majority of them came from the Middle East countries. A pre-test and a post-test were conducted to determine the types of grammatical errors that they committed the most. The result of the study revealed that colour corrective feedback was found to be effective in increasing learners' awareness which had improved learners' performance in writing. After receiving corrective feedback in the form of colours, it was found that grammatical errors, specifically mechanical and morphological errors committed by the learners had decreased tremendously whereas in terms of semantic errors, the number of errors had increased. This result supports the notion of Noticing Hypothesis whereby learning is effective when the errors are noticed. The use of colours in highlighting specific errors was also found to assist learners to progress further and faster in the learning process as the types of errors committed can immediately be identified. This study enlightens the usage of colour-coded system as a form of indirect corrective feedback for language instructors specifically in EFL context. Thus, the pedagogical implication of this study is that colours could be used as a form of indirect corrective feedback due to its ability to immediately direct students' focus towards specific grammatical errors.

Hence, the ability to read online effectively is becoming increasingly important, as students need to utilize, understand and respond to online materials. However, most university undergraduates lack the ability to read effectively and critically. Therefore, the present study examines university students' metacognitive online reading strategies and navigational strategies in reading English Science and Technology hypertexts for academic purposes. Data were collected through an online survey among 55 Science and Technology students in a public university situated in the east coast of peninsular Malaysia to identify the most frequent metacognitive online reading strategies used by the students. The survey revealed that students used problem-solving strategies the most followed by global and support reading strategies. Out of the same sample, 12 students were purposively selected to be a part of qualitative data collection on navigational strategies that was conducted through individual screen recordings captured through a screen recording software. The software recorded the on-screen activities while students were using an interactive reading system named iREAD; Interactive Reading for Academic Disciplines. Based on the screen recordings, it can be observed that students mostly used mixed overview strategies followed by serial overview strategies, and serial navigational strategies when reading online materials. The findings concluded the need to teach students metacognitive awareness in order to read online materials successfully to make learning more efficient, meaningful and beneficial.

J	Sera'ai, AM; Aman, I; Shabudin, M				Sera'ai, Azlina Mohd; Aman, Idris; Shabudin, Maserah			The Mastery of Writing Spanish Thematic Progression Feature by Non Native	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						thematic progression; writing; Spanish; theme and rheme; correlation	STUDENTS	Thematic progression refers to how an idea is expanded from one sentence to another in a text. Therefore, thematic progression is an important element in writing production. Studies on writing have mostly focused on the linguistic, learning and teaching, and experimental study. However, studies on thematic linguistic dimension have only discussed the thematic progression surrounding a text without taking into account other variables such as student category, while studies on text production as a foreign language other than English are limited and do not explore the relationship between the language proficiency with the use of thematic progression. Therefore, this study aims to explain the mastery of thematic progression in narrative texts produced by non-native advanced students of Spanish based on students' category and to identify their relationship with language achievement. This study analyses 30 narrative texts which involves 106 paragraphs. The movement of ideas in each paragraph is analysed based on the thematic progression scheme outline, Rheme Regression, Rheme Iteration, Mix Theme, Box Development and Pair to Single Development. The findings reveal that all categories of students utilize Mix Theme dominantly without paying attention to the genre of writing. Student category, in fact do not play a role nor influence the construction of their thematic progression. No significant correlation was found between thematic progressions with the language achievement. These findings prove that the thematic progression is capable as an effective technique to teachers and students to form and develop a coherent writing.

J	Achachelooei, EM; Leon, CE				Achachelooei, Elham Mohammadi; Leon, Carol Elizabeth			The God-Human Relationship in Octavia Butler's "The Book of Martha"	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Posthumanism; post-Biblical; Octavia Butler; "Book of Martha"; Daphne Hampson	SCIENCE-FICTION	This article explores the relationship between God and a posthuman representative of humanity in Octavia Butler's "The Book of Martha" (2005). Using Daphne Hampson's feminist post-Biblical ideas, the article argues that the story, as a sample of science fiction, exposes a posthumanist perspective where existence and subjectivity of human kind is defined based on a mutual, non-hierarchical relationship between human being and God. The article aims to explore the capacity of the story to embody a positive standpoint of science fiction towards the transformation of the human. This article suggests that "The Book of Martha," reflecting this transformation together with an unothered perspective of the God-human relationship, illustrates the potential for a more humanitarian life on Earth. The relationship is investigated through an unorthodox theological perspective that confronts Christian norms, particularly the norms dealing with what is considered as true femininity. In this way, the story describes a fictional space in which the Christian concept of human as a fallen, condemned, and passive object before a ubiquitous Almighty is substituted with a non-Christian active concept of the human entity. This active representation is based on the recognition of a posthuman agency which is free from surrender to divine power. "The Book of Martha" is about the gradual awakening of a black woman who, in interaction with God as the source of goodness, becomes aware for the need to redefine an authentic sense of self beyond that of an obedient servant before a masculinized God. This article explores this awakening.

J	Cho, H				Cho, Hyeyoung			Two Faces of Collaboration: A Critical Perspective on Effects of Collaboration in Learners' Corpus Consultation	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						learners' corpus consultation; collaborative learning; two-sides of collaboration; pedagogic mediation; critical perspective	STUDENTS; WORK	Collaborative learning has been increasingly incorporated into learners' corpus consultation as a type of pedagogic mediation. However, studies found that collaborative learning has negative aspects as it may cause conflicts and power inequality among members. Given the two sides of collaboration, this study provides a critical investigation on the functions of collaboration in learners' corpus consultation. Through two collaborative corpus analysis sessions, three students of different L2 proficiency levels assisted each other's understanding of corpus data to complete group activities. The students' verbal and nonverbal behaviors during corpus analysis became the main source of investigation, complemented by the results of pre-/post-interviews and the researcher's direct observations. The findings of this study suggest that collaboration creates significant power inequality among the participants by gradually marginalizing the less capable student in the group from the learning process and increasing the psychological burden for the most capable student. In addition, collaborative work during corpus consultation could impede critical learning opportunities for individual students to pursue personal queries during collaboration. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study provide a realistic picture of collaboration in learners' corpus consultation and suggest pedagogical implications to corpus-based instruction.

J	Bolte, S; Keong, YC				Bolte, Stef; Keong, Yuen Chee			The Refugee Swap Deal in Malaysian Online News Reports: Ideology and Representation	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						critical discourse; ideology; refugees; asylum seekers; immigrants		Using Critical Discourse Analysis, this study attempts to examine the representation of Refugees, Asylum Seekers and Immigrants (henceforth RASIM) in news reports from three selected English online newspapers in Malaysia: The Star, The New Straits Times (NST) and Malaysiakini. This research aims to reveal the representations of RASIM and attempts to unravel the ways in which ideology and context shape the discourse surrounding RASIM. The focus of the article is the Refugee Swap Deal between Australia and Malaysia that was announced in 2011. Although the Refugee Swap deal did not take place, the media discourse provided distinctive information about discursive strategies that media draw upon to represent RASIM. The general characteristics of the news reports disclose that there are ideological differences at play and that three main themes are frequently utilised to attribute certain characteristics to RASIM: refugee protection, people smuggling and human trafficking, and policy and national security. In Malaysian media, the reporting on RASIM has been framed according to the political stance of newspapers: in a positive supportive way by the government linked media, The NST and The Star, and in a more balanced way in the alternative, or non-government linked media, Malaysiakini. These reporting styles show differences in situational context and ideology that shaped the discourse of the newspapers, contributing significantly to the portrayal of RASIM in particular ways.

Factors that influence the transfer of messages contained in the mentifacts are also discussed. The research corpora are obtained from the novel Sungai Mengalir Lesu and its translation, Lazy River. This study utilizes the concept of situational meaning as proposed by Larson (1984) as well as the concept of semantic translation as proposed by Newmark (1981) to scrutinize the reproduction of the thoughts contained within the message of the mentifacts found in the translated text. Herkovits' (1970) concept of culture is also utilized in order to identify the elements of mentifacts in the source text. Researcher found that the mentifacts that exist in the culture of both the source and target languages are prone to fulfil the function of the text, at once making it reproducible in the translated text. The messages that are lost during the translation of mentifacts can be counteracted with additional information in the context of presence. However, because it is difficult to obtain sameness in terms of the thoughts that underlie a cultural element in two different languages, the message of the mentifacts cannot be transferred accurately from the source text into the translated text. Not only does this evoke the issue of loss of meaning, it also causes the target readers to suffer a loss as they cannot get to know the real culture in the source text	[Marekan, Nur Hafeza Binti Ahmad; Seong, Goh Sang] Univ Sains Malaysia, Terjemahan & Interpretasi Pusat Pengajian Ilmu Ke, Bahagian Bahasa Malaysia, George Town, Malaysia	Universiti Sains Malaysia	Marekan, NHBA (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Terjemahan & Interpretasi Pusat Pengajian Ilmu Ke, Bahagian Bahasa Malaysia, George Town, Malaysia.	feza_haydie@yahoo.com; gohss@usm.my						Amzah Normalis, 2008, THESIS; Aveling H., 1981, LAZY RIVER; Fellmann J.

J	Stapa, SH; Shaari, AH				Stapa, Siti Hamin; Shaari, Azianura Hani			Understanding Online Communicative Language Features In Social Networking Environment	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						online communicative language; social networking environment; Facebook; online literacy; online conversations		This paper discusses the findings of a research study that seeks to investigate the language features and patterns of online communicative language amongst young Malaysian Facebook users. The acquisition of online literacy might create a gap or linguistic disparity that distinguish the young online users from the older generations who are not used to online communication environment hence, it is due to the same concern that led to the departure of this study. With the corpus of over 500,000 words of Online Communicative Language derived from a one year of Facebook conversations among 120 young Malaysians from different ethnic groups, mother tongues, and cultural background, it is hoped that the study will shed light into the new patterns of Online Communicative Language among young Malaysians that somehow signifies a reconstruction of an online identity among the young users; regardless of their cultural differences and backgrounds. Virtual Ethnography was employed, which involved daily observations and documentations of actual conversations on Facebook in a period of 12 months. Data were analyzed using Content Analysis in examining the features and patterns employed by the participants. The findings of the study suggest that the features used by these online users are spelling innovations and modifications, combinations of letter and number homophone, reduction or omission of vowels, replacement of <s> with < z>, the use of one letter to represent a word, the use of playful jargons, the used of acronyms and abbreviations and the use of emoticons. As a conclusion, language evolution is seen as an ongoing process and the development of online communicative language is always unpredictable even though it might originated from a re-thinking process of some old spelling conventions in media and not language that derived on its own.

The varieties studied were Standard Mandarin, colloquial Mandarin, Hokkien and Cantonese. The instruments used for data collection consisted of matched-guise test (indirect method) and questionnaire (direct method). A total of 403 respondents took part in this survey. Results yielded from the matched-guise tests with supporting evidence from feedback through questionnaires suggest that social factors, namely age group and socioeconomic status do influence evaluations towards the varieties. Generally, Standard Mandarin and Cantonese were rated 'high' and 'positive' consistently for both the dimensions of status and solidarity, while the ratings for Hokkien and colloquial Mandarin were more prominent in the solidarity dimension.

The survey was a part of a front-end analysis for the design and development of an online Arabic vocabulary games prototype. It elicited learners' attitude towards Arabic language learning, their attitude towards playing ordinary video games and perceptions of utilizing online games in Arabic language learning. The descriptive quantitative and open-ended survey was distributed among 113 out of 133 learners, taking Arabic language course in an academic semester. The results showed positive level of pre-acceptance among learners' support and value-addedness of online games were also pronounced in the suggestions put forward by the participants.

J	Yamin-Ali, J				Yamin-Ali, Jennifer			Translating Concerns Into Action In The Foreign Language Classroom	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						teacher research; foreign language; communicative competence; teacher education; foreign language acquisition		This study highlights the concerns and research findings of 11 foreign language (FL) student teachers in the secondary school system in a developing country. They were in-service student teachers who were required to engage in action research as part of their professional preparation. Their research experience enabled them to develop new ways of approaching their concerns with regard to developing the communicative competence of their students. In the first instance, action research prompted them to identify a concern in their classrooms. The tools of action research facilitated their exploration of these concerns in that each had to translate the concern into an intervention which they monitored and reported on. The study reports on what these student teachers identified as concerns and why, and describes the teacher's intervention in each case. Each teacher's findings are also reported. What is noteworthy is the potential value of action research as a tool for any teacher since the study includes varied types of schools and varied levels.

Sixty one students of similar writing ability were chosen as the participants of this study. They were divided into two groups. The experimental group received the treatment i.e. portfolio assessment while the control group underwent the traditional assessment. The results of data analysis revealed that the students in the portfolio assessment group outperformed the students in the control group in their overall writing ability and in the sub-skills of focus, elaboration, organization and vocabulary. To triangulate the quantitative data, students' views and reflections about portfolio assessment were elicited via semistructured interviews. The qualitative data underwent thematic analysis and the major extracted themes were discussed. The findings suggest that portfolio assessment empowers students' learning of English writing, hence emphasizing the formative potential of portfolio assessment in EFL classes. The results have some implications for teaching and assessment of L2 writing.

The ultimate aim of a paperless world may be far fetched at present but as a means of information dissemination towards an e-community on campus, an e-forum discussion supports e-learning due to the fact that students' online participation could be more effective compared to classroom discussion. This article discusses a descriptive analysis of an e-forum and its aims of discussion based on three selected topics posted on the eforum. The focus is on the frequency of students' participation, level of confidence and their contribution in achieving the aims of an e-forum. This qualitative analysis considers students as a contributing factor for the success of using a learning portal and finalises with suggestions based on the conclusion derived.

However, studies that involved communicative acts have mainly focused on examining the language mode. It overlooked the multimodal perspective which hinder prospective international medical tourists from receiving the intended promotional messages. This study, therefore, aims to examine multimodal realisations of representative and commissive communicative acts in Thailand's private hospital website. Within Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) perspective, Halliday & Matthiessen's model of textual analysis (2004) and Danes' classification of thematic patterns (1974) were utilised for language analysis, while Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) framework was adopted for visual analysis. Three webpages from a Thai private hospital website were analysed in relation to theme types and thematic progression for textual function in language analysis, and information value, saliency and framing elements for compositional function in visual analysis. Results based on the analysis of the communicative acts in the selected webpages aimed to inform and persuade prospective medical tourists. The multimodal communicative acts created a technologically established, sophisticated, reliable and caring representation of Samitivej Hospital through the high occurrence of unmarked themes, reiteration patterns, salient visuals and absence of framing. The findings provided communicative strategies to promote medical tourism to copywriters, website designers and medical tourism stakeholders in designing such websites.

J	Awal, NM; Bakar, KA; Rahman, ANCA; Abdullah, IH				Awal, Norsimah Mat; Bakar, Kesumawati A.; Rahman, Anis Nadiah Che Abdul; Abdullah, Imran Ho			Representations of Halal and Haram in Malaysian Parliamentary Discourse	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						halal; haram; Malaysian Hansard Corpus; parliamentary discourse; corpus-driven approach	SATISFACTION	The issues related to halal and haram are very important for the Muslim community in Malaysia because they are related to various social and cultural aspects such as relationships, clothing, food and business. Many people view the issues related to halal and haram as what is allowed and forbidden in Islam, and the views are often associated with food and socialization. Based on the dynamics of these two concepts in daily life, this study aims to investigate the representations of halal and haram in Malaysian parliamentary discourse through corpus-driven analysis to examine how and in what context both concepts are debated in the parliament. This objective is achieved by looking at the trend of frequency and use of halal and haram in the context of the discourse of the Malaysian Parliament and subsequently the semantic evolution of these two terms from legal perspective and later associated with commodity. The data of this study was obtained from the Malaysian Hansard Corpus (MHC) which covers Parliament 1 (1959-1964) to Parliament 13 (2013-2018) and is approximately 157 million words in size. The findings of the study indicate differences in the usage patterns of halal and haram in MHC. Initially, halal was associated with Islamic concepts and laws. However, the use of halal has expanded into several domains such as business, tourism, cosmetics and ecosystems. This clearly indicates the efforts to make halal as the way of life. The use of haram, on the other hand, is often associated with domains such as activities, objects and groups of people. The usage patterns show the function of haram as an adjective that changes the value of a noun from neutral to negative in Malaysia. A closer examination of the words that frequently appear along with halal and haram in the MHC shows a trend of its widespread use and at the same time displays variations of meaning in parliamentary discourse spanning a period of almost 60 years.

J	Samaha, H; Teng, YT; Rajandran, K				Samaha, Hanaa; Teng, Yap Teng; Rajandran, Kumaran			Reverse and Reserve: A Cardiff Grammar Account on Reversibility in Equational Clauses in Modern Standard Arabic	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Cardiff Grammar; Equational Clauses (ECls); Modern Standard Arabic; reversibility; semantics; syntax	VERBLESS; COPULA	The sequence of clause elements not only determines the syntactic relations of categories but also recognizes the semantic and pragmatic roles associated with them. Therefore, this paper aims to examine reversibility in verbless Equational Clauses (ECls) by investigating the syntactic, experiential (Transitivity), and textual (thematic and informational) features of the The data consists of 138 ECls collected from twelve articles in seven daily newspapers, out of which thirty-one ECls have been identified as reversed. The findings have revealed that Subject and Complement can be optionally reversed in ECls to achieve discourse purposes. In this case, when optional reversibility represents the Unmarked Participant Role Theme, the reversed elements retain none of their syntactic, experiential, thematic, and informational meanings. But when optional reversibility reflects the Marked Participant Role Theme, the reversed elements retain their syntactic and experiential functions but not necessarily their thematic and informational meanings. On the other hand, obligatory reversibility has been argued to stem from the syntactic constraints concerning the violation of the definiteness norm and the pragmatic factors. Finally, the paper concludes that the association of the 'Theme' concept with what comes early in the clause should not be taken as a universally unified concept applied to all languages. The findings imply that in designing syllabi for language learning and teaching, learners should be made aware of the significant interplay of linguistic and extra-linguistic factors that cause the inversion of the clause elements. This would probably help them reflect on understanding the sentences they receive and produce in different contexts.

J	Nguyen, TH; Anh, KH				Trang Huynh Nguyen; Khau Hoang Anh			Investigating Teachers' and Graduates' Remarks on the Translation of English Modals into Vietnamese Provided by Google Translate	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Google Translate; English modal verbs; social functions; remark; Vietnamese		Due to demands of using English for work, study and entertainment, more Vietnamese people have tended to use Google Translate to help translate English into Vietnamese and vice versa. This tool has become popular in these situations. However, can this tool translate English modal verbs expressing social functions into Vietnamese? To obtain the data for the study, the authors used the English source extracted from the grammar course book by Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman (1999) which was fed into Google Translate for their Vietnamese versions. The source was related to making requests, giving advice, expressing potential realization, expressing desire, giving invitation and making preference. The study also recruited 11 experienced Vietnamese-speaking teachers of English and 21 Vietnamese-speaking graduates of English to give their remark on these translation texts which were sent to them via email and the social media platform Zalo. The findings showed that Google Translate was able to keep the intended meanings of many social functions through using the English modal verbs when transferring these functional texts into Vietnamese. The results also uncovered that most of the teachers and graduates agreed with these translated texts provided by Google Translate.

J	How, C; Jan, JM				How, Cherish; Jan, Jariah Mohd			Speech Act of Concern on the Academic Performance of Malaysian Foster Children	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Speech act of concern; stages of concern; foster children; academic needs; Malaysia	LANGUAGE; LEARNERS	Language is vital in expressing concern as it allows one to explain their feelings, ideas and behaviour. Teachers and caregivers are concerned about the poor academic performance of foster children as these children have low grades on tests and high dropout rates. Those with poor academic performance might be vulnerable to secure a better life when they leave home. Nevertheless, studies on concern in regards to Malaysian foster children's academic issues from a language perspective are scarce. Hence, this qualitative study uses speech act categories and stages of concern to examine the voices of concern, of teachers and caregivers towards the academic performance of foster children. The data were collected from semi-structured interview sessions with teachers and caregivers. Findings reveal that teachers and caregivers are highly concerned about the poor academic performance of foster children as their responses are most prominent in the stage of refocusing. They attempted to reach out to address foster children's academic needs by giving suggestions. However, they face challenges in addressing these children's academic needs and issues. Representative act is highly utilised by teachers and caregivers to describe, report or explain about problems in trying to help the children. This study contributes to the area of speech acts on concern especially on the academic performance of foster children in Malaysia.

This research primarily aims to identify the steps and strategies involved in the online romance scam in Malaysia. Apart from that, it also aims to identify the pattern of deceptive language used in online romance scam in Malaysia through a comprehensive linguistic analysis of actual online conversations between scammers and victims. The empirical investigation of this research focuses on the language strategies used by scammers as a modus operando in deceiving their targets. With the help of the Malaysian Police Department, a database of romance scam cases was gathered and established. From the database, 30 sets of online communication between scammers and 30 Malaysian victims were selected and analysed using content analysis method. One of the aspects involved in data analysis was scammers' linguistic styles and patterns in manipulating their targets. This was analysed using Brown and Levinson Politeness Model as well as Whitty's Scammers Persuasive Techniques Model. The findings indicate a common linguistic pattern and style of conversation used by online scammers in persuading and deceiving their victims.

J	Chang, TC				Chang, Tsung-Chi			Re-evaluating Lady Gregory in Modern Irish Literature: A Feminist Ethics Study	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Lady Gregory; Irish literature; Carol Gilligan; Nel Noddings; feminist ethics		Women's subordinate status in twentieth-century Irish literature has come under criticism in recent years. Irish women's subjugation becomes apparent when we compare W. B. Yeats and Augusta Gregory. Whereas Yeats has been universally acknowledged in the past few decades as the spokesman of the Irish Literary Revival and an icon of modern Irish literature, Lady Gregory was ridiculed by George Bernard Shaw as the helping maid of the Abbey Theater. In this paper, a textual analysis of Lady Gregory's plays is brought into discussion with Carol Gilligan's and Nel Noddings's feminist ethics to further explore the role women played in modern Irish literature. This paper aims at clarifying the nature of female writing as exemplified in Lady Gregory's works. Unlike traditional studies on Lady Gregory and her plays, which focus on women's subjugation in the male-dominated Irish society around the early twentieth century, the main findings of this research help shed new lights on the value of women in Gregory's plays via an ethical feminist approach. The implication of this study is that women, who are apparently disempowered in traditional male-oriented moral thinking, are much more valuable and powerful when they are evaluated from ethical feminism.

J	Noah, SAM; Ali, NM; Hasan, MS				Noah, Shahrul Azman Mohd; Ali, Nazlena Mohamad; Hasan, Mohd Sabri			Determining Features of News Headline in Malay News Document	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						headline; Natural Language Processing; malay news; text summarization; Malay corpus		Headline summarization is one of the automated text summarization techniques that can reduce the problem of information overload in the retrieval system and reduce the user's cognitive burden while searching and selecting relevant documents in large quantities. This study discusses the process on the determination of Malay language system features in the news genre document. Methodology starts with analysis the corpus of Malay news documents. The corpus contains 140 core news items which were selected from the two mainstream news databases in Malaysia which are Berita Harian and Utusan Malaysia. The selection news criteria are from core news categories, sized 50 to 250 words, the years of publication from 2007 to 2012 and news genres from economic, crime, education and sports. Three linguistic experts in Malay produced a headline summary for each news document manually. The experts need to comply with three conditions which are summary extraction, select-word-inorder word selection techniques and word morphological changes. The experimental results show that three characteristics have been identified, first: the first two sentenses are the important sentences, second: the verse that contains the potential acronym definitions is chosen as the most important sentence and third: the size of the summary of the ideal headline is six words. The consideration of this feature allows a summary of the headline that can be generated automatically, just like the process done by human.

J	Ting, SH				Ting, Su-Hie			Ethos, Logos and Pathos in University Students' Informal Requests	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						rhetoric; requests; ethos; logos; pathos	EFL LEARNERS; STRATEGIES; PERSUASION; COMPLAINT; CONTEXT	Persuasion is used in spoken and written communication to convince the audience to take appropriate actions or to support specific viewpoints. The speaker or writer may use statistics and logical arguments, emotions and their character, authority and credibility to convince the audience. The present study examined university students' strategies of persuading their lecturer to grant their request using Aristotle's rhetorical proofs of ethos, logos and pathos as the framework. The data were from 165 students enrolled in an English language course in a Malaysian university. They were asked to write down what they would say to persuade their lecturer to end the class early. Some students used more than one strategy, giving rise to 180 persuasion strategies in total. Analysis of their requests showed that majority of the students used one type of rhetorical appeal to persuade. Emotional appeal (pathos) was the most popular persuasion strategy accounting for over half of the persuasion strategies identified, followed closely by the rational appeal (logos). Appeal to ethos (credibility) was seldom used. Further analysis of the use of personal pronouns showed a clear difference in that self-focus is frequent in appeals to logos whereas other-focus is frequent in appeals to pathos. When students made an appeal to logos in their requests, they used the singular first person pronoun (I, my) more than the second person pronoun because they justified their request for an early class dismissal by using their heavy workload and uncomfortable physical classroom conditions. When the students made emotional appeals, the content of their persuasion revolved around their lecturer and they made frequent use of the second person pronoun. The results suggests that the students can benefit from the teaching of persuasive discourse so that they are able to use the rhetorical appeals more effectively.

These works established the basis of geolinguistic study today. The present study examines the realizations of linguistic variants of two lexical items, namely 'curry leaves' and 'kesum leaves' in the dialects of Malay spoken in Langkawi Island. Based on the geolinguistic analysis, linguistic elements is incorporated with non-linguistic features, such as topography, delineation, migration and history. A total of 90 respondents have been selected comprising of teenagers, adults and the elderly. The elicited data are analyzed and processed by the Geographic Information System (GIS) software. The study has accomplished its main objective, that is, to identify the use of linguistic variants of the two lexical items. Additionally, the comparison and distribution of lexical variants of each lexical item have been successfully mapped into chloropleth technic. Consequently, the application of GIS software displays the geographical factors that govern and determine the distribution of those variants in Langkawi. The findings demonstrate that Padang MatSirat, Bohor and Kuah are the native areas of Langkawi Malay, meanwhile in Ayer Hangat and Ulu Melaka most of the respondents speak Satun Malay. Subsequently, in Kedawang district, the people converse in Patani Malay. The distribution of these dialects is determined by historical, geographical and socio-cultural factors. The present study is more elegant, systematic and convincing because it is supported by GIS technology and multidisciplinary approach.

J	Johari, A; Zahid, I				Johari, Arina; Zahid, Indirawati			Manifestation of Malay Politeness in Asking and Giving Advice	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						pragmatic; politeness strategy; cooperative principle; Face Threatening Act (FTA); non-conflict		The acts of asking and giving advice are linguistically complex and require observations of politeness norms that exist across cultures. Lack of understanding on this aspect of communication often leads to conflicts or resistance to the advice given. This can be especially so in motivational radio phone-in shows where the politeness strategies of the callers can be numerous. Hence, an analysis was done to identify the patterns of politeness employed in a talk show entitled "Celik Mata Reset Minda Orang Yang Tenang" aired on Radio IKIMfm. Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Model, and Grice's (1975) Maxims of Cooperative Principles were combined to form a model called "Model Pola Kombinasi Strategi dan Maksim" (MPKSM) to analyse the 33 dialogues in the body structure of a conversational context. MPKSM forms four patterns of combined strategies which are Patterns A, B, C and D with the main patterns of P2 and P3. P2 consists of both positive and negative politeness strategies while P3 consists of off-record strategies. Both P2 and P3 are related to the maxims of Cooperative Principles. The speech acts of asking and giving advice from those who took part in the body structure of the radio talk show were analysed using five methods which are downloading of texts, text analysis, transcription, labelling and coding as well as through quantitative approach. The findings indicate that the participants in the talk show have applied the MPKSM in their utterances by minimizing Face Threatening Acts (FTA) while planning the acts to avoid conflicts, with pattern B being dominantly used. The study also shows that time constraint and the presence of overhearer audience were significant factors in influencing the selection of politeness strategies among participants.

J	Al-rousan, MY; Awal, NM; KhazriyatiSalehuddin				Al-rousan, Mohammad Yahya; Awal, Nosimah Mat; KhazriyatiSalehuddin			Compliment Responses among Male and Female Jordanian University Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						compliment responses; response strategies; ethnographic method; gender; FTA	ENGLISH	This study was conducted to examine compliment responses among Jordanian university students. It aims to explore the use of compliment responses among Jordanian, and investigate if there are any differences with regard to gender. The corpus consists of 611 compliment responses collected from 36 participants through an ethnographic (note-taking) method during the second semester of 2013/2014 academic session. This research adopted Herbert's (1990) taxonomy of compliment response strategies to analyze the compliment responses. Results show that recipients used the agreement strategies more frequently than the other strategies. The findings also show although both males and females favored to use agreement strategies more than non agreement and other interpretation strategies, female students used agreement strategies more frequently than the male students. This may support the claim that males tend to interpret compliment as FTA. Females also preferred to use agreement strategies to respond to compliment offered by female than compliment offered by male. Compliment responses strategies are discussed in terms of gender. It can be concluded that the linguistic manipulations of compliment responses shown in this study indicate that no one strategy of compliment responses would work because different genders have different sets of strategies, thereby preventing any valid generalization. The current study offered important differences in using compliment responses between genders.

J	Sulaiman, MZ				Sulaiman, Mohamed Zain			Translating Urban Tourist Icons across Cultures: An English-Malay Perspective	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						translation; culture; tourism promotional texts; tourist icons; functional approach		Urban tourist icons such as Paris, Istanbul or Sydney are major pull factors of a destination and are often represented in tourist promotional texts (TPTs) to persuade potential tourists to visit a destination. The use of the ' iconic advertising approach`(Litvin & Mouri, 2009), which capitalises on the iconicity of tourist icons, is one of the most effective advertising approaches in affecting a destination image. The strength of this approach lies in its key function of representing easily recognisable and positive images that reinforce or simply recall the audience` s previously held perceptions about the destination. However, the ways in which urban tourist icons are represented and perceived differ from one audience to another, for it is based on the cultural background of the audience. The differences in how these icons are represented and perceived pose a key challenge for translators of TPTs, whose role is to produce an effective translation in the target language and culture in order to persuade potential tourists in that language and culture. This paper discusses some of the cultural issues involved in translating tourist icons and analyses how a particular ' tourist icon` is represented in a published English TPT (source text) for an Anglo audience and how it has been translated into the Malay language for a Malay audience. The translation (target text) is analysed in terms of its functionality and effectiveness within the cultural context of the target audience. The discourse analysis of the source and target texts is complemented by findings derived from focus group discussions and an analysis of authentic TPTs in Malay (parallel texts). Based on the analysis, a functionally adequate translation which takes into consideration the cultural differences, hence preserving the iconicity of the destination, is proposed.

From among the variety of formulaic expressions, lexical bundles have been shown to serve particular facilitative functions in academic discourse. Defined as strings of word forms that commonly co-occur in natural discourse, lexical bundles are characterized statistically by their frequency of occurrence and they contribute significantly to fluency in speech and writing. While previous research had focused on the use of these expressions in academic research articles across disciplines or on the difference between spoken and written registers, little research has been carried out to find out the language use of academic lectures from different disciplines in terms of the use of these bundles, orally. Taking into account this consideration, the present study aimed to investigate how lexical bundles are used by academic lecturers from different disciplinary communities. With the aim of comparing their language selection, the most frequent four-word lexical bundles in academic lectures of two disciplines, namely politics and chemistry were identified and categorized. The procedure adopts Biber et al.. s (2004) functional categorization of lexical bundles to investigate the communicative purposes that lexical bundles convey in the lectures of the two groups and to see whether there were any disciplinary differences with regard to the bundles used. Based on the findings, there were some marked variations found across the two disciplines in terms of discourse functions of the lexical bundles. It seemed that academic lectures rely heavily on the use of specific word combinations to fulfill those functions related to their discipline.

This study intends to investigate the speech act of condolences in Jordanian Arabic that are conveyed via a social network site, i.e. Facebook. The data focused on the condolences made as a response to an obituary status update on a deceased contemporary Jordanian actor in 2011. Based on 678 posted comments, the researchers were able to identify seven major strategies in the commentary; which were: praying for God's mercy and forgiveness for the deceased, reciting Quranic verses, enumerating the virtues of the deceased, expressing shock and grief, offering condolences, realizing death is a natural part of life; and using proverbs and sayings. To ensure consistency in the comments, the data was first analysed by the researchers of the present study before three independent raters were invited to analyse the same data sample (condolences). The raters. analysis in the commentary reflect the seven major strategies identified by the researchers. The results revealed that the strategies were attributed to the respondents. religious orientation (i.e. Islam). Moreover, the findings also indicate that the majority of condolences in Jordanian comments are affiliated to faith and religious beliefs. The results obtained provide useful information to cross-cultural comparison studies and other related studies.

Innovation refer to the changeable feature of the proto language in the actual languages and dialects; while, retention are the unchangeable feature of the proto language in the actual languages and dialects. This article is an attempt to discuss the innovation and retention features which exisst in the Hulu Tembeling's dialect (DHT). This article specifically focused on one of the innovation and retention features of DHT, that is, the change of nasal consonant in final position and the retention of the high vowel in prepenultimate position. The analysis was based on common comparative linguistic approach in order to determine whether the sound is categorized as innovation or retention. Therefore, the data of the Hulu Tembeling dialect is compared to the Proto-Malayic (MP) as reconstructed by Adelaar (1992) because of the closed relationship between the two different levels of languages. The comparative approach which is used in this study is based on the research hypotheses that the different realisation of MP's sound in Hulu Tembeling is innovation, whereas the same realisation of MP's sound in that dialect is retention. The innovation and retention features were then related to a few factors such as tentative classifations between Hulu Terengganu dan Hulu Tembeling dialect, change in progress and the existence of dialect continuum in Pahang River Basin.

In this context, politeness is taken to mean good manners such as greeting, acknowledging and thanking others. Taking the cue from the Malaysian government which emphasizes on showing good manners, this paper examines the public transactions of front counter staff and patients in nine Malaysian private hospitals. Focus was given to the use of openings and closings in 158 transactions which were extracted over a period of three months via close observations which were allowed by the gatekeepers manning the front counters. Data were then orthographically transcribed. Brown and Levinson's (1987) notion of politeness and the Malaysian concept of good manners such as greeting and thanking were applied as a framework. Our analysis indicates that front counter staff in private hospitals employed more impolite openings but at the end of the transactions, they used more polite closings. A closer analysis of the data indicates that these polite closings were often given in response to patients. initiations. Although our findings are small in comparison, we believe they will benefit researchers of communication, curriculum designers and practitioners as these findings clearly indicate that there is a need for professional communication skills to be taught and implemented in service industries	[Hei, Kuang Ching; David, Maya Khemlani; Kia, Lau Su] Univ Malaya, Fac Languages & Linguist, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia	Universiti Malaya	Hei, KC (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Languages & Linguist, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	kuangch@um.edu.my; mdavid@um.edu.my; lausk@um.edu.my	David, Maya Khemlani/B-8970-2010; LAU, SU KIA/B-8828-2010	David, Maya Khemlani/0000-0002-5569-3591; 	University of Malaya [PJPFS103/2008C]	University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya)	We would like to thank University of Malaya for the funding (PJPFS103/2008C) granted to this study.

J	Zare, M; Mobarakeh, SD				Zare, Mostafa; Mobarakeh, Sajad Davoudi			Effects Of Bilingualism On L3 Vocabulary Learning Among Iranian EFL Learners	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Bilingualism; Arabic-Persian bilinguals (APBs); Persian monolinguals (PMs); L3 vocabulary learning; mother tongue		It is well documented that everybody's first language or mother tongue influences the way one learns his/her second language (Wade-Wolley, 1999; Liszka, 2004). However, the difference and comparison of this effect on third language learning motivated the researchers to investigate whether Arabic-Persian bilinguals(APBs) take advantage of their bilingualism in learning the third language (English) versus Persian monolinguals (PMs) or not. The study sample comprised of 100 male senior high school students who were randomly selected. 50 PM students were in one group and 50 APB students were in the other group. Firstly, a questionnaire through which mono/bilingualism and proficiency level in the language skills were asked was given to students. Then a list of English words was presented to the students and they were requested to write the meaning of words they knew. 50 words meaning of which none of the students in both groups knew were selected to be taught. For homogeneity purpose, Oxford Placement Test (OPT) was also used. After taking the pretest (based on 50 unknown words), students received the treatment (50 unknown words were taught). Finally, posttest was run and the performance of both groups onL3 general, recognition and production vocabulary was analyzed. Results of three T-tests revealed that APBs in general and in L3 production vocabulary learning outperformed their PMs. The results also showed that no significant difference was seen between APBs and PMs in L3 recognition vocabulary learning	[Zare, Mostafa; Mobarakeh, Sajad Davoudi] Isfahan Univ, Fac Foreign Languages, Esfahan, Iran	University of Isfahan	Zare, M (corresponding author), Isfahan Univ, Fac Foreign Languages, Esfahan, Iran.

The language of communication is usually the language often used in everyday life. In the state of Sarawak, there are many ethnic groups with their own native languages. However, at the same time, they also use a common language of communication which is appropriate, comprehensible and does not raise communication problems. In Sarawak, the language with the highest number of speakers is the Iban language. This is based on the distribution of population in the said state. This research includes a field survey which employs questionnaires and informal interviews. The findings of this research illustrate that the Iban language and Sarawak Malay dialect are chosen as the lingua franca in Sarikei, Sarawak. Iban is used in informal settings while Sarawak Malay is used in formal ones.

A total of 50 respondents were involved in the study. The respondents were asked to complete a writing activity. The result was analysed using qualitative and quantitative approaches based on Zentella's (1997) definition and classification of code-switching. The result showed that Malay language was utilised more by the respondents in their code switching to French. Respondents also used code switching strategies as crutching, conjoining and replacing words and phrases when they could not translate into French. This research also found that code switching in the form of crutching was most utilized. The code switching involved nouns, adjectives, prepositions and personal pronouns.

J	Ghani, KA				Ghani, Kamarulzaman Abdul			The Readability Of Higher Arabic Language Textbooks Based On Cloze Test Among SMKA Students	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						readability; cloze test; foreign language; reading text; Arabic		Among the factors associated with students' low proficiency in Arabic is the readibility level of Arabic textbooks, that is the levels of difficulty and suitability do not match students' language ability. As research on the readability of Arabic reading materials in Malaysia is scarce, this study attempts to explore and evaluate the readability of textbooks on Arabic as a foreign language. Thus, the purpose of this study is to measure the readability level of the Bahasa Arab Tinggi Tingkatan Empat (BATTE) textbook used by Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama (SMKA) students through a cloze test; and to identify the differences of the test scores in relation to students' gender, the reading texts tested and the students' achievement in the Bahasa Arab Komunikasi (BAK) subject in the Penilaian Menengah Rendah (PMR) examination. To achieve these objectives, a survey test was carried out on 390 form four students from a population of 5442 of all SMKA students throughout Malaysia. The test results showed that the average score for the BATTE textbooks is 49%, defined as frustration level, which indicated that the textbook is not suitable for the purpose of teaching and learning, and independent reading. Meanwhile, there is no difference in the test scores in relation to the students' gender, reading texts tested and students' achievement in the BAK subject in the PMR examination. The test showed that the readability level of the BATTE textbook is not suitable to be used as a learning material for the target group. This unsuitability involves all the independent variables tested; gender, reading texts and students' achievement in the PMR. Hence, the regulatory parties should take into account the readability level of a text before it is made as a learning material, to ensure that it is appropriate to students' language ability.

This article focuses on the reading strategies of teacher trainees by presenting the results of the study conducted in a teacher-training department at a state university in Western Turkey. It highlights the importance of strategy training and why the strategies should be taught to enhance the reading of the learners.

J	Shaharudin, SA; Sulaiman, MZ				Shaharudin, Siti Aisyah; Sulaiman, M. Zain			The Status of Interpreting Professionalisation in Malaysia	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						interpreting; interpreter; professionalisation; Tsengs model; Malaysia		Despite its long history, interpreting as a professional career is still lagging in many countries including Malaysia. Interpreting practice in general is still regarded as a low-status, semiprofessional occupation that has yet to develop to a full-fledged profession. Existing research on the professionalisation of interpreting practice in Malaysia is quite limited and outdated. There has been no follow-up research conducted over the past decade. Based on Tseng's interpreting professionalisation model (1992), this study explores the latest development related to the professionalisation of interpreting practice in Malaysia, by focusing on three key elements: (1) education and training institutions, (2) associations/organisations related to interpreting, and (3) political and governmental support. The primary research method used for this study is document review. The findings show that although there are positive developments, interpreting practice in Malaysia still exhibits features of market disorder, due to the absence of a body which regulates market entry and provides a code of ethics. The local interpreting scene may be described as simultaneously being in phases one (disorder), two (education and training) and three (recognition) of Tseng's model of professionalisation. Elements of all three phases partially exist in the local interpreting landscape but have yet to reach maturity. It is hoped that stakeholders in the Malaysian interpreting industry, namely the associations and organisations related to interpreting, education and training providers, and the government, will work hand in hand to continue the efforts of professionalising interpreting practice in Malaysia.

Government officials were forced to impose drastic measures to curb the spread. The Ministry of Health relied on political leaders and government agencies to help disseminate as much health information and the government policies efficiently and effectively. As these representatives or leaders belong to different ethnicities, they are more likely to understand the life circumstances, needs, strengths, and capabilities of multicultural and vulnerable communities, and would be the best people to convey the needed information. Tamils are the third largest community in Malaysia and there is not much research done on Tamil language and communication strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aims to observe on how effectively Tamil language and culture influences crisis communication. Effective communication and leadership are central to the management of pandemics and to give the public assurance in order to alleviate their fears and anxiety in having to adapt to the rapidly changing societal and economic landscape. Based on the communication strategies recommended by Hyland-Wood et al (2021), the current study focuses on how a Malaysian Indian politician, Saravanan responds, engages, and communicates with his followers. Seventeen Facebook posts in Tamil on Saravanan's page were extracted and analysed qualitatively. The strategies utilized by Saravanan showed his resolve and effectiveness in managing crisis. This study will be useful for political leaders, community representatives, and medical practitioners in seeking equitable accessibility to quality health care and well-being of the people.

J	Kurnia, NI; Nurgiyantoro, B; Fitri, CE				Kurnia, Nandy Intan; Nurgiyantoro, Burhan; Fitri, Cindy Elsa			The Othering of Majority and Minority Groups in Lessing and Ajidarma's Literary Works: A Postcolonial Analysis	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						discrimination; postcolonial; racial; gender; No Witchcraft for Sale; Clara		A postcolonial reading of literary works remains relevant since the characters, stories and various issues related to the colonial domination discussed in literary texts may serve as a means for its readers to learn more about life under colonialism. This article examines how Doris Lessing, a British-Rhodesian author, and Seno Gumira Ajidarma, an Indonesian author, reveal the issue of discrimination of African native community and Indonesian-Chinese community because of the act of othering, respectively, from a postcolonial lens. This study used the critical content analysis technique on two literary works, namely Lessing's short story entitled "No Witchcraft for Sale" and Ajidarma's short story entitled "Clara", which is based on Spivak's theory of othering. Specific dialogues and utterances related to instances of discrimination were analyzed to uncover the othering of individuals, in this case, the main characters of the stories Lessing's short story captures the struggles encountered by the main character named Gideon, who belongs to the majority group, while Ajidarma's short story provides the portrayal of a young native Indonesian-Chinese descent who is a member of a minority group. The study found that Gideon faced racial discrimination and on the other hand, Clara faces racial and gender discrimination. By comparing two different literary works coming from two different cultures, nationalities, and historical backgrounds focusing on the issues of othering from a postcolonial perspective, this article can serve as a means for its readers to learn more about how the discrimination stemmed from different histories and how cultural background can create similar outcomes.

J	Mohd, J; Aziz, J; Musaev, T				Mohd, Jamila; Aziz, Jamaluddin; Musaev, Talaibek			The Interlanguage Pragmatics of Japanese Daily Greetings by Malaysian Learners	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Pragmatic; Malaysian Learners; Japanese; Greetings; Interlanguage	COMPETENCE	Scholars in pragmatics argue that the teaching of a second language (L2) must pay extra attention to the language forms and expressions within specific cultural contexts. Not being able to use a L2 according to the nature of its cultural context could sometimes lead to misunderstanding and miscommunication. This study aims to explain the interlanguage pragmatic transfer in daily greetings used by Malaysian learners of Japanese. Using a convenient sampling technique, the respondents are 80 Malay students enrolling in a Japanese preparatory program prior to attending Japanese universities. Being competent in using Japanese language in context is therefore crucial for them. This study employs a qualitative research approach using Discourse Completion Tests (DCT) and follow-up interviews. Shleykina' s model of greetings is appropriated and used as the framework which allows data to be categorized into six patterns. The findings show that Malaysian learners chose to use less greetings when they greet their Japanese friends vis-a-vis their Malaysian friends. The types of Japanese greetings they use are mostly greeting expressions from what they have learned in the classrooms. Other casual greetings applied are learned from anime, dramas and Japanese TV programs. This study revealed that some of the Japanese greetings used are actually a direct translation from Bahasa Melayu. This pragmatic transfer has offered two perspectives, which are, success transfer and failure transfer. The results contribute towards the importance of exposure to and the understanding of the cultural context of a target language in choosing appropriate greetings among L2 in interlanguage context.

J	Al-Sewwi, E; Awad, Y				Al-Sewwi, Esraa; Awad, Yousef			Illness and the Development of Master-Slave Relations in Morrison's A Mercy and Lalami's The Moor's Account	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Laila Lalami; Toni Morrison; Master-Slave Dialectic; Illness; historical novel		The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare Master-Slave relations in two historical novels by African-American novelist Toni Morrison and Arab-American novelist Laila Lalami. The study aims at examining the formation of Master-Slave relations in Morrison's A Mercy (2008) and Lalami's The Moor's Account (2014), with a particular focus on the role illness and healing play on their development. This will be done within three stages of before, during and after illnesses. Moreover, Hegel's Master-Slave Dialectic theory will serve as the theoretical framework upon which Master-Slave relations will be examined within their historical and cultural contexts. Masters' illnesses in both novels represent a turning point in the course of Master-Slave relations, providing Slaves with a chance to prove to themselves and to their Masters that the two are involved in complex and multifaceted connections. However, the study shows that the way illnesses affect the development of the relation in each novel differs drastically. In The Moor's Account, illness offers an opportunity for Mustafa and his companions to add value to the services they offer to the Native American tribes they serve. In contrast, the emergence of illness in A Mercy negatively affects Lina's relationship with Rebekka as the latter loses faith in the former and substantially downgrades her efforts and labors. The results of this study reveal the importance of external factors, such as the appearance of illnesses, in defining and affecting Master-Slave relations. Hence, by reading both novels alongside each other, the study highlights sociopolitical, cultural and historical aspects in the two narratives that have not been fully explored previously.

J	Koudria, S; Davtian, E				Koudria, Svetlana; Davtian, Elena			Word Meanings in Oral and Written Psychiatrist-Patient Communication	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						patient-psychiatrist communication; word meaning; polysemy; interpretation; discourse analysis	COGNITION	The evolving trends in today's institutional psychiatrist-patient communication give rise to non-transparent research methods and communication failures in psychiatry. We see the source of such problematic practices in fundamental misunderstanding and misuse of a word as a linguistic unit in modern psychiatric research. Our study focuses on the use of polysemantic words in psychiatrist-patient communication. We explore how psychiatrists and patients interact to infer meanings from words and expressions crucial for the outcome of psychiatrist-patient communication in various institutional settings. The study is qualitative and interdisciplinary: it is a semantic analysis supported by evidence from clinical interviews and enhanced by the observations of a psychiatrist. The results are presented in two parts. Part 1 focuses on the word meaning in an oral clinical interview. We analyze examples of mental patients' utterances from clinical interviews and describe how psychiatrists elicit meanings from their patients' utterances in a clinical setting. In Part 2 we describe the different ways in which words are used and interpreted by patients and clinicians in written communication mediated by a psychiatric clinical research questionnaire. We conclude this article by interpreting our results with regard to the objectives and values of the clinical discourse, and discussing whether or not the new ways of word usage boost the institutional capacity of mental health care.

J	Chandran, G; Vengadasamy, R				Chandran, Gheeta; Vengadasamy, Ravichandran			Colonialist Narrative in a Post-Colonial Era Travel Writing, Into the Heart of Borneo	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						Travel writing; Into the Heart of Borneo; Colonialist; Orientalism; Denigration		Travel writings have long served as important points of reference for Western academicians, travellers and those generally associated with the business of conquest and trade. More often than not, these sources of references had depicted the lands and people of the 'new world,' usually the East or Africa, as being wild, savage and in dire need of European intervention for the creation of civilized societies. Therefore, it would be of great interest to both scholars and travellers to find out if the colonialist representations still persist in a post-colonial era Western travel writing about the East. The current study examines the ways in which Redmond O'Hanlon, an English naturalist, constructs and represents the natives and the land of Sarawak in his travel writing, Into the Heart of Borneo (1984). The study aims to find out if O'Hanlon's representation of Sarawak and its natives have progressed from the depictions found in the travel writings of his colonialist predecessors. The discussion of findings is preceded by a brief explanation of Edward Said's notion of Orientalism, which provides the theoretical basis for the analysis of the travel novel. The paper highlights that there has been no real evolution in the travel narrative used by O'Hanlon to describe Sarawak and its natives from the colonial heyday of travel literature.

J	Saad, S; Mansor, MK				Saad, Saidah; Mansor, Mohamed Kamil			Named Entity Recognition Approach for Malay Crime News Retrieval	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			Malay	Article						information extraction; named entity recognition; malay language; crime news; rule-based approach		Information extraction is a process of obtaining an important concept in representing the textual content of unstructured documents. At present, there are a lot of unstructured documents such as news, articles, blogs, forums, tweets and micro- blogs of social networks. These documents are very difficult to be understood by the computer. Therefore, studies on the extraction of information is very important to overcome this problem. One extraction technique that is widely used is the entity name recognition. This research aims to implement the entity name recognition techniques of crime news source document in Malay language. The main objective of this study is to develop a prototype system model information extraction crime news in the Malay language using name entity recognition through a rule-based approach. This assessment is done by creating a corpus of crime news in the Malay language which is derived from the archival source; BERNAMA news. The corpus is then examined manually by linguists to identify individual entities such as name, organization, location, date, time, financial, percentage, crime and weapons. At the same time, a prototype system was developed and tested with the same corpus and the results of these tests were compared with the results of an expert. Overall, these tests showed good results with the findings for the recall at 78.67%, while precision is at 71.11% and for F-measure at 74.7%. The results of this study are expected to contribute knowledge regarding the effectiveness of the entity's name recognition techniques for crime news Malay language. This could further assist investigators, police, lawyers and authorities involved in the field of crime in solving crimes more quickly and effectively.

This paper describes five significant components in this new model that complement the 21st century learning skills. Data illustrated in this paper were drawn from an action research project on PBL case design training and model for English language practitioners. The four steps in the action research approach namely plan, act, observe and reflect were closely followed within two cycles of the research procedure. Data collection tools were observation checklist and focus group interviews with a group of English Language practitioners. The collected data were then analysed using content analysis for emerging themes and the findings were used to develop the new model (PBL-LcCRAFT). The outcome of this study is the new model which is a guide for crafting PBL cases specifically for languages. This paper discusses five interrelated components in the new model (Ill-structuredness, Language in-use, Researching, Reasoning and Reflecting) which language practitioners considered as significant components in crafting language cases. The key findings presented here are the five interrelated components in PBL-LcCRAFT that have assisted the practitioners to craft cases and the symbiosis between these five components with the 21st century skills (i.e. knowledge, creativity, collaboration, critical thinking and communication skills).

J	Puteh-Behak, F; Ismail, IR				Puteh-Behak, Fariza; Ismail, Isma Rosila			Multiliteracies Project Approach: Dated or a Worthy Learning Tool?	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						multiliteracies; 21st century skills; fourth industrial revolution; meaningful learning; project approach	LITERACY	In the midst of the popularity of massive open online learning approach and the fourth industrial revolution, it seems that multiliteracies approach is losing its significance in the educational setting of Malaysia. This paper discusses the relevance of multiliteracies project approach in the current Malaysian academic arena since its introduction in the early 21st century. This paper will begin by outlining the significance of the multiliteracies approach at the local and global educational settings. The current study is part of a larger action research project that involved four action research cycles investigating multiliteracies approach in ESL (English for the Second Language) contexts. The data for the current study were collected from the second action research cycle, involving 28 participants who were learners of ESL at Bakti Polytechnic (pseudonym). Data were collected through classroom observation, semistructured interviews and classroom documents. The data show that multiliteracies approach still provides students with evocative learning experience and promotes the acquisition of necessary skills for students to participate in the 21st century particularly technological, critical thinking and teamwork skills. Findings suggest that multiliteracies approach has the potential to be expanded to further include the properties of the current sensation of the fourth industrial revolution.

J	Zabir, A; Haroon, H				Zabir, Atikah; Haroon, Haslina			Procedures in the Translation of Proper Names in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire into Malay	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						proper names; translation procedures; translation loss; J.K. Rowling; Harry Potter		In fantasy fiction, names play a fundamental role in portraying the characters' personality traits and identity. Names are also sometimes chosen to create certain effects. The fact that names may carry meaning raises the question of how names are dealt with in translation. This issue is especially pertinent in the case of the Harry Potter novels in which many of the names have associative meanings. In view of this, the aim of this study is to determine the procedures used in the translation of some of the proper names in the novel 'Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire' into Malay. The study also aims to discuss the effects resulting from the use of the translation procedures. To carry out the study, the proper names in the novel are first identified based on the definition of proper names by Fernandes (2006). Next, the names are mapped to their Malay counterparts. The procedures for the translation of proper names proposed by Fernandes (2006) are then used to analyse how the names are translated into Malay. Finally, the concept of 'translation loss' by Hervey and Higgins (1992) is used to determine the effects resulting from the use of the translation procedures. The analysis reveals that a number of different procedures are used to translate the names into Malay. The procedures used have resulted in the loss of hidden meanings in the names, the loss of the creative aspect of the names and the loss of the casual style of the original.

Face-to-face collaborative writing refers to in-class meeting of students to write essays collaboratively. Thirty ESL tertiary students from an intact class participated in the study. They were randomly divided into Group 1 and Group 2. Each of the two groups was further sub-divided into five smaller groups comprising three members. Group 1 discussed and wrote the essay on the wiki platform while Group 2 did the same task face-to-face in the classroom. One sub-group from both modes of writing was selected for in-depth comparison. Data were collected from the collaborative writing processes on the wiki platform and audio-recordings of face-to-face interactions, and also from semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed that the participants of both modes of writing were able to evaluate different viewpoints, and understand shortcomings and strengths through interaction in either of the collaborative learning contexts. The collaboration through both modes of writing showed that the participants not only displayed similar understanding, but also learned from each other through developing and sharing different perspectives on the same issues. Of the differences found between the two modes of collaborative writing, Wiki is a more effective platform for drafting and revising, while planning is easier done through face-to-face interaction. The study implies that either mode of collaborative writing can be adopted by ESL language instructors who aspire to practice the social-constructivist approach to writing instruction especially in a blended learning environment.

J	Ali, SM; Krish, P				Ali, Syahrir Mat; Krish, Pramela			Gender-Specific English Language Use of Malaysian Blog Authors	GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article						gender differences; English use; blogs; Malaysian blog authors; neologisms	ONLINE; TEXT	Gender-based research on the language use in blogs has its roots in the long-standing notion that men and women speak and write differently. This paper reports an empirical study on the use of English in a blog context involving Malaysian blog authors. Specifically, the study aimed to identify gender-specific English use among Malaysian blog authors and determine the differences in the language use. Using an ensemble text analysis approach, Malaysian female blog authors are more inclined towards using more verbs, adverbs and pronouns than their male counterpart, with a significant difference, while the males are inclined towards using more adjectives, nouns, determiners and prepositions/subordinating conjunctions than the females, with a significant difference. There are also differences between females and males in terms of the function words, neologisms/blog words as well as use of tag questions and adverbs initiating sentences. However, there are minimal differences between the females and males in terms of length of sentences and that the use of intensifiers, hedges, empty adjectives and emotions, thus concluding that they are not necessarily gender-specific differences. The findings can serve as useful language markers that can benefit the applied linguistics and particularly gender-based and forensic linguistic research.
