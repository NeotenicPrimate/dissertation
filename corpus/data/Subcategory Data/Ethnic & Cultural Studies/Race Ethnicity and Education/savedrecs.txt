J	Picower, B				Picower, Bree			The unexamined Whiteness of teaching: how White teachers maintain and enact dominant racial ideologies	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Critical Race Studies in Education Conference	2008	Chicago, IL			race; racism; Whiteness; teacher education; student teachers; White supremacy; tools of Whiteness studies; elementary education; Critical Race Theory; critical whiteness	PEDAGOGY; SCHOOLS	While much research that explores the role of race in education focuses on children of color, this article explores an aspect of the predominately White teaching force that educates them. This article explores findings from a qualitative study that posed questions about the ways in which White pre-service teachers' life-experiences influenced understandings of race and difference, and how these pre-service teachers negotiated the challenges a critical multicultural education course offered those beliefs. In keeping with the tenet of critical race theory that racism is an inherent and normalized aspect of American society, the author found that through previous life-experiences, the participants gained hegemonic understandings about race and difference. Participants responded to challenges to these understandings by relying on a set of 'tools of Whiteness' designed to protect and maintain dominant and stereotypical understandings of race - tools that were emotional, ideological, and performative. This phenomenon is typically referred to as resistance in the literature on White teachers and multicultural education. The author contends, however, that these tools are not simply a passive resistance to but much more of an active protection of the incoming hegemonic stories and White supremacy and therefore require analysis to better understand when and how these tools are strategically used. Understanding how these tools of Whiteness protect dominant and stereotypical understandings of race can advise teacher education programs how to better organize to transform the ideologies of White teachers.

We first examine some connections between the interdependent constructions of race and dis/ability in education and society in the United States and why we find it necessary to add another branch to Critical Race Theory and Disability Studies. Next, we outline the tenets of DisCrit, calling attention to its potential value as well as elucidate some tensions, cautions, and current limitations within DisCrit. Finally, we suggest ways in which DisCrit can be used in relation to moving beyond the contemporary impasse of researching race and dis/ability within education and other fields.

J	Annamma, SA; Jackson, DD; Morrison, D				Annamma, Subini Ancy; Jackson, Darrell D.; Morrison, Deb			Conceptualizing color-evasiveness: using dis/ability critical race theory to expand a color-blind racial ideology in education and society	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; Dis/ability Critical Race Theory; color-blindness	CRITICAL LEGAL; WHITE; RESISTANCE; RIGHTS	Color-blind racial ideology has historically been conceptualized as an ideology wherein race is immaterial. Efforts not to see' race insinuate that recognizing race is problematic; therefore, scholars have identified and critiqued color-blindness ideology. In this paper, we first examine Gotanda's (1991) identification and critique of color-blind racial ideology, as it was crucial in troubling white supremacy. We then explore literature in both legal studies and education to determine how scholars have built upon Gotanda's intellectual theoretical foundations. Finally, using a Dis/ability Critical Race Theory (DisCrit) framework, we end by expanding to a racial ideology of color-evasiveness in education and society, as we believe that conceptualizing the refusal to recognize race as color-blindness' limits the ways this ideology can be dismantled.

Pedagogy of fear: toward a Fanonian theory of 'safety' in race dialogue	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; race dialogue; Fanon; multiculturalism; racism; diversity		In education, it is common to put the condition of 'safety' around public race dialogue. The authors argue that this procedural rule maintains white comfort zones and becomes a symbolic form of violence experienced by people of color. In other words, they ask, 'Safety for whom?' A subtle but fundamental violence is enacted in safe discourses on race, which must be challenged through a pedagogy of disruption, itself a form of violence but a humanizing, rather than repressive, version. For this, the authors turn to Frantz Fanon's theory of violence, most clearly outlined in The Wretched of the Earth. First, the article outlines the basic assumptions of Fanon's theory of revolutionary, as opposed to repressive, violence. Second, we analyze the surrounding myths that an actual safe space exists for people of color when it concerns public race dialogue. Third, we critique the intellectualization of racism as part of the concrete violence lived by people of color in the academy, which whites continually reduce to an idea. We pedagogically reframe the racial predicament by promoting a 'risk' discourse about race, which does not assume safety but contradiction and tension. This does not suggest that people of color are somehow correct by virtue of their social location. In addition, it does not equate with creating a hostile situation but acknowledges that violence is already there. Finally, we consider the practical import of intellectual solidarity, where understanding racism becomes the higher good rather than whether or not one leaves the dialogue looking more or less racist than before.

Racial microaggressions as a tool for critical race research	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						macroaggression; institutionalized racism; racial microaggressions; white supremacy; everyday racism; critical race theory (CRT)	AMERICAN COLLEGE-STUDENTS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; EXPERIENCES; PEDAGOGY; CLIMATE; COLOR	This conceptual article utilizes critical race theory (CRT) to explain how everyday forms of racism - racial microaggressions - emerge in the everyday experiences of People of Color. We provide a framework for understanding and analyzing racial microaggressions that demonstrates how everyday racist events are systemically mediated by institutionalized racism (i.e. structures and processes), and guided by ideologies of white supremacy that justify the superiority of a dominant group (whites) over non-dominant groups (People of Color). To demonstrate the conceptual utility of the framework, we utilize historical and contemporary examples of racial micoraggressions, and offer varied ways to use the framework in critical race research. We argue racial microaggressions can be a powerful 'tool' for identifying, disrupting, and dismantling the racism that marginalizes, subordinates and excludes People of Color in and outside of education.

J	Dumas, MJ				Dumas, Michael J.			'Losing an arm': schooling as a site of black suffering	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						black education; school desegregation; cultural politics of education	DESEGREGATION	Drawing on data from a historical-ethnographic study of the cultural politics of school desegregation in Seattle, USA, the author explores suffering as a recurring theme in the narratives of four black leaders, educators and activists involved in the struggle for black educational opportunity in that city during the post-Civil Rights Era. As these black subjects reflect on the historical trajectory of racial desegregation policies and practices, they offer us a unique view of the confluence of racial melancholia, a heavy, deeply-felt awareness of the history and persistence of racial disregard and subjugation, and school malaise, a form of what Pierre Bourdieu has called la petite misere, or ordinary suffering. The author's analysis of these narratives highlights how these school and community leaders reflect on the meaning of black suffering in schools, what they understand as the source of that suffering, and how they imagine that suffering might be alleviated. The article concludes with recommendations for research at the nexus of race, education and social suffering.

J	Gillborn, D; Warmington, P; Demack, S				Gillborn, David; Warmington, Paul; Demack, Sean			QuantCrit: education, policy, "Big Data' and principles for a critical race theory of statistics	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical race theory; quantitative research methods; statistics; race; racism; education policy; Big Data	RACISM; EQUITY	Quantitative research enjoys heightened esteem among policy-makers, media, and the general public. Whereas qualitative research is frequently dismissed as subjective and impressionistic, statistics are often assumed to be objective and factual. We argue that these distinctions are wholly false; quantitative data is no less socially constructed than any other form of research material. The first part of the paper presents a conceptual critique of the field with empirical examples that expose and challenge hidden assumptions that frequently encode racist perspectives beneath the facade of supposed quantitative objectivity. The second part of the paper draws on the tenets of Critical Race Theory (CRT) to set out some principles to guide the future use and analysis of quantitative data. These QuantCrit' ideas concern (1) the centrality of racism as a complex and deeply rooted aspect of society that is not readily amenable to quantification; (2) numbers are not neutral and should be interrogated for their role in promoting deficit analyses that serve White racial interests; (3) categories are neither natural' nor given and so the units and forms of analysis must be critically evaluated; (4) voice and insight are vital: data cannot speak for itself' and critical analyses should be informed by the experiential knowledge of marginalized groups; (5) statistical analyses have no inherent value but can play a role in struggles for social justice.

Teachers, please learn our names!: racial microagressions and the K-12 classroom	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; racial microaggressions; racism; internalized racism; K-12 schools; Students of Color; teachers	CRITICAL RACE; EXPERIENCES	Many Students of Color have encountered cultural disrespect within their K-12 education in regards to their names. While the racial undertones to the mispronouncing of names in schools are often understated, when analyzed within a context of historical and current day racism, the authors argue that these incidents are racial microagressions - subtle daily insults that, as a form of racism, support a racial and cultural hierarchy of minority inferiority. Furthermore, enduring these subtle experiences with racism can have a lasting impact on the self-perceptions and worldviews of a child. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework and qualitative data, this study was designed to explore the racial microaggressions and internalized racial microaggressions of Students of Color in K-12 settings in regards to their names. Black, Latina/o Asian American, Pacific Islander and mixed race participants were solicited through various education electronic mail lists, and data was collected through short answer questionnaires and interviews. Coded for emergent themes, the data is organized into three sections: (1) Racial microaggressions and names in school; (2) Internalized racial microagressions; and (3) Addressing racial microagressions and internalized microagressions in schools. This article gives language to the racialized experiences many Students of Color endure. Additionally, it furthers our understanding of racial microaggressions by analyzing the complexity and impact from a multi-racial lens.

"I don't think I'm a racist": Critical Race Theory, teacher attitudes, and structural racism	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; teacher training; Whiteness; race; teacher attitudes	EDUCATION	This article is an ethnographic examination of teacher attitudes towards race, racism, and White privilege in response to anti-bias in-service trainings in two major U.S. urban school districts through the theoretical lens of Critical Race Theory. We employ the analytic tools of Whiteness as property to make sense of the messages teachers perceived and developed about race and racism. Further, we examine what teacher attitudes reveal about the structural dimensions of racial inequity in schooling and achievement. We argue that the racial attitudes expressed by teachers in this study are illustrative of larger structural racism that both informs and is reinforced by these attitudes and their manifestation in practice.

J	Ahmed, S				Ahmed, Sara			Embodying diversity: problems and paradoxes for Black feminists	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						racism; diversity; emotion; Black feminism		This paper examines some of the problems and paradoxes of embodying diversity for organisations. With reference to a research project based on interviews with diversity practitioners, as well as personal experience of working within universities as a Black feminist, this paper explores how diversity becomes a commitment that requires that those who embody that diversity express happiness and gratitude. Our very arrival into organisations is used as evidence that the whiteness of which we speak no longer exists. Most importantly to embody diversity can mean to be under pressure not to speak about racism. The very talk about racism is seen as introducing bad feeling into organisations. Drawing on the work of bell hooks and Audre Lorde, the paper argues that we need to reclaim the figure of the angry Black feminist, and that we need to refuse the injunction to be happy objects for the organisation, which means being willing to cause trouble and being prepared to stay as sore as our points.

J	Bodkin-Andrews, G; Carlson, B				Bodkin-Andrews, Gawaian; Carlson, Bronwyn			The legacy of racism and Indigenous Australian identity within education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; Indigenous education; racism; identity; resilience; epistemology	ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIANS; SELF-CONCEPT; STUDENTS; URBAN; DISCRIMINATION; ACHIEVEMENT; PREJUDICE; ATTITUDES; CHILDREN; PEOPLE	It may be argued that the emerging discourses focusing on the social, emotional, educational, and economic disadvantages identified for Australia's First Peoples (when compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts) are becoming increasingly dissociated with an understanding of the interplay between historical and current trends in racism. Additionally, and if not somewhat related to this critique, it can be suggested that the very construction of research from a Western perspective of Indigenous identity (as opposed to identities) and ways of being are deeply entwined within the undertones of epistemological racism still prevalent today. It is the purpose of this article to move beyond the overreliance of outside-based understanding Western epistemologies, and to explore not only the complex nature of both racism and identity from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives, but to also explore the role of education and research in perpetuating varying levels of racism and resistance to Indigenous identity(ies) from a contemporary insider-based standpoint. It is hoped this article will shed some light on the pervasive nature of racism directed at Indigenous Australians, and highlight the need for the continual acceptance, respect, and promotion of Indigenous voices and identities within the educational environment and beyond.

J	Garcia, NM; Lopez, N; Velez, VN				Garcia, Nichole M.; Lopez, Nancy; Velez, Veronica N.			QuantCrit: rectifying quantitative methods through critical race theory INTRODUCTION	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Editorial Material						Critical race theory; quantitative methodologies; educational research; QuantCrit		Critical race theory (CRT) in education centers, examines, and seeks to transform the relationship that undergirds race, racism, and power. CRT scholars have applied a critical race framework to advance research methodologies, namely qualitative interventions. Informed by this work, and 15years later, this article reconsiders the possibilities of CRT applications to quantitative methodologies through QuantCrit.' We ask the question: Can quantitative methods, long critiqued for their inability to capture the nuance of everyday experience, support and further a critical race agenda in educational research? We provide an abbreviated sketch of some of the key tenets of CRT and the enduring interdisciplinary contributions in race and quantitative studies. Second, we examine the legacy and genealogy of QuantCrit traditions across the disciplines to uncover a rich lineage of methodological possibilities for disrupting racism in research. We argue that quantitative approaches cannot be adopted for racial justice aims without an ontological reckoning that considers historical, social, political, and economic power relations. Only then can quantitative approach be re-imagined and rectified.

J	Kohli, R				Kohli, Rita			Critical race reflections: valuing the experiences of teachers of color in teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Critical Race Studies in Education Conference	2008	Chicago, IL			Critical Race Theory; racism; racial hierarchy; urban education; teacher-education; Asian-American teachers; Black teachers; Latino teachers; K-12 education		While research has demonstrated that White teachers often must be taught about the pain of racism in order to not perpetuate it, this may not apply to racial minority teachers. Through personal experience, Teachers of Color are likely aware of the trauma that racism can cause students. Within teacher education, we must create research and teaching strategies that acknowledge racial minority teachers as insiders to the experiences of racism in school, and as valuable assets in the fight for educational justice. Using a critical race theory (CRT) framework, this article explores the reflections of Women of Color educators regarding their encounters and observations with race and racism in K-12 schools. Qualitative interviews were conducted with twelve Asian-American, Black and Latina women enrolled in a social justice teacher preparation program in Los Angeles. Their stories expose (1) the personal experiences with racism the women endured within their K-12 education; (2) the parallel experiences with racism they observe Students of Color enduring in schools today; and (3) racial hierarchies within teacher education. This data highlights a cycle of racism that continues to manifest in the educational experiences of Asian-American, Black and Latina/o youth. Additionally, the important stories and ideas revealed through the process of this research draws attention to the personal knowledge teacher preparation programs can tap into when training Teachers of Color about educational inequality.

J	Brown, KD				Brown, Keffrelyn D.			Teaching in color: a critical race theory in education analysis of the literature on preservice teachers of color and teacher education in the US	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher education; interest convergence; critical race theory in education; counter-storytelling; critical race theory; Whiteness; preservice teachers of color	PREPARING TEACHERS; AMERICAN; COMMUNITY; LANGUAGE; IDENTITY; SCHOOLS; CAREER; POWER; IM	In this article I take seriously the call for recruiting and retaining more preservice teachers of color by critically considering some of the pressing challenges they might encounter in teacher preparation programs. I draw from critical race theory (CRT) in education to review the extant literature on preservice teachers of color and teacher education in the US. I excavate how the dominant, (dis)embodied and normalized culture of Whiteness, White privilege and White hegemony pervades contemporary teacher education, and presents a formidable challenge to the goal of preparing teachers (of color) to teach in a manner that is relevant, critical and humanizing while also socially and individually transformative. I conclude by envisioning how teacher education programs might address these challenges in such a way that more effectively meets the needs of preservice teachers.

'You got a pass, so what more do you want?': race, class and gender intersections in the educational experiences of the Black middle class	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher expectations; racism; social class; gender; intersectionality; parents		The article discusses the findings of an ESRC funded project (RES-062-23-1880) which used in-depth interviews to explore the educational experiences and strategies of 62 Black Caribbean parents; the biggest qualitative study of education and the Black middle class yet conducted in the UK. The article focuses on the parents' interactions with their children's teachers and, in particular, their experience that teachers tend to have systematically lower academic expectations for Black children (alongside a regime of heightened disciplinary scrutiny and criticism) regardless of the students' social class background. The parents' accounts highlight the significance of a cumulative process where a series of low level misdemeanours sometimes build into a pattern of seemingly incessant and unfair criticism that can have an enormously damaging impact on their children. Although our data suggest that these processes can involve children of both sexes and of any age, the parents report a particular concern for Black young men, whom they perceive to be especially at risk. Our findings demonstrate the continued significance of race inequality and illuminate the intersectional relationship between race and social class inequalities in education. This is particularly important at a time when English education policy assumes that social class is the overwhelming driver of achievement and where race inequity has virtually disappeared from the policy agenda. Our findings reveal that despite their material and cultural capital, many middle-class Black Caribbean parents find their high expectations and support for education thwarted by racist stereotyping and exclusion.

J	Milner, HR; Howard, TC				Milner, H. Richard; Howard, Tyrone C.			Counter-narrative as method: race, policy and research for teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; race; research; narrative; counter-narrative; equity; teaching; teacher education; instructional practice; policy	INTEREST-CONVERGENCE; STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT; AMERICA; CHALLENGES; REALITIES; DIVERSITY; IDENTITY; HISTORY	The authors argue for a research and conceptual agenda that complicates and disrupts common narratives in teacher education that have serious implications for race. Building on the pivotal work of legal scholar Derrick Bell and through a critical race theory (CRT) lens, this article challenges researchers to broaden and complexify traditional ideologies related to: (1) characteristics of ideal teachers recruited into the field; (2) the amount of time teachers should be expected to remain in the field through alternative programs such as Teach for America; (3)weight placed on teacher entrance examinations; (4)racial diversity of P-12 teachers; (5)racial and ethnic makeup of teacher educators; and (6)over-reliance on subject matter knowledge in teacher preparation to the exclusion of other aspects of learning to teach. The authors argue given the present racial divide in schools between teachers and students it is imperative for teacher education programs to complicate and intensify the utility of race in their recruitment, retention, and support of teacher education practices and policies. The authors offer a counter narrative framework and agenda to advance policy and research through a CRT lens.	[Milner, H.

J	Yoon, IH				Yoon, Irene H.			The paradoxical nature of whiteness-at-work in the daily life of schools and teacher communities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; teaching; discourse; teacher community; critical whiteness studies	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; CLASSROOM; STUDENTS; EDUCATION; PEDAGOGY; FEAR	US public schools produce persistent, racially-based inequities in educational opportunity and attainment. These institutional outcomes may be related to the fact that the schooling of low-income students and students of color is shaped, overwhelmingly, by middle-class white women teachers, who have relatively higher levels of privilege than, and certainly wield authority over, their students. In this case study, I follow a teacher study group made up of white women intent on addressing equity issues in their own school and observe what the study group addresses and how it operates. I utilize critical discourse analysis to elaborate ways in which whiteness is enacted in the study group and how that professional culture is also evident in one participating teacher's classroom. This article focuses on discursive strategies that create paradoxes among teachers' beliefs, intentions, and actions. I call these discursive paradoxes 'whiteness-at-work' and discuss the mechanics and implications of whiteness-at-work in elementary schools and classrooms. Thus, the article offers a look at how whiteness is collectively constructed by multiple players, in real time and despite educators' best intentions.

J	Hylton, K				Hylton, Kevin			Talk the talk, walk the walk: defining Critical Race Theory in research	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; methodology; 'race'; racism; research	WHITENESS; POLICY	Over the last decade there has been a noticeable growth in published works citing Critical Race Theory (CRT). This has led to a growth in interest in the UK of practical research projects utilising CRT as their framework. It is clear that research on 'race' is an emerging topic of study. What is less visible is a debate on how CRT is positioned in relation to methodic practice, substantive theory and epistemological underpinnings. The efficacy of categories of data gathering tools, both traditional and non-traditional is a discussion point here to explore the complexities underpinning decisions to advocate a CRT framework. Notwithstanding intersectional issues, a CRT methodology is recognisable by how philosophical, political and ethical questions are established and maintained in relation to racialised problematics. This paper examines these tensions in establishing CRT methodologies and explores some of the essential criteria for researchers to consider in utilising a CRT framework.

J	Ladson-Billings, G				Ladson-Billings, Gloria			'Who you callin' nappy-headed?' A critical race theory look at the construction of Black women	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; African American women; Black women teachers	TEACHERS	The spring 2007 furor over New York City syndicated radio personality Don Imus' racist and demeaning characterization of a group of African American women on a college basketball team set off a firestorm of debate and discussion throughout US media. However, little of this discussion focused on the broader constructions of Black women as unattractive, undesirable, and morally suspect. These constructions from popular culture find their way into education when Black women as teachers and mothers continue to face a separate and different set of standards about what it means to be a good teacher and/or a good mother. This paper uses a set of films about teaching and teachers as 'texts' that define and redefine what it means to be a teacher or a mother and explores the implications of these constructions for teaching and teacher education through a critical race theory perspective.

J	Devine, D; Kenny, M; Macneela, E				Devine, Dympna; Kenny, Mairin; Macneela, Eileen			Naming the 'other': children's construction and experience of racisms in Irish primary schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						racism; peer culture; children's voice; power; social identity	CITIZENSHIP; EDUCATION	This paper considers the construction and experience of racisms among a sample of primary school children in Ireland during a period of intensive immigration. Placing children's voices at the centre of the analysis, it explores how children's constructions draw upon discourses of 'norm' and 'other' in relation to national identity and cultural belonging. Constructions of minority ethnic groups are located within a context that defines what it is to be Irish, such constructions carrying with them assumptions related not only to skin colour but also to lifestyle, language, and religious belief. Drawing on key concepts related to power, social identities and child cultures, the findings highlight the significance of ethnic identity to children's negotiations around inclusion and exclusion in their peer groups. Name-calling in general, and racist name-calling in particular, was shown to be an important tool used by some children in the assertion of their status with one another. The sensitivity displayed by the majority ethnic children to skin colour only, in their discussions around racism, highlights the salience of colour to many of these children's typification of themselves as white Irish, and of many black migrant children especially as 'other'. It also indicates, however, the limited understanding these majority ethnic children had of racism in contrast to their minority ethnic peers (including Irish Traveller children), all of whom were able to recount their own experiences of being racially abused for colour and/or culturally-based differences. The need for teachers to be sensitive to the dynamics of children's social world is stressed, as is the importance of developing clear procedures for the monitoring and tackling of racist incidents in schools.

J	DiAngelo, R; Sensoy, O				DiAngelo, Robin; Sensoy, Ozlem			Getting slammed: White depictions of race discussions as arenas of violence	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						White supremacy; anti-racism education; safety; discourse analysis	PEDAGOGY; SAFETY	For many educators who lead cross-racial discussions, creating safe' spaces in which students can express their views is a familiar goal. Yet what constitutes safety is rarely defined or contextualized. In the absence of this contextualization, the goal of safety is most often driven by White participants who complain that they are (or fear being) attacked' in these discussions. This article examines this specific complaint, which we term as the discourse of violence. We draw on data from a facilitated race discussion and identify five key effects of this discourse in cross-racial discussion about race: positions and re-inscribes Whites as racially innocent; positions and re-inscribes people of Color as perpetrators of violence; maintains White solidarity; stabilizes the ideologies of individualism and universalism; re-inscribes the narration of the ideal imagined community. The data reveal that White students draw on violent imagery to position contexts in which race and racism are under discussion as unsafe spaces; as arenas of violence. We argue that the discourse of violence ultimately functions to protect and reproduce White supremacy, specifically in a context in which the goal is to interrupt White supremacy.

J	Crozier, G; Davies, J				Crozier, Gill; Davies, Jane			'The trouble is they don't mix': self-segregation or enforced exclusion?	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						South Asian youth; secondary school experience; exclusion; othering; racism	BANGLADESHI	This article draws on a two-year study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) of South Asian parents and their children's views on the school experience (Parents, Children and the School Experience: Asian Families' Perspectives - Grant Reference: R000239671). The article focuses on an aspect of the young people's school experience and reports that teachers constructed the students' behaviour in terms of 'Asian gang culture'. Teachers frequently criticised the South Asian students for not mixing with their white peers, not going on school trips, and not participating in extra-curricular activities. The authors discuss this in relation to notions of integration, teachers' perceptions of gendered and ethnic differences and issues of symbolic violence. The emphasis was on the students integrating into the dominant culture: in terms of conforming and knowing their place. In this sense the young people do not see a place for themselves. Ethnocentrism together with racist harassment serves to relegate the young people to the margins, where they have little choice but to remain, not least for fear of their safety.

J	Billings, GL				Billings, Gloria Ladson			Boyz to men? Teaching to restore Black boys' childhood	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black; male; education		Many schools see teaching African American boys as a daunting challenge. However, in many schools the primary focus of Black male children's educational experience is maintaining order and discipline rather than student learning and academic achievement. By the time Black boys reach the 3rd or 4th grade their teachers and other school personnel no longer treat them like children, but rather like men. This paper will describe the current state of education for Black male students and propose ways to ensure that we teach all children, particularly Black boys in intellectually, socially, and culturally appropriate ways.

Participants tended to utilize individualized definitions of racism and experience high levels of racial segregation in both their pre-college and college environments. This corresponded to participants seeing little evidence of racism, minimizing the power of contemporary racism, and framing whites as the true victims of multiculturalism (i.e. reverse racism'). This sense of racial victimization corresponded to the participants blaming racial minorities for racial antagonism (both on campus and society as a whole), which cyclically served to rationalize the persistence of segregated, white campus subenvironments. Within these ethnic enclaves, the participants reported minimal changes in their racial views since entering college with the exception of an enhanced sense of reverse racism,' and this cycle of racial privilege begetting racial privilege was especially pronounced within the fraternity system.

J	Phoenix, A				Phoenix, Ann			De-colonising practices: negotiating narratives from racialised and gendered experiences of education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Caribbean women; contact zones; identities; postcolonial feminism; schooling; serial migration	PERFORMANCE; THREAT	This paper uses feminist work on diaspora and postcolonial theory to examine the ways in which women serial migrants, who as children left the Caribbean to join their parents in the UK, experienced racialised, gendered intersections in the 'contact zone' of school. Drawing on narrative accounts from women serial migrants the paper argues that school was a key site for racialised subjectification, even though, as girls new to the UK, the participants had not yet come to an understanding of racialisation. Their mastery of a new school system occurred in contexts where they reported being subjected to racist discourses from teachers and other children. It was epistemically violent in that it involved learning that they were constructed as inadequate learners and undesirable femininities. As a result, they experienced subjectification and school itself as painful processes. All, however, reported agency in resisting subjection into representations of themselves as innately incapable. Their retrospective accounts indicated that postcolonial theory can illuminate how migrant children negotiate complex, racialised experiences in education and, in doing so, help to de-colonise everyday practices.

J	Ford, M				Ford, Margot			Achievement gaps in Australia: what NAPLAN reveals about education inequality in Australia	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						indigenous education; locked-in inequality; achievement gap; Australian education; national testing		Drawing on approaches used by Gillborn (), this article examines results from the most recent version of Australian national testing (NAPLAN) in Years 3, 5 and 9, operating since 2008. It analyses the inequality of achievement between indigenous and non-indigenous students in the States and Territories, with particular reference to New South Wales (NSW) and the Northern Territory (NT). It frames an analysis by using the concept of locked-in inequality, one element within Critical Race Theory (CRT) in education. Whilst there is an achievement gap between indigenous and non-indigenous students in all States, in the NT it is a staggering fifty percentage points or more in reading, writing and numeracy across all Year levels currently tested. This article argues that there has not been any significant change to indigenous education outcomes in comparison with their non-indigenous cohorts, since the introduction of government funded education in the NT. Locked-in inequality has been deep and long-lasting in the NT and unless significant changes take place, this is set to continue.

Using white, high-income women as our reference group, we report linear combinations of marginal effects for six-year graduation rates and developmental course taking across 20 distinct social locations varying according to race-ethnicity, gender, and class. We find substantial achievement gaps that remain unseen in conventional models treating such characteristics as independent. Nearly every group has a significantly lower likelihood of graduation compared to the reference group, and there is substantial variation in estimated achievement gaps. Low-income, American Indian men are approximately 45 percent less likely to graduate within six years relative to the reference group. For high income, black men this gap is approximately 30 percent. Our paper proposes a method and praxis for exploring the complex, interdependent relationship between race-ethnicity, gender, and class.

J	Mirza, HS				Mirza, Heidi Safia			Plotting a history: Black and postcolonial feminisms in 'new times'	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						black feminisms; postcolonial feminisms; embodied difference; multiple identities; intersectionality		Black feminist thought is grounded in an understanding of the nature of power and the way black/othered difference women's is systematically organised through social relations. Postcolonial feminist approaches enable us to situate the silent 'spectral' power of colonial times as it appears in the production and reproduction of marginalised, racialised and gendered others in new contemporary times. This special issue brings the two perspectives together to explore the complexities of black and ethnicised female marginality through an intersectional analysis where race, class, gender and other social divisions are theorised as lived realities. Through a variety of methodologies - such as the oral tradition of storytelling in CRT (critical race theory), embodied autobiography and geographically embedded longitudinal ethnographies - black and postcolonial feminist scholars chart new perspectives on multiple identity, hybridity, diaspora, religion, culture and sexuality. Exploring issues as diverse as black female marginality in higher education and their regulation and resistance in the neocolonial sites of schooling, work, family and the media, black and postcolonial feminist scholars of colour demonstrate their contribution to critical race and feminist thinking.

J	Kohli, R				Kohli, Rita			Unpacking internalized racism: teachers of color striving for racially just classrooms	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						internalized racism; school racism; teachers of color; urban education; teacher education; pre-service teachers; Critical Race Theory	CRITICAL RACE	Within racial inequitable educational conditions, students of color in US schools are susceptible to internalizing racism. If these students go on to be teachers, the consequences can be particularly detrimental if internalized racism influences their teaching. Framed in Critical Race Theory, this article investigates the process pre-service teachers of color took in unpacking their internalized racism as they strive for racially just classrooms. In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with black (four) Latina (four) and Asian American (four) women enrolled in a social justice-oriented urban teacher education program in California. Data revealed that participants in this study: (1) had experienced racism and internalized racism in their K-12 education; (2) had done self-work prior to enrolling in their teacher education program to begin the process of unpacking internalized racism; and (3) felt that critical dialogues about internalized racism within teacher preparation was essential to develop pedagogy that challenges racial inequality. This study adds to the field by taking a cross-racial approach to understanding the struggles of teachers of color with internalized racism in their own lives. It additionally outlines an important process many teachers of color go through to develop racially just classrooms.

J	Evans-Winters, VE; Hoff, PT				Evans-Winters, Venus E.; Hoff, Pamela Twyman			The aesthetics of white racism in pre-service teacher education: a critical race theory perspective	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; critical race feminism; pre-service education; aesthetics of racism	MICROAGGRESSIONS; STUDENTS; IDENTITY; FACULTY	The authors use critical race theory (CRT) and critical race feminism (CRF) as a lens for analyzing and grappling with White students' resistance to learning about and deconstructing systems of oppression. The authors build on the work of critical scholars whose work exposes the ways in which White pre-service teachers resist counter-hegemonic pedagogical approaches and subject matter. In the so-called 'post-racial' era, these ways of resisting have become more virulent and structural in nature, thereby institutionalizing racism. Included in the article are excerpts from the authors' end of the academic year teaching evaluations. The excerpted comments serve as evidence that students use evaluations as weapons to speak back to and against, not only to anti-racist philosophies, but counter-hegemonic narratives that represent the diversity of their future teaching experiences. Both faculty members are formally trained in social work, multicultural education, and educational policy. Finally, using CRT and CRF the authors argue that cultural hegemony is institutionalized when White students are afforded the privilege to evaluate Black female professors without academic departments and universities critically assessing the role that racism and sexism play in student feedback. Our use of CRT and CRF make transparent the ways in which White students' resistance as cultural hegemony is institutionalized in their evaluations of experiences in social foundations courses. The article has implications for teacher education programs, higher education policy, and social foundations of education.

J	Rollock, N				Rollock, Nicola			The invisibility of race: intersectional reflections on the liminal space of alterity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Whiteness; marginality; intersectionality; Critical Race Theory; Black middle classes	EDUCATION; WHITENESS	It has been argued that racialised Others occupy a liminal space of alterity; a position at the edges of society from which their identities and experiences are constructed. Rather than being regarded as a place of disadvantage and degradation, it has been posited that those excluded from the centre can experience a 'perspective advantage' as their experiences and analyses become informed by a panoramic dialectic offering a wider lens than the white majority located in the privileged spaces of the centre are able to deploy. In this article, I invite the reader to glimpse the world from this liminal positioning as I reflect critically on how the intersections between social class, race and gender variously advantage or disadvantage, depending on the context, the ways in which Black middle classes are able to engage with the education system. While I make reference to findings from a recent school-focused ESRC project 'The Educational Strategies of the Black Middle Classes'(1) the article takes a wider perspective of the education system, also incorporating an autobiographical analysis of the academy as a site of tension, negotiation and challenge for the few Black middle classes therein. I make use of the Critical Race Theory tool of chronicling (counter-narrative) to help demonstrate the complex, multifaceted and often contradictory ways in which ambitions for race equality often represent lofty organisational ideals within which genuine understanding of racism is lacking.

J	Skerrett, A				Skerrett, Allison			English teachers' racial literacy knowledge and practice	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						English language arts; English teachers; literacy; professional development; racial diversity	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; CLASSROOM	This article examines how secondary English teachers in two racially diverse schools - one in Massachusetts, USA, the other in Ontario, Canada - described their knowledge of and practices for teaching about race and racism. The extent and quality of teachers' racial literacy knowledge and practice were considered in light of the literature on racial literacy, racial literacy instruction, and anti-racist education. Three approaches to racial literacy instruction were identified: apprehensive and authorized; incidental and ill-informed; and sustained and strategic. The paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of teachers' knowledge and skills in order to suggest content and structures for professional development in support of racial literacy instruction.

J	Lynn, M; Jennings, ME				Lynn, Marvin; Jennings, Michael E.			Power, politics, and critical race pedagogy: a critical race analysis of Black male teachers' pedagogy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Critical Race Studies in Education Conference	2008	Chicago, IL			African-American teachers; critical race pedagogy; Critical Race Theory; African-American education; critical pedagogy; critical theory		In this article, the authors explore the analytic connections between the scholarship on Black teachers and the development of the concept of critical pedagogy. In particular, the authors conduct a detailed analysis of both of these discourses and then explore the work of two African-American male teachers in an urban school in Los Angeles. The findings reveal that the links between critical pedagogy and the scholarship on Black teachers is stronger than the existing literature would suggest. Additionally, it is suggested that Black male teachers in urban communities embody qualities outlined in both critical pedagogy and the scholarship on Black teachers.

J	Kishimoto, K				Kishimoto, Kyoko			Anti-racist pedagogy: from faculty's self-reflection to organizing within and beyond the classroom	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Anti-racist pedagogy; identity; institutional transformation; organizing; race; social positions		This article is a synthesis of my own work as well as a critical reading of the key literature in anti-racist pedagogy. Its purpose is to define anti-racist pedagogy and what applying this to courses and the fullness of our professional lives entails. I argue that faculty need to be aware of their social position, but more importantly, to begin and continue critical self-reflection in order to effectively implement anti-racist pedagogy, which has three components: (1) incorporating the topics of race and inequality into course content, (2) teaching from an anti-racist pedagogical approach, and (3) anti-racist organizing within the campus and linking our efforts to the surrounding community. In other words, anti-racist pedagogy is an organizing effort for institutional and social change that is much broader than teaching in the classroom.

J	Harrison, L; Sailes, G; Rotich, WK; Bimper, AY				Harrison, Louis, Jr.; Sailes, Gary; Rotich, Willy K.; Bimper, Albert Y., Jr.			Living the dream or awakening from the nightmare: race and athletic identity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						athletic identity; race	AFRICAN-AMERICAN; STEREOTYPE THREAT; PERFORMANCE; WHITE	Education is often viewed as the door that leads out of poverty for many students of color. But for many African American boys and young men, the dream of becoming a professional athlete is a door that appears to be wide open. Considering the over-representation of African American athletes in revenue-producing sports in colleges, universities and at the professional ranks, it is no surprise that many African American male youth develop aspirations for, and identify with the athletic role. These aspirations may become even more focused and intense if they ascend to the level of division I college athletes. The identification with the athlete role is likely to intensify as they get closer to the goal of professional sport. Most individuals occupy multiple identities or roles in life such as sibling, student, spouse, employee, athlete, etc. Identity salience and strength depends on the importance of that role. Athletic identity has been defined as the degree to which an individual identifies with the athletic role. Few studies have examined the impact and influences of race on athletic role identification. This study explores the relationship between race and athletic identity. Division I-A African American and Caucasian American football student-athletes' responses to the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale were analyzed (Brewer, Raalte, and Linder 1993). Results indicated that African American football student-athletes have a stronger athletic identity compared to their Caucasian American counterparts. Differences in specific items on the scale indicated that African American student-athletes were more internally focused on their sport, felt that others perceive them only as athletes, and see sport as the focal point in their lives. Differences in these items and implications of these results suggest that there is a potential impact on academic achievement and the student-athlete's aspirations.

J	Vakil, S; Ayers, R				Vakil, Sepehr; Ayers, Rick			The racial politics of STEM education in the USA: interrogations and explorations	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Editorial Material						STEM education; critical race theory; identity; urban education	SCIENCE; IDENTITY; SCHOOLS; RACE	This special issue brings together a mix of early-career, mid, and senior scholars to critically examine current realities of, and boldly imagine future possibilities for, STEM education in the lives of racially minoritized children in the United States. Given the implicit and sometimes explicit aspirations of STEM education to be a counteracting force against racialized injustice, how do students and communities of color experience and make sense of STEM reforms/initiatives? By examining a broad range of STEM contexts including mathematics, computer science, science and environmental science education, and through a diversity of methodological approaches, this special issue aims to contribute to a scholarly conversation about how racialized power intersects with the larger themes and foci of STEM education. In our introduction, we both highlight broad themes of the issue, and offer possible directions for future research at the intersections of race, power, and STEM.

J	Pilkington, A				Pilkington, Andrew			The interacting dynamics of institutional racism in higher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						racism; education; whiteness		This article has its origins in the Macpherson report's contention that public organisations in British society are characterised by institutional racism. Drawing upon the Parekh report's identification of ten components of institutional racism, the article examines which, if any, of these components are manifest in a university in Central England that was the subject of ethnographic investigation in the decade following the publication of the Macpherson report. It is argued that the Parekh report's identification of various components of institutional racism is helpful in disclosing the extent of disadvantage faced by Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) staff and students and the institution's reluctance to do anything about it. It is also illuminating in sensitising us to the overwhelming Whiteness of the university and the position of White privilege within it.

J	Aleman, E; Aleman, SM				Aleman, Enrique, Jr.; Aleman, Sonya M.			'Do Latin@ interests always have to oconvergeo with White interests?': (Re)claiming racial realism and interest-convergence in critical race theory praxis	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race praxis; interest-convergence principle; racial realism; politics of education	EDUCATION	The interest-convergence principle proposes that change benefitting people and communities of color only occurs when those interests also benefit Whites. As newly transplanted Chicano/a residents of a state facing exponential growth of its Latino immigrant population, we have attempted to counter the efforts criminalizing members of our Latino/a community, and have witnessed attempts to do so through an alignment of interests between Latinos/as and Whites. In this article, we examine the current scholarship regarding interest-convergence and present a counterstory of educational leadership and politics affecting our own community. We use the counterstory to particularize and problematize how critical race theory concepts operate in real-world situations. Ultimately, the counterstory reveals that using interest-convergences as a political strategy divorces activism from the foundational tenets of critical race theory, preventing discussions that center race and racism and distorting Bell's original notion of this principle. We argue that claiming this approach as the primary strategy for social change, negatively affects social justice goals. Our discussion section highlights three tensions that result from this misuse, and pushes critical race scholars to better understand that the concept of interest-convergence carries its greatest impact towards social transformation when it remains directly linked to the foregrounding of race and racism.

The aim of the module was to provide students with the opportunity to experience learning across the boundaries of institution, discipline, language, race and class, and to provide the team with data to enhance understanding of how students grapple with issues of difference. The study was based on data obtained from student texts produced in response to the final reflective essay assignment. The texts provided valuable insights into how students, some of whom appeared to come into contact with peers from different socioeconomic backgrounds for the first time, grappled with themselves in relation to 'the other'. A theoretical framework based on the notion of a 'pedagogy of discomfort' and the complementary relationship of recognition and distribution, was used to explicate the data. The data revealed that there are cognitive as well as affective dimensions in learning about difference. It suggested that a pedagogical intervention can enhance what students learn about difference, but that this depends on various factors: pedagogical factors, and factors pertaining to the students' own prior experience and cultural capital. The analysis of the assignments suggested that power differentials and inequality in terms of material and cultural resources can limit the transformational character of such initiatives.

J	Santoro, N				Santoro, Ninetta			'If I'm going to teach about the world, I need to know the world': developing Australian pre-service teachers' intercultural competence through international trips	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher education; international programmes; culturally responsive teachers; postcolonialism; ethnicity		Increasingly, there is an imperative to prepare teachers who can address the needs of ethnically and racially diverse learners. One way to do so is to make available to pre-service teachers opportunities for an international experience so that they might learn about the world and develop better understandings of cultural diversity and difference. In this article, I draw on the findings of a qualitative study that aimed to investigate pre-service teachers' perceptions of the value of an international experience to their development as teachers. I present excerpts of interview data that highlight how fourteen Australian pre-service teachers who went to India to live and teach for a month, made sense of their experiences. Findings raise concerns about how they saw the trip primarily as an opportunity for tourism and how it became a vehicle through which postcolonial and neocolonial views were developed and maintained. I conclude by making recommendations for teacher education as well as for the organisation of the trip.

J	Zembylas, M				Zembylas, Michalinos			Rethinking race and racism as technologies of affect: theorizing the implications for anti-racist politics and practice in education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						anti-racism; affect; education; racism; affective turn; race	LITERACY	This article draws on the concept of race and racism as "technologies of affect" to think with some of the interventions and arguments of critical affect studies. The author suggests that critical affect theories enable the theorization of race and racism as affective modes of being that recognize the historically specific assemblages which are practiced in schools and the society. It is also argued that rethinking race and racism as technologies of affect, a vision of anti-racist politics and practice in education can be formed in ways that go beyond recognition or resistance, but rather attend to the production of pedagogical spaces and practices that create ways of living differently. The education implications of this idea are discussed in relation to how teachers and teacher educators can begin not only to analyze the affective mobilizations of race and racism, but also to engage in political struggles that harness the affective forces of anti-racist action in everyday life.

J	Brown, AL; Donnor, JK				Brown, Anthony L.; Donnor, Jamel K.			Toward a new narrative on Black males, education, and public policy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black males; public policy; Black male crisis	AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES; CRITICAL RACE THEORY; PERSPECTIVE; INEQUALITY	This article examines the Black male crisis thesis promulgated by the social science literature, public policy, and mainstream discourse, respectively. The authors contend that the stock-story that the majority of African American males are 'at-risk' for engaging in self-destructive behavior or on the verge of extinction perpetuates a discourse of Black male pathology, which leads to over-emphasis of behavior modification as a strategy for their collective improvement. Subsequently, de-emphasis on the historical and structural role of race as a life opportunity-shaping variable occurs, which renders an incomplete understanding of the social and educational status of Black males in the United States. As a result, public policies and social programs guided by this deficit discourse are unlikely to create meaningful change for this population, because society's existing political economic structures are left unchallenged. The article concludes with the assertion that a 'new narrative' is needed in order to rethink the complex and systematic ways the social and educational status of Black males in the United States are constructed.

J	Flores, J; Garcia, S				Flores, Judith; Garcia, Silvia			Latina testimonios: a reflexive, critical analysis of a 'Latina space' at a predominantly White campus	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Critical Race Studies in Education Conference	2008	Chicago, IL			Testimonios student groups; Chicanas/Latinas on predominantly White campuses; Critical Race Feminism; LatCrit; Chicana/Latina feminist theory; digital stories		Judith Flores and Silvia Garcia (University of Utah) draw from the work of their mentor, Rina Benmayor and Telling to live: Latina feminist testimonios to establish an organization for Latinas who are staff, faculty, students, alumni, and community members at a predominantly White institution (PWI). Critical race feminism (CRF), Latina/o critical theory (LatCrit), and foundational work from US Third World feminists, informed the need to create a space where Latinas could discuss issues such as body image, language, sexual orientation, how to navigate academia, mentorship, genealogy, epistemologies, immigration status, and educational backgrounds among others. Flores and Garcia write about the need for the formation of a 'Latina space'. They evaluate the impact of this space where experiential knowledge is fostered and nurtured. The authors accentuate on the benefits and areas for improvement to strengthen the Latinas Telling Testimonios (LTT) group as it evolves in its third year. Flores and Garcia argue that when students and scholars of color are the minority on PWIs, a way of coping with issues of alienation and isolation is by 'testifying', bearing witness and telling their testimonios in order to succeed at a predominantly White campus, especially as women of color.

J	Subedi, B; Daza, SL				Subedi, Binaya; Daza, Stephanie Lynn			The possibilities of postcolonial praxis in education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical global perspectives; identities; postcolonial; racialization		This introduction to the special issue explores the possibilities of postcolonial praxis in the field of education. The local/global focus of postcolonial perspectives invites alternative ways of theorizing question of pedagogy, curriculum and research. Postcolonial praxis similarly highlights how questions of differences and identity need to be critically reexamined and how cross racial/ethnic solidarity against dominant ways of being requires new ways of theorizing anti-oppressive struggles. By critically highlighting issues of gender, we examine three themes relevant in postcolonial praxis: (1) discrepant identities; (2) critical global perspectives; and (3) racialization and ethnic postcolonial discourse.

J	Martin, DB				Martin, Danny Bernard			Equity, inclusion, and antiblackness in mathematics education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Equity; antiblackness; reform; mathematics education	RACE; CHILDREN; MATH; STEM	Despite decades of equity- and inclusion-oriented discourse and reform in mathematics education, Black learners in the U.S. continue to experience dehumanizing and violent forms of mathematics education. I suggest that equity for Black learners in mathematics education is a delusion rooted in the fictions of white imaginaries, contingent on appeasing white logics and sensitivities, and characterized at best by incremental changes that do little to threaten the maintenance of racial hierarchies inside or outside of mathematics education. Moreover, the forms of inclusion offered up in equity-oriented discourses and reforms represent contexts of containment and enclosure that keep Black people in their same relative position. Refusal is suggested as a strategy for Black learners to resist the anti-Black character of mathematics education, and as a first step in actualizing forms of mathematics education that are worthy of Black learners.

J	Nxumalo, F; Ross, KM				Nxumalo, Fikile; Ross, Kihana Miraya			Envisioning Black space in environmental education for young children	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Antiblackness; environmental education; early childhood education; speculative fiction	ANTHROPOCENE; FRAMEWORK	In this article, we bring attention to absences and deficit assumptions that continue to circulate in relation to environmental education for young Black children in North America. We focus our attention on tracing some of the ways in which racial innocence works to exclude and limit possibilities for young Black children's learning. Our analysis includes making visible connections between racialized discourses of childhood innocence, antiblackness in schooling, ongoing settler colonialism, and dominant forms of environmental education for young children. In seeking otherwise possibilities for Black childhoods in environmental education contexts, we turn to Black speculative fiction as a creative and generative mode of imagining fugitive educational spaces for young Black children.

J	Bhopal, K; Rhamie, J				Bhopal, Kalwant; Rhamie, Jasmine			Initial teacher training: understanding 'race,' diversity and inclusion	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						diversity; 'race'; trainee teachers; inclusion; initial teacher training	PRESERVICE TEACHERS; CULTURAL-DIVERSITY; US	There is little research which has explored how students on Initial Teacher Training (ITT) courses understand and conceptualise discourses of 'race', diversity and inclusion. This article will focus on student understandings of racialised identities; it will explore the discourses by which students understand what it means to be White and what it means to be Black, within the context of ITT. The article will examine the different facets and themes of identity within the context of belonging and exclusion which exist within higher education in the cultural and social contexts of English universities. The findings indicate that students' understandings of 'race', diversity and inclusion on ITT courses are complex and multifaceted. The article argues that greater training is needed in relation to the practical assistance that student teachers require in terms of increasing their understanding of diversity and dealing with racism in the classroom.

J	Mitchell, K				Mitchell, Kara			Race, difference, meritocracy, and English: majoritarian stories in the education of secondary multilingual learners	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						multilingual learners; Critical Race Theory; secondary schools	LANGUAGE LEARNERS; TEACHERS ROLES; LITERACY; STUDENTS; POLICY; OPPORTUNITIES; DEFINITION; ENGAGEMENT; SUCCESS; ISSUES	In this study, empirical and conceptual scholarship (approximately 100 studies) regarding the education of secondary multilingual learners and their teachers are analyzed through the lens of critical race theory (CRT). Specifically, four common majoritarian stories are identified that are both challenged and endorsed in the research literature: there is no story about race, difference is deficit, meritocracy is appropriate, and English-is-all-that-matters. This article discusses the literature, the four identified majoritarian stories and the specific ways they are both promoted and countered throughout the literature. The implications of these four majoritarian stories on research, policy, and practice are also addressed and the article concludes with a discussion about the value the identification of these stories offers for future research.

J	Warmington, P				Warmington, Paul			Taking race out of scare quotes: race-conscious social analysis in an ostensibly post-racial world	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; social practice; post-racial analysis; mediation; pedagogy		Academics and activists concerned with race and racism have rightly coalesced around the sociological project to refute biologistic conceptions of race. By and large, our default position as teachers, writers and researchers is that race is a social construct. However, the deconstruction of race and its claims to theoretical intelligibility has also left us buckling under the weight of scare quotes, prefixes, suffixes, qualifiers and euphemisms. Why has race been singled out in this way? In this ostensibly 'post-racial' context, how can race-conscious scholars (to use Leonardo's term) speak not just of racism or racialization but of race itself in the work that we do? These are pedagogic questions because pedagogy is not simply a synonym for teaching and learning styles; it is also the study of connections between teaching and learning and wider social structures, cultural shifts and intellectual conditions. This paper draws upon the work of Gilroy, Winant, Leonardo and Pollock to argue the value of representing race as a central social practice ordered by shifting boundaries, tools and categories. The paper takes issue with post-racial positions and suggests that, while race's false dimensions need to be understood, race is not simply something to be overcome. A racial analysis that incorporates imaginative and material lenses is the required tool for beginning to dismantle real and damaging racial practices. We are post-racial in having moved beyond pseudogenetic notions of race; however, we are not 'post-racial' per se. Therefore we must make creative use of the paradox of race-conscious scholarship: working both with and against conceptual tools that have yet to be effectively replaced.

J	Patton, LD; Bondi, S				Patton, Lori D.; Bondi, Stephanie			Nice white men or social justice allies?: using critical race theory to examine how white male faculty and administrators engage in ally work	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						higher education; critical race theory; white men; social justice allies	EDUCATION	Numerous scholars have offered definitions and perspectives for White people to be or become social justice allies. The purpose of this study was to examine the complicated realities that social justice allies in higher education face when working on campus. Using a critical interpretivist approach grounded in critical race theory, the authors intepret participants constructions of allies and ally work and draw larger implications for these constructions and their capacity to disrupt and uphold systems of oppression and injustice. In examining the experiences of White male faculty and administrators who shared how they constructed and made meaning of the complexities embedded in ally work, we found that participants situated ally work at individual, rather than institutional levels. Findings also revealed the paradox of engaging in ally work, which involved few risks and sacrifices, but greater rewards for being perceived as "good" people. Finally, ally work was viewed as aspirational for the participants. Recommendations for future research and scholarship are offered.

J	Lensmire, TJ				Lensmire, Timothy J.			Ambivalent white racial identities: fear and an elusive innocence	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; white racial identity; white fear		This article examines the complex social production of white racial identity. Specifically, the author theorizes white people's fear of people of color and make a case for conceiving of white racial identities as profoundly ambivalent. Drawing from a larger ethnographic interview study conducted in a small, rural, white community in the Midwest of the United States, and grounded in critical whiteness studies, this article explores how Delores, an elementary school teacher, experienced being white, and how being white for Delores was very much intertwined with ways of thinking and feeling that she had learned growing up in this rural community. The purpose is to describe and theorize white identity and whiteness in ways that avoid essentializing them, but that also keep in view white privilege and a larger white supremacist context. A growing number of researchers and educators argue that our previous conceptions of white identity have too often hurt rather than helped our critical pedagogies with white students. This article, then, contributes to a more nuanced and helpful portrait of white racial identity that we might draw on in our social justice efforts.

J	Lander, V				Lander, Vini			Race, culture and all that: an exploration of the perspectives of White secondary student teachers about race equality issues in their initial teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						initial teacher education; critical race theory; Whiteness		This research explores the racialised perceptions of White students teachers who are preparing to teach in secondary schools in a diverse society. Student teachers' views about Black and minority ethnic (BME) pupils are often cast in the language of otherness. This research was conducted in a post-1992 university in the south of England where the majority of students on initial teacher education (ITE) programmes are White, which reflects the ethnicity of serving teachers in England (95.5% of whom are White). In England all student teachers are required to fulfil the Professional Standards for Qualified Teacher Status 2007 which incorporates statements on the understanding of cultural and linguistic issues. It could be argued that the inclusion of such standards would result in student teachers who are competent in these aspects. But this is not borne out in the annual survey of newly qualified teachers. This research draws on critical race theory as a theoretical framework to analyse how the students' ethnicity influenced their initial perceptions and how notions of White privilege might inform their positions and responses to race-related issues in school. The interviews with student teachers revealed the inadequacy of their initial preparation to deal with the 'scary' situations associated with race issues in school.

J	Winn, MT				Winn, Maisha T.			'Betwixt and between': literacy, liminality, and the celling of Black girls	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						literacy; school-to-prison pipeline; gender; African American girls; urban education		In this article the author examines the lives of formerly incarcerated African American girls of ages 14-17 who participate in a playwriting and performance program in an urban southeastern American city and who consequently find themselves 'betwixt and between' incarcerated and liberated lives. Through interviews with formerly incarcerated girls in this program, participant observation, and student writing, this article contextualizes these girls' experiences in a larger discourse of African American women writers and speakers being 'celled' throughout the history of the United States. Interviews with girls revealed narratives that challenge education research to examine these lives on the periphery with urgency.

J	Davila, B				Davila, Brianne			Critical race theory, disability microaggressions and Latina/o student experiences in special education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						special education; disability microaggressions; Latina/o students; CRT	CAMPUS RACIAL CLIMATE; LIFE; CHICANA	This research draws upon critical race theory (CRT) to explore the experiences of Latina/o students in special education. It seeks to extend the theoretical construct of racial microaggressions and illustrate the additional layer of disability as I present data that are particular to the context of special education and the assigned label of students with disabilities. In this article, I draw upon three academic semesters of ethnographic observations and present observed cases of disability microaggressions that occur against Latina/o students in special education. The types of disability microaggressions include low expectations, disregard, and bullying. Students often did not challenge these microaggressions, but they occasionally resulted in students' refusal of academic services, providing an additional barrier to their academic success within the context of a program intended to facilitate it. And given the close-knit, intimate environment of the learning center, disability microaggressions that occurred resulted in a collective impact for Latina/o students in special education.

J	Beratan, GD				Beratan, Gregg D.			The song remains the same: transposition and the disproportionate representation of minority students in special education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; disability; disproportionate representation; institutional ablism; interest convergence; transposition	ACCOUNTABILITY	The disproportionate representation of minority students in special education has long been recognised as a problem in the United States. It is, however, only with the 2004 authorisation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) that Congress has tried to prescribe a remedy for this. Beginning with a deconstruction of the case law, public law and policy interpretations built around IDEA, this paper will first use an understanding of the concept of 'institutional ablism' as it has been developed within disability studies, to challenge the widely accepted view of IDEA as civil rights legislation. Drawing on Critical Race Theory, the article will then offer a further deconstruction of IDEA focusing on the IDEA's attempt to address the disproportionate representation of minority students in special education. The analysis of the law illustrates the use of a mechanism that I will call transposition: the use of the legally accepted segregation of special education to maintain the effects of the unacceptable and illegal segregation by race. The analysis will make the case that the development of special education in the United States offers yet another example of interest convergence, specifically that of the marginal disability rights gained with the creation of special education converging with the white interest of recouping the losses of the US Supreme Court's historic Brown v. Board of Education desegregation decision.

J	Gomez, ML; Rodriguez, TL; Agosto, V				Gomez, Mary Louise; Rodriguez, Terri L.; Agosto, Vonzell			Who are Latino prospective teachers and what do they bring to US schools?	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher development; preservice teachers; teacher education	EDUCATION; IDENTITY	In this article, the authors draw on life-history methods to investigate the family, school, university, and teacher education experiences of three Latino teacher candidates in a large, midwestern, research-oriented university in the United States. They show how in university social experiences and in teacher education classes and field experiences, these young men often felt misinterpreted in interactions with white females in particular. Also evident is their strong desire to make personal connections with youth and families they teach. The authors offer suggestions for how teacher educators can be more responsive to prospective male elementary teachers and teacher candidates of color.

J	Wane, NN				Wane, Njoki Nathani			Mapping the field of Indigenous knowledges in anti-colonial discourse: a transformative journey in education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Indigenous knowledge; anti-colonial		This paper interrogates Indigenous knowledge and practices a crucial form of anti-colonial resistance. It aims to capture the fluidity between the past and present, recognizing that the former cannot be quarantined from the latter. In this exploratory discussion, I argue that Indigenous knowledge is a living experience that is informed by ancestral voices. Within this context, I examine anti-colonial discourses as articulated by scholars in the 1960s and as they are taken up today. Discourses are ways of referring to, or constructing knowledge about, a particular topic, practice, social activity or institutional site in society. In doing so, I aim to share with the reader my struggle with colonial education and to elicit a dialogue on questions about how we, individually and collectively, can disrupt the entrenchment of this type of education. These questions include: How did colonial systems of education disrupt the spiritual and cultural beliefs and traditional ways of life of African peoples? How have colonized peoples, especially African women, resisted, and how do they continue to resist, colonial education? And how can the engagement of Indigenous Knowledge transform pedagogical approaches, curriculum, and learning in the academy? In exploring these questions, I will examine the concept of knowledge production: who controls knowledge and whose knowledge is valid. My reflections are grounded in my experiences as an African woman caught between a European education system and a traditional knowledge base.

J	Knoester, M; Au, W				Knoester, Matthew; Au, Wayne			Standardized testing and school segregation: like tinder for fire?	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						High-stakes standardized testing; segregation; critical race theory; racial coding	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EDUCATION	Recent research suggests that high-stakes standardized testing has played a negative role in the segregation of children by race and class in schools. In this article we review research on the overall effects of segregation, the positive and negative aspects of how desegregation plans were carried out following the 1954 Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education, and the de facto re-segregation that followed the dismantling of many desegregation plans, along with the increase of school choice plans. We then analyze these effects in light of the ways that high-stakes standardized testing has grown in importance and intensity in US education policy and practice, especially during the most recent period of school re-segregation. Based on the evidence we argue that the intrinsic features of high-stakes testing, combined with current systems of school choice, function as mechanisms used for racial coding that facilitate segregation and compound inequalities found in schools.

J	Sian, KP				Sian, Katy Pal			Spies, surveillance and stakeouts: monitoring Muslim moves in British state schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						PVE; extremism; Islamophobia; post-racial; education		This article will provide a critique of the PVE initiative and its implementation within the context of primary education following the events of 9/11, the 2001 riots and 7/7. Drawing upon empirical data I will argue that the monitoring of young Muslims and 'extremism' is problematic and reinforces the logics of Islamophobia through practices of governmentality. Moreover I will examine how whilst the monitoring of extremism is prioritized in many schools, training for teachers on race equality, tolerance and accepting difference is weak if not absent. This, I suggest, demonstrates a clear manifestation of contemporary hegemonic post-racial politics which increasingly silences the critique of institutional racism. Additionally this article will explore how Muslims in the sphere of education have been implicated and problematised against the backdrop of a 'muscular liberalism' intent on the return of assimilationist discourses.

J	Matias, CE				Matias, Cheryl E.			Who you callin' white?! A critical counter-story on colouring white identity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; counter-storytelling; Whiteness; resistance; racial identity; action research; Critical Social Theory	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; PEDAGOGY; RACISM	This action research, which utilizes critical race theory's counter-storytelling, analyses a process of debunking White students' epistemology of ignorance in a history course at an urban public high school. After piloting a raced curriculum that deliberately re-centers marginalized counter-stories of students of colour, I document its impacts on White students' understanding of history. Ultimately, such a process problematizes White students' sense of identity. I employ the analytic tools of Whiteness as power to understand how White students responded to curriculum on race and racism. The analysis silences White dominant Discourse while activating counter-stories by modelling critical consciousness and colourscence for my students of colour. Further, I detail two specific responses made by White students in this study: (1) symbiotic transformation; and (2) active resistance. Regardless of the differences in responses, both are processes in debunking White epistemology of ignorance.

These creations are: the Social Justice Education Project (SJEP); the Critically Compassionate Intellectualism Model of Transformative Education (CCI); and CCI's Third Dimension.

Its main conclusion is that whether one examines representation in terms of numbers of racialized and Indigenous faculty members and their positioning within the system, their earned income as compared to white faculty, their daily life experiences within the university as workplace, or interactions with colleagues and students, the results are more or less the same. Racialized and Indigenous faculty and the disciplines or areas of their expertise are, on the whole, low in numbers and even lower in terms of power, prestige, and influence within the University.

Through the use of focus groups, African American undergraduates from a large California State University campus, share the ways in which campus racism impacts their achievement potential as well as their behavior and emotional well-being. The results of the study illuminate how research on the difference in black-white grade performance must begin to examine the role of racism, and the way in which it constricts the academic opportunities afforded to African American undergraduates.

J	Myers, M; McGhee, D; Bhopal, K				Myers, Martin; McGhee, Derek; Bhopal, Kalwant			At the crossroads: Gypsy and Traveller parents' perceptions of education, protection and social change	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Gypsy; Traveller; bonding social capital; umwelt; racism; community; risk		This article uses empirical data gathered during a pilot study funded by a local education authority to consider Gypsy and Traveller parents' perceptions of education. It examines the changing role of education within the lives of Gypsy and Traveller parents and children reflecting changing social circumstances, in particular how many parents now feel schooling has a greater place in their children's lives than would have been the case a generation ago. The research demonstrated that many families felt their children could learn skills at school and that would be necessary to generate an income in the future. This adaptation towards schooling designed for a sedentary population carried with it a large degree of concern from the point of view of Gypsy and Traveller parents around issues such as cultural erosion and safety, (issues that in the past may have led to many children not attending school). Employing concepts such as Goffman's umwelt and Putnam's description of defensive bonding social capital this article considers such concerns. It examines how parental anxiety about the transition from primary to secondary schools and the associated perceptions of risk posed by the permissive culture of the sedentary population materialize. It also explores how this transition coincides with parental tensions surrounding the 'early onset adulthood' of Gypsy and Traveller children who are regarded within their families and communities as being adults from an early age. Within this context, the article examines some of the very fluid adaptations being made by families to changing economic and social circumstances and also the roles adopted by members of the education 'community', in particular Traveller Education Services, in their relationships with Gypsy and Traveller families.

J	Cammarota, J				Cammarota, Julio			The praxis of ethnic studies: transforming second sight into critical consciousness	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						ethnic studies; praxis; critical consciousness; Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR); Social Justice Education Project (SJEP)	PEDAGOGY; RACE	This article focuses on a youth participatory action research (YPAR) program called the Social Justice Education Project (SJEP) that fostered young people of color's critical consciousness. Their critical consciousness emerged through praxis (reflection/action) while focusing on preserving ethnic studies in Tucson, Arizona. Because the SJEP home was in ethnic studies, the youth also struggled to keep their program alive. The Arizona Department of Education claimed the program bred radicals' who wanted to overthrow the government and therefore lobbied the state legislature to ban K-12 ethnic studies in public schools. In January 2012, the ban went into effect, shutting down ethnic studies classes as well as the SJEP. Young people's qualitative research on their struggle led to action to save the education that gave them hope for a more equitable and just world. The article addresses the praxis of YPAR, which sparks a thought process leading to the drive to take action. Observing and documenting educational injustices inspire the need to seek radical change of Self and schools. Through the reflection and action facilitated by YPAR, young people of color construct a message about the importance of ethnic studies for individual as well as social transformation.

J	Brown, KD				Brown, Keffrelyn D.			Trouble on my mind: toward a framework of humanizing critical sociocultural knowledge for teaching and teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						sociocultural knowledge; teacher education; teaching; African American; Black students; Sylvia Wynter	PEDAGOGY; VISION; RACISM	Drawing from the work of philosophers Sylvia Wynter and Ian Hacking, in this conceptual article I argue why a humanizing critical approach to sociocultural knowledge is needed for teacher education, particularly in preparing teachers to work effectively with black students. In light of enduring concerns in teacher education with improving the educational experiences of black students a student population that is routinely discussed in extant education literature, policy and popular discourses as in trouble, troubling, or troubled and the failure of teacher education programs to successfully meet this goal, I consider how regardless of their intent, these discourses exist within and help to reinscribe an already limiting notion of human constituted by historically contingent, Western epistemic notions of humanity. Highlighting both the shortcomings and possibilities that tackling dominant sociocultural knowledge might have on teacher candidates and teachers I conclude by offering a vision for how teacher education might more effectively engage in transforming such knowledge towards improving the education of black students in the US.

J	Coloma, RS				Coloma, Roland Sintos			Border crossing subjectivities and research: through the prism of feminists of color	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						feminists of color; insider/outsider; Philippines; subjectivity; transnational research		Drawing on my research experiences as a Filipino American historian, this article explores what Michel Foucault calls 'subjectification', the dialectial process of self-making and being-made, within the context of ethnic identities and transnational projects. Engaging the work of feminists of color in particular, it outlines three types of subject formations - compartmental, intersectional and constitutive - that foreground the tensions between how I identified myself and how others perceived me. It also explores the dilemma of belonging as an insider/outsider researcher in communities that one affiliates with as well as my emerging recognition of homelessness as a liminal and productive space for self-construction. Ultimately it links and gives voice to three issues that are often treated separately: first, the ways in which subjectivities are shaped by self and others; second, the ways in which race and ethnicity are linked to other axes of difference; and, third, the analytical and methodological insights of undertaking research in communities that one calls home.				colomars@muohio.edu						Alexander M.

J	Henry, A				Henry, Annette			'We especially welcome applications from members of visible minority groups': reflections on race, gender and life at three universities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race and gender; higher education; women in leadership; authoethnography; critical race studies; black feminism	FACULTY; PROGRAM; WHITE; BLACK	This autoethnographic account documents and analyses university life as a racialised woman who has worked in both Canadian and American universities. The theoretical framework draws from critical perspectives on race, black feminisms and narrative and autoethnographic research methodologies. The study involves a range of data sources that provide sociohistorical and sociopolitical contexts in which to ground the Personal: academic writings on race and gender, university reports, email correspondence, relevant newsmedia artifacts, as well as personal written accounts, conversations with colleagues and life experiences. This article critiques the pervasive institutional practices of white and male privilege and gendered racism. It offers some suggestions to reshape disciplinary knowledge, curricula and the workplace for black and marginalised women faculty. It is hoped that the results and conclusions contribute to our understandings of life as it is lived in the margins of race and gender, and in this way, contribute to understanding black women's experiences in North American universities.

Data is drawn from focus groups conducted with the youth participants and founder of Umoja Network for Young Men (UMOJA), an all-male, school-based mentoring program for over-aged and under-credited (OA/UC) high school students. The authors draw on theories of culturally relevant pedagogy, care, and critical pedagogy to present the findings and propose a form of culturally relevant care (CRC) that entails warm demanding and building mutual trust. This study highlights the humanizing experiences of the Black and Latino male transfer students and their mentor. This focus on the experiences of young Black and Latino male participants seeks to shift the discourse from one focused on deficits to one that recognizes their agency and capacities for social and academic success.

J	Castro-Salazar, R; Bagley, C				Castro-Salazar, Ricardo; Bagley, Carl			'Ni de aqui ni from there'. Navigating between contexts: counter-narratives of undocumented Mexican students in the United States	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						undocumented Mexican students; critical race theory; counter-stories; racism	RACE; ACHIEVEMENT; ADOLESCENTS; LANGUAGE; COLLEGE	Research has documented the ways in which students of Mexican origin are not succeeding academically in the same proportion as the rest of the US population. This process of educational failure occurs in the context of overt and more subtle forms of racism experienced throughout their schooling and everyday lives. Undocumented Mexican students face even harsher educational challenges as they experience life in a post-September 11th environment of heightened xenophobic US nativism. The purpose of this three-year study was to acknowledge the counter-stories and learn from the counter-life-histories of undocumented college graduates of Mexican origin as they navigate across and between historical, socioeconomic, political and cultural boundaries, barriers and contexts. The research is grounded in the experiences, voices and perspectives of six individuals who graduated from a community college in Arizona. The study utilizes critical race theory (CRT) as an interpretive approach to both situate and challenge ahistorical, decontextualized, and one-dimensional explanations of Mexican-American underachievement and adopts a life history methodology to engage comprehensively with the perceptions of the interviewees.

Participants at the PWI described feeling excluded, voicing concerns about institutional struggles with creating an inclusive campus climate; whereas, participants at the HBCU perceived STEM disciplines to be diverse and viewed their programs and the institution as supportive of their needs.

J	Hamzeh, M				Hamzeh, Manal			Deveiling body stories: Muslim girls negotiate visual, spatial, and ethical hijabs	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Muslim girls; veil; hijab; body; gender; discourse; agency; insider and in-betweener methodology; positionalities	EDUCATION; IDENTITY; PEDAGOGY	This article describes a collaborative research project that took place in two south-western US border towns and sought to understand how four muslim girls (age 14-17) expressed and negotiated their bodily learning experiences. Drawing on both the work of arab-muslim critical feminist Fatima Mernissi who utilized classical Islamic tools of research and my positionalities as arabyyah-muslimah, I used insider's methods to discuss how three hijabs (veils) - the visual, spatial, and ethical - acted as a central genderizing discourse that challenged the girls' learning opportunities. This article shows how the girls' parents enforced these three hijabs; how the girls questioned and deveiled the hijabs in their dress, mobility in public places, and physical behavior around boys. This inquiry is a call for critical feminist researchers and educators to recognize how these three hijabs form a key genderizing discourse in the lives of muslim girls. It also presents the importance of: (1) working with muslim girls as agents in their own lives; (2) critical engagement with difference between researchers/educators and muslim communities; and (3) practicing a critically reflexive pedagogy of deveiling.

J	Coles, JA; Powell, T				Coles, Justin A.; Powell, Tunette			A BlackCrit analysis on black urban youth and suspension disproportionality as anti-black symbolic violence	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						BlackCrit; school suspensions; antiblackness; critical race theory; critical literacy; black youth	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; SCHOOL DISCIPLINE; EDUCATION POLICY; WHITENESS; POLITICS	Through an analysis of Black urban high school youth's critical engagements with literacy, the authors examine school suspensions-particularly disproportionality-as anti-Black symbolic violence. By historically mapping the terrain of discipline, from chattel slavery to The New Jim Crow, the article unearths the connection between racial disproportionality in school discipline and the micro-level context of systemic societal Black exclusion. Gathered from a 3-week summer writing course, the data highlights how Black youth conceptualize suspensions and disproportionality as structurally anti-Black by design. Guided by the triangulation of CRT, BlackCrit, and theories of critical literacy, the data provides an anti-Black specific analysis of school suspensions centered in the voices and lived truths of Black youth. The article concludes by prompting educators to (1) confront antiblackness within disciplinary practices (and schooling at-large) and (2) wrestle with the necessity for school suspensions given the history of being meted out in racially inequitable ways.

J	Johnson, L; Bryan, N				Johnson, Lamar; Bryan, Nathaniel			Using our voices, losing our bodies: Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and the spirit murders of Black male professors in the academy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Race; critical race theory; Black males; teacher education; racial violence	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES; THEORY PERSPECTIVE; EDUCATION; RACISM	The recent deaths of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and other Black males have generated new civil rights urgencies in Black communities and spirited academic discourses in higher education regarding the educational and social plight of Black males in America. Connecting the deaths of Black males to our lived experiences in the academy, we use a text messaging performative writing style to demonstrate how Black males are not only gunned down in the streets of America by police but also are metaphorically gunned down in the academy. That is to say, white colleagues and students attempt to use what we call the bullet of rejection, the bullet of silencing, and the bullet of disrespect to destroy us and our academic agenda. We conclude with a call to action for teacher education programs as a way to deepen their understanding of the racialized experiences of Black males in the academy and Black males in America.

J	Darmody, M; Byrne, D; McGinnity, F				Darmody, Merike; Byrne, Delma; McGinnity, Frances			Cumulative disadvantage? Educational careers of migrant students in Irish secondary schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						educational careers; disadvantage; migrant students; Ireland	MULTICULTURALISM	Recent rapid immigration of a diverse group of migrant children into an almost exclusively White Irish school population makes Ireland an interesting case study for migrant education. This article explores key points in the careers of migrant secondary school students in Ireland from an equality perspective. The article draws on data gathered as a part of a large-scale study specifically designed to investigate provision for migrant children in Irish schools. The results of the study show that migrant students in Ireland face a number of educational barriers in terms of access to schools, placement in classes, year groups and types of secondary school programme. This disadvantage is likely to impact on their future life-chances in terms of progress to further education and their place in the labour market, as well as their general social positioning in the Irish society.

J	Lynn, M; Jennings, ME; Hughes, S				Lynn, Marvin; Jennings, Michael E.; Hughes, Sherick			Critical race pedagogy 2.0: lessons from Derrick Bell	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race pedagogy; critical pedagogy; critical race theory; race	TEACHERS; POWER	In this article, we attempt to honor the rich legacy of Derrick Bell by detailing how exploring his specific contributions to critical race theory (CRT) provided lessons for developing and refining critical race pedagogy (CRP). We examine Bell's racial realism thesis in connection with his pedagogical work. In doing so, we find that he was as committed to developing a community-based' law classroom as he was to articulating a strong critique of the law (Radice 1991). As part of his teaching philosophy, Bell wrote extensively about the value and importance of a student-centered humanist pedagogy (Bell 1980, 1982, 1997; Bell and Edmonds 1993; Delgado and Stefancic 2005). We draw parallels between Bell's humanist student-centered pedagogy and the tenets of CRP as a way to expand the accessibility of this framework. Finally, as the ultimate homage to the work of Derrick Bell, we end with a futuristic mini-chronicle that takes place in a school district boardroom. The chronicle features a fictitious character who happens to be a distant relative of Bell's. As we will discuss, we believe that the use of chronicles and storytelling hold the possibility for helping us to name extant challenges and illuminate further possibilities of CRP as a tool for battling globalized oppression at the intersection of race, class, gender and sexuality in education.

J	Rolon-Dow, R				Rolon-Dow, Rosalie			Race(ing) stories: digital storytelling as a tool for critical race scholarship	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; digital storytelling; social identities; high school youth; race talk	EDUCATION	This article investigates the use of digital storytelling as a medium for exploring the significance of race in the educational experiences of youth. A critical race theory (CRT) framework is utilized because CRT places race at the center of social analysis and values the everyday experiences of people of color. The author focuses on two US high school students who created digital stories and shows how the students grappled with the ways race shaped identities and institutional structures in their educational contexts. The author also highlights the ways in which the students represented themselves through stories that countered normalized discourses about race. The author concludes that the digital storytelling medium, combined with a CRT framework, can be a valuable tool for initiating conversations about the raced experiences of youth and can provide valuable knowledge for those working towards greater racial justice within educational contexts.

J	Zembylas, M				Zembylas, Michalinos			Racialization/ethnicization of school emotional spaces: the politics of resentment	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						resentment; racialization; ethnicization; emotions; elementary schools; Cyprus	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EDUCATION; CLIMATE; CYPRUS	The present article explores how emotional spaces are racialized and ethnicized in a multicultural elementary school in Cyprus through the majoritized group's feelings of resentment. The data for this article are drawn from a two-month ethnographic study at this school in which the students enrolled come from the two historically conflicting groups on the island, that is, Greek Cypriots (the majoritized group) and Turkish-speaking students (the minoritized group). In light of the political problem in Cyprus and the ongoing conflict between these groups, the study investigates the emotions that Greek-Cypriot students and teachers express about Turkish-speaking children and the material implications of school policies and teachers' practices on minoritized children's lives. The study shows the ways in which the racialization/ethnicization of school emotional spaces contributes to the constitution of an affective economy of resentment towards Turkish-speaking students and discusses how the emotional culture of resentment feeds school discourses, policies, and practices.

J	Bryan, A				Bryan, Audrey			The intersectionality of nationalism and multiculturalism in the Irish curriculum: teaching against racism?	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						intercultural education; national identity; curriculum; racism; educational policy; symbolic violence		This research explores the interrelationship between the production of national identity and multiculturalism in Irish schools and society. Working from the perspective that ideas about 'race' and nation are inextricably linked, I examine how contemporary nationalistic identity projects and processes map onto the current policy drive towards multicultural (or intercultural) education in Ireland. Informed by the intellectual oeuvre of Pierre Bourdieu, my analysis investigates state-level discourses as they are articulated in recent anti-racist policy documents and in the national curriculum, and how these broader discourses are interpreted at the local school level. Combining discourse analytic, observational and in-depth interviewing techniques, I examine how state and school-based intercultural policies and practices construct difference along racial-ethnic and national lines, and consider the implications of these policies and practices for sustaining and contesting racism. The purpose of the research is to promote a deeper understanding of the ways in which racial inequality is reproduced through policies and practices which are purported to have egalitarian and anti-racist aims.

J	Bryan, N				Bryan, Nathaniel			Shaking thebad boys: troubling the criminalization of black boys' childhood play, hegemonic white masculinity and femininity, and theschool playground-to-prison pipeline	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black boys; black masculinity; childhood play; early childhood education; race and racism; white girls; white hegemonic masculinity and femininity	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; SCHOOL; TEACHERS; DISCIPLINE	Few studies have sought to understand the childhood play experiences of Black boys in early childhood education (ECE), and a majority of those that investigate them often socially construct Black boys' play as criminal, dangerous, and monstrous. Considering the dangers of hegemonic masculinity and femininity or the racial and gendered power and privilege White boys and girls bring to societal spaces including playgrounds, little is known about how such power influences the experiences of Black boys who play with them. In this conceptual paper, I draw on critical race theory (CRT) to trouble the criminalization of Black boys' childhood play and hegemonic White masculinity and femininity, which can prove violent and dehumanizing to Black boys. As such, I suggest that similar to the school-to-prison pipeline (STPP), Black boys may become victims of what I call theschool playground-to-prison pipeline (SPTPP)as a consequence of White children's accusations, fears, misperceptions, and misreadings of Black boys' play. Recommendations are provided for teacher and ECE to better support Black boys and the cross-cultural play interactions between them and White children.

J	Ohito, EO				Ohito, Esther O.			Thinking through the flesh: a critical autoethnography of racial body politics in urban teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Race; urban teacher education; whiteness; autoethnography; affect; assemblage; embodiment	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; PREPARING TEACHERS; WHITENESS; SCHOOLS	Although the ubiquitous nature of whiteness has been scrutinized in research on teacher preparation in the United States, scholarship on how this concept impinges upon the field's overall culture, as well as on pedagogy, is scarce. Thus, I perform a critical autoethnographic study on the relationships among whiteness, pedagogy, and urban teacher education. The inquiry threads Critical Race Theory and feminist theorizing on (Black) bodies, affects, and assemblages, and extends from extant literature illustrating that the dichotomous thinking characteristic of whiteness undergirds the disembodied approaches to teaching and learning prevalent in teacher education programs. This, I discover, leaves one White pre-service teacher ill-equipped to discern and disrupt the materialization of whiteness in an (inter)corporeal encounter with a Black youth in an urban classroom. Additionally, a pedagogy of disembodiment hinders this pre-service teacher from developing robust understandings of how latent within his lived-in, socio-historically situated White body is the potent potential to exacerbate the psychic pain that racism inflicts upon the racially othered children and youth who navigate urban classrooms under the scorching glare of whiteness. These findings underpin my call for urban teacher educators to embrace a pedagogy of embodiment in order to build pre-service teachers' capacities to teach racially marginalized children and youth in ways that broaden the boundaries of the human beyond the scope of whiteness.

J	Forrest, J; Lean, G; Dunn, K				Forrest, James; Lean, Garth; Dunn, Kevin			Challenging racism through schools: teacher attitudes to cultural diversity and multicultural education in Sydney, Australia	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher attitudes; cultural diversity; anti-racism; public schools; Australia; Sydney; multicultural education	CONSTRUCTING RACISM; REPORTED RACISM; CHILDHOOD; HEALTH; ADOLESCENCE; PREJUDICE; KNOWLEDGE; WHITENESS; RESPECT; CONTEXT	How school teachers act to challenge racism in schools is a vital concern in an immigrant society like Australia. A 10% response from a self-administered online survey of government (public) primary and secondary school teachers across Sydney, Australia's largest EthniCity, examines attitudes of classroom teachers towards cultural diversity, goals of multicultural education, and strategies to implement anti-racist strategies. Principal components analysis (PCA) of attitudes tease out the varied influence of opinion on multicultural education, diversity, and anti-racism. Classroom teachers are overwhelmingly supportive of cultural diversity, multicultural education and strategies to combat racism and discrimination, and these views hardly vary across the different geographic zones of the city, unlike attitudes within the general community. However, teacher knowledge about the implementation of multicultural policy does vary, and is positively associated with the extent of population diversity and socio-economic status (SES) of the communities surrounding the schools.

J	Santoro, N				Santoro, Ninetta			The drive to diversify the teaching profession: narrow assumptions, hidden complexities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						indigenous teachers; qualitative research; diversification of the teaching profession; ethnic minority teachers	STUDENT-TEACHERS; RACE; EXPERIENCES; DIFFERENCE; EDUCATION	In response to increasing cultural diversity within student populations in Australia as well as Britain, Europe and North America, there have been ongoing calls to diversify the teaching profession. Such a strategy is based on assumptions that teachers who are of ethnic and racial minority are well placed to act as role models for minority students, will understand students' cultural practices and beliefs and how they shape them as learners, and will contribute diverse cultural perspectives to school curricula. In this article I draw on data from two separate studies that investigated the experiences of culturally diverse teachers working in Australian schools. I illustrate how the participants are constructed, first and foremost, as ethnic and racialised teacher subjects, a positioning that shapes the nature of their work and professional identities. I suggest that the work of racially and ethnically diverse teachers and the construction of their professional selves are underpinned by naive assumptions about them as a homogenous group, as educators who can address the education needs of all culturally diverse students and as cultural experts who can incorporate diverse cultural perspectives into school curricula. In light of these findings I critique the assumptions about culturally diverse teachers that underpin arguments to diversify the profession. I also make visible some of the tensions and complexities that shape their work in schools.

J	Baldridge, BJ; Hill, ML; Davis, JE				Baldridge, Bianca J.; Hill, Marc Lamont; Davis, James Earl			New possibilities: (re)engaging Black male youth within community-based educational spaces	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black male youth; community based educational spaces; race; gender	ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; MALE-STUDENTS; SCHOOL; RACE; PROGRAM	Despite the assertion that due to an Obama presidency America has become a post-racial society, Black males still face a unique social crisis. In this article, we hold that both race and gender continue to work in tandem to produce a certain set of social outcomes for young Black men in America despite this assertion. The educational, economic, and social mobility of young Black men is often limited due to structural constraints that are exacerbated by the intersectional dynamism of race, gender, and social class. As young Black men continue to experience social hardships, they are being pushed further and further away from traditional school contexts. Drawing from qualitative interviews with 24 young Black male participants from EmpowerYouth, a national community-based organization, this study highlights the importance of alternative sites of education and youth development for Black male youth. Findings from this study indicate that flexibility, applied educational and work experience, and positive healthy adult-youth relationships provided by EmpowerYouth, granted solace for young Black males who traversed through difficult circumstances within traditional school contexts. Our findings speak to the need to create new and relevant educational models that address the unique and complex circumstances of young Black men in America. Ultimately, as young Black males are often considered to be social burdens, this study shows how successful community-based programs like EmpowerYouth reframe young Black males as a valued segment of society that deserve support, care, and educational sites that are able to respond to their distinct academic and social needs.

J	Sleeter, CE				Sleeter, Christine E.			Becoming white: reinterpreting a family story by putting race back into the picture	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; whiteness studies; family history	TEACHERS; IDENTITY	Many teacher educators attempt to prompt teacher candidates, who are usually majority white, to examine themselves as culturally and historically located beings in order to prepare for multicultural and anti-racist teaching. But with white teacher candidates in colonialist societies, this work is difficult. Family history stories that white teacher candidates tell tend to disassociate individuals from the context of race and class relations in which they lived. Using insights from Critical Race Theory, critical whiteness studies, and post-positivist realist identity theory, I probe below the surface of a 'heroic individual' story I grew up hearing about one of my immigrant great-great-grandmothers. This paper reports detailed historical research that situates her life in a social and cultural context, thereby making racism visible. Using a research methodology I am calling 'critical family history,' I uncover the story's silences related to her claiming of a white identity in the context of racism and competition for economic resources. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for how teacher educators work with family history and racism in order to move from uncovering how racism was constructed and how it works, to how white people today might act differently.

J	Francis, B; Archer, L; Mau, A				Francis, Becky; Archer, Louise; Mau, Ada			Parents' and teachers' constructions of the purposes of Chinese complementary schooling: 'culture', identity and power	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						British Chinese; identities; ethnicity; culture; complementary schooling	PEDAGOGY; POLITICS	User perceptions and experiences of complementary education are neglected in the research literature, yet they are important in providing understanding concerning complementary schools and their impact on educational and social identities. This paper explores the constructions of parents of pupils attending these schools, and of teachers at these schools, regarding the purposes and benefits of Chinese complementary schools. Data is drawn from an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)-funded study of six Chinese schools in England, including interviews with 24 parents and 21 teachers. Findings demonstrate that in contrast to complementary school pupils, Chinese adult participants see a diverse range of purposes of these schools besides perpetuating heritage language. Many of these purposes related to 'identity' and 'culture', were often produced in reified terms. In interrogating these themes we focus particularly on the productions of 'culture' generated and the implication of both Chinese and Western bodies in these constructions in relations of power.

J	Knaus, CB				Knaus, Christopher B.			Shut up and listen: applied critical race theory in the classroom	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Critical Race Studies in Education Conference	2008	Chicago, IL			Critical Race Theory; racism in education; student voice; urban education; multicultural education		This paper demonstrates that applying critical race theory to the classroom dramatically shifts the nature and scope of schooling for students of color in urban schools. In focusing on students, applied critical race theory centers the development of voice and expression, and de-centers the high-stakes pressures that limit student engagement. This overview of a writing class at a continuation high school clarifies the importance of student voice, but also of knowing how to engage in dialogue with students about the social context they navigate daily. Understanding how to foster critical voice in students provides educators the tools to create engaging classrooms, and acknowledges the intense emotional experiences that students bring (from home contexts) to the classroom. Without such acknowledgement at the core of schooling, educators are likely to reinforce the very stereotypes that lead students to reject what they often see as demeaning education. The article demonstrates instructional techniques that encourage student voice as a foundation for academic excellence, and argues that applying critical race theory ultimately requires re-visioning the entire US educational system.

J	Buenavista, TL				Buenavista, Tracy Lachica			Model (undocumented) minorities and "illegal" immigrants: centering Asian Americans and US carcerality in undocumented student discourse	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Undocumented student; immigration; Asian American; critical race theory; carcerality; model minority	CRITICAL RACE; EDUCATION; CONSCIOUSNESS; SUCCESS	As the numbers of immigrant apprehensions, detentions, and deportations increase, and in context of anti-immigrant sentiment, education scholars must better contend with the way that carcerality affects undocumented student experiences. Carcerality refers to social and political systems that formally and informally promote discipline, punishment, and incarceration. Guided by Critical Race Theory, I examine interview data from 15 undocumented Asian Americans to show that the portrayal of undocumented student exceptionalism that typically characterizes the discourse on their experiences obscures the centrality of carcerality in shaping how young people with undocumented status navigate their lives. The narratives of undocumented Asian Americans represent a shift in undocumented discourse as these students de-emphasized their academic mobility, demonstrated a hyper-awareness of punitive immigration policies, and were traumatized by and practiced nondisclosure in response to deportation threats. However, while these students developed resistance strategies that they believed would both physically and psychologically protect their presence in the US, some reinforced white supremacist perceptions of the illegality of other undocumented immigrants. Undocumented Asian American experiences illuminate the nuanced relationship between the criminalization of undocumented immigrants, race, and education, and how a legacy of carcerality is vital to deciphering the contemporary educational experiences of undocumented students in the US.

J	Leonardo, Z; Manning, L				Leonardo, Zeus; Manning, Logan			White historical activity theory: toward a critical understanding of white zones of proximal development	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Whiteness; Vygotsky; education	RACE	Best known for arguing that individual development is part of social and historical development Vygotsky's entry into education may be captured by his concept of the zone of proximal development' (ZPD). ZPD has not yet been synthesized with a critical study of whiteness. When ZPD is used to explain racial disparities in the service of inclusion, it is usually connected with the lives of people of color. This leaves out a critical understanding of racially dominant experiences, or whiteness. This article argues that a progressive union between Vygotsky and the field of race studies generally, Whiteness Studies specifically, benefits educators insofar as the concept of ZPD is applied to the particular ideological development of white identity. Likewise, Whiteness Studies gains an explanatory framework to account for the cognitive development of the dominant racial group, in short, a learning theory of whiteness. A Whiteness Studies intervention within Vygotskian theory pushes the limits of developmental theory when it analyzes the contours of a white ZPD. When racialized to consider whiteness, certain terms and concepts, such as Vygotsky's genotypic and phenotypic analyses, take on a different significance, even different meanings. As a racially sensitive framework, particularly within a US-based understanding, Vygotskian theory is limited without critical attention to the development of white identity and whiteness as an ideology. By focusing on this nexus, Vygotskian theory fulfills part of its historical mission as a concrete study of cultural relations.

Assistant professors of color confront the inequitable terrain of academia: a community cultural wealth perspective	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Faculty of color (FOC); community cultural wealth (CCW); assistant professors	ASIAN WOMEN FACULTY; RACE; PERCEPTIONS; EDUCATION; AFRICAN; TENURE	This qualitative study adopted Yosso's community cultural wealth (CCW) framework to examine how 16 assistant professors of color (APOC) drew upon various forms of capital (navigational, aspirational, social, resistant, linguistic, familial) to deal with racism and marginalization in academia. Findings revealed how APOC: dealt with students' stereotypes of them, maintained their authentic selves to make academia more accessible and relevant, persevered with integrity despite hostility or marginalization, self-advocated for quality mentorship, and engaged in strategic service while avoiding cultural taxation and tokenism. Findings highlighted the positive cultural assets APOC enact within the academy while reiterating the need to address racist and marginalizing policies and practices in higher education. Variations in experiences based on gender and international status that can be explored further in future research also emerged. Working at a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) also did not eliminate or lessen racist or marginalizing experiences for participants.

Whitened rainbows: how white college students protect whiteness through diversity discourses	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; white students; diversity; critical multiculturalism; higher education	FRIENDSHIP GROUPS; HIGHER-EDUCATION; CONSEQUENCES; PRIVILEGE; RACISM	This qualitative study investigates white students' attitudes toward campus diversity at a large, multiracial public university. Drawing upon focus group data gathered from a larger campus climate study, we identified four themes: participants voiced that: (1) racial diversity fosters campus tolerance; (2) diversity fragments into de facto racial segregation; (3) institutional support of diversity undermines and excludes whites; and (4) the university should avoid acknowledging white identity. Employing critical multiculturalism as a theoretical lens, we argue that these discourses maintain white dominance within a framework that promotes inclusion. These findings suggest that without more direct institutional guidance, white students will protect white supremacy even as they celebrate diversity in multiracial spaces.

J	Hollinsworth, D				Hollinsworth, David			Unsettling Australian settler supremacy: combating resistance in university Aboriginal studies	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Aboriginal studies; student resistance; denial; white privilege; white supremacy; critical pedagogy	INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS; RACISM; RACE; ATTITUDES; DISCOURSES; EDUCATION; IDENTITY; HEALTH; CONSTRUCTION; NATIONALISM	Higher education courses designed to equip students to work effectively with Indigenous peoples by teaching about racism and inequality often encounter resistance to these concepts. In particular, students argue that individual and structural racisms, and their own white privilege, are not their fault'. This article examines different forms of student resistance expressed within a number of Aboriginal Studies courses taught in a regional Australian university. This article reflects on data collected from various research initiatives with students, and personal teaching experiences over decades, and argues that although the notion of white supremacy can explicitly identify white privilege it also actively promotes even greater student resistance to learning. As such, this article argues for a consistent sequence of anti-racism approaches and suggests a number of key pedagogical strategies for anti-racism education.

J	Chu, YT				Chu, Yiting			The power of knowledge: a critical analysis of the depiction of ethnic minorities in China's elementary textbooks	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						textbooks analysis; ethnic minorities; knowledge construction; critical discourse analysis (CDA)	SCHOOL; UNITY	This study critically analyzes knowledge about: (1) ethnic minority groups; (2) the dominant Han group; and (3) the interaction between ethnic minorities and Han presented in three types of elementary textbooks used in China. The analysis reveals that the knowledge about and the values and beliefs of the Han people are overwhelmingly dominant in all reviewed textbooks. At the same time, ethnic minority groups are marginalized and the knowledge about them is incomplete and stereotypical. In addition, most of the knowledge about ethnic minorities are constructed and presented from the perspective of the Han people. The results indicate that the dominant ideology and unequal power relations are reflected and reinforced through the strategic construction, selection, and presentation of knowledge in textbooks. It also calls for a need to incorporate more accurate and complete knowledge in textbooks for students to develop a critical understanding of the society.

J	Stoll, LC				Stoll, Laurie Cooper			Constructing the color-blind classroom: teachers' perspectives on race and schooling	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						color-blind racism; teacher bias; anti-racism	GENDER; EDUCATION; WHITENESS; BELIEFS; GIRLS; URBAN	The purpose of this study is to explore teachers' attitudes towards race and schooling, and the ways in which they 'do' race in contemporary 'color-blind' learning environments where social location is not believed to exert any meaningful influence on students' potential for success. Data for this study were gathered through observations and in-depth interviews of teachers in a primarily white elementary school, a primarily Hispanic elementary school, and a primarily African American elementary school, all within the same school district north of Chicago. This research finds that in an era of post-racial politics, teachers regularly make use of color-blind ideologies in order to support their understandings of race and schooling. Further, these ideologies underlie the widespread adoption of the social equality maxim, and reflect and sustain the creation of color-blind classrooms.

J	De Lissovoy, N				De Lissovoy, Noah			Education and violation: conceptualizing power, domination, and agency in the hidden curriculum	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						violation; hidden curriculum; agency	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; PERFORMANCE; THREAT; POLICY; SOUTH	This article offers a theory of a process of violation that connects macropolitical effects to the intimate terrain of subject production. I describe power, as violation, in terms of a simultaneous process of construction and destruction, which seeks its satisfaction in an injury to the very identities it is complicit in producing. Starting from analyses of power and racism in the historical Black radical tradition, and in particular the work of W.E.B. Du Bois and Frantz Fanon, and in contrast to prevailing conceptualizations in critical and poststructuralist theory, I describe violation as active and motivated rather than the mere by-product of a more fundamental imperative of reproduction or normalization. This analysis fore-grounds the continuous process of assault that characterizes the hidden curriculum of schooling for students of color and other marginalized students, particularly with regard to the contemporary clinical and academic discourses that work to name, know, and organize identities. I argue that the pathologization of student selves by these discourses is a more complex process than the simple circulation of norms, and that this process is always characterized by a simultaneous struggle for resistance and survival. The article describes the ways in which critical theory in education will need to become more sensitive not only to the logic of violation and to the modes of domination that it sets in motion, but also to the persistent integrity and agency of those whom it seeks to subjugate.

Critical race quantitative intersections: a testimonio analysis	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Chicana(o); Latina(o); educational pipeline; testimonio		The educational pipeline has become a commonly referenced depiction of educational outcomes for racialized groups across the country. While visually impactful, an overreliance on decontextualized quantitative data often leads to majoritarian interpretations. Without sociohistorical contexts, these interpretations run the risk of perpetuating culturally deficit ideologies about the causes that produce and reproduce these outcomes. In using an analysis grounded in Critical Race Quantitative Intersectionality (CRQI), this article contextualizes the educational pipeline from preschool to the professoriate through a mixed methods approach that fuses quantitative data with testimonio, a qualitative bridge to center knowledge and agency - as individuals and as a collective - in the quest for social change.

Despite a range of explicit and implicit approaches that fostered different levels of critique among students, teachers often communicated Australian national identity as commensurate to white racial and Anglo-Australian cultural identity. We identified three main approaches teachers used to talk about national identity and cultural diversity: cultural essentialism, race elision and a quasi-critical approach. We conclude that the wider education system needs to develop a more formal curriculum structure that guides teachers in developing a better awareness of the power of white normativity, and to critically and explicitly counter discourse and practice that centres whiteness as foundational to dominant conceptualisations of national identity.

All participants were White teacher education students from the United States earning their English as a Second Language (ESL) teaching endorsement and hoped to teach English language learners (ELLs). During the three week program, students took ESL Methods and Spanish for Teachers classes, and lived with host families in Cuernavaca. In addition to academic goals, the study abroad program was designed to help students develop empathy for the challenges faced by ELLs in the US through immersion in Mexico. Given that most teachers in the US are monolingual, native English speaking Whites and the majority of ELLs are native Spanish speakers, this study abroad experience provided many opportunities to develop empathy for ELL schoolchildren that the students' usual milieu in the US did not. Daily journal entries, instructors' observations, and pre- and post-experience questionnaires were examined. Through our analysis, we found that students struggled with the cultural, linguistic, and racial dimensions of their short-term study abroad experience and that most channeled these frustrations into some measure of empathetic understanding for the challenges facing ELLs in the US.

J	Maylor, U				Maylor, Uvanney			Notions of diversity, British identities and citizenship belonging	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						'Britishness'; diversity; citizenship belonging; 'race'; ethnicity; culture	CULTURE	This article reports on a small-scale research study commissioned by the then Department for Education and Skills ([DfES] now the Department for Children, Schools and Families [DCSF]) in June 2006 to aid the work of the Diversity and Citizenship Curriculum Review Group, headed by Sir Keith Ajegbo. The findings concentrate on how 'diversity' is viewed by schools and the implications of this for developing pupil understanding of British diversity, British identities and citizenship belonging. The article highlights student perceptions and experience of a diverse curriculum together with their perceptions of 'Britishness' and citizenship belonging. In examining school and student understanding of diversity, this article explores two discrete aspects: 'diversity' education and education about 'Britishness'. While supporting the need to value British diversity, the article nevertheless challenges the assumption that ethnic or cultural 'heritage' is always positive and/or learning about it positive.

J	Dickar, M				Dickar, Maryann			Hearing the silenced dialogue: an examination of the impact of teacher race on their experiences	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; teachers; urban schooling; school climate		Drawing on interviews with 17 educators, 9 Black, and 8 White, as well as observations of classes and staff meetings at a segregated urban high school, this essay examines the ways teacher race impacts their professional work and suggests that racial experiences are far more complex than has been recognized in the literature on race and teaching. In this sample, Black educators described a strong sense of racial solidarity with their students, a theme frequently raised in studies of Black teachers. However, these educators also noted that racial solidarity was an expectation Black students held of them. Such expectations placed Black educators in the 'crossfire' between student demands of solidarity and the demands of their professional roles. White teachers expressed conflicted perspectives around race. They were at once race evasive and race cognizant while also wary that White teachers were victims of race talk and racial policy. White teachers are often depicted as embracing 'color blind' racial ideologies, but, in fact, these may be defensive postures masking much more complex understandings of race. The great divergence between the racial experiences of teachers at the same school offers greater insight into the lack of dialogue across the color line that Delpit (1995) noted over a decade ago.

J	Housee, S				Housee, Shirin			Should ethnicity matter when teaching about 'race' and racism in the classroom?	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; student centred learning; black experience; racialised identities; counter-narrative		Teaching about 'race' and racism to a diverse student group can lead to some very interesting exchanges. Some of these moments are much to do with the subject content. Learning about racism often pulls on our emotional strings: black students sometimes express their hurt and anger, while white students sometimes remain silent or express their hurt, shame and discomfort. The lecturer's racialised identity is an important factor in these emotional exchanges. Black lecturers are sometimes judged for their 'loyalties and sensibilities' with the black community, while white lecturers are questioned for their understanding and sympathies with 'race'/racism issues. This paper considers how social identities and physical appearances impact on the teaching and learning process and issues of student and lecturer positionalities and identities in the Higher Education context. In particular, it examines how much being white or black can matter in teaching and learning about race and racism, and the importance of critical pedagogy. Theoretical reflections on identity construction and management are themed through these discussions. The conclusion argues that the teaching of 'race' and racism is not only about identity or ethnicity, but the development of teaching strategies that are inclusive of black experiences; and questions power structures and relations found in whitearchy and patriarchy.

Policy making has been introduced to specifically address such inequalities. This article draws on critical policy analysis and 45 interviews to explore the impact of the recently introduced Race Equality Charter (REC) as a measure to address such inequalities. By using principles of Critical Race Theory (CRT), we argue that racism continues to play a key role in the experiences of BME groups in HEIs and policy making. Consequently, the enactment of policy making on race through the REC works to benefit HEIs by adhering to White normative practices and behaviours which contribute to a system which reinforces and perpetuates White privilege.

J	Urrieta, L; Villenas, SA				Urrieta, Luis, Jr.; Villenas, Sofia A.			The legacy of Derrick Bell and Latino/a education: a critical race testimonio	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						testimonio; Critical Race Theory; Latina; o Critical Theory	CAMPUS RACIAL CLIMATE; CHICANA; MICROAGGRESSIONS; IDENTITY; BOARD	In this article, we trace Bell's influence in our lives from graduate students to teacher educators and engaged scholars, and note how we have always read Bell alongside and inseparable from Latino/a Studies and Latina/Chicana feminist thought. We highlight the powerful and fruitful tensions of these interconnections in addressing our curricular struggles and innovations, professional identities and scholarly trajectories. We address Bell's theory of interest convergence to discuss the tensions and possibilities of personal success' in the academy by interweaving our testimonios with Critical Race and Latino Critical Race (LatCrit) scholarship in Latino/a education. Latina feminist scholars have re-worked the Latin American tradition of testimonio as a way to link individual stories to a collective story of Latina/o racialization in the US, and to epistemological racism in the academy. Our collective story centers the intersections of race with indigeneity, class, citizenship, language, gender and sexuality. We begin from the earliest influence of Bell's counterstorytelling method for examining Latino/a students' racializing experiences in higher education and move through other critical race work in Latino education that both directly and indirectly addresses Bell's scholarship as these intersect with our intellectual journeys. Finally, we offer a story of the complex legacy of Bell's anti-subordination and social justice scholarship for intellectual alliances, coalition building, and inter-, multi- and trans-disciplinary engaged scholarship.

J	Howard, TC; Flennaugh, T				Howard, Tyrone C.; Flennaugh, Terry			Research concerns, cautions and considerations on Black males in a 'post-racial' society	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black males; race; education; equity; research	AMERICAN; RACE	Black males continue to be one of the most academically marginalized groups of students in US schools, and undoubtedly the role of race and racism has largely influenced these experiences. The paradox of the underperformance of Black males has been the election of President Obama in 2008. The Obama election has led some to question whether or not race and racism continue to be pertinent factors in how racially diverse groups experience life in the United States. This article takes an examination of research on Black males in what some are attempting to label the United States' first 'post-racial' era. In this article, the authors take exception to the term 'post-racial' and any suggestion that the United States is beyond race, and that race no longer matters in US life, law, policy, and life experiences. The article calls for researchers to be mindful of important cautions, concerns, and considerations as they engage in scholarly inquiry on Black males.

J	Hughes, R; Giles, M				Hughes, Robin; Giles, Mark			CRiT walking in higher education: activating critical race theory in the academy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; Higher Education; qualitative methodology		In this article, the authors introduce the epistemological concept of CRiT walking based on critical race theory (CRT). Using performance methodology, an operational extension of critical race theory is introduced as a CRiT walk through academic neighborhoods. The authors recommend openly questioning the structural inequities deeply embedded within the academy. In so doing, they take a metaphoric walk through several 'gated communities' of higher education. The authors employ inter-story dialogue, humor, healthy skepticism, and critical reflexivity to highlight typical struggles that many faculty of color confront in the academy. Lastly, the article interrogates assumptions of the higher education enterprise and argues for faculty agency in pursuing their authentic voices despite the pressures of hegemonic policies and practices.

J	Applebaum, B				Applebaum, Barbara			'Doesn't my experience count?' White students, the authority of experience and social justice pedagogy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						social justice pedagogy; feminist theory; experience; whiteness		Social justice pedagogy appeals to experience as a form of empowerment and as a starting-point for working collaboratively in the diverse classroom. However, taking experience as unmediated and as an authoritative source of knowledge can function in ways that are counterproductive to the aims of social justice education. This essay examines the presumed authority of experience through a discussion of a debate around the meaning of 'experience' in feminist thought. Social justice educators, the author argues, must focus attention on how the subjective understanding of experience is mediated by politics, power and ideology.

'Softening' school resource officers: the extension of police presence in schools in an era of Black Lives Matter, school shootings, and rising inequality	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						School resource officers; police; discipline; school to jail nexus; racial capitalism	EDUCATION POLICY; RACE; DISCIPLINE; SENSE; MYTH	This study examines how and why a US city that is known nationally for its political progressivism continuously reaffirm its decision to maintain and expand the School Resource Officers (SRO) program in its high schools. By examining local discourses within a racial capitalism framework, we show that elements of racial neoliberalism re-emerge within a neoliberal therapeutic discourse that dominated decision-making processes and countered challenges to SROs in schools. This discourse argued that individual officers benefitted low-income students of color by providing care and challenging school racism. Despite research evidence and a counter discourse, which argued that SROs enacted harm and racism against low-income students of color, especially Black students, and should be removed from schools, SROs came to be an 'easy' fix to racial neoliberalism in the school district and city and contributed to the continuation and extension of the school to prison nexus.

Despite the increase in numbers, international students may experience racism, nativism, and other forms of discrimination within the US context. Much of the existing literature focus on how international students can assimilate and cope with these issues rather than interrogating the systems of oppression that create negative student experiences. Thus, we utilized critical race theory (CRT) as a framework for interrogating how international student experiences are portrayed in current literature. Although CRT is grounded in US-based legal theory, we argue that CRT must move beyond the rigid confinement within US borders and expand to consider how transnationalism and global exchange contributes to the fluidity and applicability of this theory. We also provide recommendations for critical race praxis, with an emphasis on implications for practice, theory, and future research.

Some scholars have theorized that racial disparities likely vary across school sub-contexts, as implicit bias in perceptions of student behavior may be more influential in locations where students and adults have weaker relationships (e.g. bathrooms and hallways, compared to the classroom). Guided by Critical Race Theory, this study used administrative data from a large urban school district (n=20,166 discipline incidents, 9,170 students, and 185 schools) to consider the relationship between student race and the locations where youth are disciplined. Results indicate that Black, Latino/a, and Multiracial youth were no more likely than White students to have a discipline incident take place outside the classroom. These findings suggest attention is needed to the role of systemic bias and colorblind policies and practices in discipline disparities.

J	Huber, LP; Velez, VN; Solorzano, D				Huber, Lindsay Perez; Velez, Veronica N.; Solorzano, Daniel			More than "papelitos:' a QuantCrit counterstory to critique Latina/o degree value and occupational prestige	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						CRT; quantitative; educational attainment; occupations		Concerned with how numbers are misused and distorted in research and public discourse at the expense of People of Color, this article attempts to answer the following: How do we use numbers to tell the stories of Communities of Color? We offer a QuantCrit counterstory to share our journey of (re)imagining quantitative methods to center and extend the commitments of critical race scholarship. Specifically, we employ the tools of cultural intuition and groundtruthing to examine educational attainment and occupational outcomes of Communities of Color generally, and Latinas/os specifically, in order to challenge dominant narratives of postsecondary degree value' and occupational prestige.' We describe how our QuantCrit journey led us to theorizing a new index of occupational status and prestige for Communities of Color, what we call a Critical Race Occupational Index. By sharing our methodological counterstory, we offer a strategy for what it means to employ QuantCrit, rather than a strict description of a methodological design that produced specific results.

J	Wun, C				Wun, Connie			Angered: Black and non-Black girls of color at the intersections of violence and school discipline in the United States	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						School discipline; race and gender; girls of color; zero tolerance policies; violence; critical race feminism; black feminism	WOMEN; PUNISHMENT; PRISON	While most research examining school discipline policies have focused on the experiences of boys of color, this article explores the relationship between violence and school discipline as they shape the lives of girls of color and their disciplinary records. Using in-depth interviews, this article re-narrates the experiences of Black and non-Black girls of color who have discipline records to explore their experiences. The author found that in addition to being subject to multiple, intersecting forms of violence outside of school, girls of color - particularly Black girls - are also subject to schools as sites of control that elicit their anger and resistance. This author contends that faculty should establish new ways of understanding Black and non-Black girls of color by accounting for the ways that intersectional violence shapes the girls' lives and supports their 'anger', agency and resistance to violence.

"It's like this Myth of the Supernegro": resisting narratives of damage and struggle in the neoliberal educational policy context	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Community-based educational spaces; Black youth; neoliberalism; educational policy	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; WHITENESS; TEACHERS; SCHOOLS; GENDER; MODELS; YOUTH	As pathologizing, racialized, and patriarchal rhetoric undergirds neoliberal education reform, deficit narratives characterize the education of Black youth. Such narratives present deep challenges for educational policy and community-based educational spaces. This article explores the ways in which community-based educators resist narratives of damage and struggle in their own personal and professional narratives in order to prevent the cycle of deficit-oriented discourse that follow Black youth through myriad educational spaces. By situating the narratives of community-based educators within a broader policy context shaped by race, class, and gender, this article illustrates the challenges that arise for community-based educators that seek to frame Black youth beyond deficit narratives and who avoid framing themselves as heroes and saviors of Black youth.

J	King, LJ				King, LaGarrett Jarriel			Teaching black history as a racial literacy project	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial literacy; black history; social studies education	TEACHERS; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION	Scholars have long promoted black history as an appropriate space to promote the development of racial literacy. Few research studies, however, have examined how teacher education uses black history as a heuristic to teach about race. Using racial literacy as a framework, this article examined the varied ways four social studies pre-service teachers interpret and taught race through black history. The pre-service teachers were aided by a black history summer reading program dedicated to help them gain the necessary knowledge to teach race through black history. The findings indicated that the pre-service teachers taught race and black history more critical than traditional US history classes but were limited in their presentation of black history and race.

Two black teacher candidates in the US demonstrate their racial identity development through critical reflections offered throughout the program. Findings suggest that teachers' racial identities shaped their constructions of culturally relevant (CR) pedagogy. Implications for teacher education programs include considering how the development of CR pedagogues is influenced by teacher candidates' racial identities and experiences.

J	Robinson, SJ				Robinson, Subrina J.			Spoketokenism: Black women talking back about graduate school experiences	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black feminist thought; African American; tokenism; gendered racism; graduate education; oral narrative	STUDENTS	Black women still experience racial oppression in the academy. In this study, I draw on Black feminist theory and oral narrative research to examine the narratives of Black women graduate students discussing their educational experiences. Black female graduate students deal with acts of everyday racism and instances of structural and internalized oppression. I explore the communicative strategies Black women use to get through their graduate programs. More specifically, I address two emergent themes: (1) Black women as spoketokens; and (2) the risks and consequences of talking back in the face of racial oppression. Ultimately, the academic experiences of Black women have a profound impact on how they wish to be perceived and how they see their role in representing Black female identity.

They conducted observations of their school experiences and then wrote up what they were observing in field notes. Field note data focus on how political discourse shapes school climate, especially around speaking Spanish, and the treatment of student researchers by other students and teachers. We also discuss the anti-Latino politics in Arizona that began with the passage of Proposition 203 in 2000. The focus of this political discussion is to identify education and immigration related laws passed by the Arizona legislature that target and negatively impact the Latino community. The article concludes with recommendations to improve education for Latino students who are learning the English language.

J	Wilkins, C; Lall, R				Wilkins, Chris; Lall, Rajinder			'You've got to be tough and I'm trying': Black and minority ethnic student teachers' experiences of initial teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						racism; initial teacher education; Black student teachers; race equality legislation; racialization	CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION; RACE	Whilst Black and minority ethnic (BME) recruitment to initial teacher education (ITE) in the UK is increasing, completion rates are lower than for White students, and this study reports the experiences of BME student teachers on a primary postgraduate programme that had been particularly successful in increasing recruitment of BME students. Amongst some positive experiences, they report concerns about social isolation, stereotypical attitudes amongst White peers and instances of overt racism, particularly in school placements. Whilst conscious of the distinctive contribution they are able to make to schools, the student teachers are aware of the dangers of marginalization where their contribution is solely defined by their ethnicity. This paper draws attention to the parallels between these experiences and those revealed in similar studies undertaken up to two decades ago. It explores possible factors behind the persistence of these experiences and questions the effectiveness of the 2000 Race Relations (Amendment) Act in promoting race equality.

J	Halagao, PE				Halagao, Patricia Espiritu			Liberating Filipino Americans through decolonizing curriculum	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Filipino Americans; decolonizing pedagogy and curriculum; libratory education; curriculum development; cultural diversity		As Filipino Americans continue to struggle academically in our public schools, we must seek alternative frameworks to understand how their historical backgrounds and cultural identities have impacted their educational experience. Filipino Americans have a colonial history that has produced what scholars termed as 'colonial mentality', a denigration of self and aspiration to be like the colonizer. Given the historical legacy of colonialism, educators have begun to look at developing curriculums and pedagogy with decolonization framework with the aim to emancipate students from ignorance and ignite a commitment to social change. In 1996, the multicultural teacher education program, entitled Pinoy Teach, was launched to empower college students to teach Filipino American history and culture to middle school students. This article presents findings and implications from a survey research study that examined the long term impact on its college student teachers ten years later. Though the Pinoy Teach curriculum was not originally developed from a decolonization framework, the results showed that the program served as a tool to decolonize the college student teachers. The outcomes have implications for the conceptualization and implementation of decolonizing pedagogy and curriculum.

J	Mosley, M				Mosley, Melissa			'That really hit me hard': moving beyond passive anti-racism to engage with critical race literacy pedagogy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race literacy pedagogy; preservice teacher education	EDUCATION; TEACHERS; CHILDREN; RACISM; COMMUNITIES; IDENTITY; STUDENTS; DILEMMA; BOARD; TALK	This study interrogates how understandings about racism and anti-racism are constructed through interactions with students as well as peers in preservice teacher education contexts towards a closer understanding of racial literacy as both a personal and pedagogical tool. Critical race literacy pedagogy - a subset of the approaches known as multicultural education, culturally responsive teaching, and anti-racist teaching - is a set of tools to practice racial literacy in school settings with children, peers, colleagues, and so forth. In this article, I explore the construction of critical race literacy pedagogy for one white preservice teacher in a U.S. teacher education program through two engagements with literacy pedagogy: a reading lesson with two African American students and the discussion of a children's literature text in a teacher education book club. Through the critical, mediated discourse analysis of these two engagements, we see that for Kelly, the process of enacting racial literacy in a reading lesson required anti-racist discourse patterns not yet available to her; whereas in the book club, interviews, and written reflections she was able to articulate what it means to practice racial literacy, pinpoint the breakdown of her pedagogy, and develop what it means to be 'actively' anti-racist as a literacy teacher. The findings of this study suggest the complexity of the roles and the variety of paths available for white teachers who desire to be anti-racist teachers. Ultimately, the findings indicate that we do not need only to prepare teachers for identities that 'transcend' predictable ways of being white but to construct a more complete framework for what it means to practice racial literacy in educational contexts.

In a three-year multi-sited ethnography journeying through regional youth detention centers (RYDCs), a multi-service center serving formerly incarcerated youth, and a public theatre housing a women-focused theatre company in the urban southeast, this study raises questions about the gendering of the school/prison nexus and interrogates the role of programs. Ultimately this study urges scholars, activists, and youth advocates to combine efforts in coalition building to meet the needs of girls in under-served and under-resourced communities and schools.

J	Brown, AL				Brown, Anthony L.			'O brotha where art thou?' Examining the ideological discourses of African American male teachers working with African American male students	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African American male teachers; African American males; social justice; nation language	RACE; PEDAGOGY	Since the early 1990s, several researchers have found that African American teachers who are successful with African American students hold deep philosophical commitments to the concept of 'social justice'. While these scholars have convincingly articulated how 'social justice' is a central feature of African American teachers' success with African American students, little attention has been given to whether African American teachers draw from diverse and/or competing ideological discourses to address the collective goal of achieving 'social justice'. Employing the theoretical framework of nation language, the findings from this study illustrate how seven African American male teachers who worked with African American male students within a local educational context drew from multiple and sometimes contested conceptions of 'social justice'. The findings from this study demonstrate that while the teachers held a 'shared concern' to radically alter the educational and social conditions of African American males, they each employed different and competing discourses of 'social justice'. Thus, in the context of this study, the idea of 'social justice' was individually rendered, historically contingent and multifaceted.

J	Subedi, B				Subedi, Binaya			Contesting racialization: Asian immigrant teachers' critiques and claims of teacher authenticity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						authenticity; cultural identity; immigration; postcolonial theory; racialization; teacher identity	MINORITY	Research on how racialization operates in immigrant context, particularly in relation to immigrant teachers, is marginalized as an area of inquiry in US educational research. This paper examines how immigrant teachers negotiated ideological and resistant notions of teacher authenticity in US school settings. In particular, the author examines how female South Asian teachers contested dominant interpretations on what counted as teacher legitimacy and authority. Along with racial, ethnic and gender identities, the paper argues for the need to recognize how religious, linguistic identities and one's academic disciplinary affiliation shape how one is constructed as an authentic or less-authentic teacher. The author argues for the need to critique the narrow ways in which identities are conceptualized in schools and advocates for the need to consider heterogeneous and contradictory notions of cultural identity.

J	Gorski, PC				Gorski, Paul C.			Racial battle fatigue and activist burnout in racial justice activists of color at predominately White colleges and universities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racism; racial battle fatigue; burnout; higher education; activism	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; AMERICAN ACTIVISM; FACULTY; EXPERIENCES; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; GENDER; WOMEN; BLACK	Activist burnout scholarship has inadequately considered challenges marginalized-identity activists, such as racial justice activists of color, experience in the course of their activism - challenges from which privileged identity activists, such as white racial justice activists, are protected. This article attempts to address this gap through a phenomenological study examining activist burnout in racial justice activists of color whose primary sites of activism are predominantly white colleges and universities in the United States at which they work. In order to stretch activist burnout theory to differentiate unique marginalized-identity activists' burnout causes from general causes that do not consider specific activist identities, the lens of racial battle fatigue is employed. Findings show that, although participants shared many causes of burnout that are consistent with general non-identity-specific causes described in existing literature, racial battle fatigue hastened their burnout while their activist commitments elevated their battle fatigue.

J	Acevedo-Gil, N				Acevedo-Gil, Nancy			College-conocimiento: toward an interdisciplinary college choice framework for Latinx students	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Latinx students; conocimiento; college choice	HIGHER-EDUCATION; HIGH-SCHOOL; STRATIFICATION; TESTIMONIOS; TRANSITION; ACCESS; COSTS; STATE; MODEL; RACE	This paper builds upon Perna's college choice model by integrating Anzaldua's theory of conocimiento to propose an interdisciplinary college choice framework for Latinx students. Using previous literature, this paper proposes college-conocimiento as a framework that contextualizes Latinx student college choices within the inequitable distribution of institutional resources in the K-12 system. In particular, the framework centers on the notion that a lack of adequate college guidance can influence a cyclical Latinx college choice process. College-conocimiento is defined as a serpentine process where Latinx students reflect on the college information that they receive, in relation to their intersectional identities when preparing for college. The pathway of college-conocimiento entails seven cyclical spaces and aims for students to develop a reflective college consciousness, exemplified through self-advocacy and supporting peers with the college choice process. This paper challenges college choice as a sequential process by noting that students can repeat stages as needed.

"We're here because we're Black": the schooling experiences of French-speaking African-Canadian students with refugee backgrounds	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						refugee youth; critical race theory; French schooling; education; African-Canadian	CRITICAL RACE THEORY	This article discusses the educational experiences of a group of French-speaking Black African-born students who entered Canada as refugees. They were attending a French school and were placed in a separate programme that was designed to meet their particular needs given their limited language skills and level of education. Drawing on critical race theory (CRT), the article analyzes how these students' identities operated in linking their academic abilities and particular life experiences in terms of race, gender, class, language, and immigrant status. The youth identified their separate programme as a problem in that their placement in it has to do with the fact that they are Black. The study provides important insights into the ways students with refugee backgrounds are being integrated into Canadian schools; and that, in some cases, the approach to their education operates to stream them along the lines of ethnicity, race, and life experience - the consequence of which is likely limited educational, occupational and social outcomes.

J	Youdell, D				Youdell, Deborah			Fabricating 'Pacific Islander': pedagogies of expropriation, return and resistance and other lessons from a 'Multicultural Day'	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						subjectivity; identification; racialisation; multiculturalism; critical race pedagogy	ALTHUSSER	This paper is concerned with the potential for pedagogic practices that unsettle race hierarchies and open up possibilities for young people who are minoritised and excluded through these race hierarchies to be recognised as legitimate students and learners. It explores these possibilities through an analysis of an ethnographic account of the dance, song and musical practices of a group of 'Pacific Islander' students, their peers and their teachers at a 'Multicultural Day' event at a high school in Sydney, Australia. The paper demonstrates how processes of subjectivation constitute, and are the sites of struggle over, race hierarchies and brings these analyses together with an exploration of students' and teachers' identifications and investments and their struggles over recognition and subjectivity. Through these analyses the paper extends existing critiques of multicultural pluralism, demonstrating the fundamentally flawed nature of Multicultural Days of this sort and the pluralist multiculturalism that they are part of. The paper goes on to consider how teachers informed by critical race pedagogy might act to undercut race hierarchies and how discursive spaces might be created and sustained in which 'Pacific Islander' and 'student' and 'learner' are recognisable. The paper engages Judith Butler's thinking on the inseparability of the Same and the Other and the promise of an open-ended and enduring invitation to 'give an account of oneself', considering whether we might begin to imagine this invitation as pedagogy.

J	Farmer, S				Farmer, Sarah			Criminality of Black youth in inner-city schools: 'moral panic', moral imagination, and moral formation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						criminalization; adolescent moral formation; moral panic; moral poverty; culture of law and order; moral imagination; zero tolerance policies		Schools provide a context or moral space for youth to develop their identity; however, with the racialized ideology, language and practices that promote Black youth criminality, criminalized schools become a racialized, classed, and gendered moral space that feeds into the school-to-prison pipeline. The criminalization of schools refers to a combination of reactive disciplinary policies, surveillance, metal detectors, unwarranted searching and lockdowns that reflect the contemporary criminal justice system within the school environment; the combination of policies send youth on a trajectory that leads to prison. The school-to-prison nexus intersects with class and race, targeting Latino, undocumented immigrants, and other populations. The purpose of this article is to explore the intersection between media representations of youth crime, school disciplinary policies, and adolescent moral formation in the context of schools where youth are criminalized. This study is guided by the following questions: In what ways does media's construction of youth crime perpetuate a moral panic that largely influences youth of color? How does this depiction of Black adolescents shape the collective imagination about the morality of Black adolescents and policies within public schools?.

'Strange faces' in the academy: experiences of racialized and Indigenous faculty in Canadian universities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racism; colonialism; academia; microaggressions; faculty; higher education	RACE; GENDER	This paper is based on a larger qualitative study of exclusion and belonging as experienced by members of marginalized groups in the professions. The current analysis draws on a subsample of 13 racialized and Indigenous academics at Canadian universities to examine their experiences of both everyday racism - subtle, almost intangible micro-level interactions that convey messages of not fully belonging - and overt racism and colonialism. Overt experiences were less common, though intensely painful. Though in some ways they are more straightforward to address, as they are more obvious, they also consume considerable time and energy. Instances of everyday racism and colonialism were more common, often intricately interwoven with the very fabric of the institutional culture. Their cumulative nature is exhausting. Diversity initiatives, while popular in contemporary universities, are failing to approach equity, in that they deny the need for change in institutional cultures.

J	Doharty, N				Doharty, Nadena			'I FELT DEAD': applying a racial microaggressions framework to Black students' experiences of Black History Month and Black History(*)	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial microaggressions; Critical Race Theory (CRT); Black History Month (BHM); Black History; history curriculum; White supremacy	CURRICULUM; EDUCATION; DIVERSITY	This paper uses a Critical Race Theory perspective to explain the everyday racisms - racial microaggressions - directed towards students of African and Caribbean descent during a non-statutory Black History unit, at an English secondary school. Applying a racial microaggressions framework to ethnographic data, this paper finds that experiences of studying Black History by students of African and Caribbean descent are dominated by various types of racial microaggressions including: micro-invalidation, micro-insults and micro-assaults. These experiences are symptomatic of wider racist structures and processes within the National Curriculum for History, based upon the ideology of white supremacy. This paper concludes that the racial microaggressions framework allows for useful ways of thinking about the function and purpose of Black History Month and Black History in schools, and its opportunities for exposing wider institutional and ideological underpinnings that legitimate deficit understandings about black people in school classrooms.

Framed by concepts of culturally relevant teaching and racial literacy, the study illustrated how the teachers used sustained and strategic instruction about race (Skerrett 2011) to complicate and challenge students' ideas of race and racism. The authors conclude by examining the implications for teaching racial literacy in humanities classrooms with low-income students of color. They also explore how the teachers' 'alternate models of pedagogy' (Ladson-Billings 1995) builds upon and extends the theory of culturally relevant pedagogy as it is commonly conceptualized.

J	DePouw, C				DePouw, Christin			When culture implies deficit: placing race at the center of Hmong American education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; Hmong American education; race and culture		There is a need for a critical race analysis of Hmong American education that places race and racism at the center of analysis, highlights Whiteness as property and recognizes the fluid and situated racialization of Hmong American students. Majoritarian explanations of inequities in Hmong American education often describe Hmong American student and family experiences in terms of 'culture clash' or profound cultural difference, thereby obscuring the ways in which Hmong American communities have been racialized as refugees, as Southeast Asians, and as 'Blackened' and gendered low income communities of color. Further, these racializing processes significantly impact the ways in which Hmong American students are situated and shaped by Whiteness as property within schools.

J	McKinney, C				McKinney, Carolyn			Schooling in black and white: assimilationist discourses and subversive identity performances in a desegregated South African girls' school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						South Africa; desegregated schools; identity; subjectivities; positioning; assimilation	CULTURE	Research on school desegregation in South Africa has largely documented an assimilationist process. As in educational contexts elsewhere, the assimilationist position presupposes that learners from non-dominant groups are made to change their ways of being on entering schools from which they were previously excluded. Drawing on an ethnographic case-study of a suburban girls' school in Johannesburg, South Africa, where 'black' learners have replaced 'white' learners, as well as on post-structuralist theorizing of 'discourse' and 'identity', this paper engages with and critiques the assimilationist position. I reconstruct the discursive positioning of the girls within official school discourses, thus highlighting the powerful assimilationist project of the school, but go on to explore the ways in which the learners use a range of semiotic resources not valued in official school discourses to subvert their positioning. I conclude that in inhabiting the school, the girls experience both repressive and liberatory effects, and they themselves produce mobile points of resistance.

J	Mayuzumi, K				Mayuzumi, Kimine			'In-between' Asia and the West: Asian women faculty in the transnational context	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asian women; faculty; transnational feminism; higher education; equity		Asian women faculty (AWF) are an underrepresented and understudied population. I hypothesize that, while AWF should be included in a broader analysis of the intersection of gender, race, class, and ethnicity in the academy, their stories can also contribute to the existing literature on minority faculty by linking the local and global experiences of 'Asians' in the 'West'. In this paper, I explore the higher education space by asking: 'What would it mean to take a transnational feminist approach to the analysis of issues concerning AWF?' First, I will closely look at a transnational feminist approach as a theoretical framework and will locate the academy as a contested space within this framework. Second, I will look at narratives and insights of AWF by drawing on literature either dealing with AWF in North America or written by AWF who explicate their own experiences in the academic settings. By applying the transnational lens to the narratives, I hope to add a new angle to see the academy as a contested site to other literature and studies that attempt to bring social justice to higher education. Lastly, I will point out some of the implications, including strengths and limitations, of using a transnational feminist framework to look at the issues concerning AWF as a marginalized population.

Drawing on the perspective of HSCCs as reflecting a colonial relationship between whites and Students of Color, we outline specific forms of anti-Black racism that include the rejection of Black intellectualism, presumed ownership of Blacks' intellectual and material property, and psychological violence and rejection of Black suffering. We articulate a need for researchers to attend to institutionalized forms of anti-Blackness across structurally diverse institutional contexts - as well as predominantly white ones - and a need to articulate realities that exist outside the 'settler colonial logics' that permeate higher education.

J	Weiner, MF				Weiner, Melissa F.			Racialized classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school: the silencing, disparagement, and discipline of students of color	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Race; ethnicity; classroom practices; discipline; the Netherlands	NETHERLANDS; EDUCATION; RACE; ACHIEVEMENT; TEACHERS; 2ND-GENERATION; DISCRIMINATION; IMMIGRANTS; WHITE; DUTCH	In both Europe and the US, racial and ethnic minority students experience discrimination at the hands of teachers that negatively impacts academic achievement. In the US, scholars have documented how a predominantly white teaching force racializes students of color through discipline and low expectations, which impact educational attainment. But in Europe, the denial of race's existence hinders research regarding structural explanations for minority educational inequality and often explains low educational attainment as a function of cultural differences. Examining classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school, this article documents racializing mechanisms that found minority students disproportionately disparaged, disciplined, and silenced. In addition, many were students under-recommended to higher level secondary school tracks. These findings reveal that Dutch schools are not racially meritocratic institutions and are relevant for scholars in the Netherlands and all other nations with educational institutions dominated by colorblind ideologies, white norms, and large immigrant populations.

J	Park, G				Park, Gloria			Situating the discourses of privilege and marginalization in the lives of two East Asian women teachers of English	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						capital; East Asian women teacher candidates; habitus; privilege and marginalization; identity; language and race	LANGUAGE; ESL; NEGOTIATION; IDENTITIES; EDUCATION; BOURDIEU; SUCCESS; TESOL; RACE	Using a narrative approach (i.e., Clandinin and Connelly 2000; Dewey 1938 [1963]), this article explores the identity constructions and negotiations of two East Asian women teachers of English in MATESOL programs. The focus of this article explores the ways in which the two women's privileged experiences coexisted with issues of marginalization once they entered English speaking contexts. The work of Kumashiro and Bourdieu provides the theoretical foundation for exploring the discourses of privilege and marginalization that are weaved into the lives of the EAWTCs. Using the women's narrative accounts collected during 2004-2005 AY, the core of the analyses focuses exclusively on the different forms of marginalization these women negotiate in reconstructing their identity within English/Turkish as second language spaces (both study abroad and graduate programs) and the ways in which Bourdieu's forms of capital play out in the intersection of privilege and marginalization. I conclude with discussions around these intersections focusing on: (1) two faces of college entrance examinations; (2) language and race; and (3) capital, habitus, and identity in the graduate programs.

Talking (and not talking) about race, social class and dis/ability: working margin to margin	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						disability studies in education; social class; race	TEACHER-EDUCATION; DISABILITY; SCHOOL	In this article we examine some of the omnipresent yet unacknowledged discourses of social and economic disadvantage and dis/ability within schools in the US. First, we document ways that social class, race, and dis/ability function within schools to further disadvantage and exclude already marginalized students. Next, we show how particular ways of talking about student ability and achievement rarely addresses this important connection. We then illustrate specific ways that race, social class, and dis/ability are elided even within more critical academic discussions. Finally, we argue for a more critical and sustained scholarly engagement that would necessarily entail reaching out margin-to-margin in order to fully understand and interrupt the myriad ways that race, economic disadvantage and dis/ability work to justify exclusion and inequality in schools.

J	Blackwell, DM				Blackwell, Deanna M.			Sidelines and separate spaces: making education anti-racist for students of color	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						antiracist education; students of color; talking back; black feminist standpoint theory; pedagogy of separation	WHITENESS; IDENTITY; RACISM; RACE	The way in which anti-racist education is currently conceptualized and practiced holds very few benefits for students of color. By using whiteness theory and the politics of identity and difference, many educators have developed pedagogical interventions that are concerned with bringing white students into a consciousness about racism and white privilege, and examining the effect of racial-identity politics on classroom interactions. Their aim to cultivate an anti-oppressive educational environment for all students is undermined by their preoccupation with identity politics, whiteness and white students. Thus, in both theory and practice, students of color are often rendered invisible on the sidelines or their personal stories are used to benefit white students and white educators. Scholar-practitioners in this field have not adequately considered what counts as anti-racist education for students of color. In this paper, I tell stories about my own experiences as a black woman graduate student as a way of 'talking back' to the disjunctures between pedagogical intentions and the disappointing realities of anti-racist classrooms. I identify the pedagogical obstacles that block instructors from positioning students of color as a central educational concern alongside their white classmates, and argue that anti-racist educators must reexamine their principles and practices from the standpoint of students of color. Finally, I turn to black feminist standpoint theory to discuss the importance of racially separate spaces as a pedagogical intervention that can make education anti-racist for students of color.

J	de Freitas, E; McAuley, A				de Freitas, Elizabeth; McAuley, Alexander			Teaching for diversity by troubling whiteness: strategies for classrooms in isolated white communities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher education; diversity; whiteness; critical pedagogy		This paper explores strategies to help prepare pre-service teachers from a predominantly white, relatively isolated island in Atlantic Canada to teach for diversity. The paper proposes a modified framework for 'teacher identity development' that pivots around three foci for enhancing teacher awareness and commitment to action: (1) relations of power and privilege; (2) youth culture and critical media literacy; (3) theory as an interpretive tool. These foci contribute to a 'pedagogy of discomfort' through which white pre-service teachers confront their resistance to and complicity in the inequities that play themselves out in the school system. The ongoing capacity to sustain the emotional labour of confronting this discomfort is seen as critical to making a positive difference.

J	Chen, GA; Buell, JY				Chen, Grace A.; Buell, Jason Y.			Of models and myths: Asian(Americans) in STEM and the neoliberal racial project	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						STEM; Asian American; education; race; neoliberal	MINORITY; WHITENESS; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; COLOR; RACE	This paper examines historical and contemporary racializations of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system. The prevailing perception of Asian(Americans) as model minorities masks how their multiple and contradictory positionings in the STEM system perpetuate the neoliberal racial project and reproduce systems of racism and oppression. Through a multidisciplinary analysis of STEM education and industry, we demonstrate that the shifting racialization of Asian(Americans) secures advantages for White Americans by promoting meritocracy and producerism and justifies White supremacy. By serving these functions, the racialization of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system is central to the neoliberal racial project. This paper also suggests how STEM education researchers can reveal and resist, rather than veil and support, the neoliberal racial project in STEM.

J	Briscoe, FM; Khalifa, MA				Briscoe, Felecia M.; Khalifa, Muhammad A.			'That racism thing': a critical race discourse analysis of a conflict over the proposed closure of a black high school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						epistemologies; critical race theory; educational leadership; power; racism; discourse		Using critical race discourse analysis, this study examines descriptions of a heated controversy over the proposed closure of the only primarily black high school in a large urban city. Participants included community members and the district and school leaders who were key in the controversy. Based on Foucault's analysis of power we looked for conflicts in the narratives of the participants in their description of the controversy. Four strands of discursive conflict emerged: the purpose of school; the relationship of school and community; communication; and the issue of racism. Taking these four strands together, the themes found in the discourse of the community members enacted an emancipatory knowledge paradigm, while the themes found in the discourse of the administrators enacted a technical-rational, instrumental paradigm of knowledge.

J	Berry, RQ; Ellis, M; Hughes, S				Berry, Robert Q., III; Ellis, Mark; Hughes, Sherick			Examining a history of failed reforms and recent stories of success: mathematics education and Black learners of mathematics in the United States	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; counter-storytelling; mathematics education; meta-ethnography; education reform; Black learners	LEVEL	There is a long history indicating that during times of reform, the interests and needs of Black children are in many ways dismissed. This history culminated in 1990's to what is described today as the 'Math Wars.' The underlying narrative focuses on America's national security, technological interests, social efficiency, and the perpetuation of White privilege. There are intense debates focusing on curriculum, teaching, learning, and assessment but little debates on understanding the realities of children's lives. Through a hybrid historical-critical race theory (CRT) lens informed largely by the work of Derrick Bell, this article makes the case that Black children have not benefited from reform agendas in mathematics which are often situated in the larger political and social space. Moreover, the CRT analysis coupled with the historical critical methods of this article attempt to unveil the underpinning of the 'mathematics for all' message, often touted in policy documents, as having done little to understand that influence of mathematics teaching and learning for Black children. The article also draws from Bell's work to offer counter-narratives through examples of the brilliance of the Black children who are thriving with mathematics, even within a context that tends to ignore them. The article concludes with implications for considering and addressing what we name the 'opportunity to learn mathematics gap.'

J	Gerrard, J				Gerrard, Jessica			Self help and protest: the emergence of black supplementary schooling in England	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						black British history; community education; social movements; supplementary schooling; race; class	EDUCATION; COMMUNITY; RESISTANCE; BRITAIN; MARGINS; RACISM; RACE	First initiated in the late 1960s, the black supplementary school movement is now approaching its fifth decade of existence. Located across Englands town and city centres, this movement represents important sites of community-based education and independent black culture. The history of black supplementary schooling points to a concerted reclamation of black knowledge and culture, and the asserted capability of black students, parents, and communities. Drawing on school archives and the testimonies of ex-teachers and organisers, this article explores the historical emergence of this significant educational movement and its relationship to the state education system. Firstly, this history traces the educational and political impetus for supplementary schools, through examining the campaign and community work that instigated and defined them. Following from this, the ways in which black supplementary schools challenged state educational authority through their educational practices and through their active campaign work is explored.

J	Ullucci, K				Ullucci, Kerri			Learning to see: the development of race and class consciousness in white teachers	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						identity development; teacher education; race consciousness; White teachers	HISTORY	This is a study of White teachers and their identity development. Using a qualitative approach steeped in the tenants of critical race theory and storytelling, this study investigated how White teachers learn about race, class and diversity in meaningful ways, with a close eye on the role their own personal histories played in their development. To better understand this phenomenon, three White teachers - all believed to be exceptionally skilled in educating children of color in urban centers - were interviewed over the course of several meetings. Their data provides insights into the factors and experiences that shape the race and class consciousness of successful White teachers in urban schools. Through the teachers' stories, we glean an awareness of the salient life experiences that help build solidarity between students and teachers, help White teachers understand their own racial positioning, and illuminate ways in which teacher education programs can broaden their understanding of 'quality' teachers.

J	Krueger, P				Krueger, Patricia			It's not just a method! The epistemic and political work of young people's lifeworlds at the school-prison nexus	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						social production of space; student lifeworlds; participatory action research; school safety and security; spatial tactics	ACHIEVEMENT; PLACE	In 2008, a New York City-based youth research collective formed to document the different types of interaction young people have within the securitized space of some of New York City public high schools. This article describes the inquiry methods of this research group, and by examining selected image-based and written data that youth researchers created of their securitized school grounds, this mixed-method and participatory action research-inspired study interrogates to what degree criminal-justice-oriented school safety practices affect young people's perceived, conceived and lived experiences with space in schools. The data collection and analysis were guided by the work of Henri Lefebvre (1991) and Edward Soja (1996) whose theoretical framework focuses on the social processes of space production to situate young people's daily lived experiences at school as lifeworlds amidst intensified penalizing school safety and security procedures. This article emphasizes youth-directed image-based research of space as both a methodology and epistemology to deeply examine some of the long-term effects that the school-prison nexus has on young people's educational attainment.

J	Seggie, FN; Sanford, G				Seggie, Fatma Nevra; Sanford, Gretchen			Perceptions of female Muslim students who veil: campus religious climate	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						campus religious climate; higher education; female Muslim students; headscarf; student resilience	RACIAL CLIMATE; COLLEGE	This article is based on a small qualitative case study that examined the perceptions of undergraduate Muslim American and Muslim international female students regarding the campus religious climate in a predominantly Christian four-year research university. Specifically, it seeks to understand the opportunities and challenges of female Muslim students who veil on campus during their college years. Due to the small sample size, findings should be taken as indicative rather than definitive. Findings indicate that despite the fact that female Muslim students who veil perceive the campus religious climate welcoming to a certain extent, they still experience feelings of mild exclusion and marginalization. The findings indicate that the perceptions related to campus religious climate for Muslim American and Muslim International students are similar. This study reveals that religiously diverse students, specifically Muslim veiled women, share some of the same experience as culturally and ethnically diverse students. There is much that higher education institutions can do to provide support to this population of students such as accumulating knowledge regarding the needs of these students so the institutions are equipped to provide support and able to assist these students in finishing their degree programmes.

J	Meer, N				Meer, Nasar			Identity articulations, mobilization, and autonomy in the movement for Muslim schools in Britain	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Muslims; education; faith schools; identity		Muslim schools in Britain have emerged as a highly salient issue that at times reinforces, and at other times cuts across, political and philosophical divides. It therefore comes as some surprise to learn that despite a general proliferation of literature on Muslims in Britain very little research has explicitly investigated how increasingly salient articulations of Muslim identities connect with the issue of Muslim schooling. To be sure, and notwithstanding sustained Muslim mobilizations for Muslim schools within and across diverse Muslim communities, surprisingly little is known of how these mobilizations are being undertaken, what is being sought, and, more generally, why Muslim schools are deemed to be an important issue for different Muslim communities. By drawing upon two years of fieldwork, this article addresses these questions through the use of primary interviews with Muslim educators and stakeholders concerned with voluntary aided schooling, including teachers and Muslim educational associations, alongside other case study instruments including field notes, and documentary and policy analysis. The article concludes that through an engagement with a range of established educational conventions, norms, regulations and precedents, the testimonies of Muslim educators betray emerging syntheses between faith requirements and citizenship commitments that are seeking out negotiated, and reciprocal, British Muslim identities.

J	Serrano, U				Serrano, Uriel			'Finding home': campus racial microclimates and academic homeplaces at a Hispanic-Serving Institution	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Campus racial microclimates; campus racial climate; Hispanic-Serving Institutions	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; CLIMATE; COLLEGE; MICROAGGRESSIONS; STUDENTS; EXPERIENCES; PERCEPTIONS; STEREOTYPES; TRANSITION; DIVERSITY	Students do not uniformly feel welcome in university environments, and their experiences vary across race. Drawing on 19 interviews with Black and Latino men at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, this study demonstrates that participants perceive the campus racial climate at the organizational level differently. However, perceptions and experiences in microclimates converge and are informed by the lack of Black and Latinx faculty, the underrepresentation of Black students, and experiences with racial microaggressions. This study bridges prior research on microclimates and campus racial climates to advance the concept of campus racial microclimates. I also introduce the concept of academic homeplaces, which are campus racial microclimates that foster a sense of community and affirmation.

Drawing on ethnographic data, we explore how girls of color make meaning of their everyday experiences in two settings: a racially tracked mathematics class in a suburban high school and a STEAM based after-school program in a working class urban community. The stories of these girls - separated by time, place, age, and social histories but bound by sensibilities grown in their Immigrant families and learning contexts - contest U.S. hegemony as the primary rationale for STEM learning; challenge individual gain at the expense of another; problematize what counts as science while insisting on its creative convergence with joy; and honor their ingenuity and humanity.

Discussing racism with primary aged-children	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						racism; racialisation; ethnic-racial socialisation; children; teachers	COLOR-BLINDNESS; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; FOCUS GROUPS; PREJUDICE; MULTICULTURALISM; DISCRIMINATION; CONSTRUCTION; IDENTITY	Ethnic-racial socialisation is broadly described as processes by which both minority and majority children and young people learn about and negotiate racial, ethnic and cultural diversity. This article extends the existing ethnic-racial socialisation literature in three significant ways: (1) it explores ways children make sense of their experiences of racial and ethnic diversity and racism; (2) it considers ways children identify racism and make distinctions between racism and racialisation; and (3) it examines teacher and parent ethnic-racial socialisation messages about race, ethnicity and racism with children. This research is based on classroom observations, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with teachers, parents and students aged 8-12years attending four Australian metropolitan primary schools. The findings reveal that both teachers and parents tended to discuss racism reactively rather than proactively. The extent to which racism was discussed in classroom settings depended on: teachers' personal and professional capability; awareness of racism and its perceived relevance based on student and community experiences; and whether they felt supported in the broader school and community context. For parents, key drivers for talking about racism were their children's experiences and racial issues reported in the media. For both parents and teachers, a key issue in these discussions was determining whether something constituted either racism or racialisation. Strategies on how ethnic-racial socialisation within the school system can be improved are discussed.

J	Djonko-Moore, CM				Djonko-Moore, Cara M.			An exploration of teacher attrition and mobility in high poverty racially segregated schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						high poverty schools; racially isolated schools; school climate; teacher mobility; teacher attrition	URBAN-SCHOOLS; TURNOVER; SATISFACTION; RETENTION; RACE; PROFESSION	The purpose of this study was to examine the mobility (movement to a new school) and attrition (quitting teaching) patterns of teachers in high poverty, racially segregated (HPRS) schools in the US. Using 2007-9 survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics, a multi-level multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the contribution of teacher characteristics, school setting characteristics, and school climate with a focus on interactions between school climate variables. The findings demonstrated that school climate variables predicted increased odds of mobility and that teacher characteristics, school setting, and teachers' perceptions of school climate predicted increased odds of teacher attrition. These findings suggest that teacher attrition and mobility from HPRS schools could be slowed by strategic placement of teachers based on their beliefs about students in poverty and students of color.

Advice to White allies: insights from faculty of Color	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						White allies; faculty of Color; social justice; teacher education	TEACHERS; RACISM; RACE	This article interweaves discussions of successes and tensions surrounding cross-racial collaborative social justice efforts in teacher education. It addresses frustrations that often occur for faculty of Color when working with White allies in P-12 settings and schools of education at Predominantly White Institutions. Advice is offered with the larger goal of helping White allies think about ways to shift the gaze from educators' politics to the wellbeing of culturally and linguistically diverse students. Suggestions for how White allies can better support faculty of Color are presented.

J	Housee, S				Housee, Shirin			What's the point? Anti-racism and students' voices against Islamophobia	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; anti-racism; social justice education and student voice		In a climate of Islamophobic racism, where media racism saturates our TV screens and newspapers, where racism on the streets, on campus, in our community become everyday realities, I ask, what can we - teachers, lecturers and educationalists - do in the work of anti-racism in education? This article examines classroom debates on Islamophobia by exploring the connections between student experiences and the wider social political issues and ideologies that create and re-enforce racism. The underlying interest for me is to examine the ways in which classroom interaction; dialogue and exchanges can undo racist thinking by informed anti-racist critique. This article has three sections; first, I discuss the multicultural and anti-racist discourses within education in the British context. I then go on to explore theoretical developments found in Critical Race Theory (CRT) as a tool for this anti-racism in education. In the second section I examine Islamophobia, the hatred of Muslims, as a measurement of current racism. My interest is to explore the meanings of Islamophobia, and its relevance to students lived realities. Media representation and text on Islamophobia are used as a way of pulling out the student views and lived experiences of such racism. In the final section I raise the question of 'what's the point of studying racism?' Here I discuss a class seminar on the viewing of a YouTube role play of a racist incident against a hijaab wearing woman. The point here is to unpack student's views and reactions to Islamophobia. I conclude that classroom discussions can be a place where anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-oppressive views emerge to inform the discussion for social justice in education.

J	Tinker, C				Tinker, Claire			Rights, social cohesion and identity: arguments for and against state-funded Muslim schools in Britain	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						muslims; faith schools; state funding; rights; social cohesion; identity	FAITH-BASED SCHOOLS; LIBERALISM; DIVERSITY	The debate over the state funding of Muslim schools in Britain often appears polarised, as those on opposing sides are portrayed as holding fundamentally conflicting values and desires. In this article I challenge this position by arguing that there are some common concerns shared by those on all sides of the debate, namely rights, social cohesion and identity. Advocates and opponents of Muslim schools are united in their concern with the rights that should be afforded to religious and non-religious groups, parents and children in multifaith Britain. Both wish to find the appropriate balance between maintaining distinct cultural communities and developing a sense of common British citizenship. They also share a desire to defend their identity and have it respected by others. This indicates that, underneath the antagonism and misunderstanding which often pervades the Muslim schools debate, there are some key desires and concerns that unite those on opposing sides. This realisation could potentially open up a space for dialogue between advocates and opponents of Muslim schools.

J	Baszile, DT				Baszile, Denise Taliaferro			Beyond all reason indeed: the pedagogical promise of critical race testimony	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; testimony; reason		Critical race testimony is the act of bearing witness - from a critical perspective - to the ways in which racism is inflicted on and inflected in one's life experiences. In this article, the author begins her process of theorizing within the context of a classroom dilemma, which compels her to expand on the meaning and value of critical race testimony to a socially just pedagogy of race. She provide a brief historical analysis of critical race testimony, locating it within the Black autobiographical tradition, and most notably within the work of W. E. B. DuBois, who insinuated throughout his body of work that a 'purely' rational approach to race was an incomplete and thus to some extent ineffective approach to redressing notions of race and practices of racism. This tradition, the author suggests, has been revived and reasserted within the context of critical race theory's use of the Black (Latino, Native, Asian, and European) autobiographical voice through counter-storytelling - not as an alternative extant of reasoning, but as epistemological and pedagogical intervention, working to reveal the socially constructed and contextually dependent nature of reasoning itself. She concludes by returning to her classroom dilemma to suggest that the pedagogical promise of critical race testimony lies in its ability to move beyond Reason as we have come to know it, to reveal the ways in which rationality (unchecked) itself reinforces racist attitudes and practices.

J	Daniel, BJ				Daniel, Beverly-Jean			Teaching while Black: racial dynamics, evaluations, and the role of White females in the Canadian academy in carrying the racism torch	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black academics; higher education; racial evaluations; racism; White women	EXPERIENCES; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; COLOR; POWER; RACE	For racialized academics, life in the academy can be marred by racial violence that leaves them caught between their commitment to their craft, desire for educational attainment and development, and the mental anguish that can dominate their existence. Drawing from experiences of the author and other Black faculty members in Canadian tertiary academic institutions, I provide a theoretical exposition recognizing the role of narratives as an act of counter-storytelling. I draw upon Black feminist epistemology, critical race theory, and critical theory to examine how the experiences of Black academics remain under-theorized, marginalized, and often erased within 'strong/angry Black woman/man' caricatures. I highlight how racial evaluation filters reinforce racism and affects the careers of Black academics. I also discuss the role that White women, who are charged with decision-making power, have come to play in carrying the 'racism torch' in the academy while adhering to the tropes of innocence.

J	Welply, O				Welply, Oakleigh			"I'm not being offensive but ...': intersecting discourses of discrimination towards Muslim children in school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Muslim children; discriminatory discourses; Critical Race Theory; multiculturalism; intersectionality	BRITISH; POLITICS; RACE; WHITE; ISLAMOPHOBIA; CHILDHOOD; EDUCATION; IDENTITY; VOICES; GENDER	This article examines forms of implicit discrimination towards Muslim children in children's discourses of Otherness. Findings in this paper draw on qualitative data exploring the discourses of 17 children from a Year 6 class in a culturally diverse primary school in the East of England. Building on Critical Race Theory and Critical Discourse Analysis, this article shows that children's discourses of Otherness acted in tacit discriminatory ways by constructing difference as problematic, which positioned Muslim children as the bad Other'. These findings show the intersectionality of discrimination experienced by Muslim children in school, and offer a reflection on the role of multiculturalism in schools and the limitations of uncritical discourses of tolerance in fostering an understanding of difference and Otherness.

The challenges associated with presenting while black	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African American faculty; racialized experiences; interpretations of performance; racial notions; presentations	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; PROFESSORS; RESISTANCE; FACULTY; BELIEVE; RACISM; HUMOR; DONT; RACE	How black faculty experience presenting their research in educational venues within the context of historical objectification of black people as sources of entertainment is an underexplored topic in higher education research. Presenting research has far-reaching implications for black academics' advancement, such as future employment and opportunities for research collaboration. Thus, how black faculty are perceived while presenting has significant implications for their career trajectories. This study is concerned with understanding how black higher education faculty perceive, interpret, and respond to how they are perceived while presenting within a context of racialized academic scrutiny. Thirty-three black professors were interviewed about their participation in a number of presentation contexts, including national conferences, symposia, and campus job talks. Study participants discussed encountering multiple layers of racial stereotyping and bias, and also how their keen racial awareness enabled them to develop strategic coping mechanisms to manage audience reactions. These strategies also represented the self-sacrifices they made that altered their racial identities. By examining black faculty members' struggles to be valued personally and professionally in white-dominated academic sites, the study findings can enrich critical interpretations of racism in higher education.

J	Modica, M				Modica, Marianne			Unpacking the 'colorblind approach': accusations of racism at a friendly, mixed-race school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						colorblind; racism; cross-racial friendship; race and education; reverse racism	TEACHERS	The desire to ignore race in favor of a 'colorblind' approach has so permeated the cultural ethos of the US, that many whites, teachers included, fear that talking about race in any capacity leaves them open to accusations of racism. As a result, race has become a taboo subject in many US classrooms. This article explores the implications of the colorblind approach in the lives of students and teachers at a suburban, mixed-race high school. In spite of the friendly environment at the school, white students and teachers expressed a racial identity that was infused with racial tensions over possible accusation of racism. White students' confusion and anxiety about how to discuss race in mixed-race settings coexisted with resentment over perceived marginalization by African Americans. Apprehension over discussing race hindered productive classroom conversations and stopped teachers from addressing evidence of racial inequity. Teachers, administrators, and students need support and training on how to engage in much needed conversations about race.

J	Ryder, AR; Rostas, I; Taba, M				Ryder, Andrew Richard; Rostas, Iulius; Taba, Marius			'Nothing about us without us': the role of inclusive community development in school desegregation for Roma communities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						inclusive education; Roma; inclusive community development; desegregation; ethnicity; interculturalism	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; SEGREGATION; EDUCATION; CHILDREN	This article was presented at the European Conference on Educational Research, September 2012 Cadiz, Spain. The article argues that community dialogue and participation is a vital dynamic in desegregation and explores the centrality of forms of empowerment which can be described as 'inclusive community development' (ICD). The segregation of Roma children is taking place despite the growing body of legal statutes and policy directives aimed at creating integrated education which has been formally reaffirmed in a number of cases at the European Court of Human Rights. It is posited that ICD is essential to make a reality of legal and policy directives which support desegregation. It is argued that such a dialogic exercise can overcome institutional opposition to inclusion but has transformative potential by promoting inclusive education, interculturalism and setting communities along a path leading to wider structural change. The article draws upon a large pan-European project which involved the authors.

J	Chapman, TK; Bhopal, KK				Chapman, Thandeka K.; Bhopal, Kalwant K.			Countering common-sense understandings of 'good parenting:' women of color advocating for their children	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						parents; critical race theory; intersectionality	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; BLACK-MALES; EDUCATION; TEACHERS; WHITENESS; POLITICS; SCHOOLS; MOTHERS; INTERSECTIONALITY; SCHOLARSHIP	Commonsense understandings of school practices have historically painted parents of color as inattentive and non-participatory actors in public school settings. Racist implementations of policy and individual actions, based on teacher ideology and deficit paradigms of race, force parents of color to take an oppositional stance in public school settings. The commonsense notion of good parenting is countered by descriptions of how parents of color, particularly mothers, remain involved and active leaders in the lives of their children by pursuing schooling options and opposing enactments of school policies and practices that further marginalize their children. Using data from two studies in different countries, the authors explore how women of color enact racial justice by advocating for their children and preparing them to face racism in public school settings.

J	Osei-Kofi, N; Torres, LE; Lui, J				Osei-Kofi, Nana; Torres, Lisette E.; Lui, Joyce			Practices of whiteness: racialization in college admissions viewbooks	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; racialization; higher education; admissions viewbooks; whiteness; marketing; diversity	LIBERAL-ARTS; RACE	US colleges and universities today intensively market themselves in order to compete for prospective students. One of the most widespread marketing tools used to attract students are admissions viewbooks, which are designed to provide potential students with favorable impressions of the many institutions to which they may apply. In this study, we explore how racial diversity is represented in undergraduate admissions viewbooks. Because viewbooks contribute to how prospective students and their families understand higher education and how they comprehend racial diversity in this context, careful examination of the messages contained in viewbooks is of great significance to a range of social justice and equity-related issues in higher education. Our findings, which stem from a critical visual and textual analysis of 20 viewbooks, suggest that viewbooks convey strong messages concerning racial identity that raise critical questions about the state of diversity, race relations, institutional priorities, and the commoditization of admissions in American higher education today.

J	Warmington, P				Warmington, Paul			'A tradition in ceaseless motion': Critical Race Theory and black British intellectual spaces	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; black intellectuals; public intellectuals; black British history	WHITE SUPREMACY; EDUCATION	In the USA, where Critical Race Theory (CRT) first emerged, black public intellectuals are a longstanding, if embattled, feature of national life. However, while often marginalized in public debate, the UK has its own robust tradition of black intellectual creation. The field of education, both as a site of intellectual production and as the site of political struggle for black communities, is one of the significant fields in which black British intellectual positions have been defined and differentiated. This article argues that the transfer of CRT to the UK context should be understood within this broader context of black British intellectual production. Through a critical examination of race conscious scholarship and the diverse literature produced in the UK since the 1960s, this article identifies some of the dimensions of education that have been scrutinized by black British intellectuals. In doing so, it directs attention to questions being generated by the transfer of CRT to the UK and to the local materials on which those using CRT might draw, in order to build a historically grounded base for the development of CRT in the UK.

J	Haw, K				Haw, Kaye			From hijab to jilbab and the 'myth' of British identity: being Muslim in contemporary Britain a half-generation on	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						identities; multiculturalism; Muslim communities	MULTICULTURALISM; FRANCE	This paper is written as a return to the generation of young Muslim women who were participants in a piece of research carried just over a decade ago. Some of these original participants have been re-interviewed in 2007. The paper traces the shift in discourses around multiculturalism and identity, ethnicity and religion via two recent significant events in Britain. First, the case of a Muslim student excluded from her school for wearing a long, loose, dress-like outer garment, the jilbab. Second, the riots that took place in several cities in England during the Summer of 2001. Taking these events as signifiers and using the notion of a 'mythic feedback loop' in relation to a 'changing same', an analysis of the new interviews highlights the movements in the discourses of multiculturalism. The paper argues that the girls' shifting 'senses of self', and their changing discursive articulations, must be understood in light of the sociological changes after 2000 compared to the 1990s, as they dance between the contradictory and shifting discourses concerned with multiculturalism, mediated by notions of essentialism and exclusion, diversity and difference and the difficult and dangerous.

Early career faculty of color and promotion and tenure: the intersection of advancement in the academy and cultural taxation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Faculty of color; students of color; cultural taxation; promotion and tenure; collectivism; cultural wealth; departments of educational leadership and administration; critical race theory	RACE; PERSPECTIVES; PROGRAMS; IDENTITY; STUDENTS	This qualitative study examined how early career faculty of color in higher education departments of educational leadership and administration across the United States were able to manage the cultural taxation associated with faculty service and achieve promotion and tenure. In the U.S., receiving academic tenure promises faculty both academic freedom and job security. This study utilizes cultural taxation as a theoretical framework to explore how faculty of color navigated service demands at their institutions. Three commonalities were found among participants: (1) being strategic about commitments to students and promotion and tenure efforts; (2) making connections between faculty workloads and motivation for pursuing promotion and tenure; and (3) believing relationships with students were a benefit during the promotion and tenure process. The results of this study indicated that successfully navigating cultural taxation helped faculty in their pursuit of promotion and tenure.

African American faculty expressing concerns: breaking the silence at predominantly white research oriented universities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						predominantly white research universities; African American faculty; Delphi method	COLOR; EXPERIENCES; PROFESSORS; ETHNICITY; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; TENURE; GENDER; RACE	A Delphi method was used with a panel of 24 African American faculty employed at 43 predominantly white doctoral extensive universities to arrive at a group consensus on a list of concerns that African American faculty in general experienced or held. Using the Delphi method a panel of African American faculty initially worked from a list of eight concerns (i.e., lack of mentor; little guidance about the tenure and promotion process; social isolation and lack of collegiality; excessive and token committee assignments; research viewed as trivial and discounted; little guidance about the academic workplace; limited opportunities to participate in departmental and institutional decision making; and infrequent occasions to assume leadership positions) to the development of a list of 13 concerns after employing three rounds of the Delphi method. The implication from the expressing of these concerns is that universities have a portion of their faculty that are yet experiencing racism, subtle and even overt discrimination. This study serves as a clarion call that some universities are not being as successful at achieving diversity and inclusiveness as they declare or think.

J	Tate, WF; Hogrebe, M				Tate, William F.; Hogrebe, Mark			From visuals to vision: using GIS to inform civic dialogue about African American males	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						human capital; social disparities; civic engagement	SEGREGATION; PLACE	There has been considerable attention in the sociology and public policy literatures to the relationship between spatial arrangements and opportunity structures in metropolitan America. This article attempts to address this issue in the context of Metro St. Louis, Missouri, a center of biotechnology development, where the majority population in St. Louis City is African American. More specifically, it does so by examining extant social science literature related to African American males in urban America. A focus is on highlighting developmental challenges and opportunities for intervention where spatial arrangements are a consideration. Next, it provides an argument that metropolitan regions attempting to intervene would benefit from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as part of a visual political literacy project aimed to support civic engagement and capacity related to African American male life course development. The metropolitan region of St. Louis is used as a case to illustrate the possibilities of geospatial tools as information sources. The article concludes with a recommendation for greater investment in resources to support sustained community-based research designed to inform understandings of geospatial arrangements that are linked to social disparities.

J	Li, J				Li, Jun			'My home and my school': examining immigrant adolescent narratives from the critical sociocultural perspective	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						immigrant youth; critical sociocultural perspective; cross cultural experience; qualitative research	PERCEPTIONS; CHINESE; ACHIEVEMENT; ATTITUDES; COMMUNITY	Privileging the voices of 12 recent Chinese immigrant adolescents, this multiple-case narrative study examined their home and school experiences from the critical sociocultural perspective. The adolescent stories about home testified to the significant influence of immigrant poverty, parental sacrificial altruism, and disciplinary Chinese parenting in their academic achievement. The adolescent experiences at school revealed their appreciation of Canadian liberal education, their perception of ethnic peer divides, and their concerns about the ineffectiveness and the negative psychological consequences of the ESL (English as a Second Language) programming. Locating the adolescent narratives in the hierarchical power of domination in Canadian society, this article challenges mainstream educational institutions to address the changing nature of urban Canadian classrooms, structurally and ideologically representing the strengths of cultural diversity.

J	Akom, AA				Akom, A. A.			Ameritocracy and infra-racial racism: racializing social and cultural reproduction theory in the twenty-first century	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Review						race; racism; social and cultural reproduction theory; colorblindness; merit; intersectionality; declining significance of race	RACE; RESISTANCE	This article argues that narratives forecasting spectacular mobility for Black people/people of color along with the growth of the Black middle class function as proof that America 'works' and that the American dream is obtainable for all. However, what is concealed within this 'meritocratic' discourse is that full acceptance into this society is restricted on the basis of racial identity and other forms of social difference. I term the illusion of egalitarianism as 'Ameritocracy'. By combining two separate words American and Meritocracy - I use the idea of 'Ameritocracy' to demonstrate how race intersects with other forms of social oppression such as class, gender, religion, nationality, sexuality, phenotype, accent, immigration status, and special needs. Thus, informed by the intercentricity of racialized oppression, I use the concept of Ameritocracy to racialize social and cultural reproduction theory and illustrate how traditional claims of objectivity, meritocracy, colorblindness, and race neutrality often mask self-interest, power, and privilege of dominant groups in the United States' opportunity structure and beyond.

J	Hughey, MW				Hughey, Matthew W.			Brotherhood or brothers in the 'hood'? Debunking the 'educated gang' thesis as black fraternity and sorority slander	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African Americans; racism; gangs; fraternity; sorority; identity; culture	RACE	In this article the author explores the controversial thesis that African American Collegiate Fraternities and Sororities, also known as Black Greek Letter Organizations (BGLOs), are 'educated gangs'. First, the author examines this polemic as a 'truth claim' and compares BGLOs and gangs through: (1) hazing; (2) rape and substance abuse; (3) social constructions of black masculinity and femininity; (4) social structure; and (5) cultural aesthetics. Second, the author finds the legitimacy of the 'educated gangs' thesis untenable due to the racist nature of the discourse itself. Third, the author argues that BGLOs are deemed 'educated gangs' via a nouveau 'culture of poverty' ideology, the exaction of 'symbolic violence', and the propagation and protection of a normative and pure whiteness that is constructed relationally to a demonized and vilified blackness.

J	Thomas, EE; Warren, CA				Thomas, Ebony Elizabeth; Warren, Chezare A.			Making it relevant: how a black male teacher sustained professional relationships through culturally responsive discourse	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						English Education; culturally responsive pedagogy; African American education; discourse analysis; race relations; teacher education; practitioner research	PEDAGOGY; PERCEPTIONS; WHITENESS; POLITICS; STUDENTS; PORTRAIT; SCHOOLS; POWER; LIFE	What we know about the experiences of black teachers is limited, especially considering the vast amount of research conducted on and about black boys and young men. This article describes and analyzes how a black teacher at a suburban high school in the Midwestern United States negotiated professional relationships through culturally relevant discourse. Anthony Bell was the only black male teacher participating in a classroom discourse analysis study group at a diverse suburban high school. Throughout the course of the semester, Anthony's stated objective for learning discourse analysis was to understand, structure, and facilitate more productive conversations with a struggling student teacher he was mentoring. Yet Anthony also used his discursive inquiry to trouble the water in his classroom and in the study group workshops. Participation in the study group provided Anthony with metalinguistic tools to critique his interactions with his students, student teacher, and professional peers. Anthony's analyses of his own teaching, his student teacher's work, the study group, and the school index themes in critical and critical race theory in education. As he became a teacher researcher, Anthony reported a greater sense of professional self-efficacy, eventually facilitating a successful workshop at a national teacher conference. Anthony's case is an exemplar of the unique and critical role of black men who teach, as well as the imperative of practitioner research within the current climate in teacher education.

J	Moskal, M				Moskal, Marta			Language and cultural capital in school experience of Polish children in Scotland	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						migrant children; cultural capital; language learning; education; qualitative research	MIGRANTS; LIVES	This article addresses the complex relationship between migration and education in the context of recent intra-European labour mobility. It considers how this mobility impacts the education and life chances of migrant students attending schools in Scotland, UK. By examining the experiences of Polish migrant children and youth at schools in Scotland, the article engages with the issues of language, cultural capital transferability and social positioning. Drawing on qualitative data from 65 in-depth interviews with school children aged 5-17years, their parents and teachers, as well as observations in the contexts of school and home, the article points to a range of factors affecting the transition of migrant pupils to new schools and social environments.

J	Higgins, M; Madden, B; Korteweg, L				Higgins, Marc; Madden, Brooke; Korteweg, Lisa			Witnessing (halted) deconstruction: white teachers' 'perfect stranger' position within urban Indigenous education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						deconstruction; whiteness; Eurocentrism; Derrida; teacher education; Indigenous education		This article extends upon Susan Dion's theory of the 'perfect stranger' by exploring how this position is articulated and embodied by white teachers (N = 67) involved in urban Indigenous education reform. On the lookout for deconstruction, we think with Derrida around the interrelated self/other and familiar/strange binaries that uphold the perfect stranger. We argue that Eurocentrism simultaneously centres and obscures whiteness, resulting in teachers' misconceptions about culture. We also demonstrate how stereotypical representations of the 'imaginary Indian' that these white teachers 'know' inhibits their ability to foster and build upon relationships with Indigenous students. We conclude by conceptualizing a model for teacher education that, through a variety of teaching practices and policies, intentionally disrupts and destabilizes the perfect stranger position.

J	Smith, HJ; Lander, V				Smith, Heather Jane; Lander, Vini			Collusion or collision: effects of teacher ethnicity in the teaching of critical whiteness	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; teacher education; teacher ethnicity	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; DIVERSITY; WOMEN	Educational inequities persist in England today. Initial teacher educators are therefore charged with facilitating student teachers' understanding of the issues pertaining to such inequities so they may work to disrupt them. Two lecturers at opposite ends of England, both with overwhelmingly White student cohorts, have approached this undertaking through the teaching of critical whiteness studies. This article exposes and explains the very different reactions of White student teachers to this approach given that one of the lecturers is Black and the other White. Explanations are viewed through a sociological framework which seeks to deconstruct normalized practices; in tandem with understandings of how whiteness operates to reinforce such normalization in order that inequitable power relations are reified. This revealed that student reactions were underpinned by racialised assumptions of teacher ability and motives, leading to collusion in whiteness for the White teacher and, for the Black teacher, a collision between her teaching and student perceptions of her role and values.

J	Kitching, K				Kitching, Karl			Interrogating the changing inequalities constituting 'popular' 'deviant' and 'ordinary' subjects of school/subculture in Ireland: moments of new migrant student recognition, resistance and recuperation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						subjectivities; subculture; bodies; migration; racism; class; gender	RACE; CONSTRUCTION; IDENTITY; POLITICS; FEMINIST; GENDER	This paper explores moments in which three new migrant students become constituted as particular types of learners and classmates, through the interplay of racialised, classed and gendered norms made available in one Irish school. Certainly, new migrant students' subjectivities may be constrained due to already embedded school/subcultural inequalities. Yet rather than simply being entirely subject to the exclusionary norms underpinning 'deviance', 'ordinariness' and 'popularity', we can read moments where 'Christian', 'Feyi' and 'Theresa's' subjectivities might expose, disrupt, or be reworked by them. This paper provides insight as to how the inequalities of a previously monoculturally styled context intersect with and/or elide now more tangibly local racialising processes of contemporary migration. Drawing on the critical work of Butler and Youdell, it is suggested that the means of recognising new/indigenous students as acceptable learners or classmates are unstable, thus constantly offering the possibility of contesting/jettisoning the rendering of 'undesirable' learner/classmate subjectivities.

J	Sonn, CC				Sonn, Christopher C.			Educating for anti-racism: producing and reproducing race and power in a university classroom	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical pedagogy; whiteness; racism; Indigenous Australians; psychology	PSYCHOLOGY; LIBERATION	In this paper I explore some of the issues associated with teaching about race, culture, and ethnicity in a psychology program. These curriculum initiatives are part of a broader agenda of raising awareness about racialised oppression and exclusion and contributing to the development of ways of researching and practicing psychology that are transformative and culturally sensitive. I overview the broader context and describe our subject and the guiding principles. This is followed by a description and analysis of two events in the classroom that illustrate the ways in which students differentially respond to the challenges posed by writings that challenge taken-for-granted understandings of race. Part of the analysis shows that students can often engage in the reproduction of oppressive practices and invest in whiteness. It is suggested that more than single semester subjects are required to promote and support the development of critical capacities for anti-racism practice.

J	Alexander, C; Weekes-Bernard, D				Alexander, Claire; Weekes-Bernard, Debbie			History lessons: inequality, diversity and the national curriculum	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Multicultural education; history curricula; national curriculum; britain	POLICY	This article explores the continued importance of teaching a diverse curriculum at a time when issues of racial and ethnic equality and diversity have been increasingly sidelined in the political discussion around British' values and identities, and how these should be taught in schools. The 2014 History National curriculum, in particular, provoked widespread controversy around what British history is, who gets included in this story and how best to engage young people in increasingly diverse classrooms with the subject. The new curriculum provides both opportunities for, and constraints on, addressing issues of racial and ethnic equality and diversity, but how these are put into practice in an increasingly fragmented school system remains less clear. Drawing on the findings of two research projects in schools across England and Wales, this article examines the challenges and opportunities facing teachers and young people in the classroom in the teaching and learning of diverse British histories. We argue that it is not only the content of what children and young people are taught in schools that is at issue, but how teachers are supported to teach diverse curricula effectively and confidently.

Beyond conventional wisdom: community cultural wealth and the college knowledge of African American youth in the United States	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African American students; college knowledge; college preparation; community cultural wealth; postsecondary pathways	LATINA/O STUDENTS; URBAN; EDUCATION; SCHOOL; EXPERIENCES; FUNDS	African American youth are generally as likely as their peers from other racial and ethnic groups to aspire to earn a college degree; yet, in spite of their aspirations these students remain under-represented in college enrollment and graduation. Part of the disparity between these students' aspirations and the realization of their goals may lie in their minimal college knowledge and nominal participation in postsecondary preparatory activities that have frequently been caused by the historic, and ongoing, systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans. During interviews, college students reflected on how similarly-aged family members, peers, co-workers, and parishioners assisted with various aspects of college preparation and enrollment. The community cultural wealth framework helps us understand the reason for, and importance of, this 'lateral mentorship' in the fulfillment of these students' college aspirations. Consequently, educators and educational systems are challenged to be more responsive to the college preparatory needs of traditionally under-represented college-going populations.

Transcending apartheid in higher education: transforming an institutional culture	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						intergenerational justice; racism; higher education; institutional culture	SOUTH-AFRICA	Twenty years after Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa, deeply entrenched inequalities and injustices are still at the core of the country's social fabric. South Africa's public and private sectors continue to battle with the situation and higher education institutions are no exception. The South African Ministry of Education has identified systemic problems within the institutional cultures of universities as one of the key obstacles to change. This article focuses on a racist incident that occurred at the University of the Free State (UFS) in South Africa in 2007. The incident shook the university's institutional culture to the core and became a catalyst for change for universities across the country. We portray the institutional culture of the UFS on the basis of a series of interviews with management and student leaders who personally played key roles in handling the incident in 2008. The interviews reveal some of the 'story stock' within the institutional culture and highlight four interrelated dimensions of contestation. The stories also show that the interviewees frequently situate and justify their beliefs and actions in an intergenerational chain. Finally we consider some of the implications of our findings for the ongoing reconstruction of post-apartheid institutional cultures in higher education.

J	Kearns, LL				Kearns, Laura-Lee			The construction of 'illiterate' and 'literate' youth: the effects of high-stakes standardized literacy testing	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						standardized testing; literacy; masculinity; marginalized youth; power; colonization; masculinity		High-stakes standardized literacy testing is not neutral and continues to build upon the legacy of dominant power relations in the state in its ability to sort, select and rank students and ultimately produce and name some youth as illiterate in contrast to an ideal white, male, literate citizen. I trace the effects of high-stakes standardized testing by using the voices of 16 youth who failed the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT) to illustrate how the illiterate youth' revealed to students, schools, and communities by this test is culturally and socially constructed. In an age where multiple literacies are more and more valued, standardized literacy testing acts as a form of social control projected upon the adolescent' body that has historically been deemed other' or deficient.' Just as colonized subjects needed to be civilized,' so youth now need to acquire a state defined literacy in a competitive and fast paced learning environment. This article helps to demonstrate how power operates on marginalized youth through standardized literacy testing that is being used transnationally.

J	Mayuzumi, K				Mayuzumi, Kimine			Navigating Orientalism: Asian women faculty in the Canadian academy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Orientalism; Asian women faculty; Canada; transnational feminist perspectives; higher education		While individuals of note have been documented, there has been a paucity of research into the collective voices of Asian women faculty in higher education. To fill this gap, the study brings forward the narratives of nine Asian women faculty members in the Canadian academywho have roots in East Asia. Employing the concept of Orientalism within a transnational feminist perspective, I argue that the historically produced Orientalist discourses of Asian women are still prevalent in contemporary society, including the academy. This article highlights two major themes: 'Oriental' others - being 'Asian'; and 'Oriental' women - questioned authority. This article concludes by pinpointing some implications of the research within the analytical lens and connecting the topic to the general equity issues in higher education institutions.

J	Lunneblad, J; Johansson, T				Lunneblad, Johannes; Johansson, Thomas			Learning from each other? Multicultural pedagogy, parental education and governance	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						parental education; governmentality; social capital	INVOLVEMENT; TEACHERS; SCHOOLS	Today there is a strong tendency to involve local citizens in community work, and to mobilize social forces in poor urban districts. We will focus on one specific method used to educate and help immigrant parents raise and foster their children. This method is described as part of a wider ambition to integrate and involve immigrants in Swedish society. The aim is to get parents involved, and to create a dialogue and the necessary requirements for equal conditions. However, although the emphasis is on dialogue and shared experiences, this model is also based on and coloured by governmentality. Through an empirical material consisting of a number of interviews with parents and teachers, we have focused on four thematic subjects: educational policies, homework, values and identities, and the importance of space and belonging. The results indicate that although the Swedish teachers try to create a dialogue and communicate with the parents, they do not succeed particularly well. The results indicate that when communication breaks down, the teachers often use different strategies of governance to implement their values, norms and ideas. In conclusion, it is not merely the clash between different value systems, and the different views on pedagogy and learning that contribute to distortions in the communication between teachers and parents, we also have to look more closely at the material and social conditions that create distance and alienation. Against the backdrop of the perception of whiteness and segregation, many of the communicative failures are understandable and logical.

J	Buras, KL				Buras, Kristen L.			'We have to tell our story': neo-griots, racial resistance, and schooling in the other south	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; neoliberalism; urban educational policy; counterstories; New Orleans; global south		In cities across the United States, working-class communities of color find themselves struggling against inequities deepened by state disinvestment. Students at the Center-a writing initiative based in several public high schools in New Orleans over the last decade-has been a part of this struggle and embraces a pedagogy rooted in the voices, cultures, and histories of traditionally marginalized youth, their families, schools, and neighborhoods. Through collections of student writing and digital media, young neo-griots have produced counterstories that call into question dominant narratives about race, schooling, and neoliberal policy. This article draws upon student counterstories, teacher interviews, and classroom and community observations as the means for critically analyzing the implementation of racially-inspired neoliberal reforms, such as decentralization, charter schools, market-based educational choice, and targeted disinvestment in pubic infrastructure, in New Orleans-the experimental front for such policies in the United States. While more accelerated and extensive due to the vacuum created by displacement and destruction after Hurricane Katrina, the reforms are not wholly distinct from those elsewhere. Thus students' counterstories shed light on the 'legitimacy' of such policies nationally and globally and reveal the necessity of building solidarities between the South within the North and the Global South. More immediately, students and teachers challenge the aspirations of neoliberal elites in New Orleans who seek to elide their history, close their school, and reinvent their neighborhood.

J	Dillard, CB				Dillard, Cynthia B.			Re-membering culture: bearing witness to the spirit of identity in research	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African-American; culture; Ghana; identity; memory; spirituality		This article examines the complexities and possibilities of identity (leaning on DuBois' notion of double consciousness) when located not in the white racial landscape of the US but in the varied racial, cultural and ( inter) national contexts explicated by the scholars gathered in this issue of REE. One way to read this response might be as a critique of the limitations of DuBois' notion of double consciousness in capturing the complexities and the possibilities of identities beyond the binary of black and white, beyond nation state, ethnicities, or other racialized constructions of difference. However, more importantly, I am suggesting that our discussion of identities can also be informed by the often ignored notions of spirituality in DuBois' work, and how it might mediate our contemporary meanings of racial and other identities. Beyond wrestling with the biological and cultural explanations of identity, recognition of the spiritual nature of identity extends our 'postcolonial' notions beyond their over-reliance on race as an identity - and towards the possibilities of moving through and maybe beyond race to a more equitable and subjective identity as spiritual beings.

Coping with racial battle fatigue: differences and similarities for African American and Mexican American College Students	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial battle fatigue; racism; stress; higher education	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; ASIAN-AMERICAN; MENTAL-HEALTH; CLIMATE; DISCRIMINATION; BLACK; STRESS; LATINO; MICROAGGRESSIONS; PERCEPTIONS	Student of Color often reference racial microaggressions when asked to describe their post-secondary experience. The racial battle fatigue framework assists in understanding the cumulative, negative effect of racial microaggressions on psychological, behavioral, and physiological outcomes. This paper assesses the racial battle fatigue framework for African American and Mexican American college students and the impact of coping on racial stress. Results demonstrate that racial microaggressions negatively impact stress responses for African American and Mexican Americans differently, but coping may help alleviate the impact of racial battle fatigue. Universities can address racial microaggressions and negative health outcomes by educating campus constituents about racial microaggressions, addressing Whiteness, and providing education about adaptive coping strategies.

J	Marom, L				Marom, Lilach			Under the cloak of professionalism: covert racism in teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Pre-service teacher education; Indigenous education; whiteness; Critical Race Theory; decolonization	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; MULTICULTURALISM; EXPERIENCES; LAND	This study focuses on manifestations of racism and colonialism in teacher education. I build on the theoretical framing of Critical Race Theory and decolonization in order to expose racist and colonial assumptions at the core of teacher education. I highlight in particular the work of covert racism under the cloak of teachers' professionalism. I focus on what I call 'professional microaggressions': subtle forms of racism and colonialism hidden beneath professional definitions. By interviewing graduates of a well-established Indigenous teacher education program in British Columbia, Canada, I examine the mechanisms that still hinder the success of Indigenous teacher candidates in teacher education and in the school system. The study highlights the resilience, resistance, and strategic planning that Indigenous teachers use to challenge the system while advancing their position within it. Lastly, I suggest ways to support Indigenous teacher candidates in teacher education.

J	Ramjattan, VA				Ramjattan, Vijay A.			Racist nativist microaggressions and the professional resistance of racialized English language teachers in Toronto	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racist nativism; microaggressions; professional resistance; English language teaching	CRITICAL RACE; STORIES	English language teaching upholds racist nativist notions that competent teachers are white native speakers of English born in majority-white countries. These notions manifest when international students, expecting to be taught by these speakers, are skeptical about having a racialized instructor, who may be seen as non-native to English and the nation where it is natively spoken. Rather than overt, this skepticism may appear in the form of microaggressions. Informed by critical race and resistance theories, this article uses interviews with 10 racialized teachers in Toronto, Canada to detail the racist nativist microaggressions that they experience at work and their professional resistance strategies that combat these microaggressions. The findings describe the following microaggressions: interrogations of the teachers' nativeness, insinuations of their foreignness to English, and behavioral indications that they are 'invading' the classroom. Their professional resistance either conformed to or sought to transform notions of the supremacy of white (Canadian) teachers.

J	Givens, JR				Givens, Jarvis Ray			A grammar for black education beyond borders: exploring technologies of schooling in the African Diaspora	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black education; African Diaspora; white supremacy; Educational Diasporic Practice	COMMUNITY	Education has been a technology used to sustain black abjection across the African Diaspora. Employing Mills' Racial Contract and Althusser's theory of the Ideological State Apparatuses (ISA) through a racial lens, this article will discuss how white supremacist education has been used to promote the misrecognition of black subjects as sub-human. German colonizers' recruitment of Booker T. Washington to develop cotton schools in Togo, West Africa will be explored to highlight this phenomenon. Beyond this, the article demonstrates how members of the Diaspora have resisted white supremacist education, through what I have termed as Educational Diasporic Practice. This concept will be explored through the work of Chinua Achebe and Carter G. Woodson. Ultimately, this article recommends a global language of blackness as context for educators and researchers concerned with schooling experiences of black students.

J	Watkins, M; Lean, G; Noble, G				Watkins, Megan; Lean, Garth; Noble, Greg			Multicultural education: the state of play from an Australian perspective	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						multicultural education; multiculturalism; teacher education; English as a Second Language (ESL)	GENERATION 1.5; TEACHERS	This article reports on the first comprehensive survey of public school teachers in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) around issues of multicultural and English as Second Language (ESL) education. While there is substantial literature on multicultural education - what it should and shouldn't be - there is much that is left unexplored in research in the area, not least of which is the characteristics of the teaching labour force. In this article, we take stock' of multicultural education, not by engaging with philosophical debates about multiculturalism as an ethical or policy practice, but as an auditing of what exists in the name of multicultural education. Drawing on a sample of over 5000 respondents, the article documents the changing cultural profile of the profession and highlights gaps in pre-service training and professional learning of teachers in terms of meeting the needs of Australia's increasingly culturally and linguistically complex school populations.

J	Reynolds, RE; Howard, TC; Jones, TK				Reynolds, Rema Ella; Howard, Tyrone C.; Jones, Tomashu Kenyatta			Is this what educators really want? Transforming the discourse on Black fathers and their participation in schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						parent involvement; Critical Race Theory; No Child Left Behind; fathers; Black parents	ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; INCOME; COMMUNITY; CHILDREN; FAMILY; INVOLVEMENT; SUPPORT	Parent involvement within schools has garnered attention since the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 mandated that parent participation be a condition for federal funding. This particular caveat has been significant because issues of race and class come to the forefront when examining schools that receive federal funding. A close examination of parent involvement becomes increasingly salient, in particular for students of color who are more likely than their White peers to attend schools receiving federal funding. In this qualitative study of 16 participants, we seek to narrow the focus of parents, and pay particular attention to Black fathers. The role of Black fathers has been largely absent from the educational discourse on parent involvement at both the local and federal levels, and within the literature, the roles, practices, and strategies of involvement for Black fathers has been scant compared to their White peers. This absence from the literature is noteworthy given the important role that involvement plays in educational success coupled with Black students' perennial underperformance in US schools. The purpose of this work is to highlight findings from a study that examined the voices, perspectives, and involvement practices that Black fathers used to build relationships with school personnel in an effort to advocate on behalf of their sons and daughters and improve their overall schooling experiences.

J	Khalifa, M; Dunbar, C; Douglas, TR				Khalifa, Muhammad; Dunbar, Christopher; Douglas, Ty-Ron			Derrick Bell, CRT, and educational leadership 1995-present	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; Derrick Bell; educational leadership; community-based leadership; neoliberalism	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; URBAN; PRINCIPAL; STUDENTS	Critical Race Theory (CRT) has become a centered conceptual framework to understand American education and reform (Ladson-Billings and Tate 1995; Solorzano and Yosso; 2001; Decuir and Dixon 2004). Indeed, educational leadership scholars have not been far behind in recognizing the explicative and powerful role of CRT studies in their work (Lopez 2003; Parker and Villalpando 2007). As we acknowledge the role of CRT, we cannot do so without reflecting on the life and works of the quintessential Critical Legal Studies (CLS) scholar Derrick Bell (1930-2011). In this article, we use Bell's collective works to analyze current trends and research in educational leadership. We bring his works into conversation not only with conceptions of instructional and distributed leadership, but with the palpability that CRT has on the current state of educational reform. More specifically, we use Bell's theories of interest convergence and conversations around racial remedies' to understand two recent trends in educational leadership: discourses of social justice leadership and the move toward data-driven leadership behaviors. We ask questions like: what has been the impact of research discourses social justice on the education of African American and Latino urban youth? And, how has the current social structures benefited from such discourses? We conclude with recommendations for educational leadership researchers and professors, and encourage them to consider race as an integral part of their works.

J	Gillies, V; Robinson, Y				Gillies, Val; Robinson, Yvonne			'Including' while excluding: race, class and behaviour support units	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						inclusion; behaviour support; institutional racism	EDUCATION	This article examines the workings of informal exclusion units located within British secondary schools. Although articulated in terms of inclusion and support such initiatives effectively work to remove students regarded as troublesome from mainstream classrooms. Drawing on ethnographic research in three inner-city schools we show how a therapeutic ethos governs activities within the units. A focus on developing personal skills is maintained in an effort to compensate for the perceived shortcomings of parents and wider communities. As we demonstrate, this reasoning drives a culturally intolerant approach concealed within a broader commitment to multicultural values. While notions of diversity are celebrated within the schools, issues of race and racism are routinely avoided, ensuring that institutionally ingrained patterns of discrimination remain unchanged.

J	Gropas, R; Triandafyllidou, A				Gropas, Ruby; Triandafyllidou, Anna			Greek education policy and the challenge of migration: an 'intercultural' view of assimilation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						multicultural; intercultural; education policy; migration; Greece		This article explores the policy responses and conceptual underpinnings of intercultural education in Greece. In the past two decades, and as a result of migration, Greece has seen its demography significantly and irreversibly altered in social, cultural, economic, ethnic, racial, and religious terms. Faced with an increasingly diverse student population, novel education policies are required. This article addresses the following questions: How has intercultural education been designed in Greece in response to growing immigration? What are the main objectives of Greek educational policy as regards contemporary Greek society overall and the immigrant population in particular? Are these changing, and if so in what direction? Is intercultural education perceived differently on the part of the various stakeholders? Based on our empirical research we highlight the connection between education policy approaches, practices and national identity discourses in order to explore the conceptual confusion of intercultural vs multicultural education approaches and the importance of the national context. We also raise a number of issues that we consider merit further examination both in policy and research terms in order to expand and enrich intercultural education in Greece.

Urban schools and the master narrative of the 'tough, urban principal'	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						urban education; race; charter schools; critical race theory; public opinion	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EDUCATION; HISTORY; LIMITS	We report on a field trip we took to a 'highly successful' urban middle school and a number of disturbing events that occurred there. Afterwards, we filed formal complaints about the violence, and racial and sexual harassment we observed. These complaints led to both a formal investigation and a series of newspaper articles that resulted in a public discussion of urban schools and how best to work with young urban students of color. We present our analysis of this public discussion in terms of what we identify as the master narrative of the 'tough, urban principal' and how children of color in urban schools are 'othered' in ways that allow members of the public to consider abusive behavior an appropriate way to improve students' learning. Four themes emerge in the public discussion of these events: (a) Minimization of startling behaviors - calling them 'unconventional', for example, to regularly scream racial epithets at students; (b) 'Isn't that what those kids need?' in which outrageous and possibly criminal levels of assault on students, teachers, parents, and community members are perceived as 'what is needed' to reach 'those kids'; (c) Desperation on the part of parents and community members to find and identify 'good' urban schools; and (d) Dismissal of those who would complain about such actions as 'politically correct', 'soft', and 'foolishly naive' about what 'urban' children need to succeed. These themes are discussed in terms of the implicit and explicit dehumanization of students of color, the racial separation between the community and the local schools (i.e., the community is more white and middle class than the student population of the schools), conversations about what constitutes a 'good' school, and the role of standardized test scores in protecting against criticism.

J	Hoyles, A; Hoyles, M				Hoyles, Asher; Hoyles, Martin			Race and dyslexia	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						dyslexia; race; racism; culture; disability; impairment; disability movement; disablism; social model; medical model; integration; inclusion; simultaneous oppression; self-advocacy		This article begins with a definition of dyslexia as genetic, involving language processing and phonological awareness. It goes beyond reading and writing difficulties to include, for example, sequencing, orientation, short-term memory, speed, circumlocution, organisational skills, visual thinking, self-esteem and anger. Dyslexia, though neurological and present worldwide, is experienced through culture. It may once have been an advantage and may well be again with the importance of visual literacy in the computer age. In a literate society, however, it is more of a disadvantage and is compounded by racism. An examination of changing views about disability (social and medical models, impairment and disability, integration and inclusion) is followed by relating the issue to race, expressed as simultaneous oppression. Our research into eight black dyslexic adults is summarised and the conclusion drawn that more research is needed into black dyslexic students and that the recent British government initiative to train 4000 dyslexic specialist teachers, though a start, is inadequate.

J	Ali, S				Ali, Suki			Black feminist praxis: some reflections on pedagogies and politics in higher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						black feminism; pedagogies; politics; embodiment; postcolonial		This essay takes a personal, reflexive approach to the positioning of black feminism in higher education in the UK. It asks how we might best understand the political economy of black feminist knowledge in higher education. It argues that challenges for black British feminist pedagogies and embodied positionality are best explored through postcolonial paradigms, and coalitions amongst black feminists continue to be of vital importance in contemporary academic sites.

J	Maylor, U				Maylor, Uvanney			Is it because I'm Black? A Black female research experience	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black; 'race'; racism; subjectivity; researcher; (in)visibility	WHITE SUPREMACY; RETHINKING	This article examines what it means to be a Black female researcher in contemporary Britain. Drawing on Black feminist theory and critical race theory (CRT), this article seeks to highlight some of the experiences and challenges that Black female researchers face when undertaking research, particularly research that has diversity, equality or 'race' as key foci. Such experiences often remain silent, yet they are integral to how Black researchers conduct and experience research. The article adopts a reflexive approach in uncovering these hidden realities. It explores a small number of racist experiences encountered in English schools and other educational establishments. The article examines how these various experiences are situated, internalised and negotiated as part of a Black researcher's everyday practice. In drawing attention to Black researcher ( in) visibility, the discussion also reveals why some White staff sometimes find it difficult to acknowledge racist experiences endured by Black colleagues.

J	Daza, SL				Daza, Stephanie Lynn			Decolonizing researcher authenticity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						authenticity; Colombia; ethnicity; linguistics; race; research; sexual orientation	QUALITATIVE INQUIRY; IDENTITY; RACE	This article examines the ways in which researcher authenticity is negotiated along three axes of difference, ethno-linguistic affiliation, sexual orientation and race/skin color. Ultimately, it analyzes how researcher authenticity is produced and played out within research, via interactions between participants, researchers and others who influence the research project, especially when researchers and research are transnational. Yoshino's Covering, a new addition to critical legal studies, provides a theoretical framework for analysis. Namely, what society comes to imagine as 'normal' and 'mainstream' are myths that limit us by forcing us to play-up favored traits and downplay disfavored ones. In order to be considered authentic, researchers often are pressed into playing roles - fitting norms - produced by narratives that limit and give way to how the researcher can be imagined. The analysis suggests that researcher authenticity, however, is not completely fixed, but discursively shaped during research. The ambivalence inherent in inscribing imaginary subjects that are inadequate and unattainable unfixes the subject and provides a gap where the possibility for producing new narratives exists. This work has implications for the narrow view of science that quickly is becoming the norm in this era of research.

J	Demintseva, E				Demintseva, Ekaterina			'Migrant schools' and the 'children of migrants': constructing boundaries around and inside school space	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						School; Russia; symbolic boundary; ethnic boundaries; integration	2ND-GENERATION; ASSIMILATION; EXCLUSION; WHITE	This article examines ethnic segregation at school level in Russia and the symbolic boundaries constructed around schools attended by children of migrants, as well as inside them. While Russian cities are notable for the very low degree of spatial segregation along ethnic lines, numerous studies demonstrate that in recent years local residents have come to perceive some institutions as 'migrant schools' as these have pupils of more diverse ethnic backgrounds. In particular, children of migrants and 'local' children create their own symbolic divides between 'us' and 'them' that reflects the degree of a pupil's integration into the host society rather than her ethnic origins. When conflict situations break out between schoolchildren, the migrant stereotypes current in wider society are reproduced. On the school administration level, the main problem is a lack of adaptation programmes for children of migrants, as well as lessons in Russian as a second language.

The psychosocial effects of Native American mascots: a comprehensive review of empirical research findings	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Review						American Indians; mascots; stereotypes; discrimination; athletics; equal education	POSITIVE STEREOTYPES; COLLEGE; PREJUDICE; ATTITUDES; SPORTS; IMPACT; RACE; REPRESENTATIONS; STUDENTS; ISSUES	Approximately 2,000 teams in the U.S. utilize Native American mascots, the majority of which are associated with schools. Across the nation there continue to be many intense conflicts over these mascots. Most conflicts focus on differences in opinion, rather than on the effects of these mascots. The purpose of this article is to provide educational decision-makers with a comprehensive review of research on the psychosocial effects of Native American mascots. This body of research suggests that these mascots generate undesirable effects. First, they are psychologically detrimental to Native American students. Second, for non-Native persons, they are associated with negative stereotypes of Native Americans. Third, these mascots undermine intergroup relations by increasing negative stereotyping of Native Americans. Lastly, supporters of these mascots are more apt to believe prejudicial ideas. We discuss these findings relative to broader societal contexts.

Underpinned by Giddens"reflexive project of the self', which privileges agency and reflexivity, and using a narrative inquiry approach, it presents four students'stories' collected through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. In building a picture of the ways in which students' self-identity is shaped by and shapes their experience of study abroad, the stories illustrate individual agency, motivation, self-determination and reflexivity. In doing so, they challenge the essentialised view of Chinese students as a homogeneous and sometimes problematic group and point to implications for action by the host institutions.

J	O'Mara, B; Harris, A				O'Mara, Ben; Harris, Anne			Intercultural crossings in a digital age: ICT pathways with migrant and refugee-background youth	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						digital media; migrant; ICT; refugee; education	ETHNICITY	This article problematises the uptake and use of digital technologies by migrant and refugee-background young people, through the lens of a site-based arts pedagogy program, Culture Shack (CS), in Melbourne, Australia. It argues that online pedagogies including animation, Facebook, photoshop, mobile phones and Youtube can be used effectively for bridging cultural, gender and educational gaps, if the ways in which they are applied engage with communication preferences and discourses of culture, ethnicity and digital media technology - including issues related to technological determinism. Drawing on Dimitriadis' attention to the power of public pedagogies and cyberculture theorists such as Leung and Nakamura, this article frames creative ICT use as not merely a tool but a contested, negotiated space in which young participants shape educational transits of being and becoming, and arts-based digital learning as twenty-first century global pedagogies.

J	Vass, G				Vass, Greg			The racialised educational landscape in Australia: listening to the whispering elephant	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						CRT; chronicles; Indigenous education; close the gap; racialised landscape	WHITENESS; EQUITY; RACE	Recent political and educational policy shifts within Australia have renewed concerns with achievement and engagement 'gaps' when Indigenous and non-indigenous school students are compared. The position taken for this article however, hopes to demonstrate that this shift is unlikely to result in improved outcomes because of an ongoing failure to account for the racialised underpinnings of the Australian educational setting. To illustrate this, the body of the article offers four 'Chronicles' that draw attention to the pervasive presence of negative racialised assumptions that contribute to sustaining educational inequities. The Chronicles are based on my experiences as a classroom teacher, and subsequently informed by exposure to ideas from Critical Race Theory as a graduate education researcher. The narrative style adopted here accepts the assertion that Chronicles are a valid, suitable and insightful approach to analyse and learn about racialised discourses and practices. The ambition for this article then, is to demonstrate the salience of CRT as a theoretical, methodological and analytic approach with much to contribute with enhancing understanding of Indigenous schooling and contemporary education research.

J	Bradbury, A				Bradbury, Alice			Equity, ethnicity and the hidden dangers of 'contextual' measures of school performance	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						attainment gaps; high stakes testing; value added measures; race; league tables		'Contextual value added' (CVA) scores have been used as a means of monitoring school performance in England since 2007. This article explains how these scores are calculated using biographical pupil data (including ethnicity, gender and Free School Meal status) in order to judge the impact of a school on pupils' attainment. This article argues that the use of ethnicity as a variable in setting expected levels of progress between two points of testing legitimises and reinforces differences in attainment by ethnicity, and that the growing importance of CVA in schools threatens to engender practices that systematically disadvantage pupils from certain ethnicities. This article uses data from government advice on CVA, calculations of CVA and local authorities' education websites to examine how the government's use of CVA as a monitoring mechanism has the potential to institutionalise low expectations of some minority ethnic pupils in schools. The discourses used in the presentation of CVA as a 'fairer' measure are also discussed, particularly in relation to the legitimising effect of a system which regards ethnicity and other biographical features as inevitable factors in individual pupils' levels of attainment. When compared to professed aims to reduce gaps in attainment by ethnicity, CVA reveals an incoherence at the heart of government policy on minority ethnic attainment.

J	Jackson, TA				Jackson, Taharee Apirom			Which interests are served by the principle of interest convergence? Whiteness, collective trauma, and the case for anti-racism	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; critical white studies; race; whiteness; anti-racism; interest convergence	RACISM	A primary principle of critical race theory is 'interest convergence,' or the notion that progress toward racial equality will only be made when it converges with the interests of whites. Although I generally concur, I posit that 'interest' must be rendered more complex in order to fully understand the pernicious effects of racism on all people, and on whites in particular. While laws, cultural norms, institutional practices, and even the election of Barack Obama indeed serve the material and emotional interests of whites, their psychological and moral interests are simultaneously undermined. I complicate the meaning of 'interest' to show that while whites indeed benefit from racial hierarchy in numerous ways, a full deconstruction of racism and the collective trauma it induces must be considered with a more nuanced and disaggregated definition of 'interest' in mind. I put forth that while whites are advantaged in real and tangible ways in an endemic system of racial dominance, the psychological and moral costs of racism far outweigh its limited benefits.

J	Keddie, A				Keddie, Amanda			Framing discourses of possibility and constraint in the empowerment of Muslim girls: issues of religion, race, ethnicity and culture	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Muslim girls; empowerment; religion; race; ethnicity; culture		This paper presents the stories of three female Muslim educators actively engaged in empowering Muslim girls in their school/community liaison roles. The stories are drawn from a broader qualitative and predominantly interview-based research project that investigated issues of teaching and social justice in three English schools. Through lenses that recognise the dynamic, complex and contradictory narratives that shape Muslim girls' identities, the paper draws attention to the women's discursive positionings and, in particular, how such positionings generate 'framing discourses' that both shut down and open up possibilities to support Muslim girls. The first story illustrates how the discursive position of 'Ashley', a white, Western woman who has recently converted to Islam, generates 'incomplete framing discourses' that homogenise the girls' culture and thus ignore or de-legitimise significant issues of race and ethnicity in the girls' lives. The second story provides an account of 'Abida' and 'Sati's discursive positioning as women of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage. Their alternative framing discourses bring to light and give status to the range and complexity of the discourses that shape the girls' identities. In juxtaposing these stories, the paper highlights the importance of educators being conscious of and critically examining their own discursive positioning in their construction and support of Muslim girls; and draws attention to the continued imperative of disrupting the epistemic privilege of Western-informed views of female empowerment and of listening to feminist voices from the margins.

The second ID: critical race counterstories of campus police interactions with black men at historically white institutions	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Race; racism; critical race theory; campus racial climate	AFRICAN-AMERICAN; ACHIEVEMENT; EXPERIENCES; EDUCATION; CLIMATE; BROWN	Although campus racial climate on colleges and universities has been scrutinized in research on higher education, scholarship focused on Black male collegians' interactions with campus police remains limited. Considering how the logics of white supremacy and anti-Black racism have characterized policing across the nation, we assert that a critical examination of how those practices are mirrored on college campuses can illuminate the challenges Black students face when navigating white campus spaces. Drawing on Critical Race Theory, this study reports on the encounters between three Black male students and campus police officers at three distinct historically white institutions. We posit that for Black college students, the student identification (ID) evokes a legacy of surveillance that can be traced to the freedom papers that freed slaves were required to carry while traversing white spaces as a means to affirm rights to freely belong. We conclude with implications and directions for future research.

J	Langenkamp, AG				Langenkamp, Amy G.			Latino/a immigrant parents' educational aspirations for their children	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Educational aspirations; status attainment; Latinos; familism	COLLEGE ATTENDANCE; MEXICAN-ORIGIN; HIGH-SCHOOL; ACHIEVEMENT; EXPECTATIONS; AMERICAN; FAMILISM; STUDENTS; ENGAGEMENT; CONTEXTS	This study explores Latino/a parents' educational aspirations and parents' perspectives on supporting educational attainment as a way to better understand the connection between high educational aspirations among Latino/a parents and hindrances to Latino/a youth educational attainment. Data from focus group interviews with immigrant Latino/a parents suggest that parents' high educational aspirations are shaped by their lived experiences of their own educational and occupational struggles, their immigrant status, and perceptions of opportunity in the United States. In turn, parents' perspectives on supporting educational attainment are focused on education in the home and guiding their children to overcome inevitable obstacles. This study contributes to current research by expanding sociological theory related to the status attainment process for Latino/as as well as incorporating parents' perspectives into the broader body of knowledge about how parents support their children's attainment.

Case study was used to portray the out of school' phenomenon for ethnic minority students at a secondary school in Hong Kong through the experiences of one such ethnic minority student. Morshed, a Pakistani student, participated with the researchers in an unstructured in-depth interview. In addition, interviews were also conducted with the principal, two teachers, and one support staff from the school. The study showed the complex interaction of school contexts and personal life issues that influenced Morshed's dropping out of school. Implications are drawn for providing better school support that can facilitate more positive schooling experiences for Hong Kong's ethnic minority students.

The threat of unexamined secondary data: a critical race transformative convergent mixed methods	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical race theory; higher education; secondary data; mixed methods	CHICANA	This article uses a critical race theory framework to conceptualize a Critical Race Transformative Convergent Mixed Methods (CRTCMM) in education. CRTCMM is a methodology that challenges normative educational research practices by acknowledging that racism permeates educational institutions and marginalizes Communities of Color. The focus of this article is to examine the quantitative component of the mixed methods to interrogate objective' and scientific' assumptions of the statistical practices used in analyzing secondary datasets. To demonstrate this method, we analyze the ways in which race and ethnicity are treated as a variable in a secondary higher education dataset, and highlight how the conflation of both can influence how a sample is taken. We argue that it is imperative that theoretical frameworks used in research are not only applied to the research questions, analysis or interpretation, but also the secondary datasets being used.

What style of leadership is best suited to direct organizational change to fuel institutional diversity in higher education?	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Diversity; organizational; leadership; style; higher education	RACE; STRATEGIES; WOMEN	Implementing diversity agendas within decentralized, loosely coupled, and change-resistant institutions such as colleges and universities is a global challenge. A shift in the organizational climate and culture is imperative to produce the change needed in order for a diversity agenda to thrive. Higher education scholars have consistently identified leadership styles as being among the chief contributing factors to successful institutional change, especially as it relates to diversity agenda efforts. This chapter first reviews the literature on forms of diversity agenda, paradigms of change and leadership style and then synthesizes results from 10 cases on proven strategies and offers implications on how different leadership styles can be applied to fuel institutional diversity efforts.

J	Law, I				Law, Ian			Building the Anti-racist University, action and new agendas	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education; universities; racism; antiracism; de-racialisation; de-colonisation		This article reviews two decades of work carried out at the Centre for Ethnicity and Racism Studies, University of Leeds in the area of racism and higher education. It introduces key issues and themes in this field and also identifies a seven-point agenda for action. This article provides an overview and agenda-setting account of the theoretical and policy innovations developed by this research team, which provide a contextual background for this volume as a whole. Historical recognition of the role of universities as key sites for the production of racialised knowledge across a range of intellectual fields is an essential starting point. We urge promotion of fundamental de-racialisation and de-colonisation of the academy. This cannot be achieved by self-regulation by the sector or by the setting of minimum legal requirements, it requires strong political, institutional and intellectual leadership, alliance-building and mobilisation.

J	Lustick, H				Lustick, Hilary			Making discipline relevant: toward a theory of culturally responsive positive schoolwide discipline	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Culturally relevant education; positive behavioral interventions; restorative justice; suspension; restorative discipline; school discipline	AFRICAN-AMERICAN; BEHAVIOR; SUPPORT; EDUCATION; TRUST; GAP	Implicit in the discourse on school discipline reform is the belief that utilizing positive school discipline practices, as opposed to suspension and classroom removal, will necessarily reduce the racially disproportionate representation of black and brown students in school discipline outcomes. Yet even in schools that utilize positive school discipline approaches, racial disproportionality persists; students of color continue to be disciplined more often and more harshly than their white peers, even when controlling for gender, socioeconomic status, and behavior. Framed by Vavrus and Cole's concept of the socioculturally contextualized disciplinary moment, this article argues for an approach to positive discipline that incorporates the tenets of culturally relevant education. Implications for policy, research, and practice are discussed.

J	Martinez, RA				Martinez, Ramon Antonio			<bold>"</bold>Are you gonna show this to white people?': Chicana/o and Latina/o students' counter-narratives on race, place, and representation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Counter-storytelling; Chicana; o youth; Latina; o youth; counter-narratives; representation; critical race theory	SPANGLISH; LITERACY	This article explores the recurring narratives on race, place and representation that emerged in the talk of Chicana/o and Latina/o sixth-graders at a middle school in East Los Angeles, California. Discourse analytic methods are used to closely examine how these narratives were constructed within the contexts of everyday classroom interactions. Drawing on the notion of counter-storytelling from critical race theory, the article highlights how these sixth-grade students articulated counter-narratives about who they were and what their community was like - often in direct opposition to what they perceived as white people's stereotypical assumptions and misperceptions. It is argued that these narratives constitute a powerful and sophisticated critique of dominant narratives that frame working-class Chicana/o and Latina/o students in racist and pejorative terms. The article ends with a discussion of implications for understanding youth agency and the politics of representation.

J	Araujo, M				Araujo, Marta			A very 'prudent integration': white flight, school segregation and the depoliticization of (anti-)racism	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						institutional racism; the politics of integration; white flight; school segregation; Roma; Gypsies	GYPSIES	This article explores the contemporary legitimation of institutional racism resulting from the prevailing depoliticized framework of integration, which became prominent in the 1960s and is now hegemonic in political and academic debate in Europe. Integration has helped shift the focus to the supposed cultural inadequacies of ethnically marked populations, who ought to show a willingness to pursue the modern dream; simultaneously, it has invisibilized institutional racism and made an anti-racist repertoire unavailable. This argument is illustrated through a case of white flight and school segregation in a rural area in Portugal, revealing both the enduring racism against the Roma/Gypsies - suppressed and repressed throughout the last five centuries in Europe - and its depoliticization within the normal working of institutions. It draws on qualitative research with representatives from public bodies and mediating agents (e.g. teachers and social workers), as well as on analysis of the official reports by the Portuguese state and European institutions.

J	Chadderton, C				Chadderton, Charlotte			The militarisation of English schools: Troops to Teaching and the implications for Initial Teacher Education and race equality	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						militarisation of education; surveillance in schooling; ITE; social inequality; white supremacy	WHITENESS; WORLD; IM	This article considers the implications of the Troops to Teaching (TtT) programme, to be introduced in England in autumn 2013, for Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and race equality. TtT will fast-track ex-armed service members to teach in schools, without necessarily the requirement of a university degree. Employing theories of white supremacy, and Althusser's (1971) concept of Ideological and Repressive State Apparatus, I argue that this initiative both stems from, and contributes to, a system of social privilege and oppression in education. Despite appearing to be aimed at all young people, the planned TtT initiative is actually aimed at poor and racially subordinated youth. This is likely to further entrench polarisation in a system which already provides two tier educational provision: TtT will be a programme for the inner-city disadvantaged, whilst wealthier, whiter schools will mostly continue to get highly qualified teachers. Moreover, TtT contributes to a wider devaluing of current ITE; ITE itself is rendered virtually irrelevant, as it seems TtT teachers will not be subject specialists, rather will be expected to provide military-style discipline, the skills for which they will be expected to bring with them. More sinister, I argue that TtT is part of the wider militarisation of education. This military-industrial-education complex seeks to contain and police young people who are marginalised along lines of race and class, and contributes to a wider move to increase ideological support for foreign wars - both aims ultimately in the service of neoliberal objectives which will feed social inequalities.

J	Flintoff, A				Flintoff, A.			Tales from the playing field: black and minority ethnic students' experiences of physical education teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Review						narrative; intersectionality; 'race' gender; physical education teacher education	INTERSECTIONALITY; RACISM; SPORT; RACE; CULTURE; ISSUES; BOYS	This article presents findings from recent research exploring black and minority ethnic (BME) students' experiences of Physical Education teacher education (PETE) in England (Flintoff, 2008). Despite policy initiatives to increase the ethnic diversity of teacher education cohorts, BME students are under-represented in PETE, making up just 2.94% of the 2007/8 national cohort, the year in which this research was conducted. Drawing on in-depth interviews and questionnaires with 25 BME students in PETE, the study sought to contribute to our limited knowledge and understanding of racial and ethnic difference in PE, and to show how 'race,' ethnicity and gender are interwoven in individuals' embodied, everyday experiences of learning how to teach. In the article, two narratives in the form of fictional stories are used to present the findings. I suggest that narratives can be useful for engaging with the experiences of those previously silenced or ignored within Physical Education (PE); they are also designed to provoke an emotional as well as an intellectual response in the reader. Given that teacher education is a place where we should be engaging students, emotionally and politically, to think deeply about teaching, education and social justice and their place within these, I suggest that such stories of difference might have a useful place within a critical PETE pedagogy.

Using postcolonial and psychoanalytic resources the article follows enduring manifestations of race as racism surfaces and is mobilized through global shifts of people, ideas and capital. The article argues that as national borders become destabilized under globalization, existing significations of race and racism give way to reattach to migrating, vulnerable and displaced bodies. The article argues that teachers and educators in multicultural nations can begin to follow and intervene in race moves by collectively thinking through narrative histories of migration that structure national belonging and non-belonging and our relationships to each other at home and in the world.

J	Reid, C; Collins, J				Reid, Carol; Collins, Jock			'No-one ever asked me': the invisible experiences and contribution of Australian emigrant teachers	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						emigrant teachers; reconversion theory; ethnicity; education policy; circular migration	SCHOOLS	Teachers possess qualifications and experience that opens the door to professional migration. It is common when considering the diversity or otherwise of the teaching profession to treat the dominant group of teachers in terms of ethnicity as the other side of a simplistic binary. That is, the immigrant or minority background teacher versus the culturally homogenous mainstream teacher. There is little research that examines the experiences and contributions of teachers from the dominant group who have themselves been emigrant teachers. In this article the results of a nationally funded research partnership across three states in Australia examines issues that face many globally mobile teachers. These include negotiating the qualification process and the acquiring of appropriate immigration permits, their experience in classrooms, the reasons that they wanted to teach overseas and their overall evaluation of the experience. The article first looks at the methodology and characteristics of the sample before exploring the emigrant teachers experience from leaving Australia to getting to teach in classrooms abroad, and, in most cases, finally returning to Australia. These experiences are then analysed using Bourdieu's (1984) theory of reconversion to reflect on the comparative similarities and differences between minority and/or immigrant and emigrant teachers in Australia.

J	Nguyen, HT				Huong Tran Nguyen			What role do race, ethnicity, language and gender play in the teaching profession?	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Vietnamese American; Asian American; teachers; critical race theory; standard language ideology; social context of teaching		Critical race theory and standard language ideology are employed as theoretical and analytical frames for conceptualizing and understanding the entry perspectives and experiences of some Vietnamese American pre-service teachers in US schools. Study findings from a qualitative case study approach suggest that race, ethnicity, language, and gender influence these teachers' construction of self vis-a-vis others and their social milieu. Specifically, manifestations of these social constructs inform the ways in which others perceive them and measure their potential for success as future teachers. The heritage backgrounds and practicum accounts of these Vietnamese American women help to illuminate their individual and collective struggles and the mechanisms they each adopted in coping with their particular cases in the local school context.

Race discourse and the US Confederate Flag	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; discourse; construction of whiteness; US Confederate Flag	RACIAL-ATTITUDES; STATE FLAG; IDENTITY; SUPPORT; REGION	Research reveals that racial hierarchies and 'color-blind' racism is maintained through discourse. The current study utilizes exploratory data from focus groups in a predominantly white southern university in the United States to examine race talk, the Confederate Flag, and the construction of southern white identity. Drawing from critical discourse analysis, we answer the following questions: first, to what extent do discursive strategies surrounding the Confederate Flag reflect more subtle forms of racism? Second, what does discourse surrounding use of the Confederate Flag reveal about the construction of southern white identity? Findings reveal that whiteness remains largely an 'unmarked' category as demonstrated via discursive strategies (downplaying and defensive diversions versus race competence). Educators, especially in the American south, may benefit from examinations of controversies over the US Confederate Flag in order to challenge racism in the classroom.

Aspiring and practicing leaders addressing issues of diversity and social justice	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						diversity; leadership preparation; racism; social justice	SPECIAL-EDUCATION; REPRESENTATION; INEQUALITY; STUDENTS	For the most part, faculty preparing teachers and leaders for tomorrow's schools would agree that educators, regardless of their role, need to be sensitive to the diverse cultures represented in our schools. Leaders need to be sensitive to and understanding of different cultures, while working to ensure the success of all students regardless of race, national origin, sex, disability. The movie Crash (2004) was used as a critical reflection instructional tool for aspiring and current leaders to focus on diversity and social justice issues dealing with race, gender, and diverse ethnic cultures. Self-reflections of graduate students are shared as they grappled with their beliefs, experiences, and stereotypes. This paper focuses on the themes of self-reflective leadership, privilege and power, voluntary or self-segregation, student expectations, and stereotypes and discusses the implications for Educational Leadership programs.

J	Tsolidis, G; Kostogriz, A				Tsolidis, Georgina; Kostogriz, Alex			'After hours' schools as core to the spatial politics of 'in-betweenness'	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						diaspora; community schooling; spatiality		In this article the authors draw on a larger study in which their overall concern is to illustrate how diasporic identifications develop through a range of scales related to self, family, community, nation and beyond. They consider the Melbourne Greek community as an exemplar of diasporic experience and use it as a case study for their investigation, which is aimed at exploring how transcultural literacies relate to spaces which complicate and enrich identifications. In this article they consider the role of 'after hours' schools in the shaping of diasporic identities. These are community-based schools where Greek language and culture is taught. Commonly, classes are held on Saturday morning or in the evenings during the week. Such schools operate in classrooms that are rented from 'real' schools. By existing in spaces that are commonly occupied by mainstream day schools, students who attend 'after hours' schools experience a form of marginalisation that is also a right of passage. Here the authors argue that such 'in-between' spaces assist with the formation of 'in-between' identities that are emblematic of globalization.

Racism camouflaged as impostorism and the impact on black STEM doctoral students	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racism; STEM culture; structural racism; Black doctoral students; impostor syndrome engineering; computing; impostor phenomenon	STEREOTYPE THREAT; MENTAL-HEALTH; AM I; STRESS; GENDER; RACE; DISCRIMINATION; ATTRIBUTIONS; EXPERIENCES; EDUCATION	Black doctoral students in engineering and computing fields experience racialized stress, as structural racism in STEM takes a toll on their sense of belonging and acceptance as intellectually competent in comparison to White and some Asian peers and faculty. Black doctoral students are often told by campus administrators that the source of this racialized stress is impostorism and it is curable. In this article, we employ phenomenological analysis to examine how 54 Black engineering and computing students experience racism marketed as impostor syndrome (syndrome meaning in their heads). Results show that 51 of our study participants understood their experiences as both impostorism and racism, as some realized that racism created the conditions for being racially positioned as an impostor. We problematize impostorism peddled by campus administrators as a cover for racism, once again placing onus on students and claiming they have irrational but curable behaviors, while institutional and individual racism in STEM runs rampant by design.

J	Morales-Doyle, D; Gutstein, E				Morales-Doyle, Daniel; Gutstein, Eric Rico			Racial capitalism and STEM education in Chicago Public Schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racism; capitalism; mathematics; science; STEM; neoliberalism; education	MATHEMATICS	This article analyzes the role of STEM initiatives designed by city and corporate elites in a large urban district and outlines an alternative, grassroots vision for (STEM) education and city schools. Within a neoliberal context of gentrification, displacement, disinvestment, and privatization, STEM schools have become strategic components of Chicago's 'portfolio district' that serve the interests of racial capitalism in three ways. First, STEM schools provide a claim to fairness in the midst of racist school closures. Second, STEM high schools are a corporate strategy for racially stratified labor force preparation that restricts curriculum and reifies tracking. Third, curriculum restriction prioritizes corporate interests over students' capacity to shape their communities and the world. The authors draw on the wisdom of Chicago communities who have led resistance against corporate education reform to critique Chicago STEM policy and point to critical mathematics and science education as part of a model for sustainable community schools.

J	Vakil, S; de Royston, MM				Vakil, Sepehr; de Royston, Maxine McKinney			Exploring Politicized Trust in a Racially Diverse Computer Science Classroom	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Computer science; relationships; solidarity; race	DISCUSSIONS; STANDARDS; EDUCATION; EQUITY; POWER; RACE	Over the past decade, abroad range of policymakers, corporations, educators, and scholars in the United States have catapulted computer science (CS) education from the sidelines to the center of K-12 public education discourse. While calls for CS education are often framed in terms of national and economic competitiveness, there is a growing interest amongst equity scholars in curricular interventions that directly engage the ethical and sociopolitical issues surrounding CS and its role in society. Yet, less attention has been given to how sociocultural dynamics of classrooms play a mediating role in these spaces. Drawing on video data from an equity-oriented CS classroom, we argue aconflict that arose during design activities was rooted in alack of trust and solidarity between students. Ultimately, we make the case that in addition to curricular innovations, equity efforts in CS education must prioritize the cultivation of positive student relationships.

The field of special education negates the overrepresentation of minority students: a DisCrit analysis	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Race; disability; special education; overrepresentation; research	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; LEARNING-DISABILITY; DISCURSIVE PRACTICE; DISPROPORTIONALITY; RACIALIZATION; IDEOLOGY; AMERICAN; EQUITY; COLOR; US	In this article we challenge recent research within the field of special education reports an underrepresentation of all minorities in disability categories. First, we contrast these findings with selections from a large body of diverse and innovative work by scholars of overrepresentation, while recognizing the dearth of use of findings in these studies. Second, we illustrate a field of special education that has been epistemologically divided from its inception, and discuss repercussions of this schism for researching overrepresentation. Third, we call attention to color evasion within the field of special education, and to counter this, invoke Disability Critical Race Studies (DisCrit) to critique and rethink how overrepresentation can be conceptualized and researched. Fourth, we discuss some challenging issues raised by our critique. Suggestions for future research on overrepresentation are shared.

J	Ye, W; Edwards, V				Ye, Wei; Edwards, Viv			Confucius institute teachers in the UK: motivation, challenges, and transformative learning	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Confucius institutes; Chinese teaching; motivation; intercultural adjustment; teacher beliefs; transformative learning	SPECIAL-EDUCATION; INCLUSIVE EDUCATION; REGULAR CLASSROOM; LANGUAGE; ABROAD; CHINA; ADJUSTMENT; CULTURE; REFLECTIONS; EXPERIENCE	Academic mobility has attracted much attention in recent educational research. Previous studies focus mainly on study abroad students; relatively little attention, however, has been paid to the growing numbers of teachers of Chinese as a second language working abroad in Confucius Institutes, non-profit public institutions that aim to promote Chinese language and culture, currently operating in some 500 Confucius Institutes and 1000 Confucius classrooms (local hubs in schools) in 134 countries. This paper explores the intercultural experience of a cohort of Confucius Institute Chinese Teachers working in the UK. Drawing on focus group discussions and interviews, it examines the factors associated with their motivation and the adjustments they make professionally and personally and the transformational power of intercultural experiences on teacher development. Finally, it offers suggestions for possible improvements in future international exchange programs.

J	Guenther, J; Osborne, S; Arnott, A; McRae-Williams, E				Guenther, John; Osborne, Sam; Arnott, Allan; McRae-Williams, Eva			Hearing the voice of remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander training stakeholders using research methodologies and theoretical frames of reference	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Remote Australia; methodologies; intercultural approaches; Critical Race Theory (CRT)	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; JUSTICE	Researchers in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander contexts within Australia are frequently faced with the challenges of working in an intercultural space where channels of communication are garbled with interference created by the complexities of misunderstood worldviews, languages, values and expectations. A concern of many researchers in these contexts is to ensure that the voices of research participants in remote communities are not only accurately represented, but are allowed to transcend the noise of dominant paradigms, policies and practices. This article brings together the experiences of four non-indigenous researchers in the space of remote vocational education and training. The authors present two vignettes from research in the context of health, employment and education. These vignettes highlight some of the conundrums for researchers as they attempt to harmonize the aims of research with the expectations of organizations involved. The purpose of the article is to explore the utility of Critical Race Theory (CRT), Indigenist methodologies, culturally responsive methodologies and those positioned at the cultural interface' (Nakata 2007). In so doing this article makes some assessments about the fit of CRT methodologies for such contexts.

In seeking to interrogate the ways in which racism roosts in the routine, this article interrogates quotidian responses to children's playful activity, drawing on data generated in an ethnographic study in a London-based nursery. The article argues that the imaginative characters players embody become fixed' on particular children - when these characters coincide with reified assumptions about the raced, classed, and gendered body - whilst serving as mobile resources for others. Such reification, which is a concentration of complex historic and contemporary social relations in the political economy, is not only harmful and unjust but limits understandings of racialisation and inequity.

J	Cashman, L				Cashman, Laura			New label no progress: institutional racism and the persistent segregation of Romani students in the Czech Republic	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Czech Republic; critical race theory (CRT); Roma; segregation; special educational needs (SEN)	SCHOOL-DESEGREGATION; EDUCATION; EUROPE; RACE; POLICIES	The over-representation of Romani children in special schools in the Czech Republic is well documented and widely condemned. In 2007 the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found the state guilty of discrimination against Romani children on the basis of disproportionate placement of children in remedial special schools. In 2015 high numbers of Romani children are still being misdiagnosed with special educational needs (SEN) and offered a limited and inappropriate education. This article explores the challenges which continue to hamper their successful inclusion in the Czech education system. Using critical race theory (CRT) as a lens to examine the Czech case, problems with the current policy trajectory are identified. The article shows that institutional racism persists in the Czech Republic, shaping attitudes and practices at all levels. Policymakers demonstrate little recognition of ingrained educational inequalities and Roma continue to be widely perceived as others' who must learn to adapt to Czech ways rather than as citizens who are entitled to services on their own terms.

Islamic schools in the Netherlands after an era of turmoil	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Islamic schools; the Netherlands; Muslims; primary education	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS	The Netherlands currently has 43 Islamic primary schools. Each is fully subsidised by the government. Yet since the first school was established in 1988 Islamic schools have been confronted with obstacles by the Ministry of Education, bad press and increasingly strict state supervision. Under pressure to improve their image, since 2008 Dutch Islamic primary schools have turned their attention away from expanding their numbers and instead focussed on improving school quality. In this article we describe the various developments and draw upon large scale empirical research to demonstrate the present state of affairs both in terms of cognitive and non-cognitive pupil achievements. We argue that the present results offer reasons to be cautiously optimistic.

J	Isik-Ercan, Z				Isik-Ercan, Zeynep			Being Muslim and American: Turkish-American children negotiating their religious identities in school settings	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Turkish immigrants; Muslim students; religious diversity; identity; the education of immigrants	TEACHERS; STUDENTS; GIRLS; ISLAMOPHOBIA; PERFORMANCE; EXPERIENCES; HYBRIDITY; WORKING; ISSUES; SPACE	Religious diversity in schools is a growing interest among educational researchers. This qualitative case study examines how 15 Turkish-Muslim children in elementary and middle school negotiated their religious identities as they responded to various experiences in American schools and in their communities. Unlike some earlier studies that highlighted cultural conflict as a theme in Muslim adolescents' relationship with schools in the United States, this study is based on a framework that illustrates the voices and agency of young children, and utilizes data from interviews, participant observations and cultural artifacts. Findings demonstrate the ways parents and children mediated challenges their religious identity posed by choosing strategies that made their religious identities invisible, or by finding innovative ways to negotiate their identity and religious practices. Children who participated in the study did not view American identities in conflict with their Muslim identities. Learning about the experiences of immigrant parents and children may provide teachers with insight for creating educational experiences that are responsive to the needs of these communities. This knowledge base can also assist teachers in better responding to biases about Muslims, which might negatively influence children's identity construction and academic and social achievement.

J	Philip, TM				Philip, Thomas M.			Asian American as a political-racial identity: implications for teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher education; Asian American; race; urban schools; social justice	GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS; KOREAN-AMERICANS; RACE; SCHOOLS; CHINESE; URBAN; COLOR	In this article, I consider the emergence of the term Asian American as a political and racial identifier in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s and survey the meanings that are associated with the term today. Through the analysis of in-depth interviews, I examine how Asian American prospective teachers, who were enrolled in a master's and credential program that had an explicit focus on social justice and on teaching in urban communities of color, appropriated and challenged these multiple meanings. The interview data highlight the relationship between these teachers' understandings of their racial identity and the responsibilities and challenges they anticipated for themselves as Asian American teachers of other students of color. I conclude the article by exploring the implications of these findings for teacher education programs, particularly programs that enroll high proportions of Asian Americans.

We then apply the C-D-R cycle lens to the evolution of federal race-conscious affirmative action legal cases in higher education and state anti-affirmative action policies that have emerged since the implementation of Civil Rights Act of 1964, and how these legal cases and policies are emblematic of the convergence, divergence, or reclamation periods. We also explore the incessant legal and political debate regarding race-conscious admissions policies.	[Dorsey, Dana N.

J	Lachuk, ASJ; Mosley, M				Lachuk, Amy S. Johnson; Mosley, Melissa			Us & Them? Entering a three-dimensional narrative inquiry space with white pre-service teachers to explore race, racism, and anti-racism	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						narrative; pre-service teachers; teacher educators; race	LITERACY; EDUCATION; PERSPECTIVES; SELF	In this article, two white teacher educators illustrate entering into a three-dimensional narrative space with a white pre-service teacher. The authors explore how their histories have led them to practice teacher education pedagogies that are rooted in ideas of social justice and critical race theory. In order to support the goals and aims of social justice and critical race teaching, teacher educators must be willing to be 'part of the parade' of teacher education with pre-service teachers, sharing their stories of racialized experiences alongside the stories of white pre-service teachers. As a result of entering a three-dimensional narrative space with white pre-service teachers, the authors encourage teacher educators to become more cognizant of their roles in shaping pre-service teachers' understandings of race and racism. To do so, teacher educators must assume a narrative inquiry stance in their teaching.	[Lachuk, Amy S.

J	Stromquist, NP				Stromquist, Nelly P.			The educational experience of Hispanic immigrants in the United States: integration through marginalization	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Hispanic immigrant students; English as a second language; undocumented immigrants		This article calls attention to the educational situation of Latino immigrants in the United States. Through an extensive review of the literature, it examines the nature of contemporary Hispanic immigration and the school response to the linguistic and cultural attributes of the students - particularly those of Mexican origin, who represent the largest proportion of students whose parents are immigrants. Although the US education system seeks the incorporation of immigrant students into American society through the provision of specialized English language programs, the evidence indicates that often these programs produce an educational experience characterized by limited access to academic courses, labeling by peers and teachers, and reduced chances of access to higher education.

The authors draw upon critical race theory as a lens and employ critical discourse analysis to uncover classed and raced biases within and across three early childhood contexts. While the cases are situated in specific public school settings - a parent teacher association (PTA) fundraiser, a mandated literacy program, and a read-aloud - they shed light onto a variety of contexts as these are all common phenomena in many American elementary schools. Together, the cases illustrate how racism has been normalized through familiar practices in early childhood settings. Through description and reflection, the authors suggest ways to start seeing the strange in the familiar, unpacking racialized practices across three settings, and advocating new ways of thinking about these common practices leading to change and transformation.

J	Hattam, R; Every, D				Hattam, Robert; Every, Danielle			Teaching in fractured classrooms: refugee education, public culture, community and ethics	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						refugee; community; schooling; ethico-politics		During the last decade or so, schooling policy has had to increasingly grapple with processes that have a global reach. One significant aspect of globalisation has been the global flows of asylum seekers and refugees. Although Australia has a long history of accepting asylum seekers and refugees, in recent times, concerns about national security have fuelled community disquiet about refugees and asylum seekers. As such the 'refugee problem' is a crucial site for research by those interested in the relationships between a vibrant and socially just society and educational policy and practice. This paper draws on Rose's genealogy of 'community' (that is community now a site for governmentality); and Bauman's meditation on 'elusive community' (how can we have both freedom and security?) as a means to think through an appropriate ethico-politics for educators grappling with the refugee problem in Australia.

J	Bhopal, K				Bhopal, Kalwant			Identity, empathy and 'otherness': Asian women, education and dowries in the UK	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asian women; dowries; education; empowerment; Black feminism		This article will examine Asian women's views on the practice of dowries in the UK. The research is based on 20 in-depth interviews with Asian women studying for a Social Sciences degree in a 'new' (post-1992) university in the southeast of England. All of the interviews were tape-recorded and the data transcribed. The data was analysed using methods of grounded theory as discussed by Strauss and Corbin and developed by Charmaz. I sought to develop a Black feminist standpoint from which to conduct research with Asian women. This was based upon a notion of 'shared identity' and a 'shared empathy' with respondents. Revealing personal details about my own life sought to minimise power differentials in the research process. The research reveals that Asian women's entry into higher education has an impact on how they see the practice of dowries in the UK. Many of the women indicated that higher education was used as a source of empowerment for them, which gave them greater choice within the family regarding the practice of marriage and dowries. Within this context, the research reveals that Asian women's identities are shifting and incorporating new modes of being. The research also demonstrates that a Black feminist standpoint is a useful way forward in understanding the lives of women who continue to be silenced and 'othered'.

J	Wane, NN				Wane, Njoki Nathani			Black Canadian feminist thought: perspectives on equity and diversity in the academy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black; feminism; healing; strategies; success; academy; self-reliant; self-determination; spiritual; education		This paper is based on on-going research on feminist theorizing among women of African ancestry in Canada. The women's residency in Canada ranges from those who were born here to those who migrated in the last five years. The paper highlights stories of 16 women's experiences in the academy and concentrates mainly on their stories of agency, resiliency, survival skills and healing strategies as they navigate through the halls of academe. Their measure of success was on how self-reliant they were; how well they connected with Black communities; how well they were grounded in terms of their spiritual practices; and how successful they were in challenging the status quo. These women were acutely aware of the Black woman super-strength stereotype. However, they did not fall prey to misguided societal notions of Black women's resiliency. Most women emphasized education as one of the transformative tools within their communities and many felt that it was one of the vehicles through which they could dismantle and transform the social and political barriers for Black people. What emerges from the reflections of these women is a realization of the importance of engaging in analyses of success, rather than focusing on experiences of injustice.

J	Houser, NO				Houser, Neil O.			Cultural plunge: a critical approach for multicultural development in teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						multicultural development; teacher education		This report utilizes a qualitative methodology to investigate an educational approach designed to promote critical consciousness and multicultural understanding among undergraduate and graduate students in teacher education. The approach, referred to as a 'cultural plunge', involves intense exposure to social and cultural settings in which the students' norms are clearly in the minority. Initial encounters were followed by personal reflection and subsequent small-group and whole-class analyses. The findings revealed courage in the face of fear, social criticism and critical reflection, and identification with and empathy for others. The evidence suggests that the approach may indeed provide opportunities for critical growth and multicultural development. However, there are also potential liabilities related to use of the cultural plunge as an educational approach, including the possibility of reducing the 'other'. Strengths and limitations are examined in detail, and implications are discussed for theory and practice in teacher education.

J	Riviere, D				Riviere, Dominique			Whiteness in/and education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; multicultural education; drama education	PEDAGOGY	This article discusses my interactions with the teacher in whose classroom I conducted my doctoral research. That project was concerned with using transformative Drama pedagogy to reconceptualise cultural identity in multicultural curricular policy. The participants in my study comprised of 15 Grade Nine Drama students and their teacher at 'May Valley High School', located just outside of Toronto, Canada. During the Fall semester of the 2004-2005 academic year, I observed the students' performances (both in and out of dramatic role) of their gender, sexuality, racial and ethnic identities. Using a performative lens to analyse the connections between their 'fictional' identity performances, and their 'actual' ones, I showed how, in this particular classroom, those connections often served to reinforce rather than challenge hegemonic constructions of social identity and identification. I suspected that this had much to do with their teacher's pedagogical orientations and practices, with respect to multiculturalism and ethno-cultural difference. In this article, I tease out how the 'Whiteness' embedded in his pedagogy served to perpetuate institutional racism at the school.

J	Camangian, P; Cariaga, S				Camangian, Patrick; Cariaga, Stephanie			Social and emotional learning is hegemonic miseducation: students deserve humanization instead	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Social and emotional learning; critical pedagogy; culturally relevant pedagogy		The ahistorical objectives of social and emotional learning fall short of repairing the cultural contempt of hegemonic miseducation and does not address the primary social forces negatively impacting the health and wellness of communities of color - their colonial relationship with inequitable social systems. In this article, we posit humanization in place of social and emotional learning because SEL's inadequate analysis of intersecting oppressions justifies existing power relations in communities and schools. In essence, this article examines the pedagogy and psychology of humanization as a viable framework to confront systemically imposed self-hate, divide and conquer, and suboppression if it teaches students knowledge (and love) of self, solidarity, and self-determination.

'We still here': Black mothers' personal narratives of sense making and resisting antiblackness and the suspensions of their Black children	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						School discipline; black parents; historical trauma; antiblackness	EDUCATION; FRAMEWORK; PARENTS	While research has called attention to the phenomena of a link between school and prison for many Black students in the United States, there has been much less examination of the direct impact to Black families, in this case Black mothers. This paper seeks to center the stories of Black mothers to provide a specific type of sense making around Black children and school suspensions that often goes unheard in educational research and the broader terrains of schooling and society at-large. Through the experiences of five Black mothers, this paper sheds light on the overwhelming stress and trauma that comes from being a Black parent in an education system that is implicitly, and in some cases explicitly, pushing Black children out. The authors' analysis of these experiences unearths the ways in which school discipline constructs, particularly out-of-school suspension, reproduce historical trauma as well as illustrate the ways that these Black mothers resist antiblackness and the suspension of their Black children.

The research questions are (1) What are the features of classrooms that support culturally sustaining learning for young children? (2) What social, cultural, and linguistic resources do learners draw upon when engaging in culturally sustaining spaces? Findings in this paper indicate that (a) children need critical safe spaces to foster CSP (b) children draw knowledge from varied resources and (c) teachers' must be able to navigate policies to implement practices that utilize students' cultural referents.

The data are ethnographic, drawing on one year of participant observation and interviews at two elementary schools. The findings are also set within the context of an analysis of data from the New Immigrant Survey. The article identifies mechanisms by which relationships between black African immigrants and schools are created and argues that intersections between demographics and school culture are central, particularly as related to the possibilities for relational power, which can allow parents and school staff to transcend persistent inequalities of race and discrimination.

J	Martin, S; Horgan, D; O'Riordan, J; Christie, A				Martin, Shirley; Horgan, Deirdre; O'Riordan, Jacqui; Christie, Alastair			Advocacy and surveillance: primary schools teachers' relationships with asylum-seeking mothers in Ireland	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asylum seekers; education; mothers; Ireland	BARRIERS	The article analyses the findings of a small-scale qualitative study in Ireland that examines interactions between asylum-seeking mothers and primary school teachers, and highlights the significance of teachers' understandings of asylum in shaping home-school communications. Mothers and children in this study were living in Direct Provision, collective accommodation for asylum seekers in Ireland. The research identifies a number of concerns including: poor communication between the school and mothers, only English being used as a medium of communication with the mothers, and mothers being directly and indirectly excluded from Parent Associations. Interactions of teachers with asylum-seeker mothers demonstrated a lack of recognition that their situation is different from other migrants/newcomers and is particularly challenging because of the because of living in Direct Provision and under the threat of deportation. The research shows that primary schools are drawn into ambiguous relationships with asylum-seeking mothers in their attempts at advocacy and surveillance, as they are expected to facilitate integration, while at the same time dealing with the uncertainty facing asylum-seeking parents and children.

It locates such narratives within the historical 'concealment and invisibilisation of race and racism' that have characterised Italy particularly since the end of the Second World War, while showing how they legitimate contemporary processes of disablement and over-representation of forced migrant children in the category of Special Educational Needs. A theoretical framework influenced by Dis/ability Critical Race Studies, Italian postcolonial studies, and Judith Butler's notions of subjectivation and performative politics is used to discuss how a 'colour-evasive' racial ideology has seeped into various institutions in Italian society, and importantly into education policies and practices.

We capture the insights that emerged from our self-study through a close reading of dominant neoliberal educational reform discourses, particularly through an examination of the writings of Michelle Rhee and Wendy Kopp. Along three dimensions of: (1) experience as teachers; (2) solidarity with teachers; and (3) analyses of racism in schooling, we characterize prominent discourses through which educators, researchers, and the public describe teachers and teaching. We name these discursive frames to make explicit the assumptions that are embedded in each and the intentional or inadvertent consequences of each. Finally, we propose a teacher solidarity lens through which we strive to approach our research and work with teachers.

Five major themes emerged from students' dialogues that pose several questions about what sort of racist atmosphere the members of this community are being exposed to on a daily basis. The findings of this study underscore an understanding of Aboriginal student resiliency within a school setting that employs successful school initiatives that aim to promote student success. Further inquiry into these findings is needed.

J	Sung, KK				Sung, Kenzo K.			'Hella ghetto!': (dis)locating race and class consciousness in youth discourses of ghetto spaces, subjects and schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Review						dislocated consciousness; critical social theory; race theory; ghetto; urban education; double consciousness; hegemony	SEGMENTED ASSIMILATION; EDUCATION; POVERTY; WHITENESS; STUDENT; SHAPE; WORK	Based on analysis of interviews conducted during 2008-2009 in Oakland, California, this article examines how narratives of inner-city youth reinforce and destabilize mainstream conceptions of 'ghetto.' The article demonstrates that inner-city youth discourses regarding 'ghetto' spaces, subjects and schools often exemplify a consciousness informed by both counter-hegemonic insights and internalized psychological trauma. In other words, the interviewed youth reconstitute the term 'ghetto' to signify structural and cultural processes of dislocation occurring in their neighborhood through narratives characterized by contradiction. This finding is significant because it questions how to analyze non-white narratives and offers 'dislocated consciousness' as an interpretive lens grounded in the contradictions of subaltern consciousness theorized by W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon and Antonio Gramsci. By developing the concept of 'dislocation' to illuminate how such youth negotiate, resist and internalize the material and ideological structures that condition their existence, this study contributes to the existing literature on race and class consciousness of urban youth. The article concludes by exploring how strategies urban youth utilize to come to terms with their lives can provide new understandings of urban communities and schooling.

J	Ghaffar-Kucher, A				Ghaffar-Kucher, Ameena			'Narrow-minded and oppressive' or a 'superior culture'? Implications of divergent representations of Islam for Pakistani-American youth	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						youth; immigrants; Pakistani-Americans; Muslim; cultural citizenship; 9/11	CITIZENSHIP	Drawing on ethnographic data, this article examines the complex terrain that working-class Pakistani-American youth must negotiate in their daily lives. Specifically, the article illustrates how particular views of Islam and Americanization manifest in particular sites and within educational discourses, and the resulting dissonance that youth experience. On the one hand, schools view Islam as oppressive, problematic and a hindrance to the youths' academic and professional success. On the other hand, families present Islam as a type of cultural capital that can guide youth and help them navigate their lives by being a 'good Muslim.' The result of these fossilized views of culture and nationality is the production of an 'imagined nostalgia': One group longs for a world where assimilation into the dominant group is expected and accepted; the other longs for the homeland, which they try to recreate in their new home. Thus, in their own ways, both schools and communities send the message that being Muslim and being American is not compatible. Consequently, rather than view being Muslim and American in an additive way, youth believe that they can only be one or the other, which often translates into placing themselves outside the realm of American cultural citizenship.

J	Buehler, J				Buehler, Jennifer			'There's a problem, and we've got to face it': how staff members wrestled with race in an urban high school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; school culture; teacher beliefs; discourse analysis; urban schools	WHITENESS; TEACHERS; RACISM	Educators who initiate school reform work often find that attempts to raise student achievement and change school culture are derailed when staff members refuse to address issues of race. At the same time, staff members who collectively resist engaging in discussions of racism and racial inequality may be actively involved in their own individual processes of wrestling with race'. This was the case at an urban high school in the US where staff members were engaged in a reform effort designed to change toxic' school culture. Staff members' collective refusal to examine racial discipline and achievement patterns masked the ways in which individuals struggled privately with a variety of race-based questions, tensions, and dilemmas. In a school where references to race were routinely encoded in forms of everyday talk, staff members positioned students and each other racially, read their colleagues' interactions with students and each other through a racialized lens, and formed social networks around racial ideology. This racial basis of interaction kept race in the forefront of many staff members' minds, even as they outwardly denied that race was a significant issue in the school. My analysis will show that when left unaddressed, educators' private struggles with race contributed to racial tension among staff members and students. On the other hand, when those private struggles were acknowledged, supported, and explored, they could lead to important forms of racial learning and progress on school reform.

J	Perumal, JC				Perumal, Juliet Christine			Pedagogy of refuge: education in a time of dispossession	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						refugee teachers; teacher identity; teacher as guest and host; hospitality and post colonial and post structural theories	SCHOOLS	Despite its chequered history in relation to human rights issues, South Africa has been playing host to peoples displaced and dispossessed by geographies of anger and war, poverty, economic meltdown and other human rights atrocities. Perceiving South Africa as a sanctuary, there has been a steady wave of immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees coming to the country in search of better personal and professional prospects. Qualified teachers have been among the sizeable cohort of professionals seeking a new home in South Africa. This article reports on qualitative research, which comprised a sample of seven refugee teachers. It provides pen portraits of their bio/geographical pre-flight, flight and settlement experiences as they emerged from individual interview data. The article draws on theoretical insights from postcolonial theory, deconstructionist conceptions of hospitality and critical feminist notions of communities of practice to explore the personal and professional experiences of these teachers who hold part-time employment at a private school. Some of the participants also hold temporary posts at public schools in Johannesburg. Proceeding from the contention that teachers frame their identities in relation to how they feel about themselves politically, professionally, and emotionally the article explores the dialectic of refugee teacher as a guest and a host in classrooms in a foreign country. It argues that notwithstanding the non-negotiable imperative that the rights of refugee children remain high on the national redress educational agenda; of equal importance is the necessity to be cognisant of refugee teachers who are teaching in the South African education system.

J	Jawitz, J				Jawitz, Jeff			Race and assessment practice in South Africa: understanding black academic experience	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						discourse analysis; race; assessment; academic; transformation	HIGHER-EDUCATION	Despite efforts to transform the racialised system of higher education in South Africa inherited from apartheid, there has been little research published that interrogates the relationship between race and the experience of academic staff within the South African higher education environment. Drawing on critical discourse analysis and critical race theory, this article traces the experience of two black male academics in relation to the assessment practices of their colleagues at a historically white university in South Africa. The interviewees, both graduates from the departments in which they teach, reflected on their experience of their departmental assessment practices both as black students and black academics. The analysis concludes that despite their differing perceptions and experiences they both regard the assessment practices of some of their white colleagues as undermining of their black students' efforts to succeed.

J	Li, DG				Li, Daguo			Out of the ivory tower: the impact of wider social contact on the values, religious beliefs and identities of Chinese postgraduate students in the UK	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Chinese students; adaptation; identities; religious beliefs; proselytization	CULTURAL CONTEXTS; UNITED-STATES; CONVERSION; CHRISTIANITY	This article explores the impact of wider social contact on the experience of Chinese postgraduate students of adaptation to life in the UK. Focus group and individual interviews were conducted with a group of 11 Chinese students on an MA programme at a university in southern England and individual interviews with three representatives of a local volunteer group (LVG) offering support to the Chinese students. Although it was perceived that the students' support needs were not adequately met by the University, the additional support offered outside the University was unanimously valued and considered as enriching their cultural and linguistic experiences and meeting their expectations. However, frequent social contact with the LVG, whose members were mostly Christians, also had an impact on their values, religious beliefs and identities. In a discussion framed within the sociological perspective of proselytization or religious conversion and the broad framework of international education and globalization, the different responses to this contact are described in terms of believers, doubters, empathisers and commentators. Implications are considered for universities, people involved in providing social support for international students, and sponsors of international students.

J	Preston, J; Chadderton, C				Preston, John; Chadderton, Charlotte			Rediscovering 'Race Traitor': towards a Critical Race Theory informed public pedagogy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; Critical Race Theory; anarchism; Marxism		This article attempts to politically resituate Ignatiev and Garvey's conception of the 'Race Traitor' within contemporary notions of Critical Race Theory and Public Pedagogy. Race Traitor has been critiqued both by those on the academic and neo-conservative right, who accuse advocates of the project of genocide and misuse of public funds, and has a number of critics on the left who consider that the project is misguided, posturing and self-affirming for guilty whites and politically untenable. There are also post-structuralist critiques of the 'Race Traitor' position, which overstate its focus on embodiment and the post-racial as opposed to its concrete suggestions for resisting racial oppression. In this article we argue that Race Traitor must be situated within the politics of its time, which is within anarchist and Marxist politics, and that this contextualisation enables one to consider Race Traitor as a political form with resonance for contemporary Marxists, Anarchists and in struggles against racial oppression. Ignatiev and Garvey's manifesto, that 'treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity,' still has resonance amongst some anarchist groups both in the UK and North America. 'Race Traitor' has since been propagated through more recent work in Critical Race Theory by writers such as Derek Bell (an early reader of the 'Race Traitor' material), Richard Delgado and Zeus Leonardo, and we argue that Critical Race Theory provides a useful corrective to claims that a white autonomous movement can resist racial oppression. The article concludes by considering how CRT and public pedagogy may produce new political praxis for Race Traitors in the twenty-first century.

In this article, we engage with the literature on culturally relevant teaching that suggests teacher candidates of color are more likely to have some of the characteristics of culturally responsive teachers than are White teacher candidates when they enter teacher preparation programs. By comparing the attitudes of teacher candidates from a majority Hispanic-serving university and a university that serves mostly White and European American students, we question the idea that certain bodies are coterminous with particular ideologies.

J	Shealey, MW				Shealey, Monika Williams			Voices of African-American doctoral students in special education: addressing the shortage in leadership preparation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African Americans; Blacks; doctoral preparation; special education	BLACK; FACULTY; RACE	There is a growing body of literature in examining the experiences of graduate students and faculty of color in education. This paper will provide a review of recent and relevant research on the experiences of graduate students and faculty of color, particularly those attending predominately white institutions (PWIs). Additionally, findings from a recent study of African-American doctoral students in special education will be discussed. Finally, the author will assert the need for future research on the leadership preparation of students of color as well as offer recommendations for program development.

J	Subreenduth, S				Subreenduth, Sharon			Deconstructing the politics of a differently colored transnational identity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						decolonizing; identity; narrative; nationality; race; subject positions; transnational		Using personal narrative as a form of inquiry, this paper analyzes the possibilities of re/claiming epistemological grounds within racialized transnational spaces. Categories of race, nationality, and subject positions influence the legitimacies that are extended, withdrawn and or usurped within such transnational interactions. The paper examines the ways in which these interactions are performed and negotiated through my various identity positions that inevitably mark one in US higher education settings. Specifically it examines how identity, community and Blackness become imagined, redefined and performed in different spaces. Situated within US higher education settings, the paper pays particular attention to how my racialized subject position is interpreted and engaged with/in US and African research, academic and community sites. Within this paper I use my specific Third/First World transnational interactions to examine and theorize the politics, psychological intentions and outcomes of masked racialized ideologies that shape such interactions. The intention of this paper is threefold - to: ( 1) examine the complexities of transnational racial identity and politics; ( 2) trace the im/possibilities of being validated as intellectual worker and authentic Third/First World subject in the global politics of power and knowledge that shapes the transnational educational, research and community trajectory; and ( 3) theorize the possibilities and limits for using transnational racial identity and politics for building solidarity. This decolonizing writing project attempts to reveal and disrupt the ways in which imperialism constructs racialized Others within and beyond the west. It also shows how imperialism develops transnational citizenship that creates subjects who, for those in the west, believe that they can master and conquer the world and, for those in/from the colonies, are rendered into second-class positions. Decolonization, therefore, needs to account for the interconnectedness of the west and the colonies as well as the transnational and complex interplay of subjugation, complicity and resistance.

The case for greater faculty diversity: examining the educational impacts of student-faculty racial/ethnic match	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Faculty diversity; faculty of color; academic disparities; students of color	AFRICAN-AMERICAN; CAMPUS CLIMATE; UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT; COLLEGE PERSISTENCE; RACIAL CLIMATE; RACE TEACHERS; COLOR; REPRESENTATION; ACHIEVEMENT; EXPERIENCES	Faculty diversity has benefits for all students; however, increasing faculty diversity may be particularly helpful in reducing academic disparities for students of color. This study examines the impact of having a professor of the same race/ethnicity on student performance. A longitudinal model was tested to examine how campus racial/ethnic composition and student-faculty racial/ethnic match impact GPA and graduation for students of color. Campus racial/ethnic climate was included in the model as a potential mediating factor. Results indicated that student-faculty racial/ethnic match, campus racial/ethnic composition, and campus racial/ethnic climate each predicted GPA, which predicted graduation. An indirect relationship between student-faculty racial/ethnic match and GPA through campus racial/ethnic climate was found. Findings stress the need for diverse faculty to enhance student success, ultimately improving grades and retention. Given the benefits to students, a focus on the hiring and retention of faculty of color may be key in addressing academic disparities.

J	Tomlinson, S				Tomlinson, Sally			Enoch Powell, empires, immigrants and education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Education policy; politics; racism; multicultural education; Enoch Powell		2018 marks the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell's infamous 'Rivers of Blood' speech, an intervention that is still viewed as one of the most incendiary statements of the perceived decay and violence likely to follow legislation intended to assure minoritised British citizens of equal rights regardless of their ethnic origin. In this essay, Sally Tomlinson (one of Britain's foremost multicultural theorists) reflects on Powell's legacy and the contemporary scene where in the US, UK and across Europe, White resentment and fear is increasingly shaping 'mainstream' debates about nationhood, migration and education.

J	Dunning-Lozano, JL				Dunning-Lozano, Jessica L.			Race and opportunity in a public alternative school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						education; Critical Race Theory; alternative schools; race; continuation high schools	AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES; WHITENESS; STATE	This qualitative case-study explores questions about the stratifying role of public alternative schools created for at-risk' youth by analyzing the school experience of students who attend a single continuation high school and the process of student enrollment and referral to that school. Drawing on the concept of whiteness as property, this article demonstrates how the continuation high school maintained and protected the property functions of whiteness through acts of symbolic violence and the systematic removal of non-white students from the school district's mainstream high school. Instead, students were placed in a substandard alternative school lacking in material and intellectual resources. Furthermore, teachers, counselors, and administrative staff at the mainstream and continuation high schools alike drew upon the racial ideology of merit to rationalize the overrepresentation of non-white youths at the study school and to deracialize' the student referral process.

J	Young, KS				Young, Kathryn S.			How student teachers (don't) talk about race: An intersectional analysis	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; disability; teacher education	SPECIAL-EDUCATION; DISABILITY; DIFFERENCE; WHITENESS; LEGAL	This study explores how student teacher talk about their students illuminates the identities ascribed to these same students. It uses a hybrid intersectional framework based on Disability Studies, Critical Race Theory, and Latino Critical Theory and methodologies (like examining majoritarian stories, counter-storytelling, coded talk, and post-civil rights race talk) to uncover how student teacher talk reveals oppressive discourses of race, disability (and language status). This article focuses on how the medicalization of disability facilitates student teachers not identifying the racialization of disability in school.

J	Tolbert, S; Eichelberger, S				Tolbert, Sara; Eichelberger, Serina			Surviving teacher education: a community cultural capital framework of persistence	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical race theory; microagressions; teacher education; predominantly white institutions (PWI)	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS; PRESERVICE TEACHERS; EXPERIENCES; SCHOOLS; COLOR; LEARN	In this article, we communicate the experiences of a bilingual/biracial Peruvian-Anglo European student teacher, Serina, enrolled in a 'teacher education for diversity' program. Although the majority of the 13 (mostly Anglo European) students in Serina's cohort expressed satisfaction with the social justice focus of the program, Serina was frustrated by the mixed messages she received about teacher professionalism as both teaching for social change and as deference to power. Serina was often vocal in her critique and, as a result, endured and negotiated cumulative microaggressions throughout her teacher education program. Despite these challenges, she drew on her community cultural capital to become a credentialed science teacher in an underserved urban middle school. Serina's experiences compel us to think about how teacher educators might better support preservice Teachers of Color - particularly as we strive to more actively recruit Teachers of Color to our teacher education programs. Implications for 'becoming' more socially just teacher educators are also discussed.

Arab civil society and education in Israel: the Arab Pedagogical Council as a contentious performance to achieve national recognition	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Arab civil society; education policy; citizenship acts; Israel; Palestinian identity		Focusing on recent developments in the field of education, this article grapples with the educational activism of Arab civil society in Israel. Specifically, it presents a case study of a recent initiative to establish an independent Arab Pedagogical Council (APC). I argue that this initiative, although controversial and challenging to the very definition of Israel as both a Jewish nation-state and a democracy, should be considered to be an act of citizenship, rather than a sign of radicalization and separatism. The initiative to establish the APC is a political and ethical act, through which Arab civil society organizations and activists in Israel constitute themselves as independent political actors, citizens, and claimants of rights, entitlements, and responsibilities for the quality of life and future of the Palestinians in Israel.

Using visual framing analysis and informed by framing theory and critiques of neoliberalism we seek to explore two questions: (1) What role do media images play in the framing of public education in urban spaces?; and (2) What do media images of students during the 2013 school closings in Chicago tell us about the framing of neoliberal education reforms in urban spaces?

J	Adair, JK				Adair, Jennifer Keys			Examining whiteness as an obstacle to positively approaching immigrant families in US early childhood educational settings	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; immigrant teachers; early childhood education; young children of immigrants; multivocal ethnography	CRITICAL RACE; CHILDREN; INVOLVEMENT; TEACHERS	This article examines whiteness at the intersection of immigration and early childhood education as it was made visible during interviews with 50 preschool teachers in five US cities as part of the Children Crossing Borders (CCB) study. Findings show whiteness acting not only as a construct of privilege but also as an idea that manifests itself in ways that affect schooling, even in early educational settings like preschool. Whiteness is made visible through a combination of multivocal ethnographic methodology, Critical Race Theory (CRT), and post-structural analytical tools all used within a comparative framework to understand whiteness from the perspective of white teachers responding to newly arrived immigrant families and subsequently from the counterexamples of immigrant teachers working in cities with longer histories of immigration. Findings suggest that the logic of whiteness used to respond to immigrant families includes blaming them, distancing from them and charging them with responsibility to change while at the same time being grateful for their presence in the school. Whiteness was found to prevent teachers from responding in engaged and positive ways to immigrant families and the manifestations of whiteness revealed by the white teachers in this study mirror larger societal tensions around immigration and race.

J	Jones, AE				Jones, Ann Elisabeth			Exploring teacher perceptions and expectations of Turkish, Kurdish and Turkish Cypriot girls from the perspectives of both teachers and students in three London secondary schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Turkish; Kurdish; Turkish Cypriot; girls; educational achievement; teacher expectations; Bourdieu; habitus	ACHIEVEMENT; GENDER; PUPILS; IDENTITIES; HABITUS	This article considers the role of teacher perceptions and expectations in the relatively low educational achievement of Turkish, Kurdish and Turkish Cypriot (T/K/TC) girls in the English secondary system. Recent research emphasises the 'invisibility' of these groups within educational settings. However, the study reported here finds, on the contrary, that T/K/TC students are visible in these schools. A bipolarity of stereotypes emerges from interviews with key school staff, including that of the low-achieving 'Turkish' girl who chooses to invest in her personal appearance rather than exploit educational opportunities. The relationship between such teacher perceptions and expectations is explored, drawing on student as well as teacher perspectives. A Bourdieuian analysis highlighting the concept of habitus suggests that there is dissonance between T/K/TC girls' lives at home and at school, while school staff underestimate their lack of familiarity with this group's way of life.				apiercejones@hotmail.com						Archer L, 2006, SOCIOLOGY, V40, P29, DOI 10.1177/0038038506058434; Archer L, 2005, BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC, V26, P165, DOI 10.1080/0142569042000294156; Archer L., 2006, RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK, V8, P387, DOI DOI 10.1080/13613320500323971; Archer L., 2008, EUROPEAN ED RES J, V7; Archer L., 2005, WORKING PAPER ESRC S, P3; Archer L, 2007, BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC, V28, P165, DOI 10.1080/01425690701192570; Bourdieu P., 1990, SENS PRATIQUE; Bourdieu P, 1992, INVITATION REFLEXIVE; Bourdieu P., 1998, THE STATE NOBILITY; BRAH A, 1994, RACE CULTURE DIFFERE; Carspecken P.F., 1996, CRITICAL ETHNOGRAPHY; Channer Y., 1995, I AM PROMISE ACHIEVE; Chen, 1996, S HALL CRITICAL DIAL, P442, DOI DOI 10.4324/  9780203993262; CONNOLLY P, 1995, BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC, V16, P75, DOI 10.1080/0142569950160105; Creese A., 2003, INT J BILING EDUC BI, V6, P221, DOI [https://doi.org/10.1080/13670050308667782, DOI 10.1080/13670050308667782]; Daly K., 2007, SEM FEBR 7 2007 GREA; Dedezade K., 1994, THESIS U N LONDON; Demetriou Danielle, 2002, DAILY TELEGRAPH; Demie F, 2010, EDUC STUD, V36, P95, DOI 10.1080/03055690903162408; Department of Education and Science (DES), 1985, ED ALL SWANN REP; DfES, 2003, AIM HIGH RAIS ACH MI; Enneli P., 2005, YOUNG TURKS KURDS SE; GHAILL MM, 1988, YOUNG GIFTED BLACK S; Gillborn D., 2000, RATIONING ED POLICY; Gillborn D., 2000, ED INEQUALITY MAPPIN; GILLBORN D, 1990, RACE ETHNICITY ED; Gosine K., 2002, CANADIAN J ED, V27, P81, DOI DOI 10.2307/1602189; Gove M., 2010, C NAT COLL LEAD SCH; Goyette K, 1999, SOCIOL EDUC, V72, P22, DOI 10.2307/2673184; Gutman LM, 2000, J YOUTH ADOLESCENCE, V29, P223, DOI 10.1023/A:1005108700243; Issa T, 2008, YOUNG PEOPLES ED ATT; Jones C., 2001, MAKING EMAG WORK, P45; King R., TURKS LONDON SHADES; Kucukcan T., 1999, POLITICS ETHNICITY I; Li J., 2004, RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK, V7, P168; Lloyd-Jacob C., 1999, THESIS U LONDON; MACPHERSON W, 1999, CM42621; May S., 1999, CRITICAL MULTICULTUR, P1; MCCOMBS RC, 2001, J SOC PSYCHOL, V128, P647; McNay L, 1999, THEOR CULT SOC, V16, P95, DOI 10.1177/026327699016001007; Mehmet Ali Aydin, 2001, TURKISH SPEAKING COM; Mirza Heidi Safia, 1992, YOUNG FEMALE BLACK; Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education), 2004, ACH BANGL HER PUP; Rattansi A., 1999, CRITICAL MULTICULTUR, P77; Reay D, 2005, SOCIOLOGY, V39, P911, DOI 10.1177/0038038505058372; Reay D, 2004, BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC, V25, P431, DOI 10.1080/0142569042000236934; Rhem J, 1999, NATL TEACHING LEARNI, V8; Rosenthal R., 1968, URBAN REV, V3, P16, DOI [10.1007/BF02322211, DOI 10.1007/BF02322211]; Sahan H, 2004, KURDISH COMMUNITY OU; Sayer, 2004, MORAL SIGNIFICANCE C; Shain F., 2003, SCH IDENTITY ASIAN G; Shepherd Jessica, 2010, GUARDIAN        0901; Spitz HH, 1999, INTELLIGENCE, V27, P199, DOI 10.1016/S0160-2896(99)00026-4; Strand S., 2010, DCSFRR226; Tonna M.

J	Schick, C				Schick, Carol			White resentment in settler society	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						resentment; national narrative; white supremacy; settler; aboriginal; white identity	POLITICS	Teaching about the history and culture of aboriginal peoples in schools of white settler societies can serve as a counter to the dominant story that serves as the national narrative. Even though the actual teaching may well be among the least political and least disruptive type of curricular knowledge on offer, the inclusion of counter stories can meet with resistance and resentment. This article offers that the politics of resentment enacted in a white settler society complicates the potential for equitable schooling for aboriginal and racial minority students. Public acts of resentment on the part of white settler parents mark schools as white spaces even in the midst of claims of multicultural inclusion. The politics of resentment are used to normalize emotional belonging on the part of a white settler society that sees itself as beleaguered by its excessive generosity and inclusivity. This article examines the ways that white supremacy and white racial knowledge are reasserted through the effects of emotional belonging and resentment.

J	Carlile, A				Carlile, Anna			An ethnography of permanent exclusion from school: revealing and untangling the threads of institutionalised racism	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						institutional racism; permanent exclusion; ethnography; behaviour; curriculum; gatekeeping; pupil referral unit	RACE; EDUCATION	This article focuses on the administration of disciplinary exclusion (expulsion) from school. It identifies a number of social boundaries between people that negatively affect students subject to permanent exclusion, to the extent that they can be seen as constituting incidents of institutional racism. For example, the high statistical currency of the English language and the lack of adequate translation facilities are shown to constitute social boundaries between people that undermine the participation of parents in school exclusion and inclusion processes. Age assessments for immigrant and refugee children are also seen to affect institutional responses to individual cases of permanent exclusion from school. Assumptions about what excluded students 'need' are found to sometimes be made on the basis of reductive skin-colour labels, and a disconnect is discovered between the discourses that school and family are socially authorised to adopt in discussing students at risk of exclusion. It is recommended that institutional racism in schooling is acknowledged and acted upon by both policy makers and practitioners.

J	Bondy, JM				Bondy, Jennifer M.			Normalizing English language learner students: a Foucauldian analysis of opposition to bilingual education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						ELL students; normalization; anti-bilingual education initiatives	PROPOSITION; ARIZONA; TIMES; RACE	This article uses Foucault's (1977/1995) concept of normalization to analyze contemporary opposition to bilingual education in the United States. These contemporary movements have 'normalized' English language learner (ELL) students by appropriating the technology of language in order to become 'Americanized.' This has become urgent and emergent in educational research, in part, because of the growing number of ELL students in United States' public schools. English-language proficiency is an essential element for academic success in the US's current English-only, high-stakes testing environment. This analysis questions the notion of an ideal American as the standard for how educators implement English-only curriculum and pedagogy for ELL students. The article concludes with a critique of the impact and implications of 'normalizing' ELL students with an English-only education.

J	Lim, JH				Lim, Jae Hoon			The road not taken: two African-American girls' experiences with school mathematics	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African-American students; mathematics education; cultural and social capital	RACE; PARTICIPATION; MOTIVATION; CLASSROOMS; CONTEXT; GENDER	This article is a cross-case study exploring two young African-American adolescent girls' experiences with school mathematics and the impact of the socio-cultural context upon their motivation and mathematical identity. Based on repeated in-depth interviews and ethnographic observation of their mathematics classroom, the researcher portrays contrasting pictures of two sixth-grade African-American girls who are ironically faced with the same end-of-the-year-results despite their differing personal and academic profiles. Overall data analysis reveals the profound impact of ethnicity and class, especially the influence of cultural and social capital, upon the girls' experiences with school mathematics as well as their construction of identities in the discipline. Applying social constructivist approaches to motivation, Ogbu's theory of involuntary minorities, and cultural reproduction theory, the researcher discusses possible variation and complexity existing in African-American girls' experience with school mathematics and calls for more thorough, in-depth examination of race and gender issues in mathematics education.

The study discovered that these teacher participants displayed different degrees of race consciousness, prompting contradictory expectancy practices. Negative expectations often reinforced ideologies and material conditions associated with the racial contract and, in effect, perpetuated whiteness as the racial construct of college-going abilities. Conversely, those teachers who operated with a higher degree of race consciousness reported more equitable teaching practices that emphasized self-respect, solidarity, and education as a collective contract for the common good. The study draws conclusions that impact educational policies, particularly those that identify college readiness as the benchmark of equity and high-school success.

J	Vargas, N; Villa-Palomino, J; Davis, E				Vargas, Nicholas; Villa-Palomino, Julio; Davis, Erika			Latinx faculty representation and resource allocation at Hispanic Serving Institutions	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Hispanic Serving Institutions; Latinx faculty; Critical Race Theory; racial liberalism; interest convergence	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; INTEREST CONVERGENCE PRINCIPLE; HIGHER-EDUCATION; COMMUNITY-COLLEGE; DIVERSITY; STUDENTS; COLOR; IDENTITY; RETENTION; PROMOTION	Early advocates for Hispanic-Serving Institutions argued that HSIs should require 'significant Hispanic staffing patterns at the faculty horizontal ellipsis level' and 'serious commitment to the needs of Hispanic learners.' We examine whether HSIs, nearly 40 years later, have addressed these calls by detailing rates of Latinx faculty representation and exploring how HSIs incorporate faculty in federally funded HSI initiatives. Analyses of all Title V funded HSIs from 2009-2016 (N = 167) indicate that the average Latinx student-to-Latinx faculty ratio is 146:1, whereas the corollary White student-to-White faculty ratio is 10:1. Moreover, analyses of HSI grant abstracts indicate that HSIs expend federal funding-which was initially intended to ameliorate educational inequalities - on training White faculty to become more 'culturally aware' and 'culturally engaged.' We argue these findings align with two core tenets of Critical Race Theory (CRT) - namely CRT's critique of racial liberalism, and Derrick Bell's conceptualization of interest convergence.

J	Foubert, JLM				Foubert, Jennifer L. McCarthy			'Damned if you do, damned if you don't:' Black parents' racial realist school engagement	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Parent involvement; parent engagement; family-school relationships; Black parents; critical race theory; antiblackness	MIDDLE-CLASS PARENTS; CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EXPERIENCES; FRAMEWORK; ERA	Conventional scholarship frames parent involvement in schools as crucial for student success, often depicts Black and Brown parents as under-engaged, and implies their increased engagement would lead to the end of racial disparities in education. This study challenges this traditional discourse and introduces the notion of Racial Realist Parent Engagement. Racial Realist Parent Engagement is a practice and theoretical framing drawn from Derrick Bell's notion of racial realism and a qualitative multicase study of the school engagement experiences of 16 Black parents. These parent participants resisted antiblackness in their children's schools while simultaneously recognizing racism to be a permanent and inevitable aspect of schooling. Racial Realist Parent Engagement shifts parent involvement theory, policy, and practice to a more complex understanding of the purposes and benefits of parent engagement for Black and Brown families - and demands expansive racial justice policy for student learning.

J	Colomer, SE				Colomer, Soria E.			Understanding racial literacy through acts of (un)masking: Latinx teachers in a new Latinx diaspora community	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Latinx teachers; new Latinx communities; teacher education; racial literacy; (un)masking; teacher identity	SPANISH TEACHERS; EDUCATION; URBAN	As Latinx teachers are recruited to work in U.S. schools, a continued agenda to understand their experiences is warranted. This multiple case study considers the storytelling of six Latinx teachers in a new Latinx diaspora community. It documents both their racial literacy (the ability to resolve racially stressful issues) and their experiences with (un)masking (literal and figurative ways to cover or embrace racial markers). This study reveals the tensions that arise when Latinx teachers attempt to define their identity in social spaces where their languages, bodies, and names, among other markers, are racialized when read by others. Implications for teacher education include a call to include storytelling as a pedagogical tool to develop Latinx teachers' racial literacy skills. By experiencing storytelling in their own schooling, Latinx teachers are more likely to model such racial literacy skills in their schooling communities; thereby, empowering a generation of students to enact more humanizing behaviors.

J	Martinez-Alvarez, P				Martinez-Alvarez, Patricia			Dis/ability labels and emergent bilingual children: current research and new possibilities to grow as bilingual and biliterate learners	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Bilingual education; disability; inclusive practices; special education; disability studies in education	PRIMARY LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION; FRENCH IMMERSION; DISABILITY; STUDENTS; EDUCATION; INTERVENTION; SCHOOL; RACE; IDENTIFICATION	Children who learn at the crossroads of multiple identities are at risk of experiencing inequality at multiple levels. Intersectionality frameworks have illuminated the relationship between cultural and language differences and dis/abilities, but they can also help us surface the effects dis/ability labels have on language choices for emergent bilingual (EB) children. With the primary objective of assisting the field of Bilingual Special Education (BiSPED), and related fields, move forward, this narrative literature review addresses: (1) How does a dis/ability label impact EBs' opportunities to become fully bilingual/biliterate in their two languages? (2) What does existing research tell us about the learning of bilingual children with dis/abilities in bilingual programs? Findings show that emergent bilinguals have fewer opportunities than their peers to learn in bilingual programs when they have dis/abilities, even though research suggests they can learn bilingually at no additional cost. Implications for researchers and educators are discussed.

J	Adjei, PB				Adjei, Paul Banahene			The (em)bodiment of blackness in a visceral anti-black racism and ableism context	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Anti-black racism; anti-black racism; whiteness; blackness; special education; disability "diagnoses' and placement practices; embodiment	RACE; DISABILITY; EDUCATION; IDENTITY; STUDENTS; CULTURE; LIFE	Over the years, many scholarly publications have extensively discussed disability diagnoses' and placement practices in special education programs in the United States and the United Kingdom. These publications argue that racism and classism rather than clinically predetermined factors appear to influence the disability diagnosis and placement practices in special education. The present essay is contributing to the debate by critically exploring the relationship(s) between race, class, and disability diagnoses' and placement practices in special education programs in Toronto, Canada. The core ideas noted in the essay are drawn from a personal story of an African-Canadian parent - a story of a daughter with a diagnosed disability and her mother's struggle to resist the disability diagnosis' as well as her battle rejecting her daughter's placement in the special education program in a Toronto public school. Using this personal account, other literature, and anti-black racism theory, I argue that special education programming in Toronto, Canada helps white middle/upper class Canadians achieve a de facto race/class-based segregation in the Toronto public school system. Whereas the Supreme Courts' rulings on Brown vs. the Board of Education in the United States and Washington vs. the Trustees of Charlottesville in Canada have insisted that whites and non-whites attend the same school, special education identification practices ensure that whites and non-whites do not have to belong to the same classroom. I conclude that when educational practices move into spaces of pathologization, blacks and working-class students are continually at risk of facing exclusionary practices. One thing is clear: the significance of skin color in the mind of the racist cannot easily be dismissed.

J	Myers, M				Myers, Martin			Gypsy students in the UK: the impact of "mobility' on education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Mobility; sedentarism; cultural boundary; nomadism; Gypsy; Traveller	TRAVELER PARENTS; ENGLAND	This paper argues that Gypsy students in primary and secondary education in the UK are marginalised because of ambiguous understandings of their mobility'. Drawing on research conducted on the south coast of England, it examines Gypsy families' experiences of education. Despite often describing their identity in relation to travelling or mobility, few families' lifestyles were characterised by actual movement or nomadism. Teachers and educationalists meanwhile cite the need to deliver a mobile' rather than a sedentary' education for Gypsy students. The Department for Communities and Local Government recently defined Gypsy ethnicity in direct relation to a nomadic lifestyle. This is problematic as the association between Gypsy ethnicity and nomadism is itself questionable and may be better understood in more nuanced terms reflecting the relationship between identity and mobility'. This paper argues that mobility' is understood to define Gypsy difference in a way that excludes students.

White teachers, Latino/a students, and racial battle fatigue	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial microaggressions; racial battle fatigue; participatory action research (PAR); K-12; Latino education	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; MICROAGGRESSIONS; CLIMATE	This article explores how and why a group of Latino/a high school students identify and explain racism differently over the course of an 18-month participatory action research (PAR) project. To do this we examine what recent scholarship has termed racial microaggressions in what is thought of as the Post-Racial America public school system. Pulling examples from student and teacher interview, focus group, and class discussion data we first examine how these students' teachers conceptualize and talk about racism, cross-racial relationships, and racial misunderstandings, and then we juxtapose that with students' discursive work to make sense of the ways their teachers make their conceptualizations known and/or seen in school. Focusing on the K-12 context, this study finds racial battle fatigue may be why students switch between how they label these aggressions.

J	Burman, E				Burman, Erica			Fanon's other children: psychopolitical and pedagogical implications	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Colonialism; decolonisation; education; gender; generation; nationalism; development	FRANTZ FANON; RACE; EDUCATION; REVOLUTIONARY; PSYCHOLOGY; RETHINKING; CHILDHOOD; POLITICS; CONTEXT; HISTORY	Discussions of the writings of theorist, psychiatrist and revolutionary, Frantz Fanon, in the fields of education and childhood typically focus on his account of a traumatic encounter with a white child, whose fear at the sight of a black man is said to create a vilified, racialised identity and installs an irreversible social and corporeal alienation. Yet Fanon's writings include a range of other depictions of children, childhood and education which reflect his broader views of colonial and decolonisation processes that include recognisable tropes of classic developmentalism, including gender chauvinisms. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the diversity and complexity of child-related allusions across his texts allow for other critical readings that can inform educational debates on anticolonial analyses, of children, childhood and of their more general role in post and anti-development discourse.

J	Cho, H				Cho, Hyesun			Racism and linguicism: engaging language minority pre-service teachers in counter-storytelling	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racism; linguicism; critical race theory; pre-service teachers; counter-storytelling; racial identity; teacher educator	NARRATIVE INQUIRY; RACE; WHITE; EDUCATION; TRANSFORMATION; CANDIDATES; FRAMEWORK; STUDENTS; DIALOGUE; WORK	This study examines how language minority pre-service teachers engaged in the discussion of racism and linguicism through counter-storytelling informed by Critical Race Theory (CRT). Counter-stories can act as a medium through which minority students can unpack the power relations embedded in academic learning. This study also explores ways in which having a language minority teacher educator with a similar background facilitated the discussion of race and native speaker status. Drawing on co-teaching experience with a white teacher educator, I suggest that the teaching of race and language be not only about racialized and linguistic identity of instructors, but pedagogical approaches and strategies through counter-stories that actively foster critical reflection on power imbalance inherent in schools.

J	Chang, A				Chang, Aurora			Multiracial matters - disrupting and reinforcing the racial rubric in educational discourse	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Multiracial identity; mixed-race studies; critical race theory; college students; diversity; inclusivity	RACE; IDENTITY	When studying matters of race and education, there seems to be an assumption that the inclusion of all monoracial populations equates to a comprehensive look at all students, particularly students of color. But what about students who identify with more than one race? How do Multiracial students identify and how are they included/excluded with respect to educational curricula, policies and climates? This growing group presents an immediate opportunity and challenge to the educational community, because while educational researchers appropriately and vigorously pay attention to matters of traditionally under-represented monoracial groups of color, it has yet to be seen where Multiracial students fall into this discourse. Based on a qualitative study of 25 Multiracially identified college students, I explore the ways in which the notion of Multiraciality muddies traditional conversations about race and education in an effort to better understand the potential impact of this new' demographic within an educational context.

In this article, we examine the discourses surrounding race and demographic change in three suburban school districts that have been undergoing rapid demographic changes and which contain demographically distinct areas within their district boundaries. Utilizing a critical discourse analysis (CDA) approach, we analyze how the policy context (federal and state) frames actors' discourses and understandings of race, paying particular attention to the political and institutional factors affecting school policy. We illustrate how the discourse, in turn, is related to the actions (or inactions) taken by district and school leaders to respond to demographic change. We conclude the article by discussing policy implications and potential challenges districts may face in the future if efforts to purposively address racial changes continue to be avoided.

J	Ocampo, AC; Soodjinda, D				Ocampo, Anthony C.; Soodjinda, Daniel			Invisible Asian Americans: the intersection of sexuality, race, and education among gay Asian Americans	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asian American; bullying; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT); gay; educational experiences; model minority	QUEER YOUTH; MINORITY; SCHOOL; MODEL	Most research on Asian American education has centered on addressing and deconstructing the model minority stereotype. While recent studies have highlighted the socioeconomic and cultural heterogeneity among Asian American students, few have examined how sexual identity and masculinity mitigate their academic experiences. In this article, we draw on the educational narratives of 35 Asian American gay men to address this gap. Though research on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) students has emphasized bullying, our findings show that the relationship between sexuality and schooling is more nuanced than studies suggest. Our article reveals that while anti-gay bullying is prevalent, Asian American gay students play up aspects of their racial identity and even strategically capitalize on the model minority stereotype to evade harassment. Ultimately, our study highlights the need for educators to remain mindful of how the intersection of sexuality and race affect the school climate and educational experiences among gay students of color.

J	Uptin, J; Wright, J; Harwood, V				Uptin, Jonnell; Wright, Jan; Harwood, Valerie			Finding education: Stories of how young former refugees constituted strategic identities in order to access school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						refugee students; discourse; education; strategic identities	STUDENTS; FAITH	Educators in resettlement countries are grappling with ways to adequately engage and meet the needs of newly arrived refugee students. In this article we argue that to fully meet the needs of refugee students a deeper understanding of their educational experience as 'a refugee' prior to resettlement is vital. In particular we foreground the stories of three young former refugees and explore the ways in which they actively constructed new identities in order to access school in their host countries, prior to resettlement. This article discusses how the negative discursive positioning of 'the refugee' in the world today has limited the resources and access to education for young refugees. It concludes by arguing that as these students move into education in Australia there is a danger to quickly relabel young former refugees with deficit terms rather than opening up a discourse to include the intricate complexities of each refugee experience.

J	Pennell, SM				Pennell, Summer Melody			Queer cultural capital: implications for education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						cultural capital; teacher education; teaching; queer theory; LGBT students	TRANSGENDER; LANGUAGE	This article takes the concept of cultural capital from Yosso's (2005) work and transforms the model for queer communities. While Yosso identified five forms of cultural capital in communities of color (familial, aspirational, navigational, resistant, and linguistic), the author identifies an additional form: transgressive. Queer cultural capital can show teachers the strengths within queer communities and so allow them to have a positive, rather than a deficit, model of these groups. Brief examples for queer cultural capital are illustrated for familial, aspirational, navigational, and resistant, while queer linguistic and transgressive capitals are discussed in greater depth. Implications for K-12 teaching and working with preservice teachers are offered, as well as suggestions for future work.

J	Khambhaita, P; Bhopal, K				Khambhaita, Priya; Bhopal, Kalwant			Home or away? The significance of ethnicity, class and attainment in the housing choices of female university students	Race Ethnicity and Education			English	Article						intersectionality; living arrangements; locality; higher education; class; Asian	INTERSECTIONALITY; EDUCATION; WOMEN	Given the financial implications for studying at a higher education institution, students are faced with many decisions both in terms of the topics they wish to study but also the decision of whether to remain at home or move away. The aim of this article is to compare the experiences of South Asian (Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani) female students to White females, to identify similarities and differences between women from the three Asian groups and also compare changes over time. This article is focused on the term-time accommodation status of these students, i.e. the decision to move away or stay residing in the parental/guardian home during their first year of university. Understanding students' accommodation choices is important as it can limit the other choices they have to make such as which course to choose and students who are limited to their local institutions can only study what is offered by those particular institutions. We examine this issue by using binary logistic regression to analyse administrative enrolment data on HE students in England for academic years 1998/99 and 2005/06 from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).

J	Anderson, CR				Anderson, Celia Rousseau			What are you? A CRT perspective on the experiences of mixed race persons in 'post-racial' America	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						mixed race; multiracial; biracial; Critical Race Theory	IDENTITY; CHILDREN; BLIND	In this article, the author employs Critical Race Theory (CRT) to examine the experiences of mixed race individuals in the United States. Drawing on historical and contemporary conditions involving persons of mixed race, the author considers how key ideas from CRT can be useful to frame an analysis of the experiences of multiracial persons in the US. To supplement the analysis, the author also includes fictionalized narratives in the tradition of CRT. In conclusion, the author considers how this examination of mixed race persons might inform K-12 education.

J	Allen, Q				Allen, Quaylan			Balancing school and cool: tactics of resistance and accommodation among black middle-class males	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						black middle-class; black males; resistance; accommodation	CRITICAL RACE; RACIAL SOCIALIZATION; WHITE; EDUCATION; MOBILITY; STUDENTS; YOUTH	The school lives of black middle-class males are often overlooked and understudied. An exploration at the intersection of race, class and gender for black middle-class males provides opportunity for a more nuanced understanding of the black male schooling experience. Drawing upon student resistance theories as analytical tools and employing qualitative interpretive methods, this study documented the raced, classed, and gendered approaches to schooling of black middle-class males. In particular, this article highlights the ways in which black middle-class male youth balanced the academic expectations of their parents with the cultural expectations of their peers through tactical acts of resistance and accommodation. Their tempered approach to academic effort, disruption of school processes, and peer validated performances of black masculine cool were just some of the ways they navigated schooling as a site of conflicting cultural expectations. The intent of their resistance and accommodation in school as raced, classed, and gendered bodies present both opportunities and dilemmas for improving black male achievement and middle-class reproduction.

J	Applebaum, B				Applebaum, Barbara			Reframing responsibility in the social justice classroom	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						critical whiteness studies; social justice education; responsibility	STUDENTS	This article examines a question that white students often ask when they learn about their role in systemic racial oppression: 'Why am I responsible?' I argue that the conception of responsibility that grounds this question is focused on causality and individual action and makes it difficult for white students to understand how within the context of structural injustice they are complicit in systemic racial injustice. Building on the work of feminist philosophers such as Iris Marion Young and Judith Butler, I propose a rearticulated notion of responsibility that is not focused on blame or fault and that understands that critique is at the heart of ethics. Implications for social justice education are discussed.

J	Grant, CA				Grant, Carl A.			Escaping Devil's Island: confronting racism, learning history	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African Americans; historical knowledge; racism; urban areas	RACE	This article argues that African Americans, especially males living in urban areas, are physically and mentally trapped on a Devil's Island. The penal colony on the coast of French Guiana is a metaphor for the boundaries and constraints that close off opportunities and constrain African American historical knowledge. The article argues that although African Americans have struggled to learn their history (e.g. economic, political and social), the goal of critically using that history to decipher their social world eludes them. While social movements of the twentieth century produced some racial progress, none of them generated enough progress to eliminate the racism that keeps Blacks on Devil's Island - racism that includes widely accepted mantras such as 'the United States is a Nation of Immigrants,' a historical 'sin of omission' that markets racism as merely prejudice within the context of pluralism and makes it more difficult for Whites to address the privilege their skin color provides and to acknowledge the structures in society that keep racism in place.

J	Sharma, S				Sharma, Suniti			Contesting institutional discourse to create new possibilities for understanding lived experience: life-stories of young women in detention, rehabilitation, and education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						school-to-prison pipeline; education; detention; autobiography; race; gender		This research explores autobiographies of young women in detention, rehabilitation, and education as counter-stories to the official, institutional stories of their lives. The context of the study is a private detention facility in the United States; the participants are young women aged 15-19 years in a detention classroom; and data for the study comprises their autobiographies, official documents of their life stories, and the researcher's field notes. Through various lenses the analysis supports how students' counter-stories disrupt the combined institutional discourses of the juvenile justice and the school systems. Students' counter-stories provide evidence of institutional discourses that racialize and gender certain groups of young women to shape, define, and at times, predicate their detention further compounded by the normalization process of education for rehabilitation. The overrepresentation of minority groups in the juvenile detention system combined with school discourse of sorting, labeling and tracking students based on officially sanctioned norms privileges certain groups of students while fast-tracking others into the school-to-prison pipeline. The article concludes by calling upon educators, curriculum developers, activists, reformers, and administrators to end the pathologizing of minority groups of students through socially unjust practices and policies.

Specifically, we explore how these students understood and made meaning of their experiences as mentors for local middle school and high school males of color. The students articulated three significant components of their youth mentoring experiences that shaped their leadership: (a) commitment to community; (b) serving as a role model to youth - and among their peers - and (c) using a person-first approach to enrich students holistically, enhance their schooling experiences, and support their academic efforts. The student narratives provide a frame for promoting and supporting engagement for college men of color, reveal the importance of community cultural wealth, and speak to ways to build leadership capital, as these experiences can create and enhance their leadership skills and position them to be community change agents.

J	Duncan, KE				Duncan, Kristen E.			'That's My Job': Black Teachers' Perspectives on Helping Black Students Navigate White Supremacy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black teachers; critical race theory; racism; emancipatory pedagogy	AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS; CRITICAL RACE PEDAGOGY; EXPERIENCES; POLITICS; ME	This paper presents the findings of a research study that sought to understand the perspectives of exemplary Black teachers utilizing emancipatory pedagogies to help Black students navigate systems of white supremacy in a contemporary American social landscape where racism is simultaneously invisible and hypervisible. Using critical race theory, the findings of this narrative inquiry indicate that participants made their students aware of the ubiquity of racism and the inevitability that they would experience it. Findings also show that participants provided their students with opportunities to speak back to their oppression, shifted the ways they practiced emancipatory pedagogy based on the teaching and social context in which they found themselves, and learned to engage students in these ways at various points in their lives but not through teacher education. This study has implications for teachers, school administrators, teacher educators, and researchers.

J	Doharty, N				Doharty, Nadena			The ?angry Black woman? as intellectual bondage: being strategically emotional on the academic plantation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black women; race research; critical race theory; higher education; double consciousness; emotionality	RACE; FEMINISM; CULTURE; RACISM; MATTER; WOMEN	Using a doctoral examination question as a starting point, this paper explores the specific race-gendered challenges Black women academics face when doing research on race. I argue that the stereotypical, racialised controlling images regarding Black women are not exclusive to African-American women and this has led some, in education, to draw on epistemologies such as Critical Race Theory (CRT) because of its usefulness in illuminating patterns of racial discrimination and structural disadvantage. The paper builds on this work by exploring the impact on the researcher who might too have faced similar inequalities they are now researching. Consequently, I offer the concept strategic emotionality to pay specific attention to the conscious decisions Black women academics might make about engaging with their emotions as part of the research and analytical process and the potential impact on epistemology.

Multilingualism and identity: articulating "African-ness' in an American high school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Multilingualism; identity; African immigrant and refugee youth	HIP-HOP; IMMIGRANTS; YOUTH; BLACK; LANGUAGE	This paper draws on qualitative research that examines the language practices and learning experiences of ten adolescent multilingual immigrant and refugee English Learners (ELs) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Specific questions addressed include: How do these students capitalize on home languages as they engage in linguistic practices in English? How do these students take up their identities within the context of a US high school? The project emphasizes a shift away from learning discrete language skills in one language toward a focus on supporting complex language and content learning fluidly across languages and content areas in ways that affirm students' identities and new learning. Implications for theory and practice will be discussed.

'Before they kill my spirit entirely': insights into the lived experiences of American Indian Alaska Native faculty at research universities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Native American; American Indian/Alaska native; faculty; discrimination; mentoring; decolonization	TRANSFORMATIONAL RESISTANCE; RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS; STUDENTS	American Indian and Alaska Natives (AIAN) comprise about 2% of the US population and 0.5% of the faculty in higher education. While scholars have documented the experiences of underrepresented minority (URM) faculty, the perspectives of AIAN faculty at elite universities are largely absent. Although AIAN faculty share many of the same barriers to success as URM colleagues, their unique status as Tribal peoples and their relationship to settler colonialism pose particular challenges and resistance strategies. Findings from a mixed methods study of 25 AIAN faculty at research universities, employing a decolonizing, survivance-oriented framework, examines their lived institutional experiences. The data yielded five themes regarding (1) institutional climate, (2) mentorship, (3) family-work balance, (4) cultural taxation and role stress, and (5) discrimination. The authors conclude that decolonization involves the repatriation of Indigenous epistemologies and Indigenous 'place' in the growth of science, research, and knowledge production, creating liberatory spaces within the academy.

J	Rissanen, I				Rissanen, Inkeri			School principals' diversity ideologies in fostering the inclusion of Muslims in Finnish and Swedish schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Diversity ideologies; culturally responsive education; religion-blindness; school principals; Muslims; Finland; Sweden	COLOR-BLIND; INTERETHNIC IDEOLOGY; RELIGION EDUCATION; DISCOURSES; ATTITUDES; MINORITY; STUDENTS; CITIZENSHIP; LEADERSHIP; RELEVANT	Mainstream scholarly approaches to improving equity in education, including culturally responsive education, promote multicultural recognition of diversity and abandon color-blindness as an ineffective strategy. The social psychological literature affords a more nuanced understanding of the merits of different diversity ideologies. However, these research strands rarely address religion. It is vital to study the actualization and influences of different diversity ideologies with respect to different forms of diversity and different contexts. This study analyzes Finnish and Swedish principals' diversity ideologies in fostering Muslim inclusion. The principals rely mainly on color-blind ideology, but assimilation into the secular normativity of the school is also commonly pursued. Multicultural ideology commonly applies to linguistic diversity, while Islam is excluded from the multiculturalist discourse. Reflexivity regarding the complex dynamics of recognizing individual vs. group identities in education as well as understanding of the implications of religion-blindness is called for.

Rewriting dominant narratives of the academy: women faculty of color and identity management	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Academia; women; higher education; identity	RACE; UNIVERSITIES; TESOL; LIFE	Drawing on Delgado and Yosso's counterstory, Yosso's community cultural wealth, and Alsup's borderland discourses, the authors, who are women of color academics, use narratives from their lives to discuss the ways in which they draw on resources in managing and reconfiguring their multiple identities within the academy. These include identities of scholars, mentors, teachers, community members, mothers, and partners. They suggest that rather than merely being socialized into cultural reproduction, as much of the literature oriented toward women of color advises them to do in order to become successful, they seek to actually engage in transforming their roles and that of the academy by consciously and repeatedly making present and visible facets of identity that have previously been more-or-less absent in higher education. By presenting these counter-narratives the authors attempt to engage with ways of self-positioning that are, especially for women of color in academia, not frequently discussed or presented.

J	Reyes, NAS				Reyes, Nicole Alia Salis			A space for survivance: locating Knaka Maoli through the resonance and dissonance of critical race theory	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical race theory; Indigenous; decolonization	HIGHER-EDUCATION; AMERICANS	In this article, I map a new theoretical space for Knaka Maoli, the autochthonous people of Hawai?i, within the landscape of critical race theory (CRT). To engage the ways that Knaka Maoli have been identified as people of color, Asian Pacific Islanders, and Indigenous people, I review literature on CRT, Asian critical race theory, and Tribal critical race theory, revealing that these areas of CRT are at once resonant and dissonant with Knaka Maoli sensibilities and experiences. Working through this resonance and dissonance, I weave together relevant concepts from extant strands of CRT with Kanaka Maoli knowledge and interests in the offering of new tenets toward a Kanaka Maoli critical decolonizing framework (KanakaCrit).

J	Wang, T				Wang, Tao			Religion-based cultural identity and conflicts of migrant Muslim students in Northwest China	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Cultural identity; religion; migrant Muslims; Hui; Dongxiang; Northwest China		The Hui (10.6 million) is one of the largest ethnic minority groups in China. Almost 100% of them, along with the Dongxiang, are Islamic, and are migrating from rural to urban areas in Northwest China. After moving to the urban environment conflicts between rural-urban differences, ethnic identity, and religion beliefs and practices frequently occur. This study found that Islam has strong influences on migrant Hui and Dongxiang students' identity, and cause some notable conflicts with the urban and school cultures. These conflicts penetrate many aspects of their lives such as clothing, dietary restrictions, religious practice and literacy, and schooling. This study also examines the conflict between Islamic culture and modern secular culture, and identify some implications for schooling.

It is an analysis of the Canadian and world studies curricula and texts in Newfoundland and Labrador, 1 of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada. The analysis is based on academic research and consultations with First Nations, Metis and Inuit peoples (FNMI) educators, educational administrators and knowledge holders. Although there is evidence of reform, as a whole the curriculum suffers from silences and lack of context, problematic placement and associations, the intrusion of settler perspectives, contradiction over judgement about issues related to FNMI peoples and inconsistency that undermine efforts at reform. This article provides guidance to curriculum designers, textbook writers, teachers and administrators participating in the decolonization of education in Canada.

J	Matthiesen, NCL				Matthiesen, Noomi Christine Linde			Working together in a deficit logic: home-school partnerships with Somali diaspora parents	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Marginalization; refugees; immigrants; deficit; home-school; partnerships	TEACHER PERCEPTIONS; IMMIGRANT FAMILIES; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; RACE; PERSPECTIVES; INVOLVEMENT; EXPERIENCES	Drawing on discursive psychology this article examines the understandings teachers and principals in Danish Public Schools have regarding Somali diaspora parenting practices. Furthermore, the article investigates what these understandings mean in interaction with children in the classrooms and with parents in home-school communication. It is argued that in a society with increased focus on parental responsibility the teachers and principals draw on a deficit logic when dealing with Somali diaspora parents and children which consequently leads to teachers either transmitting their expertise by educating parents or compensating for perceived deficiencies in parental practices. Both these strategies result in significant marginalizing consequences where difference' is understood as wrong' or inadequate'.

The article analyses a diverse set of national and local administrative documents advancing a polyhedron of intelligibility by which the authors discover how problem-solving complexes responsive to immigrant families change and sediment, and ultimately, weave the fabric of a Danish welfare nation-state faced with non-Western immigration after the economic boom in the late 1960s.

J	Quicke, SP; Biddle, N				Quicke, Sarah Prout; Biddle, Nicholas			School (non-)attendance and "mobile cultures': theoretical and empirical insights from Indigenous Australia	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						School attendance; Indigenous peoples; mixed-methods; Australia	EDUCATION; AFRICA; POLICY; WHITE; YOUTH	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) Australians are significantly and substantially less likely to be attending school on a given day than their non-Indigenous counterparts. This has been shown to have long-term consequences for the development of the mainstream literacy and numeracy skills associated with formal schooling, as well as later school and employment outcomes. Reducing this gap is a key focus of government education policy within Australia. Hampering the design of effective policy, however, is the lack of a robust empirical and theoretical framework to explain school (non-)attendance that not only builds on existing research, but also reflects the specific circumstances and aspirations of Indigenous students and their families. This article applies mixed-methods quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore what Indigenous student (non-)attendance in Australia might tell us regarding the relationship between highly marginalised student groups and formal education systems. A robust understanding of these geographically and socio-culturally situated school (non-)attendance patterns and processes allows us to build on and contribute to human capital, critical, resistance, and other behavioural theories of formal education and draw parallels for other population sub-groups globally, especially those that display ongoing patterns of high geographic mobility. Our analysis suggests that absenteeism amongst marginalised and/or highly mobile populations, may be most usefully conceived of as a manifestation of structural incompatibilities between formal schooling systems and the life projects and circumstances of these school-aged children and their families.

The authors implicate themselves, reflexively incorporating positions as a white, female, working class-raised doctoral student and a white, female, working class-raised professor situated in the cultures of California, University of California (UC) at Santa Cruz, and organizational cultures of groups within the movement. The authors explore organizing activities, intersectionality, positionality, privilege, collaboration, solidarity and links to literatures regarding whiteness within this context. We raise questions about how the anti-cuts movement is unfolding, how individuals and groups work with each other, and how we negotiate privilege.

J	Creagh, S				Creagh, Susan			'Language Background Other Than English': a problem NAPLaN test category for Australian students of refugee background	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						categorization; refugees; Language Background Other Than English; governmentality; English as a Second Language; NAPLAN	EDUCATION; LITERACY; ISSUES	Since 2008 Australia has held the National Assessment Program: Literacy and Numeracy (known as NAPLAN) for all students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9. Despite the multilingual character of the Australian population, these standardized literacy and numeracy tests are built on an assumption of English as a first language competency. The capacity for monitoring the performance of students who speak languages other than English is achieved through the disaggregation of test data using a category labelled Language Background Other than English (LBOTE). A student is classified as LBOTE if they or their parents speak a language other than English at home. The category definition is so broad that the disaggregated national data suggest that LBOTE students are outperforming English speaking students, on most test domains, though the LBOTE category shows greater variance of results. Drawing on Foucault's theory of governmentality, this article explores the possible implications of LBOTE categorisation for English as a Second Language (ESL) students of refugee background. The article uses a quantitative research project, carried out in Queensland, Australia, to demonstrate the potential inequities resultant from such a poorly constructed data category.

Luke			Examining academic variables affecting the persistence and attainment of black male collegians: a focus on academic performance and integration in the two-year college	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						black; African American; males; men; community college; two-year college	MODEL	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of academic variables (e.g., grade point average, major change, informal meetings with faculty) on six year persistence and attainment among black male students in community colleges. Data was collected from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study and was analyzed using logistic regression. Findings from this study indicated that select variables reflective of academic integration serve as significant predictors of black male persistence and attainment in the community college. These variables included students' grade point average, whether a student ever received an incomplete, repeating courses for higher grades, withdrawing from courses after the add or drop deadline, and informal meetings with faculty. Implications for future research are provided.

Leanne (untenured, Black mixed-race and middle class) and Susan (tenured, White and middle class) discuss their experiences and critical reflections related to teaching the course. In particular, the authors draw on Aoki's phenomenological concept of curriculum as lived to illuminate how the bodies in a classroom, the ideologies and beliefs of individuals, as well as structural (both macro and micro) forces at play influence what evolves as the curriculum. By interrogating key tensions, contradictions and challenges that arose when teaching the course, the authors point to how an understanding of curriculum as lived can enhance efforts to teach for social justice and equity goals.

J	Winograd, K				Winograd, Ken			Sports biographies of African American football players: the racism of colorblindness in children's literature	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						children's literature; racism; elementary education; sports biography		This is an exploratory study of racism in a genre of children's literature that has been largely overlooked by research and teaching in multicultural children's literature: sports biographies and, in particular, the biographies of African American professional football players. By examining the race bias of this genre of children's literature, the study addressed the question: How is race represented in the biographies of African American professional football players in texts written for elementary school-aged children? Critical race theory was used to inform the analysis of data, particularly as it relates to the relationship between the practice of race colorblindness and property as well as its promotion of storytelling by people of color as the central method of representing their biographies, for literary, cultural and legal purposes. After a textual analysis of eight popular biographies, the study found that these children's books tend to reflect the racism of colorblindness, in which the cultural and racial experience of African American football players is dismissed and ignored. Except for several brief references to the problems faced by black quarterbacks, there is no language or explicit reference to race in the texts examined, no mention of racism, no reference to African American history or traditions, no historiography of the players' families, and no reference to racism and the struggles of African Americans who live in the United States. Finally, non-standard forms of African American language are 'whited out' of the texts. The study ends with a proposal for a new genre for this type of book: biographies of African American athletes as well as all non-white people written from a culturally conscious perspective.

J	Johnstone, MJ; Kanitsaki, O				Johnstone, Megan-Jane; Kanitsaki, Olga			The politics of resistance to workplace cultural diversity education for health service providers: an Australian study	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						cultural diversity; continuing education; healthcare; health professions; ethnic disparities; racism; Australia	COMPETENCE; CARE; DISPARITIES	This qualitative study has as its focus an exploration of health service providers' perceptions and experiences of the processes and implications of delivering workplace cultural diversity education for staff. Data were obtained from conducting in-depth individual and focus group interviews with a purposeful sample of 137 healthcare professionals, recruited from over 17 different organizational sites. Participants included cultural diversity educators, ethnic liaison officers, health service managers, nurses, health interpreters, allied health professionals, and community-based ethnic welfare organization personnel working in or with select metropolitan health services in Victoria, Australia. Analysis of the data revealed that workplace cultural diversity education in healthcare is a significant site of resistance and struggle. 'Resistance' was expressed in several forms including: the problematization of resources and staff availability to attend cultural diversity education forums; indifferent failure to recognize cultural imperatives in healthcare; deliberate refusal to recognize cultural imperatives in healthcare; selective recognition of cultural imperatives in healthcare ('facts sheets' only); and the angry rejection of cultural imperatives in healthcare. 'Struggle', in turn, largely involved cultural diversity educators having to constantly 'cajole and convince' (and even manipulate) staff to attend cultural diversity education forums and using a 'velvet glove and iron fist' approach to teaching staff who remained resolute in their resistance when participating in educational forums. An important implication of this study is that the politics of workplace cultural diversity education - and the 'politics of resistance' to such programs - need to be better recognized and understood if the status quo is to be successfully challenged and changed.

J	Juarez, BG				Juarez, Brenda G.			The politics of race in two languages: an empirical qualitative study	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						dual language; race; teacher practices		Drawing upon critical analyses of participant observations of classrooms, school documents, and in-depth interviews with teachers, administrators, and school-district supervisors conducted from 1999 to 2002, this qualitative study employs a post-structuralist framework to probe one US public elementary school's quest to realize educational equity through dual language education. Focused on exploring the ways that students' racial identities influenced teachers' pedagogies, analyses of discourses and practices salient within the school's context revealed an ambivalent racial logic based on whiteness which paradoxically fostered the increased participation of English language learners in educational activities that constrained their access to valued learning resources and schooling opportunities.

J	Rhee, JE				Rhee, Jeong-eun			Risking to be wounded again: performing open eye/I	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asian/Korean immigrant; identity; postcolonial; racial minority relations; racialization; self-reflexive inquiry	IDENTITY; RACE	In this article, I narrate a self-reflexive inquiry on the process of becoming an Asian/Korean immigrant woman of color in the US. The purpose is to provide a particular insight and identity site to address the urgent need to examine ways in which the increasing number of postcolonial immigrants of color and US racial minorities engage with each other to make sense of our intersected but very differential impacts of racism. The article is organized using three vignettes on differently racialized encounters - my arrival to the racialized ruins of Korea town in LA as a newcomer, a recurring encounter with a racial epithet that defines me as Chinese, and an anti-racism session in an educational conference where I was disclaimed from being a person of color by another racialized group. Through these vignettes, I analyze the complex dynamics between very personal, affective experience and socio-political structure and actions that have constituted my still evolving palimpsest identity. In conclusion, I argue for the significance of performing open eye/I that risks being wounded again by not clinging to an unquestionable ideal of who we are and rather using it as a base to learn with others. This is to live those unknown possibilities of becoming through infinite practices of anti-racism toward the absence of racism.

J	Arneback, E; Jamte, J				Arneback, Emma; Jamte, Jan			How to counteract racism in education - A typology of teachers' anti-racist actions	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Anti-racist action in education; typology; pragmatism; structural racism; individual racism		In this article we develop a typology of anti-racist action in education. Using teachers' practices and experiences, we highlight six approaches on how teachers counter racism in their schools. Each approach entails a different set of actions and aims to address different manifestations of racism. They range from actions that seek to challenge structural racism (the emancipatory, norm-critical and intercultural perspectives), to approaches that engage individualized forms of racism (the relational, democratic and knowledge-focused perspectives). Our analysis makes the complexity of both racism and anti-racism visible. It provides an opportunity to navigate the various types of anti-racist actions, and make conscious decisions regarding what type should be used in relation to different manifestations of racism.

Critical race theory in education is employed to explain how the young men distance themselves from stereotypes about Black masculinity by regulating their own behaviour and differentiating themselves from their Caribbean immigrant peers. Sixty-seven young men who had immigrated to Southern Ontario from several African countries over the last 10 years were interviewed individually and in focus groups for the study. The findings suggest that the research participants adopted a model minority status within an educational system that clearly embodies racist and systemically oppressive frameworks.

J	Curammeng, ER				Curammeng, Edward R.			Advancing teacher preparation through ethnic studies: portraits of Filipino American self-identified male teachers	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Teacher education; ethnic studies; portraiture; critical race theory; Filipino American	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; STORY	At once a political and cultural intervention, Ethnic Studies as a field sought to create an education whereby students' knowledges and experiences were valued. While research demonstrating how Ethnic Studies affects students' academic and social-emotional outcomes, the prowess of Ethnic Studies, as a site for teacher preparation remains under examined in empirical research. Drawing from portraiture, critical race and Ethnic Studies frameworks, I analyze in-depth interviews, focus groups, and artifacts with Filipino American self-identified male teachers. I work to make explicit how Ethnic Studies prepared these teachers in ways their formal teacher education did not. I conclude with recommendations for how teacher education steeped in Ethnic Studies supports culturally sustaining, critically conscious, and community responsive learning for students and teachers committed to justice.

J	Woodson, AN; Bristol, TJ				Woodson, Ashley N.; Bristol, Travis J.			Male teachers of color: charting a new landscape for educational research	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Editorial Material						Male teachers of color; race; gender; social identities; intersectionality	BLACK-MALE TEACHERS; ROLE-MODELS; RACE; EXPERIENCES; POLITICS; STUDENTS; ACHIEVEMENT; POWER; LIFE	The manuscripts in this special issue chart a new landscape for educational research on male teachers of color.The contributors examine the lived complexities subsumed under the umbrella of 'male teachers of color,' and place research on distinct groups of male teachers of color in conversation with one another.The manuscripts in this special issue reflect the diversity and possibility of critical research in education, with an emphasis on the examination of the intersections of social identities for male teachers of color, and the relationship between social identity and struggles for political and professional agency. The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation for filling the empirical gap on male teachers of color by engaging in questions such as: How do critical considerations of the intersection of race, gender, and profession inform the future of teacher education? What does it mean to be 'male' or 'of color' in the context of the teaching profession? What are the aims of racial and ethnic diversity in the field of education? The research included in this special issue explores topics including, but not limited to, male teachers of color's perceptions of and partnerships with colleagues of other genders; their sexual and gendered identities and performances; and how they embrace, reject, or negotiate the expectation of performing as a role model in the classroom. Moreover, the articles provide explicit implications for teachers, teacher educators, university and PK-12 administrators, education activists and/or education policymakers.

J	Baldridge, BJ				Baldridge, Bianca J.			Negotiating anti-black racism in 'liberal' contexts: the experiences of black youth workers in community-based educational spaces	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Anti-Black racism; community-based education; youth workers; racial liberalism	AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS; WHITENESS; RESOURCE; POLICY	This paper examines how Black community-based youth workers navigate anti-Black racism in their educational programming with Black youth in a majority white college town widely recognized as 'nice,' 'liberal,' and 'progressive' with stark racial disparities between its Black and white residents. With racial liberalism and BlackCrit as theoretical guides, this paper draws on in-depth interviews with Black youth workers and observations at city events addressing racial disparities facing Black youth to understand how anti-Black racism within the larger city informs community-based educational programming. Findings indicate a 1) disregard of Black suffering, 2) deliberate shutdown of critical race dialogue and programming, and 3) the exploitation of Black youth workers' labor and the denial of advancement to positions of leadership within organizations to do white discomfort. This paper challenges liberal and progressive claims of social justice in education within predominantly white cities that reify anti-Black racism.

J	Turner, JD				Turner, Jennifer D.			Freedom to aspire: Black children's career dreams, perceived aspirational supports, and Africentric values	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Career aspirations; Black futures; Africentric values; Black children; drawings	SUCCESS; SCHOOL; MEN	Black children today fight to define their own futurity beyond the myth of low aspirations - a dominant societal ideology which limits Black success to careers in professional sports and entertainment and blames Black families and communities for devaluing education. Informed by career aspiration research and qualitative methodologies, this study illuminates the career dreams and aspirations of Black children ages 8 to 14 years old enrolled in a summer reading program. Analyses of drawings and interviews from 12 focal children demonstrate how Black youth: 1) articulated career aspirations through Africentric values related to Black self-determination, collective uplift and personal interests; and 2) perceived familial and community support for career aspirations as nurturing relationships, specialized career knowledge, and academic support.

J	Francis, DA				Francis, Dennis A.			?Oh my word; for us African gays it?s another story.? Revealing the intersections between race, same sex-sexuality and schooling in South Africa	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Race; queer youth; schooling; homophobia; intersectionality; South Africa	QUEER YOUTH; HOMOPHOBIA; APARTHEID; RIGHTS; EXPERIENCES; DIVERSITY; EDUCATION; TEACHERS; STRAIGHT	In South Africa, the connection between race and sexuality cannot be ignored nor can the link between racism and heterosexism. Arguing that race is a significant aspect of sexual citizenship in South Africa, this article explores the relationship between sexuality, race, and schooling of queer youth and the priorities this relationship holds for schooling. Using in-depth interviews with same-sex attracted school-attending youth, this paper makes two arguments. First, it highlights the criticality of race, racialisation and racism in the lives of queer youth. Second, it highlights how race, racialisation and racism contribute to a normalising view of heterosexuality in some contexts and, in others, contradicts the power of heterosexuality. Recommendations for educators and researchers to attend to the diversity among queer populations as they relate to young peoples? race and other social identities are made.

J	Grosland, TJ				Grosland, Tanetha Jamay			Through laughter and through tears: emotional narratives to antiracist pedagogy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Antioppressive pedagogy; antiracist pedagogy; emotions; curriculum theory; higher education	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; TEACHER; EDUCATION; WHITENESS; POLITICS; INQUIRY; ISSUES	If as a collective society we desire to challenge oppression as it exists, we must individually commit to learning about race, in all its facets, and racism as an institution at an emotional level. Although there are many ways to accomplish these ends, antiracist pedagogy - as antioppressive education - is an effective method to do so through its focus on the intersections of race. This study shares how participants in a higher education classroom emotionally experienced studying race and racism. Using a narrative inquiry hybrid, results of this inquiry include how emotions are at the core of such learning, particularly because they can be racially segregated and relationally complex. The lack of research about the relationship between racism and emotions is felt acutely in higher education classrooms, so this study contributes to our understandings of antioppressive pedagogy in such classrooms. Since the overall goal of antiracist pedagogy is antiracist change and classroom emotions are an impending result, the dilemma of focusing on emotions persists. Subsequent implications for antiracist pedagogy specifically, and antioppressive pedagogies broadly, include explicitly addressing the emotionality of antiracism as an ongoing praxis.

Students completed an anonymous questionnaire about their perceptions of school climate and school disciplinary practices. Results showed racial and ethnic differences in perceptions of teacher treatment, suspension practices, and school climate. Race was the most significant predictor of perceptions of differential suspension practices and teacher treatment among students. For Black students, perceptions of differential treatment helped predict school climate perceptions. Students' perceptions of unequal treatment of racial groups influence their experiences in school. We discuss research-based approaches that address systemic practices and policies, professional training of school personnel and provision of student services to help improve the school experiences of Black and other minority students and reduce the equity gap.

Drawing upon critical race theory (CRT) and its interconnection to the model minority myth, the most dominant form of racism against Asians as theoretical underpinnings, this study focuses on: (1) Korean American teachers' unique experiences of being racial minority educators teaching a contentious subject like social studies within culturally and linguistically diverse school settings; and (2) the influences of the model minority racial stereotype on the teachers' career choice, professional experiences, and associated coping strategies. This study aims to shed light on the heterogeneous stories and ethnoracially contextualized teaching experiences of Asian American teachers and to provide meaningful insights into and practical implications for the preparation and retention of teachers of color.

J	Singh, MV				Singh, Michael V.			Role models without guarantees: corrective representations and the cultural politics of a Latino male teacher in the borderlands	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Latino males; mentorship; Cultural Studies; corrective representation	BLACK-MALE; EDUCATION; BOYS	In recent years mentorship has become a popular solution' for struggling boys of color and has led to the recruitment of more male of color teachers. While not arguing against the merits of mentorship, this article critiques what the author deems corrective representations.' Corrective representations are the imagined embodiment of proper and productive masculinities that male of color educators are asked to perform. This discourse perpetuates confining representations of identity and locates the problem of boys of color within their own actions. Designed as an ethnographic case study, this article explores the life of one Latino male teacher as he navigates discourses of corrective representation as coordinator of his school's Latino boys program. This project provides a detailed account of the cultural politics of Latino male mentorship and offers the notion of a critical borderlands approach to identity as an avenue to problematize essentialist and deficit approaches to Latino boys.

J	Pechenkina, E				Pechenkina, Ekaterina			'It becomes almost an act of defiance': indigenous Australian transformational resistance as a driver of academic achievement	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Transformational resistance; indigeneity; indigenous Australians; academic success; identity; minority education	STUDENTS; IDENTITY	Indigenous Australian underrepresentation in higher education remains a topical issue for social scientists, educationalists and policymakers alike, with the concept of indigenous academic success highly contested. This article is based on findings of a doctoral study investigating the drivers of indigenous Australian academic success in a large, public, research-intensive and metropolitan Australian university. It draws on the concept of transformational resistance to illuminate the forms that indigenous resistance takes and how identities of resistance performed by indigenous students complicate and speak to the students' notions of academic success. By drawing on ethnographic data, this article demonstrates how indigenous academic success is fuelled by the idea of resistance to the Western dominance, where resistance becomes the very cornerstone of indigenous achievement.

An initial exploration of a community-based framework for educational equity with explicated exemplars	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Equity; race; racism; historically marginalized; community	ROUGH ROCK; SCHOOL; STUDENTS; GAPS	Educational equity dominates discussions of US schooling. However, what educational equity' means is much contested in the scholarly literature and in public discourses. We follow the lead of scholars of color who have problematized the definition of educational equity. They have shown that the dominant, taken-for-granted definitions of equity which disguises the accumulation of societal and educational exclusions of and prejudices toward historically marginalized students, their families, and their communities. In response to this critique, we offer a new definitional framework for educational equity' that is community-based and, in our specific case, urban community-based. And, then, we will apply this new equity framework to three examples or exemplars' of education reform to explicate how they do and do not illustrate our framework. We will finish with a brief discussion, recommendations for future scholarship, and some concluding remarks.

J	Cann, CN; McCloskey, E				Cann, Colette N.; McCloskey, Erin			The Poverty Pimpin' Project: how whiteness profits from black and brown bodies in community service programs	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical race theory; town-gown; engaged university; community service; tutoring; racism	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EDUCATION; PROPERTY	Tutoring programs that link colleges to public schools are seen as a way to improve the academic performance of K12 students while providing a practicum site for college-age students. Prior research on college-K12 partnerships focuses on how the academic achievement of both K12 and college students are enhanced by these relationships. This article challenges the stock story that such outreach programs are unproblematic and entirely altruistic endeavors and offers insight into the bumpy terrain of town-gown relationships complicated by race, class and academic divides. Using critical race methodology, this research tells a counter-story that highlights the white savior and poverty pimpin' projects of outreach work.

J	Harris, P; Haywood, C; Mac an Ghaill, M				Harris, Pete; Haywood, Chris; Mac an Ghaill, Mairtin			Higher education, de-centred subjectivities and the emergence of a pedagogical self among Black and Muslim students	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Pedagogy; self; generation; higher education; racialisation		This article explores late modern Black and Muslim young men's and women's experiences of higher education. Carrying out qualitative research with 14 male and female young people, these students claimed that their Youth and Community Work course at their university made available an alternative representational space, enabling them to develop a major transformation of their sense of identity and self. In deploying the term pedagogical self, we are attempting to capture their naming pedagogy as central, in their terms, to the reinvention of their selves'. We conclude by suggesting that our research participants' narratives are located within an exploration of late modern identity and the self in higher education. In turn, this enables us to reflect on a generational shift in meanings around racialisation and difference in thinking about the future of higher education in Britain.

J	Carrillo, JF; Rodriguez, E				Carrillo, Juan F.; Rodriguez, Esmeralda			She doesn't even act Mexican: smartness trespassing in the new south	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						New Latino diaspora; Latin@ education; race and ethnicity; smartness	STUDENTS	Historically, Latin@s have experienced deficit thinking as it relates to their perceived academic abilities. In North Carolina's emerging Latin@ population, the first waves of K-12 students are writing a new chapter in the state's history. Yet, there is a dearth of research that focuses on the identities of academically successful Latin@ students in the state. This qualitative study examines the politics and discrimination associated with claiming a smart identity' in the new south by documenting the experiences of a high-achieving Latina high school student. We introduce and use the term, smartness trespassing,' to capture this tension.

J	Kolano, L				Kolano, Lan			Smartness as cultural wealth: an AsianCrit counterstory	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Cultural wealth; immigrant education; Asian-American experience; narrative	MODEL MINORITY; CRITICAL RACE; STUDENTS; ACCESS	Historically, Asians have been defined by a range of negative and positive images that include the coolie, the deviant, the yellow peril, and the model minority. However, the negative images have been slowly and robustly replaced with ones that portray Asian Americans as high achievers, smart, and a model - especially when compared to other students of color. For many Asian American students, smartness' as a cultural practice and an imposed attribute has become synonymous with whiteness - impacting their academic, social, cultural, and language identities. Utilizing reflexive ethnography, I share what I name cultural wealth as smartness' as a Vietnamese refugee student growing up in a predominantly white community and the cultural capital gained and lost as a result.

J	Urrieta, L				Urrieta, Luis, Jr.			Diasporic community smartness: saberes (knowings) beyond schooling and borders	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Diaspora; saberes; smartness; indigenous	UNITED-STATES; TRANSNATIONALISM; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; CHILDREN; FAMILY	This article presents ethnographic data of US Mexican-indigenous heritage children's transnational experiences during return visits to Mexico. US-born children and youth's acquisition of transnational diasporic community knowledge, in this article, is studied as a form of smartness.' Diasporic community knowledge is defined as the saberes (knowings) and smartness' developed in relation with familia (family) and community life that originate, in this case, in the pueblo of San Miguel Nocutzepo, and that span the geo-physical and geo-political spaces of migration to and from the US. This study finds that these return visit experiences and the saberes/smartness acquired and developed through them were valuable to families and children because they socialize US Mexican-indigenous heritage children and youth in different knowledge systems, and allow them a smartness that is ancestral and that encourages mature participation in diasporic family and community life across transnational social fields.

Autoethnography and performance ethnography are utilized to examine the ways in which whiteness can remain unexamined throughout the research process due to the construction of white positional identities within the figured world of research. White privilege and white talk, specifically white silence and hyperpoliteness as they relate to white researchers conducting research, are used critique the research purpose and process. The researchers conclude that white researchers should attend to questions of privilege and white racial identity as they plan, conduct, and disseminate their research.

J	Petchauer, E				Petchauer, Emery			Passing as white: race, shame, and success in teacher licensure testing events for black preservice teachers	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						teacher licensure; identity threats; testing events; black teachers	WOMENS MATH PERFORMANCE; STEREOTYPE THREAT; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; WORKING-MEMORY; EDUCATION; PERSISTENCE; GENDER; SCORES	This qualitative portraiture study explored how race becomes a conscious and salient dimension of teacher licensure exams for black preservice teachers. The findings focus on one black preservice teacher and how she identified as white on the demographic survey preceding her licensure exam due to the racialized nature of the experience and the intense pressure to pass the exam. The findings illustrate how the technical means of test administration coupled with the racialized discourse about black students and standardized tests were important factors in her decision to identify as white. The findings also illustrate how feelings of shame and conciliatory hard work were byproducts of this decision and influenced her subsequent preparation for licensure exams. From these findings, the article discusses steps that test designers and faculty members can take to decrease the racialized aspect of teacher licensure exams. This study has specific relevance to countries such as the United States and England that use licensure exams as gatekeepers to the teaching profession.

J	Adjei, PB; Gill, JK				Adjei, Paul Banahene; Gill, Jagjeet Kaur			What has Barack Obama's election victory got to do with race? A closer look at post-racial rhetoric and its implication for antiracism education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; racism; post-raciality; antiracism	POLITICS	Our charge in this article is that it is becoming almost impossible to speak about race after Obamas election victory because for many Canadians and Americans, the election of Barack Hussein Obama as the first African American President of the United States ushered the US into a post-racial era. This thinking not only obfuscates any discussion about race and racism but also ignores the historical and contemporary evidence of racism in the United States. For those of us living in Canada, we cannot help but examine the post-racial rhetoric and its implications for antiracism education in Canada and the United States. The article asks these questions: if race is analytically reductive and has no intellectual validity, then what is the social significance of race in the era ushered in by Obamas election victory. How do we address the limits and possibilities of defining race as an ascribed status linked with physical characteristics of skin colour and pigmentation while engaging race and social difference in a power and conflict analysis? How do we contextualize concepts such as race, racism, and post-raciality to the broader process of institutional and structural transformation in the era ushered in by Obamas election victory? Our article invites complex and multiple discussions on these questions and their implication for antiracism education in Canada and the United States.

J	Hamilton, J; Bloomer, F; Potter, M				Hamilton, Jennifer; Bloomer, Fiona; Potter, Michael			The adequacy of Traveller education in Northern Ireland	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Travellers; education; equality; segregation; policy and legislation	SOCIAL EXCLUSION; GYPSY	The issues facing Travellers, including those associated with education are often linked to social exclusion, widespread disadvantage and discrimination (Reynolds, McCartan, and Knipe 2003). The Office for Standards in Education (Office for Standards in Education 1999) referred to Gypsy Traveller pupils as 'the most at risk in the education system.' Within this article issues pertaining to Traveller education are discussed and in particular accessing education provision in Northern Ireland. The article focuses on the views of the statutory and voluntary sector to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of educational provision for Traveller children and young people and reviews the policies in place relating to the provision of education for Travellers in Northern Ireland. It also considers the issue of segregated education for the Traveller community and how for some this segregation can exacerbate social exclusion, disadvantage and discrimination.

J	Oller, J; Vila, I; Zufiaurre, B				Oller, Judith; Vila, Ignasi; Zufiaurre, Benjamin			Student and teacher perceptions of school involvement and their effect on multicultural education: a Catalonian survey	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						immigration; anti-racist education; hidden attitudes; school involvement; secondary education; Catalonia		In multilingual schools students have diverse identities, cultural backgrounds, perceptions, capacities and linguistic experiences. The space for teaching and learning is also mediated by stereotypes and prejudices associated with this diversity. Diversity, stereotypes and prejudices shape how teachers and learners operate in a world of complex social relationships. In this survey we explore the hidden attitudes of immigrant students and teachers in secondary education in Catalonia (Spain). The research uses the distinction between explicit and implicit attitudes to analyse immigrant students' perceptions and teachers' subconscious perceptions about school involvement. The sample includes 4078 immigrant students with more than six months of residence in the host country that were attending linguistic support classes in secondary schools of Catalonia during the year 2006-2007, and also their regular classroom teachers and support teachers. The survey aims to establish if is there any statistically significant associations between the attitudes of newcomer students and teachers, and the linguistic and geographical origins of the students. We wanted to know if teacher and student perceptions agreed or differed and to characterise stereotypes and prejudices affecting positive or negative attitudes about the organisation of teaching while learning. The results show how the teachers' perceptions about newcomer students' involvement differ in many cases from the views of the students, and how lower expectations and subjective manifestations of racism are evident with some groups, especially with students of African origin.

J	Schulz, S				Schulz, Samantha			White teachers and the 'good' governance of Indigenous souls: white governmentality and Ernabella Mission (1937-1971)	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Anangu education; white teachers; goodness; whiteness; identity; genealogy	AUSTRALIA; CURRICULUM; EDUCATION	This paper develops out of research concerning the place of white teachers and social constructions of 'white good' in South Australia's Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) lands. Here I focus on an era known as the Ernabella 'mission days' (1937-1971), a time when Presbyterian missionaries are typically thought to have provided the Anangu people of the region with an environment in which they were 'free' to remain 'traditional' and take or leave the gift of Western education; Anangu is the name the Indigenous people of the region use self-referentially. Adopting a genealogical standpoint I interrogate the implications of these claims for Anangu, highlighting ways that Anangu education is nowadays shaped through reference to a golden past. Drawing on memoir and official correspondence, my focus is the white mission teacher's negotiation of discourse and entanglement in reproductions of race. I suggest that discourses of whiteness and progressivism are central to the making of a 'good' white missionary teacher at Ernabella. Within the logic of these discourses, identity is conceived as essential and the 'goodness' of the Ernabella missionary settles quickly into truth. To trouble these relations, I disrupt binary tropes of good or bad whites upon which the white missionary's benevolent moral status frequently relies. Far from ensuring more freedom, this research suggests that the Ernabella missionary was implicated in extending a system of disciplinary control over Anangu bodies, minds and souls, and in securing the racial order through habitual recourse to hegemonic whiteness. I argue that more detailed historical analyses of 'white good' are required if the past is to provide a rigorous basis for rethinking the present.

J	Sue, CA				Sue, Christina A.			Raceblindness in Mexico: implications for teacher education in the United States	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; education; Mexico	AFRICAN-AMERICAN; PREPARING TEACHERS; RACIAL-ATTITUDES; RACE; PERCEPTIONS; STUDENTS; COLOR; WHITENESS	The demographic make-up of US public schools indicates an increasing divergence between the racial background of teachers and that of their students: Whites represent approximately 90% of all public school teachers whereas 40% of students are of color. Further complicating the situation is the fact that many of the students of color are first-generation immigrants. The US education system is struggling to adapt to the changing nature of America's classrooms. Many have pointed out how the US educational system has become dysfunctional, especially for children who are not part of the linguistic and racial mainstream. Some scholars blame an inconsistency between the racial frames held by White teachers and those embraced by their students of color. It is argued that Whites are oftentimes colorblind whereas students of color are usually color conscious. However, this assumption may not hold for first-generation immigrants who bring their racial discourses from their home countries. For example, Mexican immigrants may bring color-blind frameworks which are common in Mexico. In this article I outline the predominant racial frames used by mixed-race Mexicans. I draw on 109 semi-structured interviews and focus group data collected over the course of one year in Veracruz, Mexico. In discussing racial frames in Mexico, I seek to provide teachers and educators in the US with conceptual tools to work with the Mexican immigrant population. Finally, I propose that we should address issues of racial frames from a broader, global perspective, incorporating the experiences of various racial and ethnic groups into teacher education.

J	Van de Kleut, G				Van de Kleut, Geraldine			The whiteness of literacy practice in Ontario	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; literacy; critical race theory	CRITICAL RACE THEORY	In the spring of 2008, the Literacy and Numeracy Secretariat of the Ontario Ministry of Education in Canada released a DVD that was one in a series designed to train literacy teachers in what the Ministry referred to as 'high-yield' comprehension strategies. Using the lens of Critical Race Theory, this article analyses the picture book used in the model lesson as well as the teaching methods recommended for all Ontarian teachers in the DVD. While the selection of the picture book fits the present policies of multiculturalism in Ontario, its romanticized portrayal of an indigenous people serves to perpetuate racism, particularly in the uncritical reading demonstrated in the DVD. In addition, the teaching methods demonstrated as 'high-yield' arise from the global movement towards standardization in education, and establish measurable student achievement, in a classroom portrayed as socially neutral, as the end goal of education. Nowhere in this model lesson, given in a multiracial classroom where minority races are both invisible and deficit, is difference acknowledged as present or important. The result is that this DVD, designed to be used as a training resource in all Ontarian elementary schools, serves to re-inscribe the whiteness of literacy practice in Ontario, and to silence the possibilities for debate and negotiation that are the hallmarks of democratic education.

I examine strategic essentialism and cultural difference in ways of being Malay-Muslim, Chinese and Indian women. I highlight the ways in which ethnic and gender politics privileges and marginalizes ways of being and knowing within contemporary postcolonial Malaysia. This paper raises important issues of doing research on multiple identities in challenging and changing globalized ethnic and gendered spaces of education and work.

J	Busey, CL				Busey, Christopher L.			Diaspora Literacy and Afro-Latin Humanity: a Critical Studyin' case study of a world history teacher's critical sociohistorical knowledge development	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Afro-Latinx; Afro-Latin American; Diaspora Literacy; black history; world history curriculum; social studies education	BLACK; CONSCIOUSNESS; MISEDUCATION; AMERICA; PEOPLE; RACISM; RACE	The development of critical sociohistorical knowledge is needed to assist teachers in negotiating and deconstructing the relevance of race, racism, and black history in global-themed social studies courses. Drawing from Diaspora Literacy as theory and Critical Studyin' as method, I situate Afro-Latin humanity within educational research relevant to black history knowledge development, and its proximity to the teaching and learning of race in social studies education. This Critical Studyin' case study examined how one world history teacher developed critical sociohistorical knowledge relevant to Afro-Latin humanity, inclusive of Afro-Latinxs and Afro-Latin Americans. Concurrently, I analyzed how the teacher positioned their knowledge for a Diaspora Literacy conceptualization of world history curriculum. Findings point to the utility of black studies frameworks in aiding social studies teachers' knowledge development. I conclude with a call to more appropriately situate Afro-Latin humanity within curricular and educational research discourses relevant to black education.

J	Breen, D				Breen, Damian			Critical Race Theory, policy rhetoric and outcomes: the case of Muslim schools in Britain	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; Muslim communities; Muslim schools		The expansion of state-funded Muslim schools in Britain since 1998 has developed against a backdrop of sustained public political rhetoric around the wider position of British Muslims in both political and educational contexts. This article explores the public policy rhetoric around Muslim schools under New Labour and the subsequent Coalition and Conservative governments and compares how these narratives align with outcomes in terms of numbers of, and types of, denominational Muslim faith schools in Britain. The article applies a Critical Race Theory approach based on the construction of counter-narrative through a critical analysis of policy and its outcomes. This analysis is contextualised through exploring the implications of counter-terror strategies such as Prevent for the political and educational equity of British Muslims as stakeholders in the state. Against this context the article explores the extent to which successive policy frameworks and political narratives around faith schooling have played out in terms of denominational state-funded Muslim schools. Whilst gains have been made under New Labour and the successive Coalition and Conservative governments, critical analysis reveals that public policy narratives allow for a misleading account of the extent to which Muslim communities have been enfranchised through state funding for Islamic schools.

Inspired by Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy theory, the program sought to empower learners to challenge their pre-existing knowledge and experience of interracial relations. Drawing on data from observations, interviews, and document reviews, we describe the process by which the program shaped Vietnamese immigrant youth's critical consciousness of Vietnamese/Asian-black interracial tension. While some participants expressed apprehension and prejudice toward African Americans, particularly in the early days of the program, by the end, participants demonstrated knowledge retained from lessons and activities on the shared history of Vietnamese immigrants and African Americans. Participants also identified roots of and offered solutions to interracial tension. This study illuminates the role of immigrant youth organizing programs in resolving interracial tension in multiracial contexts.

They receive little in the way of multicultural preparation, mentorship, and professional induction to meet the demands of teaching diverse student populations. This grounded theory study explores the experiences of novice teachers from various minority backgrounds working in urban classrooms. A tentative grounded theory, I am here for a reason' emerged, suggesting that minority teachers rely on their personal backgrounds and experiences to help them take an insider's perspective with minority students in light of poor multicultural preparation and limited support in schools. The shared cultural perspective with students enables teachers to connect with and advocate for students, which represents both a strength and challenge for minority teachers. Finally, minority teachers are motivated by a strong desire for social justice as they work to bridge many divides, and are intentional in their work despite facing significant obstacles in training and teaching.

J	Schulz, S				Schulz, Samantha			Desire for the desert: racialising white teachers' motives for working in remote schools in the Australian desert	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						White teacher; whiteness; desire; Australian desert; identity; remoteness; three Ms; tourist; social justice		Distinct from rurality, the Australian desert has long functioned as a signifier of remoteness in the dominant imagination; a product of spatialised binary relations between progressive' (white) mainstream or idealised white countryside, and disordered/dangerous Aboriginal periphery. Remoteness constitutes a complex racial dynamic that has historically mediated white teachers' and missionaries' desires to travel to the social margins. This article adopts a discursive understanding of remoteness to examine contemporary white teachers' decisions to work in Aboriginal schools in the desert - decisions that are often articulated through unwitting recourse to the three Ms' or tourist'. The article explores these identity constructs and how they enable different performances of whiteness. It examines how white people's desires are often covertly raced but does not however, position the teacher as a priori racist. Rather, desire is theorised as a social construct in which subjects invest, which may at times contribute toward processes of decolonisation. This rendering moves beyond a logic of individualism and underpins the argument that recognising how these dynamics play out is vital with respect to understanding the place of white teachers inside remote Indigenous Education.

J	Bondy, JM				Bondy, Jennifer M.			Negotiating domination and resistance: English language learners and Foucault's Care of the Self in the context of English-only education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						English language learners (ELL) students; English-only; race; language; care of the self; resistance	TEACHERS; ARIZONA; AMERICA; RACE	This article explores the basis for resistance to the normalizing technologies associated with English-only legislation and resulting educational practices. The dominance of English-only education in US public schools has normalized English first language speakers and English language learning by appropriating the technology of language in order to become Americanized.' Because of the growing number of English language learners (ELL) in US public schools, it is important to understand how the normalizing educational practices and disciplinary power associated with English-only education also cultivate possibilities for resistance. I draw upon Foucault's analytic care of the self to explore the space of English-only education by asking: What alternatives to the normalization of ELL students might be mobilized for resistance?' This analysis suggests that to shift from a normalized American' identity requires questioning the racist and nativist discourse on English-only education, and focusing attention on contradictory and multilayered notions of American'. The article concludes with recommendations for teacher education on how to cultivate prospective teachers' resistance to English-only education.

'Chinese-Mexicans' and 'Blackest Asians': Filipino American youth resisting the racial binary	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; ethnicity; identity; diversity; discourse; colorblindness; Asian Americans; Filipinos; racial discourse; racial continuum; New York City	BOUNDARIES	This study provides a deeper understanding of the interracial connections not just between non-whites and whites, but among non-whites. Filipino American youth attending high school in New York City contended with a dominant bipolar racial discourse that marginalizes the racialized experiences of Asians and Pacific Islanders. However, instead of feeling invisible or marginalized, data point to how they negotiated a black-white racial discourse to decide when and how they enter dialogues about race. Filipino youth reconceptualized this racial binary to position themselves on a continuum to form the racial middle ground' between blacks and whites. Importantly, rather than a racial hierarchy that places whites at the top, youth used discursive strategies to place themselves on a racial continuum that emphasizes the interconnectedness among racial minorities.

The data for this analysis come from a study examining the evolution of White teacher candidates' understandings and practices related to diversity as they experienced different parts of an undergraduate teacher education program over a two-semester period. We describe the case of one of the students, Michelle, focusing on the contradiction between Michelle's intense engagement, hard work and enjoyment in her required Foundations course and her simultaneous rejection of core ideas of the course. We show how Kegan's model is helpful in explaining this contradiction and discuss implications for teacher educators.

J	Charbeneau, J				Charbeneau, Jessica			White faculty transforming whiteness in the classroom through pedagogical practice	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						whiteness; pedagogy; faculty; race; hegemony; postsecondary education	INSTRUCTOR; COLOR	The primary objective of this qualitative study is to present a conceptual framework of pedagogical practices reported by white faculty that serve to challenge the hegemony of whiteness in the university classroom. These transformative teaching practices surfaced through a review of racialized pedagogies discussed in the literature and in interviews with a small sample of white faculty formally or informally recognized for their skill teaching in diverse classrooms. In an effort to bring greater resonance to these teaching practices, parallels are drawn between these practices and behaviors that take place in everyday social relations that also serve to transform white dominance. Included here are the following forms of interactions: Expressing racial awareness by disclosing personal whiteness, acknowledging and attending to plurality and revealing patterns of white hegemony; and challenging white supremacy by creating alliances and acting to alter structures and cultures. Presentation of these findings in a categorization system provides clarity about some ways whiteness is being transformed within higher education and offers a pragmatic guide for faculty and postsecondary institutions committed to faculty development around diversity issues.

Disappearing ethnic homogeneity in Czech classrooms and teachers' responses	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						ethnic diversity; pupils from ethnic minorities; education; teachers' perceptions; social disadvantage	RACE	This article argues that the Czech education system is structured to operate in an ethnically homogeneous society. Although the Czech Republic is becoming increasingly heterogeneous, teachers deploy discursive practices of ?sameness despite difference' that obscure such growing diversity. This article is grounded in the historical context of migration to and from the Czech Republic and based on ethnographic research in several ethnically-mixed classrooms. We analyze the ways in which teachers talk about their pupils. We show that in the case of migrant children, teachers tend not to see their differences and hence, their potentially structural disadvantages. On the other hand, the Roma ethnicity is perceived as insurmountable. Teachers mobilize lists of cultural and even genetic differences to legitimize their different treatment of Roma pupils. Furthermore, we analyze policy documents regarding the education of non-Czech pupils and their reception by teachers. All these strategies result in the continuing perception of Czech classrooms as ethnically homogeneous while disregarding any social inequalities.

J	Luna, N; Evans, WP; Davis, B				Luna, Nora; Evans, William P.; Davis, Bret			Indigenous Mexican culture, identity and academic aspirations: results from a community-based curriculum project for Latina/Latino students	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						ethnic identity; indigenous culture; academic aspirations; Mesocentric curriculum; program evaluation	MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE; EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES; ETHNIC-IDENTITY; PERSPECTIVES; ACHIEVEMENT; EXPERIENCES; ADOLESCENTS; AMERICAN; FAMILIES	The Latina/Latino population is the largest minority group in the United States and has the highest high school dropout rate of any ethnic group. Nationally, just over one-half of Latina/Latino students graduate on time with a regular diploma, compared to nearly 80% of Whites. Because of the growing population and the wide achievement gap, there is utility in understanding factors, strategies and programs that facilitate the academic performance of Latina/Latino students in order to address a serious social justice issue in education. This study examines a community-based cultural program about indigenous Mesoamerican traditions and heritage. Results of the mixed-method evaluation study include quantitative and qualitative data for 225 high school students who were primarily Latina/Latino. Students participated in a program based on Mesoamerican ancestry that sought to enhance academic aspirations and reduce high school dropout intentions. Survey results indicated positive changes in ethnic identity and improvements in academic aspirations. Interviews revealed enhanced attachment to ethnic identity and higher academic aspirations, as well as how the program could be improved for future participants. Implications of this culturally relevant curriculum as a strategy to enhance student academic motivation and aspirations are discussed.

J	Webb, A				Webb, Andrew			Indigenous schooling grants in Chile: the impacts of an integrationist affirmative action policy among Mapuche pupils	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						multiculturalism; indigenous grants; ethnic identity; Chilean education; education policy	EQUITY; RESISTANCE; EDUCATION	This article assesses the extent to which indigenous grants administered to school pupils and university students in Chile can be considered affirmative action towards social justice. Drawing on Fraser's framework for parity of participation, I question whether the grants are able to provide both redistribution and recognition for indigenous pupils. I provide a historical policy analysis of education reform in regards to indigenous populations, and a discussion of secondary school Mapuche pupils' responses to governmental compensatory measures. Indigenous grants have long been employed as a strategy for increasing indigenous pupils' participation in the education system, but when viewed from a critical perspective, do little to alleviate inequalities in a culturally homogenising and strongly neoliberal-led education system. The article demonstrates that by viewing the impact of these policies - ingrained in a structural history of exclusion and discrimination - from the ground up, nuanced effects on pupils' ethnic identity formation can also be perceived. Drawing on data from 20 focus groups conducted in the Araucania Region of Chile, I argue that indigenous grants can have adverse effects on family and community relations, whilst also causing negative self and public perception regarding achievement disparities. Without further reform to the education system and the grants themselves, they may only provide an impetus for improving access to a mono-cultural discriminatory schooling system.

J	Stern, M; Hussain, K				Stern, Mark; Hussain, Khuram			On the charter question: black Marxism and black nationalism	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						black Marxism; education; charter schools; black nationalism	SCHOOL; TEACHERS; BROWN	This article brings two black intellectual traditions to bear on the question of charter schools: black Marxism and black nationalism. The authors examine the theoretical and rhetorical devices used to talk about charters schools by focusing on how notions of 'black liberation' are deployed by the charter movement, and to what end. The authors first use a black Marxism lens to illustrate the character of the racial and economic relationships facilitated by charter schools. Next, the authors use historical methods to contextualize the liberation discourse of school choice proponents within a black nationalist history of school reform. The authors conclude that 'choice' rhetoric makes claim to the black freedom struggle without addressing its most enduring commitments to social justice and self-determination, ultimately perpetuating dependency by oppressed people upon their oppressors. The study identifies the limitations of contemporary critical theory to excavate several dimensions of racism in educational policy and highlight the need for scholars to draw on black intellectual traditions to evaluate the theoretical and historical significance of contemporary educational reform.

J	Pearce, S				Pearce, Sarah			Dealing with racist incidents: what do beginning teachers learn from schools?	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; institutional racism; whiteness; beginning teachers; student teachers; racist incidents	STUDENT-TEACHERS; RACE EQUALITY; WHITENESS; DIVERSITY	This article focuses on how schools respond to racist incidents, and what new teachers learn from their involvement in those processes. It analyses four incidents involving the pupils of four beginning teachers. The article suggests that in each case, schools either partly or wholly avoided addressing the incident, and that this avoidance can be understood in terms of the colour and power evasive discourse, which is the dominant discourse on race in Western societies, and in most schools. One aspect of this discourse is that racism is defined on the basis of individual intentions, not outcomes. The article argues that it may be possible to adopt a more race cognisant approach with student teachers and staff in schools, building on nascent understandings of institutional racism, which shifts the focus to outcomes rather than intentions. The article demonstrates this approach, analysing each incident in terms of its consequences for the learning of the new teacher, and for the promotion of race equality in the school. While the small number of incidents may initially appear heartening, their negative impact on both teacher confidence and children's understanding may be significant. The findings suggest that in the changing context of initial teacher education in England, approaches to supporting both schools and new teachers in this often misunderstood area are much needed, and that one way forward may be to give teachers time and support to critically reflect on and discuss their experiences.

J	Smith, WL; Brown, AL				Smith, William L.; Brown, Anthony L.			Beyond post-racial narratives: Barack Obama and the (re) shaping of racial memory in US schools and society	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Obama; race; post-racial; curriculum; narrative	BLACK POLITICS; HISTORY; RACE; REPRESENTATIONS; VIOLENCE; BROWN; MYTH	Drawing from the work of cultural memory and racial formation theory (Omi and Winant 1994) we explore the ascension of Barack Obama as an illustration of how 'race' is understood and remembered. This article focuses on the public media discourse of the 2012 Obama re-election to illustrate how the narrative morphed racially from 2008 to 2012. Our findings suggest that the public discourse about ascension and re-election of Barack Obama drew from racial and post-racial narratives to describe his re-election. We contend that attention given to the public construction of Barack Obama in the present is vitally important to how the narrative arc of 'race' in the US will be understood in schools and society.

'The goddamndest, toughest voting rights bill': Critical Race Theory and the Voting Rights Act of 1965	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; civil rights; social studies; racism; interest convergence; voting rights	INTEREST-CONVERGENCE; MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION; BROWN; HISTORY; BOARD	The author utilized Critical Race Theory (CRT) to examine the passage of the US Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 in an effort to disrupt the simplistic, uncritical understandings of the US Civil Rights Movement common to school texts while also arguing for the ongoing importance of the VRA in a time when voting rights for people of color are under attack. The author identified four points of interest convergence in the passage of the VRA and contends that a critical revisionist narrative of the VRA - along with other events and individuals Civil Rights Movement - is necessary to help students and teachers understand the persistence of racism and the limitations of liberalism in addressing racial inequality.

J	Chakrabarty, N				Chakrabarty, Namita			Buried alive: the psychoanalysis of racial absence in preparedness/education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						buried alive; psychoanalysis; education; race; CRT; resilience; preparedness		Based on extracts from an ethnography produced during the ESRC 2009-10 research project, 'Preparedness Pedagogies' and Race: An Interdisciplinary Approach, this article explores the racialized culture of civil defence in the UK whilst also critiquing the world of higher education. The ethnographic artefacts of interviews, observations of preparedness role play around fictional character, and of professionals' live reminiscence of emergency, are explored through the lens of the psychoanalytical construction of being buried alive; Critical Race Theory (CRT) conceptions of policy constitution of a social world that imprisons the non-white citizen and the other are seen, in this article, as enshrined in this construction. Freud's The Uncanny encompasses the psychology of being 'buried alive,' and one conception of this is seen as a state akin to life in the womb, a strange place of safety. In contrast I use two CRT narratives of resilience auto-education as a way of beginning to analyse different presentations of being buried alive. I refer, following Royle, to Edgar Allan Poe's The Premature Burial and his introductory conception of being buried alive as being something that happens to others, about the affective act of burial; in contrast I draw on the chapter entitled 'Buried Alive,' in the sensation novel Lady Audley's Secret, a useful metaphor for the eternal live imprisonment of the other facilitated by legal means, ensuring the security of a racially pure, class secure, hetero-normative status quo: the burial of race. This burial within policy is double edged: the shadow character buried alive within preparedness and within education haunts the work and is thus more likely to return as evoked by the events of 9/11.

J	Hooks, DS; Miskovic, M				Hooks, Debra S.; Miskovic, Maja			Race and racial ideology in classrooms through teachers' and students' voices	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; ideology; African American students; successful teachers	INQUIRY	This qualitative study examines how cultural and racial similarities and differences between teachers, regarded in their school as successful, and their African American students affect the student-teacher relationships and how these relationships shape and are shaped by racial ideology. The purpose of this paper is: (1) to offer an insight on teachers' and students' beliefs, expectations, and practices related to schooling and education; and (2) to understand how racial ideology plays out among teachers and students in a predominantly African American school. We rely on an understanding of race as ideology, rather than as an independent variable to be quantified and measured. We found that seemingly neutral and objective educational terms such as classroom structure, discipline, or achievement are infused with racial meaning and are a product of and reflection on racial ideology in which education and schooling operate. The power of racial ideology is not that it 'tells' its actors what to do or say; rather, it lies in the power of interpretive choices that teachers use to tell the stories about the school and the students.

J	Muhammad, CG				Muhammad, Crystal Gafford			Mississippi higher education desegregation and the interest convergence principle: a CRT analysis of the 'Ayers settlement'	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						higher education; desegregation; critical race theory	SEGREGATION	The goal of the present paper is to recount a legal history of the Ayers case from its inception through the Fifth Circuit's 2004 approval and the Supreme Court's decline to review the 2001 settlement agreement, ending 30 years of litigation. Then from the critical race theoretical frame of interest convergence, I argue that while the 'Ayers settlement' ostensibly remedies the historic discrimination in the allocation of higher education funding in Mississippi, the primary beneficiaries of the settlement are white students. This final outcome of Ayers violates both the law of remedies and equal protection doctrine and stems from weariness in pursuit of the law suit, the costs of further delay of any remedy, and the lack of public attention to higher education desegregation. From a policy perspective, there is a concern for black students in Mississippi, the original persons represented in the Ayers suit. If it is the case that Mississippi's HBCUs fail to meet and maintain white enrollment targets, then ultimately black students at those institutions will continue suffer. Endowments will not be granted by the state and the improvements to each of the institutions fiscally, physically and programmatically will be stymied. Yet, the work of desegregation in Mississippi will be said to have been completed.

J	Wainwright, J				Wainwright, John			Racism, anti-racist practice and social work: articulating the teaching and learning experiences of Black social workers	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Review						anti-racism; Black perspectives; Black practice teacher; Black social workers; Black students; ethnicity	POLICIES	In the mid 1990s a Black practice teacher programme was established in Manchester and Merseyside with the primary aim to increase the number of Black practice teachers in social work organisations, and in turn provide a supportive and encouraging learning environment for Black student social workers whilst on placement. In the north-west of England research has been undertaken, to establish the quality of the practice teaching and student learning taking place with Black practice teachers and students. This paper is an exploration of the ideas generated within the placement process that particularly focused on the discourse of racism and ant-racist practice. Black students and practice teachers explain their understanding of racism and anti-racist practice within social work. From the research, the paper will critique some of the ideas concerning anti-racism. In particular, it will question whether anti-racist social work practice needs to be re-evaluated in the light of a context with new migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. It will concluded, by arguing that whilst the terms anti-racism, Black and Minority Ethnic have resonance as a form of political strategic essentialism, it is important to develop more positive representations in the future.

Latina/o students as agents of change: the influence of cultural assets and college experiences	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Latina; os; social agency; civic engagement; community cultural wealth; empowerment	SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP; DIVERSITY EXPERIENCES; HIGHER-EDUCATION; IMPACT; RACE; PARTICIPATION; PERCEPTIONS; INVOLVEMENT; AMERICAN; OUTCOMES	Enhancing the civic engagement of Latina/os can promote the economic and political advancement of this racial/ethnic group. Employing a critical quantitative longitudinal design with data from UCLA's Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP), this study examines the factors that influence Latina/o college students' social agency, which represents values associated with civic engagement. The study draws from Critical Race Theory, including community cultural wealth. Multiple regression analyses indicate that cultural assets and Latina/os' college experiences shape their commitment to social change. Specifically, Latina/o students draw from various forms of capital (aspirational and spiritual) as they engage in their college environment and experience marginalization and empowerment, which collectively influence their social agency. Also, findings suggest some differences within the monolithic Latina/o group. By understanding the factors that motivate Latina/o students' social agency, colleges and universities can more effectively prepare these future change agents to reduce social, economic, and political inequities.

J	Trinidad, JE				Trinidad, Jose Eos			Structural limitations and functional alternatives reducing suspensions and preserving racial suspension gaps	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Suspension; discipline; Chicago Public Schools; racial bias		Although studies on school suspensions focus on the disproportionate number of Black students receiving them, policy changes reducing suspensions offer new insights into the racial gap. Using annual school-level data from the Chicago Public Schools (2012-2016), I evaluate how a suspension reduction policy affected the number of students receiving suspensions, and the suspension gaps between majority Black schools and other schools. I find that the policy reduced overall suspensions but still preserved racial suspension gaps. I argue how structural limitations and functional alternatives played important roles in these consequences, and how this suggests the importance of contextual factors in assisting structural changes.

Nevertheless, few studies have documented how these discrimination experiences are situated within structures of ethnic inequality in education. Adopting a critical race theory approach, experiences of Turkish Belgian university students were analysed to expose deficit assumptions towards ethnic minorities and push against inequity in education. The accounts of students show the exclusionary treatment they were exposed to despite the dominating discourses of colorblindness in education. Students' experiences with peers highlight the pervasiveness of racism that targeted ethnic minority students based on their ethnic and social class background. Lack of minority representation, ubiquitous microaggressions, and exclusionary curriculum shape students' experiences at university context and affirm White normativity. These findings highlight the urgency of challenging against systems and structures of racism in education. The implications for research and practice are detailed in the concluding section.

African American professionals in higher education: experiencing and coping with racial microaggressions	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial microaggressions; Critical Race Theory; higher education	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; FACULTY; STRESS; DISCRIMINATION; RESPONSES; BREAKING; SILENCE; EVENTS; STYLES	Using a Critical Race Theory lens, we explored how African American professionals in both HBCUs and PWIs (4-year and 2-year institutions) experienced and coped with racial microaggressions. The participants in this study included fifteen African American instructors/professors and administrators. Despite the type of institution, the emerged themes from interviews indicated that participants experienced an array of racial microaggressions. In addition, many participants addressed race-related stress experienced in the workplace by engaging in both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies. Implications are provided to discuss the impact that racial microaggressions has on African Americans in the higher education workplace.

J	Rocha, J				Rocha, Janet			Pedagogies of sacrifices: the use of narratives as socialization in families and a human resource for resilience	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asset-based resources; cultural practices; narratives; socialization; resilience; familismo	CRITICAL RACE; STUDENT ENGAGEMENT; COLLEGE; TRANSITION; KNOWLEDGE; FUNDS; ASPIRATIONS; INVOLVEMENT; SENSE	Postsecondary institutions do not typically recognize or utilize students' cultural wealth, yet cultural practices can significantly affect college persistence. In this longitudinal study, seven Mexican American low-income college students attending a large public research institution participated in in-depth interviews to examine the types of familial-cultural practices participants engage in with their families, and to explore how they apply symbolic value to such practices. I used a Latina/o critical race theory framework to analyze the raced and gendered layers of their experiences and highlight the forms of resilience and agency developed by them. Findings revealed cuentos and consejos as pedagogies of sacrifices that helped raise students' consciousness of oppressive experiences and enable the possibility for transformative behavior by encouraging educational motivation, aspirations, and attainment. The use of these stories and advice as socialization in families is an important human resource for resilience. The relationship between students' cultural wealth and the ways they utilize it to persist in college is an area where more attention is needed.

J	Mbilishaka, AM; Apugo, D				Mbilishaka, Afiya M.; Apugo, Danielle			Brushed aside: African American women's narratives of hair bias in school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Hair; education; African American women; hair shaming; narrative	BLACK-ADOLESCENT GIRLS; RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS; RACE; GENDER; COLORISM; REPRESENTATIONS; YOUTUBE; CARE; BAD	For African American women, hair is a key site of identity formation and self-esteem that has been largely ignored by education researchers. Fifty-six African American women shared memories of negative hair experiences in school as a means to magnify the implicit injuries of racial and gender marginalization in educational environments. Memories consisted of hair shaming and suffering the consequences of hair damage, by way of classmate or teacher. Embarrassment and anxiety were the most frequently reported emotional reaction, resulting in participants' discomfort in school and in their interpersonal relationships. Findings from this study suggest that hair bias represents a source of trauma and identity negotiation within school contexts. Critical Black feminist theories were used to frame the method and interpretation of participants' reflective narratives. The insights provided through the narrative sample fuel recommendations regarding anti-bias teaching and school policy reform.

J	Zavala, MD; Hand, V				Zavala, Maria del Rosario; Hand, Victoria			Conflicting narratives of success in mathematics and science education: challenging the achievement-motivation master narrative	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Learning; identity; race; mathematics; science; narrative	SCHOOL; STEREOTYPE; DISCOURSE; IDENTITY; CRITIQUE; THREAT	A prominent feature of education in the United States is the widespread endorsement of an achievement narrative, which links individual motivation and effort to academic achievement. In mathematics and science domains, this narrative is often coupled with one that special intelligence is required for people to do math and science. We argue that such narrative are especially problematic for students from non-dominant backgrounds, since de-racialized, ready-made narratives such as these obscure how broader sociopolitical structures shape individual and racial group success in school, and normalize the experiences of white children. We analyzed the negotiation of such master-narratives by students from less dominant backgrounds as they figured themselves and others in the world of school achievement, and learning mathematics. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of initiating and orchestrating conversations that support students in explicitly grappling with these master-narratives in order to confront and change the power they hold.

The aim of this paper is to explore, through the lens of the academic tutor, the pedagogical methods employed towards the implementation of cultural branching', which we define as helping ethnically diverse students to build bridges between their pre-existing knowledge and what they are expected to learn. To investigate this in more detail, the researchers interviewed 22 academic tutors across three UK Higher Education Institutions in the North of England. The findings suggest that current curriculum structures and pedagogical approaches favour the dominant non-ethnically diverse learner.

J	Miller, AL				Miller, Amanda L.			(Re)conceptualizing family-school partnerships with and for culturally and linguistically diverse families	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Culturally and linguistically diverse families; family-school partnerships; community cultural wealth; ecological resilience	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; SPECIAL-EDUCATION; PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT; BLACK-FAMILIES; CHILDREN; PERSPECTIVES; MOTHERS; PERCEPTIONS; EXCLUSION; INCLUSION	Family-school partnerships between special education personnel and culturally and linguistically diverse families can be fraught with disrespect and cross-cultural and linguistic barriers. As a 'wicked problem,' the negative interactions culturally and linguistically diverse families have over time with professionals operate as mechanisms to disempower families, further resulting in inequitable and unbalanced family-school partnerships. That said, I propose a (re)conceptualization for special education teacher preparation research and practice to support the expansion and transformation of school personnel's interactions and collaborations with culturally and linguistically diverse families. I thread two existing frameworks: community cultural wealth and ecological resilience to imagine this (re)conceptualization. Then, I discuss implications for institutional change, including transformations in thought, research, practice, and policy.

As our class of predominantly Latina/o students and two Latina instructors engaged Testimonio pedagogy, we fashioned a hopeful alternative to our own experiences of intergenerational oppression. While research indicates that the experiences and histories of pre-service Teachers of Color lend pedagogical strength and critical consciousness to teacher education, three Latina pre-service students highlight the ways in which Testimonio became more than a pedagogical approach. Testimonio's collectivity, resistance, hope, and assertions of voice and dignity moved through them not as educators first but as (great-grand)daughters of oppressed though still-resilient People(s). Testimonio emboldened these Latina pre-service educators to recognize and validate their own inherited multiliteracies, (re)claim their connectedness to land, and articulate their visions for more equitable schooling. This work advances research into the essentiality of engaging race and ethnicity in K-12 and teacher education curriculum and pedagogy.

J	Pabon, AJM				Pabon, Amber Jean-Marie			In hindsight and now again: black male teachers' recollections on the suffering of black male youth in US public schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black male teachers; social suffering; academic tracking; black male youth; racial melancholia	LIFE-HISTORIES; COMMUNITY; EDUCATORS; PEDAGOGY; POLITICS	This article draws from data in a larger qualitative study on the lives of black male teachers in US public urban schools. I examine their schooling experiences as black male youth. By coupling theories of social suffering with life history methodology, this research analyzes how three black male teachers experienced frustration, marginalization, and misery as students. For these participants, academic tracking was a site of social suffering. This suffering persisted into their adult lives as classroom teachers, as they witnessed and attempted to mitigate the struggles of their own black male students. The findings in this study have implications for further research on black male teachers as well as their recruitment and retention in US public schools.

This work, theoretically framed within Chicana and Black Feminisms, is part of a larger ethnographic study conducted through multiple methods. Findings reveal Rosa's Mexicana/Mestiza Ethic of Care, a (re)incarnated social justice revolution carrying education as ethical imperative toward uplift. Findings have implications for all educators to protect and sustain ongoing struggles for equity and dignity for Mexicana/o youth and all those on the margins of schooling.

J	Webb, A; Radcliffe, S				Webb, Andrew; Radcliffe, Sarah			Unfulfilled promises of equity: racism and interculturalism in Chilean education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Interculturalism; whiteness; racialized education; Mapuche; Chile	TEACHERS	In rural Araucania secondary schools, prescriptive and formal government programs for interculturalism - designed to overcome differentials between Indigenous and non-Indigenous pupils in educational outcomes - have had limited impact. Drawing on research across four schools, this article examines how the dynamics between state-led top-down prescriptive guidelines interface with teacher practice, school objectives, and existing racializing dynamics to produce diverse educational outcomes. Drawing on in-depth qualitative research involving over 100 pupils and teachers, this article identifies two key in-school processes that work to undercut official policy effectiveness. First, state policies do little to challenge staff and institutionalized racism, thereby perpetuating the marking of Indigenous pupils as Other. Combined with lack of political will and resources for teacher training and lesson preparation, this leaves educational inequalities in place. Second, the institutional allocation of time and resources to intercultural education reinforces widespread devaluation of indigenous knowledge among teachers, educators and public opinion. Nevertheless, the study also found that in certain schools these conditions did not prevent the adoption of pedagogies that affirmed Indigenous difference and challenged the dominance of whiteness. Informed by a critical theorization of the power and unmarked nature of racial inequality, this article argues that whiteness is neither recognized nor challenged in rural secondary schools in southern Chile, despite its ubiquity and pervasive influence on curriculum, pedagogies and institutional arrangements.

Racing tradition: Catholic schooling and the maintenance of boundaries	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Catholic schooling; space and place; Cultural Studies; Critical Race Theory; whiteness	WHITENESS; RACE; ACHIEVEMENT	This article seeks to add to the underdeveloped strain of inquiry on the raced social experience of students in private and parochial institutions. We examine the role Catholic schools in the city of Chicago play in the maintenance and creation of racially problematic policies, spaces, and rhetoric. The research uncovers a multitude of responses framing African American students as an exotic other in mission and action through the leveraging of liturgical, ideological, and political language and practice. Using Cultural Studies and Critical Race Theory the work seeks to create a discursive space for representation and resistance in the repositioning of dominant and sanguineous narratives about Catholic schooling both in the US and globally. We use moments when race became particularly and often painfully salient in our experiences of Catholic schooling to expose the structural and racial inequity perpetuated in establishing and enforcing racial barriers to success through religion-for-segregation educational policies.

This mixed methods exploratory study involved the use of a 79-item Student Athlete College Experiences Questionnaire (SACEQ), three focus group interviews, and four individual interviews. Participants in this study included 57 black male football and men's basketball student athletes at an HBCU in the southeastern US. Institutional theory and the anti-deficit achievement framework were incorporated to highlight effective institutional practices at an HBCU. Findings revealed the presence of a nurturing familial campus climate and purposefully designed institutional programs enhanced black male student athletes' educational experiences. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

J	Demie, F				Demie, Feyisa			Language diversity and attainment in schools: implication for policy and practice	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						ethnicity; language diversity; attainment; GCSEs	WHITE WORKING-CLASS; EDUCATIONAL-ACHIEVEMENT; ETHNICITY; ENGLISH; ACQUISITION; GENDER; PUPILS; GAPS; END	This research examines pupil performance differences among the main ethnic groups in British Schools by language spoken at home. The main findings of the data confirm that there were substantial differences in performance between different ethnic groups at the end of GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education). However, the study argues that none of these ethnic categories are homogenous. A further analysis of the data by language spoken highlighted the potential of language data to help disaggregate census ethnic categories and give greater insight into the performance of different groups in schools. In particular, the White Other and the Black African groups had the greatest linguistic diversity and attainment patterns. In conclusion, this study confirms that analysing an ethnic group's performance by language adds to our understanding of the associations between language and ethnic background. The article concludes with policy implications for collection and use of ethnic and language data at national and international level.

RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						education reform; decolonizing education; Detroit schools; urban education; Latino achievement gap; high stakes testing; Latino education	IDENTITY	Using critical theory and an analysis of missionary reports and documentation describing education in colonial Puerto Rico and Mexico, the authors cross borders and time periods to socially and historically situate Spanish colonial educational methodologies and their contemporary use in one low-income Latino community in urban Detroit, Michigan. By invoking associations from the colonial past to shed light on contemporary struggles, this study problematizes US educational reform initiatives such as high stakes testing and school turnaround policies. The authors found that when the playing field is not equal, such reform efforts are but another in a long line of colonial and neo-colonial methodologies that further disenfranchise Latino youth and push them out of school.

J	Wilkins, C				Wilkins, Chris			Inspecting the inspectors: race equality and quality in initial teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						accountability; race equality; ITE inspection framework; ITE policy	STUDENT-TEACHERS; BLACK; EXPERIENCES; POLICY	Equalities legislation in Britain has in recent years shifted towards requiring public bodies to proactively promote equality rather than simply prevent discrimination. This paper reports on a study of how this requirement, with specific reference to race equality, is enacted in the regulation and inspection of initial teacher education (ITE) in England. The study included a review of statutory guidance and inspection frameworks and quantitative analysis of how overall inspection outcomes reflect the quality of ITE providers' engagement with race equality issues. The study also included case studies of ITE programmes judged by their students to be either particularly good or particularly weak at preparing them to address race equality issues in their teaching. The study concludes that there is a significant gap between government rhetoric on race equality and the policy enactment of agencies involved in ITE. It argues that in the context of the high stakes accountability systems in place throughout all aspects of educational provision, this means that race equality issues are marginalised within institutional policies that focus on procedural compliance rather than substantive challenge to practices that normalise and so perpetuate structural inequality.

In the shadows of the mission: education policy, urban space, and the 'colonial present' in Sydney	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						colonialism; racialisation; education policy; urban space; 'colonial present'		This paper is concerned with enduring histories and micro-geographies of the (post) colonial Australian nation, played out through contemporary connections between Aboriginality, inner Sydney and educational policy change. This paper traces the 'racialization' of space and place in the Sydney inner city suburb of Redfern, including the Aboriginal-'owned' residential area commonly known as the Block; it then outlines aspects of an educational policy change in inner Sydney, specifically the relationship of policy proposals to the positioning of Aboriginal people; and, last, focuses on connecting the notions of Aboriginality and space to educational policy change through Derek Gregory's idea of the 'colonial present'. It explores how the idea of the 'colonial present' as 'performance of space' might help to understand the racialisation of the inner city and education policy discourses. It concludes that the 'colonial present' is a way of understanding how the 'racialisation' of the inner city and education policy discourses can, on the one hand, 'reaffirm' deficit views of Aboriginal people as irredeemably 'Other' and as 'failure', yet, on the other hand, can however precariously mobilize undo colonial enclosures.

J	Katsarou, E				Katsarou, Eleni			Reading African-American literature to understand the world: critical race praxis in teacher preparation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Critical Race Studies in Education Conference	2008	Chicago, IL			critical race praxis; teacher education; urban schools; student teaching; literature	EDUCATION	Teacher preparation programs have come under close scrutiny and teacher educators are being called to shift the center of gravity from traditional approaches to more transformative and urban-focused curricula that will better prepare teacher candidates (TCs) to become effective and caring teachers of diverse pupils, particularly in urban sites. Critical race praxis scholars and practitioners have long argued that colleges of education have been complicit in maintaining the education inequalities that exist in schools that serve children of color, English language learners, and other pupils of non-dominant backgrounds. In this paper, I will give an account of the changes made in a student-teaching seminar, including the assigned readings and fieldwork assignments, that aimed to explore the key ideas of historical context, especially as it is reflected in schools and communities, and the notion of self as situated within it. Drawing from the experiences of many years as a teacher educator but especially from those in the reported year-long course of study and actions, I conclude that teacher preparation must first center all efforts in offering TCs ideas and text that pave the way to resist racist, reductionist, and overly-simplified metaphors that are used to describe children and second insist on highlighting real models of teachers and school leaders who know the historical and cultural antecedents of their school and communities, and who frame powerfully a culture of learning and an ethos of achievement that is accessible to non-dominant students and their parents.

J	Powell, SN				Powell, Shameka N.			The paradox of a credit-recovery program: alleviating and exacerbating racial inequity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial inequity; credit-recovery programs; critical race theory	EXAMINING RACE; EDUCATION; WHITENESS	This ethnographic case study examines how a racial equity-focused effort was contested and undermined by analyzing classroom observations and interviews with three teachers who worked in a credit-recovery program. Drawing on Critical Race Theory's (CRT) whiteness as property and restrictive equality analytical lenses, this article illustrates that although the credit-recovery program was created to offer struggling Black students support and to address racialized academic disparities between Black and White students, it actually exacerbated racial inequity. Findings demonstrate that White parental demands, institutional practices, and meritocratic ideology combined to simultaneously advantage White students and disadvantage Black students. This article shines light on ways equity efforts are refashioned to support racial inequalities. The article concludes with implications for research and practice.

J	Okello, WK				Okello, Wilson Kwamogi			Organized anxiety: respectability politics, John Henryism, and the paradox of Black achievement	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						John Henryism; respectability; history; Black achievement; black feminism	HEALTH; GRIT	Henryism as a construct draws comparisons to what is commonly referred to as respectability politics, or the active adoption of standards rooted in whiteness as a regulatory instrument of one's behavior and emotions. This manuscript will bring Henryism and respectability politics into conversation in an effort to illuminate the paradox of achievement for Black educators and professionals. By examining the experiences of Black women in higher education wrestling with racial battle fatigue, I uncover the essence and possibilities of what E. Frances White calls the 'double-edged nature of the politics of respectability', recognizable asorganized anxiety, a discourse of resistance and simultaneously an investment in stereotypes about Black people.

J	MacDonald, L				MacDonald, Liana			Whose story counts? Staking a claim for diverse bicultural narratives in New Zealand secondary schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Institutional racism; biculturalism; hidden curriculum; indigenous; silencing; settler colonialism	SETTLER COLONIALISM; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; RACIST; RACE	In 1840, the British Crown and Maori rangatira (chiefs) across Aotearoa New Zealand signed a treaty that promised indigenous Maori sovereignty over their lands. In the 1980s, the government moved towards the view that the treaty signing symbolised two races coming together in 'partnership'. Partnership is a point of contention in settler-indigenous relations, with claims that state institutions favour the interests of the dominant culture. This paper draws on the experiences of Maori teachers of English in secondary schools, to examine how everyday classroom interactions reproduce an imagined partnership between Maori and Pakeha (descendants of European settlers). Findings reveal that teachers and students enact a bicultural narrative that maintains lop-sided notions of partnership to advance Pakeha group interests. The paper concludes by arguing that breaking the silencing of violent colonial histories would authorise a new narrative of biculturalism; one with the potential to transform the idealism of 1840 into practice.

J	Valdez, C				Valdez, Carolina			Flippin' the scripted curriculum: ethnic studies inquiry in elementary education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Ethnic studies; elementary teacher education; decolonial pedagogy	CRITICAL RACE; POWER	This study examines the practical application of ethnic studies inquiry projects to supplement elementary scripted language arts curriculum. Drawing from decolonial theory, the study examines pedagogical strategies in challenging the normalization of colonialism within standards and curriculum. Blending autoethnography and portraiture, data were collected throughout the 2013-2014 academic year, and consisted of observations, artifacts, and field notes from an elementary public school in South Los Angeles. The findings highlight the use of inquiry projects to center Indigeneity and resistance toward classical and internal colonialism.

J	Guenther, J				Guenther, John			Taken for a ride? The disconnect between high school completion, employment and income for remote Australian First Nations Peoples	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						First Nations education; Human Capital Theory; Indigenous language speakers; impact of year 12 completion; income inequality	IDENTITY; CURRICULUM	'Education is the key' is often used as a metaphor in remote Australian First Nations communities to indicate the importance of learning to achieve some measure of socio-economic advantage-education is seen as a vehicle for advancement. First Nations people have enthusiastically bought into education and training vehicle. High school completion data suggest that 'gaps' are closing. But the vehicle appears to be breaking down as it heads along the road towards jobs and economic participation. This article presents an analysis of Census data to show trends in high school completion, employment and income. The data suggest growth in educational achievement. But a 'break down' of the data into non-Indigenous, First Nations Indigenous language speakers and First Nations English speakers shows little change in the economic fortunes of language speakers. In these latter findings a 'new narrative', built on QuantCrit propositions, takes shape and explains why the vehicle breaks down.

J	Meetoo, V				Meetoo, Veena			Negotiating the diversity of 'everyday' multiculturalism: teachers' enactments in an inner city secondary school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Teachers; diversity 'management'; policy enactment; 'everyday' multiculturalism	RACE; EDUCATION; BLACK	This paper explores the presence of multiculturalism in teachers' professional practice in a British inner city co-educational secondary school, which featured in two predominant ways: first, as a form of 'diversity management' through interventions including a formalised staffing structure to 'respond' to the school's ethnically mixed student body, representation of difference, and same 'race' role models; and second, through its sedimentation into everyday practices, whereby teachers enacted multicultural approaches in varied ways. The multiple meanings teachers attached to multiculturalism and its subsequent translations into 'everyday' professional practice suggest that the term 'everyday multiculturalism' should be used beyond its 'convivial' meaning of living in/with ethnic diversity to also reflect the diverse professional enactments of multiculturalism through everyday practice in institutional settings. Further, an analytical focus on professionals in 'everyday' multiculturalism elucidates how teachers' diverse enactments of multiculturalism perpetuate micro-processes of racialisation in schools.

J	Mahony, P; Weiner, G				Mahony, Pat; Weiner, Gaby			'Getting in, getting on, getting out': Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic staff in UK higher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Universities; racism; racialised minorities		Research into the impact of neoliberalism has shown that institutional and individual pressure on staff working in Higher Education (HE), has changed over the last 30 years. Our first research study showed that the changes resulted in mostly negative experiences for White staff. In a second study we have investigated the impact of neoliberalism on Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff to investigate whether experiences matched those of their White colleagues. Drawing on narrative methodology, we undertook fourteen interviews, eight with BAME staff and six with White staff all with responsibility for equity in their institutions. We also drew on current and numerical data detailing employment patterns. While many of the negative impacts of neoliberalism were common to all staff, BAME staff offered a collective narrative focussing primarily on injustice, bullying and racism. Most striking was the pain resulting from simultaneous hypervisibility and invisibility of BAME staff, the continual questioning of their professional competence.

J	George, RC; Maier, R; Robson, K				George, Rhonda C.; Maier, Reana; Robson, Karen			Ignoring race: a comparative analysis of education policy in British Columbia and Ontario	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Education; education policy; racial equity; critical race theory; British Columbia; Ontario	STUDENTS	Racial equity in Canadian education remains elusive. Despite Canada's status as a multicultural nation, many minority students continue to be marginalised. In this article, we compare equity-related education policy in two Canadian provinces - Ontario and British Columbia - to ascertain how race and racialized students are understood in official documents. After reviewing provincial policy contexts from the early 1990s onward, we discuss the results of a content analysis of provincial education policy documents using Critical Policy Analysis and Critical Race Theory. We argue that the treatment of race and equity in these documents demonstrates 'symbolic anti-racism,' rather than substantive anti-racism, in three key ways: 1) the lack of robust education policy related to racial equity; 2) the construction of racism as an individual characteristic rather than a structural problem in the education system; and 3) the near-absence of race-related data collection. Policy recommendations follow based on these findings.

J	Lor, Y				Lor, Yang			Ties that bind: family obligations as immediate and anticipatory obstacles	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Race; culture; immigrants; poverty; education; Asian Americans	SEGMENTED ASSIMILATION; AMERICAN; CULTURE; WHITE; ADOLESCENTS; SATURATION; ATTITUDES; ROLES	While research on Asian American students has overwhelmingly emphasized family ties as an important contributor to student success in high school, what it neglects is how family ties can constrain students in their educational endeavors. Based on a study of 30 low-income Hmong American high school students, I argue that poverty can create conditions in which family ties bind students to gender-based expectations and obligations that prevent them from pursuing opportunities for social mobility. In their discussion of mobility obstacles, Hmong students consistently brought up family as a significant barrier. Whereas males were concerned about fulfilling family obligations related to performing cultural and religious rituals, females were distressed about providing social and economic support for their families. Both males and females framed family obligations as obstacles that interfere with their schooling but females were also concerned that family obligations would restrict their ability to pursue opportunities away from home.

J	Amiot, MN; Mayer-Glenn, J; Parker, L				Amiot, Michelle N.; Mayer-Glenn, Jennifer; Parker, Laurence			Applied critical race theory: educational leadership actions for student equity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical race theory; educational leadership; school change	SOCIAL-JUSTICE; SCHOOLS; WHITENESS	Critical race theory (CRT) in education has been used to expose and analyze racism in K-12 schooling and higher education. However, the theory has been underutilized as an inventory lens applied to school leadership practice. Our paper takes on this inquiry by highlighting the work done by an administrative leadership team at a majority racially diverse middle school in the Mountain western region of the U.S. Through an examination of the practice of racism as whiteness as property through teacher expectations, classroom instruction and teacher-student and parent interactions and by implementing changes in areas of student discipline, and color-blind teacher perceptions, the leadership team developed racial equity pathways which served as an important implementation of CRT leadership.

J	Vue, R				Vue, Rican			Trauma and resilience in the lives and education of Hmong American students: forging pedagogies of remembrance with critical refugee discourse	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Southeast Asian American students; refugee students; trauma; resilience; pedagogy of remembrance; higher education	MEMORY; RACE	Since 1975, over 3 million refugees have entered the United States, yet schools are unequipped to recognize and comprehend refugee communities' life circumstances as shaped by structural and symbolic violence. The educational experiences of second-generation Hmong American refugees highlight this neglect and its potential consequences for intergenerational relationships. Articulating a critical remembering framework, this narrative analysis examined how Hmong American college students memorialized, authenticated, and drew connections between historical trauma and contemporary racial violence through a cultural show production. The findings illustrate how addressing war, race, and class within the context of education can disrupt silence around historical trauma and racial oppression in the United States and make possible a transformative education. This study has relevance for educational institutions, especially in a context of global migrations due to conflicts that inflict mass violence, which spans the material and symbolic landscapes of refugee lives.

J	Jaffe-Walter, R				Jaffe-Walter, Reva			Ideal liberal subjects and Muslim "Others": liberal nationalism and the racialization of Muslim youth in a progressive Danish school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Immigrant youth; nationalism; racialization; liberalism; colorblind; public schools	CITIZENSHIP; RACE; EDUCATION; STUDENT	Drawing on an ethnographic case study of Muslim youth in a Danish lower secondary school, this article explores teacher talk about Muslim immigrant students and how teachers engaged liberal ideals of respect, individualism, and equality in ways that racialized immigrant students. I consider moments of vacillation in teacher talk to explore tensions between teacher's desires to assimilate immigrant students to national norms of belonging and their desires to be perceived as inclusive and 'open.' In doing so, I ask how visions of liberal schooling impose ideas of what a 'normal' citizen should be and how teachers produce 'ideal' liberal subjects in their talk and in the everyday practices of schools. I argue that teachers engage the ideals of abstract liberalism to establish a colorblind discourse of non-racism. While educators described the school as an idealized space where students are encouraged to freely express themselves, to develop unique individual outlooks, it was clear that this vision of 'openness' did not include Muslim students' attachments to religious and cultural identities.

J	Rosiek, J				Rosiek, Jerry			Critical race theory meets posthumanism: lessons from a study of racial resegregation in public schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical race theory; posthumanism; racial segregation; theory practice relationship; philosophy	CHOICE GEDANKEN EXPERIMENT; EDUCATION	Critical race theory (CRT) was used to frame a study of the impact of racial resegregation on students in a public school district. Racism operated in the district at multiple ontological levels - such as interpersonal microaggressions, structural economic arrangements, and discursive processes. CRT provided a rationale for the interdisciplinary approach required to track these different manifestations of racism, while maintaining an emphasis on the material reality of racism. Having its origins in the field of law, however, CRT provided limited guidance for methodological decisions often required in a social scientific study. The author found posthumanist philosophy of science offered guidance for these decisions in a manner that complemented the philosophical and political commitments of CRT. This essay reflects on the advantages this combination of theories offers for the analysis of institutionalized racism. Illustrations are drawn from the study on school resegregation.

J	Gebhard, A				Gebhard, Amanda			"Let's make a little drum': limitations and contradictory effects of cultural approaches in Indigenous education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Indigenous education; racism; cultural awareness; discourse analysis		Initiatives to improve low levels of educational attainment amongst Indigenous students in the Canadian Prairies have long emphasized cultural approaches and ignored how racism affects achievement. Taking up the debates offered by critical race theory, and utilizing post-structural theorizing of knowledge and subjectivities, this article provides a discourse analysis of educators' contradictory deployments of cultural discourses. The analysis highlights the inadequacy of cultural narratives for explaining the inequality experienced by Indigenous students. I show how naming racism in schools is difficult for teachers because cultural integration efforts are taken as evidence that equality is being achieved, and I trace the ways in which this leads to the naturalization of schooling exclusions and unequal subjectivities. Readers are brought to rethink the integration of Indigenous culture in schools as a singular pathway to student success, and the importance of centering race and racism.

J	Osorio, SL				Osorio, Sandra L.			Border stories: using critical race and Latino critical theories to understand the experiences of Latino/a children	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Immigration; critical race theory (CRT); Latino critical theory (LatCrit); counternarratives; border	LITERATURE DISCUSSIONS; LITERATURE CIRCLES; IMPERIAL SCHOLAR; TALK	The number of school-age children of color in US schools is increasing, while the teaching force continues to be dominated by white teachers. According to the 2013 Digest of Education Statistics in the 2011-2012 school year, 81.9% of public school teachers were white, while the projected number of Hispanic students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools is expected to increase 33% between 2011 and 2022. In my experience, the issue of immigration is often ignored by the majority white teacher population, but, as I will share in this article, it is part of the lived experience of Latino children. I present my students' border stories as discussed in relation to Latino children's literature. I am using the words 'border stories' to represent the narratives my students shared about their families' experiences crossing the US-Mexico border as well as what they felt about the societal discourse around 'illegal immigrants.' Critical race theory (CRT) and Latino critical theory (LatCrit) are used to frame these border stories to speak against the majoritarian story.

In particular we draw attention to the unwillingness of the majority of these employees to name or recognize specific forms of institutional inequality. Following critical pedagogy literature we argue that the Chilean education system reproduces a fear of talk among teachers working in areas with high density indigenous populations, which obscures unequal social structures and opportunities for specific (class, gender, ethnic) groups in school contexts. Based on data from 12 interviews with school staff and observations from four schools in southern Chile, we analyze how intersecting inequality is discursively reduced by predominantly white teachers to individual deficit, de-politicized geographical problems of access to schooling, and the normalizing of low achievement across schools with students from similar backgrounds.

Racism as a threshold concept: examining learning in a "diversity requirement' course	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Threshold concept; racism; race; pedagogy; student learning	TEACHING RACE; STUDENTS; ETHNICITY; EDUCATION; PEDAGOGY; CHALLENGE; PRIVILEGE; COLOR; POWER; TALK	This article frames racism as a threshold concept and, using qualitative data from written coursework, examines student learning of that concept in a racially diverse college course. The data suggest scaffolding learning and using real-world applications correlate to student mastery of the threshold concept of racism. Findings also suggest that students of color, those who assessed their understandings of issues of race and racism on the first day of class as mixed (rather than expert or weak), those who took the course primarily due to interest, and upperclassmen moved more quickly toward advanced understandings of racism. Qualitative data illustrate that the ways in which the threshold concept was troublesome and transformative varies for students, particularly by race. This study answers the call for more research on the pedagogy of racism as related to the learning experiences of students of color, especially in diverse classrooms.

J	Gkofa, P				Gkofa, Panagiota			Being Roma - being Greek: academically successful Greek Romas' identity constructions	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Educational success; identity; "being Greek'; "being Roma'	HIGHER-EDUCATION	In Greece, Roma ethnic-cultural identity is frequently situated in a social narrative which others' this community. As a consequence, Roma pupils' low achievement is frequently understood on the basis of a deficit view of Roma culture because schooling and Roma traditions are widely seen as incompatible. This article theorises aspects related to Roma's national and ethnic-cultural identity descriptions by investigating how 20 Greek Roma who have accessed higher education account for their success in relation to its connections with their national (being Greek') and ethnic-cultural (being Roma') identities. This article argues that, for the respondents, being Greek' is critical in making up their identity; simultaneously, their identities positively draw on being Roma' which is reconstructed, against public stereotypes, as being connected with educational success and with being Greek'. The findings suggest that the identities of these academically successful respondents are inclusive of national and ethnic-cultural dimensions.

The vicious circle: effects of race and class on university entrance in Brazil	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial discrimination; Exame Nacional do Ensino Medio; ENEM Examination; Brazil; secondary education	RACIAL CLASSIFICATION	Brazil has high levels of socio-economic inequality and an inequitable distribution of access to higher education. How much of this inequality is associated with race or class is an important question in light of the current debate over affirmative action and the suitability of race and social targeted policies. There are those who claim that racial disparities in the educational system are a result of students' social status and not a result of racism, while others believe race is an important factor that superposes the effect of class. This study uses national survey data from Brazil's Exame Nacional do Ensino Medio (National Secondary Education Exam [ENEM]) to examine the relationship between race and access to higher education of high school students between 2004 and 2008. The results document a vicious circle which connects the schooling of the young with their race, socio-economic status, and university attendance.

J	Watt, D				Watt, Diana			Dealing with difficult conversations: anti-racism in youth & community work training	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical dialogue; conversations; diversity; whiteness; resistance; resilience		This paper represents a critical reflection on youth and community work students' response to a module on race equality and diversity. An awareness of issues in relation to power and oppression are amongst the core elements of youth and community work training. Throughout their study, youth and community work students are engaged in conversations aimed at enabling them to critically examine their own attitudes and beliefs in areas of anti-discriminatory and anti-oppressive practices. These classroom conversations and expressions of resistance and resilience are informed by Paulo Freire's work on critical dialogue. As a specialist unit the module on equality and diversity was aimed at developing students' critical understanding of race, racism and ethnic difference. Based on written feedback, student-led presentations and conversations of protest', this paper critically explores the power of whiteness in silencing particular groups of students.

J	Chang, A				Chang, Aurora			Undocumented intelligence: laying low by achieving high - an "illegal alien's' co-option of school and citizenship	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Undocumented; Chicana feminism; intelligence; self-study	SMARTNESS	In this article, I relay the irony of my own path as an illegal alien' in the US - identifying the tension between being a successful student earning straight As and accolades for good citizenship, while hiding my undocumented legal status. Drawing from the notions of race, smartness and citizenship as social constructions, I use a Chicana feminist epistemology to argue that, from early on, my schooling process taught me, intentionally or not, that academic achievement, as perceived and assessed by my school teachers and administrators, would protect me from unwarranted inquiries about my illegal' status. But beyond academic achievement, I argue that my undocumented status greatly contributed to my unofficial and undocumented intelligence,' that is, the knowledge, skills and intuition fostered by living as an undocumented person. Negotiating the process of schooling as an underground good' citizen fostered intangible skills that undergirded my ability and motivation to do well in school and to interact with people in a cautiously savvy way. Critically thinking about my daily behaviors and interactions with authority, the significance of scholarly performance and the transnational conditions that led me to this conundrum, then, was not an option but a necessity for individual and familial survival. This narrative aims to introduce and relocate undocumented intelligence' from a place of obscurity to a central position in educational research - a site of knowledge construction, development and authorship.

The study is based on the life stories of these young Moroccan women and on ideas that emerge from discussion groups involving the women themselves and experts in education and other fields. We report that the young women perceive a certain degree of flexibility on the part of their families in their intra-family relations and the model of woman they are prepared to accept. However, our study also provides evidence of the fact that their success is associated with a constant process of negotiation, the women having to exercise their agency above and beyond their parental expectations and control, leaving them in a position of solitude.

J	Harper, CE				Harper, Casandra Elena			Pre-college and college predictors of longitudinal changes in multiracial college students' self-reported race	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						racial categorization; multiracial college students; longitudinal change	RACIAL IDENTITY	This longitudinal study of 1101 multiracial college students from 105 US institutions reveals the dynamic racial designation choices of participants as freshmen and as seniors, as 56% of the sample gave inconsistent responses about their race over time. Logistic regressions predicting a multiracial designation choice as seniors reveal the pre-college and college factors associated with developing or maintaining this choice over the span of college. Experiences such as living on campus, joining a racial or ethnic student organization, taking an ethnic studies course, participating in a racial awareness workshop, and discussing issues of political or personal importance were each significant predictors of the racial identification patterns examined in this study. The results of this study offer evidence of the need to consider longitudinal changes in students' race and the ways in which students' racial identification preferences change between the time they enter and leave college.

We describe a peer-mentoring model, piloted in 2009 at The University of Auckland, New Zealand with university staff in order to promote staff advancement. The participants were all Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. The strengths of the model were: it gave Maori staff a rare opportunity to work with other Maori in a context where their culture was the norm with regards to language, spirituality, humour, and whakawhanaungatanga (togetherness); it mediated the effects of isolation that Maori staff often feel when working in large institutions; and, provided affirmation of Maori in a large institutional environment. This case study suggests that the model of staff development would be applicable to other indigenous minority groups, by adopting a similar approach and adapting the model to the specific cultural practices of the group.

J	Feniger, Y				Feniger, Yariv			Jewish ethnicity and educational opportunities in Israel: evidence from a curricular reform	Race Ethnicity and Education			English	Article						tracking; ethnic inequality; Israel; secondary education	TRACKING; SCHOOLS; STRATIFICATION	Based on a 20% representative sample of all high school students in Israel in the mid-1990s, this study explores a reform implemented in low socio-economic status (SES) state religious high schools. Most of their students were from the disadvantaged Jewish ethnic group in Israel, Mizrachim. Perceived as unable to meet the requirements of academic programs, more than half these students studied on lower ranked vocational tracks. As part of the reform, these tracks were replaced by academic tracks aimed at awarding students a matriculation diploma. Comparable low SES secular high schools did not adopt the same curriculum change, so a comparison of these two types of school for learning opportunities became possible. Results revealed a significant improvement in matriculation eligibility rates in low SES religious schools while eligibility rates in comparable non-religious schools remained relatively stable.

J	Kitching, K				Kitching, Karl			How the Irish became CRT'd? 'Greening' Critical Race Theory, and the pitfalls of a normative Atlantic state view	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						postcolonial studies; Irishness; Whiteness; Critical Race Theory; education	INSTITUTIONAL RACISM; EDUCATION; PERSPECTIVES; TRADITION; BROWN	This article considers the transatlantic use of Critical Race Theory (CRT) frameworks to critically interpret racism in education internationally, and the possibilities and pitfalls this has for understanding racism in Ireland. It argues for the importance of CRT's framework on a number of grounds, but echoes cautions against the assumed, or sole use of a white/non-white framework to understand situated anti-racisms 'elsewhere'. This caution focuses on less on CRT principles per se, and more on typically derivative 'nationalist' policy appropriations of anti-racism. Education policy (and research) misrepresentations of systemic racism as happening in another place, or at another time function by deracialising and ignoring complex Atlantic and wider (neo)colonial relations. By exploring the 'troubling movements' of education's emergence within Irish-Atlantic-Empire politics, the article encourages postcolonial animations of CRT praxis. It shows ways in which CRT can work transnationally with and beyond white/non-white dualisms, to challenge derivative 'normative state' dilutions of educational anti-racisms.

J	Levine-Rasky, C				Levine-Rasky, Cynthia			White fear: analyzing public objection to Toronto's Africentric school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Africentric school; public opinion; whiteness; psycoanalysis; Toronto; racism; emotion; fear; psychosocial		In September 2009, the Toronto District School Board opened a publicly funded Africentric alternative school that today serves a population of about 135 students. While the founding of the eponymous school was the result of successful advocacy on the part of African-Canadian communities in the city, it was met with controversy. Readily observed in online comments appearing in national newspapers, objection to the school was far more common than approval. Arguments against the school ranged from the defense of Canada's official multiculturalism that impels a fantasy of a 'rainbow' of children interacting in the city's classrooms, to crudely racist remarks equating blackness with uneducability. Through the lens of psychoanalysis, objections to the school are seen as expressions of white fear of the self-determining Africentric Other. In this process, white innocence projects fear of its fragmentation onto the educated black body suddenly capable of incisive knowledge and expressive power.

J	Leonardo, Z; Harris, AP				Leonardo, Zeus; Harris, Angela P.			Living with racism in education and society: Derrick Bell's ethical idealism and political pragmatism	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical Race Theory; education; Derrick Bell; racism; racial realism	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; REFLECTIONS	Derrick Bell's pronouncement and challenge that racism is likely permanent has captured the imagination of Critical Race Theorists in education. Equally important are his ideas about living with the concrete conditions of racism. This article focuses on a tension within Bell's work. On the one hand, his writings are characterized by a certain racial realism.' In this perspective, Bell encourages race scholars and activists to abandon notions of one day ending racism. On the other hand, Bell also retains a certain idealism, most evident in his appeal to the ethical dimensions of critical race work. He invites intellectuals to join him in fighting racism even if the prospects for change are sometimes bleak. In his life as well as his work, Bell willingly sacrificed prestige and financial security for his ideals, and seemed puzzled when his friends and colleagues were reluctant to do the same. Bell's racial realism and ethical idealism comprise two - sometimes warring - moments that permeate his work.

J	Basit, TN				Basit, Tehmina N.			' ... But that's just the stereotype': gender and ethnicity in transition to adulthood	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						ethnicity; gender; transition to adulthood	EDUCATION POLICY; YOUNG-PEOPLE; ATTAINMENT; BRITISH; RACE	This article examines the role of gender and ethnicity in young minority ethnic British citizens' transition to adulthood. As part of a larger study using a mixed methods approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 young men and women aged 14-24 at different stages of education, employment and non-employment. By employing Bourdieu's concept of habitus, the article shows how young people's transition to adulthood is affected by gender and ethnic considerations. It is argued that for some, the interplay of gender and ethnicity with religion is a crucial aspect of their transition which causes them to make choices to live their lives in a certain way, whereas for others it is more subtle and nuanced. Further, researchers and policymakers need to be cognisant of the similarities and differences of gendered experiences within various minority ethnic groups and the similarities between these groups and the majority ethnic group.

J	Desmond, M; Emirbayer, M				Desmond, Matthew; Emirbayer, Mustafa			To imagine and pursue racial justice	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						multiculturalism; racial justice; race politics		At the conclusion of many courses on race and racism, students, having learned, some for the first time, about the existence, origins, and complex dimensions of racial domination in America, are left pondering their next steps. 'What is to be done?' many ask. 'And what, exactly, is it that we want?' Important as they are, these questions too often are given insufficient attention, usually addressed at the end of the semester, sometimes only on the final day of class. And students inquiring about the most effective ways to strive toward racial justice are at a loss to find a single comprehensive source that provides them with basic analytical guidance about the goals one should work toward (the ends) or the strategies one should employ to achieve those goals (the means). We believe that students would benefit greatly from such a source, and we attempt to offer one here. To effectively address racial domination, we argue, one must have not only an idea of the means with which to struggle on behalf of a reconstructed racial order, but also an idea of the ends for which one is struggling. Accordingly, in the first major section of this article, we specify three ends: (1) a society where racial domination is addressed intelligently; (2) a society that embraces racial justice in all its arenas; and (3) a society that values and practices multiculturalism - offering a glimpse of what a society without racial domination might look like. In the following section, we specify the means - emphasizing four levels or sites of change having to do with: (1) ourselves; (2) our inner circle; (3) our institutions; and (4) our nation - offering some guidance as to how we each can do our part to bring forth a more racially just society. Although we believe this article will provide guidance for advanced scholars and instructors, we have composed it primarily with a broader audience in mind.

J	Rhamie, J				Rhamie, Jasmine			Achievement and underachievement: the experiences of African Caribbeans	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African Caribbean achievement; resilience; academic success	RESILIENCE	The disproportionate representation of African Caribbeans in all the negative educational statistics has been well documented. Despite this, there are African Caribbeans who achieve academically but relatively few studies have explored this area. This study aimed to investigate the factors that contribute to African Caribbean academic success, taking into account the factors that contribute to low academic achievement. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Seventy-eight questionnaires were analysed and 38 respondents aged 16 to 40+ years were interviewed. Data is presented for the highest and lowest achieving groups. The findings revealed that most African Caribbeans have negative experiences at school. The difference between those who are successful academically and those who are not depends upon the development of resilience and protective factors that mitigate the negative impact of school.

J	Ajayi, L				Ajayi, Lasisi			Exploring how ESL teachers relate their ethnic and social backgrounds to practice	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						diversity; ethnic; social backgrounds; ESL instruction; poststructuralist theory; subjectivity	IDENTITIES; LANGUAGE	This study is an exploration of how English as a second language (ESL) teachers relate their ethnic and social backgrounds to instructional practices. Fifty-seven ESL teachers from inner-city junior high schools of Los Angeles responded to a questionnaire, interviews and provided self-written perspectives on how their personal histories mediated their pedagogical practices. The teachers' narratives were analyzed within the framework of critical reflectivity. Results indicated that teachers of different backgrounds interpreted their roles differently based on a complex interplay of diverse variables. The teachers also deployed diverse approaches and strategies to guide their practices and mediate their roles. The study recommended development of teacher education programs and curricula that incorporate explorations of prospective teachers' social/ethnic background experiences, perspectives, assumptions, expectations, and attitudes as a way to ascertain how such teachers' personal histories will shape their pedagogical choices. The study also recommended well-designed community-based immersion programs for all prospective teachers as a way to bridge social and cultural gaps between teachers and their students.

J	Brown, KD; Kraehe, A				Brown, Keffrelyn D.; Kraehe, Amelia			Sociocultural knowledge and visual re(-) presentations of Black masculinity and community: reading The Wire for critical multicultural teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black males; teacher education; critical multicultural education; visual cultural studies	AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES; RACE	In this article we consider the implications of using popular visual media as a pedagogic tool for helping teachers acquire critical sociocultural knowledge to work more effectively with students of color, particularly Black males. Drawing from a textual analysis (McKee 2001, 2003; Rose 2001) conducted in the critical visual studies tradition (Barthes 1977; Hall 1993, 1997) and longstanding discourses on Blackness, Black masculinity and critical visual studies, we explore how the critically acclaimed HBO series, The Wire, positions Black males in the local and larger social milieu. While offering a more complex rendering of the Black male, The Wire simultaneously presents a myopic representation of the Black man and his place in the larger Black community. This inquiry highlights the pedagogic limitations of using The Wire, or any other visual media that reinscribes deficit-oriented knowledge that critical multicultural teacher education seeks to challenge about Blackness and Black people.

As a BAC member, I participated in the production and implementation of LOL and other BAC programs aimed at mobilizing communities to halt the mass incarceration of people of color. This article reflects BAC's effort to fuse art, education, and activism as a means to build public awareness and catalyze action toward ending the prison crisis in the United States. Highlights from BAC's journey to over 25 cities across the United States in five years are described in this piece, including reflections on the performances and interactive workshops in prisons, halfway houses, youth detention centers, and drug-treatment facilities with detainees and youth. This article examines an innovative arts-and-activist inspired program designed to address the root causes of crime, reduce recidivism, and support the educational growth and development of incarcerated youth and adults.

J	Oloo, JA; Kiramba, LK				Oloo, James Alan; Kiramba, Lydiah Kananu			A narrative inquiry into experiences of Indigenous teachers during and after teacher preparation	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Narrative inquiry; Metis; Indigenous education gaps; Teacher preparation; Indigenous teacher education programs	ABORIGINAL STUDENTS; REFLECTIONS; GAP	This narrative inquiry is informed by a concern to increase the number of Indigenous teachers in Canadian classrooms. While the Indigenous population is younger and growing faster than the non-Indigenous population, educational attainment gap remains between the two groups of Canadians. The gap is widening at the university level. This study explores the experiences of two Indigenous teachers during and after teacher education in an Indigenous teacher education program and attempts to reframe teacher education to enhance the meaningful engagement of pre-service Indigenous teachers. We conducted interviews as conversations with the study participants as guided by open-ended unstructured research questions and employed relational ontology because we believe that ethical relationships are paramount in conversations with participants. Four major common themes emerged from the participants' stories: decision to attend Indigenous teacher education program, Indigenous identity, positive learning environments, and the importance of Indigenous teachers in the schools. Implications for teacher education are presented.

Black families' resistance to deficit positioning: addressing the paradox of black parent involvement	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racism; ableism; parent involvement; Black families; resistance; Disability Critical Race Theory	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; CRITICAL LEGAL; MIDDLE; SCHOOL; DISABILITY; EDUCATION; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES; EXCLUSION; DISCOURSE	Traditional conceptualizations of parent involvement are applied in paradoxical ways to Black families - schools ostensibly seek families' participation in schooling, while positioning multiply-marginalized Black families as deficient and disregarding their contributions. This article explores the experiences of Black families of Black girls using a Disability Critical Race Theory (DisCrit) framing. Our exploration reveals how Black families experience and resist racism and ableism imbued in traditional conceptualizations of parent involvement grounded in white, middle-class families' norms. We describe ways Black families (1) relocated the problem from Black girls' behavior to schools' expectations and actions; (2) shifted schools' priorities from a focus on disciplining dis/abled Black girls to a focus on their support needs; (3) initiated dialogue to support Black girls; and, (4) assisted Black girls in recognizing, processing, and responding to racism and ableism. Through this discussion, we address ways to reconceptualize parent involvement to center multiply-marginalized Black families' priorities and contributions.

Exclusionary discipline may result in adverse academic, social, and life outcomes. There is an urgent need for creating an inclusive, equity-oriented learning environment where Native American students' identities, well-being, and dignity are promoted and nurtured. To develop a culturally responsive behavioral support system aimed to address racial disparity in school discipline, the Indigenous Learning Lab was implemented at a rural high school in Wisconsin. Indigenous Learning Lab is an inclusive problem-solving process through which Native American students, parents, and community members and non-native school staff collectively examine disproportionality in school discipline and design a new school-wide system. The purpose of this study is to examine how participation in Indigenous Learning Lab expanded local stakeholders' individual agency to collective, transformative agency in designing a culturally responsive behavioral support system.

J	Gholami, R				Gholami, Reza			Critical race theory and Islamophobia: challenging inequity in higher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						CRT; Islamophobia; muslim students; awarding gap; religification; higher education		This paper engages with a dominant model of Islamophobia which gives race and racism primacy. It argues that such an approach is parochial, conceptually narrow and practically ineffective. I take as my case the UK's Muslim student awarding gap - Muslims are currently the worst performing religious group at UK universities. Existing work explains this problem in terms of racism/Islamophobia. These factors are correctly identified, but a lack of analytical precision around race and religion has led strategies to fall back on 'standard' and largely ineffective ideas. I argue that racial and religious disadvantage must be understood separately, though intersectionally, through Critical Race Theory and the concept of 'religification'. Such an analysis sheds light on how institutional approaches to race and religion play a key role in the structuration and perpetuation of educational disadvantage for Muslim students. It also paves the way for more effective strategies for eradicating the awarding gap.

'I didn't want to be a statistic': black males, urban schooling, and educational urgency	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black male students; educational urgency; resistance; secondary school; aspirations	STEREOTYPES; RESILIENCE; POLITICS	Drawing upon resilience and educational urgency, this longitudinal study explores the narratives of 20 college-aged Black males as they make sense of their secondary school experiences at Marcus Garvey Academy (pseudonym), an all-boys public school in a large urban city in the U.S. In paying particular attention to some of the challenges they faced, findings indicate that a complex set of personal, family, peer, and school factors affect these students' lives during their secondary school years. In their efforts to overcome these difficulties, students scripted resistance into their self-concept, identified ways that they benefitted from a supportive schooling environment, and translated some of their self-learning into educational urgency. These students' experiences and meaning making serve as a critical counternarrative to how they are stereotyped and limited by deficit framing and lowered expectations and speak powerfully to ways to better theorize, understand, and appreciate Black males' schooling experiences, resistance efforts, and aspirations.

However, with the ability to recruit, Black boys have become prime targets of predominantly white private Catholic high schools seeking promising student-athletes. As a result, the population of Black boys at these schools are composed almost entirely of students recruited to play a sport. Drawing from qualitative interview data, the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the racialized experiences of six Black boys who attended a predominantly white Catholic high school in which the entire Black population was composed of student-athletes. Findings indicate that participants initially saw the private Catholic school as an escape from their respective public schools but realized that mere attendance did not result in total inclusion. All six participants encountered forms of antiblackness via frequent structural and cultural assaults that made their daily attendance at the school difficult.

Remembering and honoring the dead: Dia de los Muertos, Black Lives Matter and radical healing	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Radical healing; youth activism; extrajudicial killings	AMERICAN; YOUTH; REVOLUTION; POLICY; CARE	The officer who murdered George Floyd by pressing his knee on his neck symbolizes the chokehold systemic racism and antiblackness has had on Black people. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has provided a critical space where marginalized people of color can find their voice by engaging in social activism as well as a space where they can process and reflect on the larger issues that are affecting them in society. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to discuss how through a Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) project that addressed extrajudicial killings by creating a Dia de los Muertos float led to youth finding critical hope, which lent itself to radical healing.

We report findings from a study that employed narrative interviews to solicit stories from racially minoritized students at a predominantly white university. Participants included 16 graduate students and 18 undergraduate students who identified as African-American, Latinx or mixed race. Students shared microaffirmations that they experienced related to their racial identities. We developed a typology of four microaffirmation types from the students' stories: microrecognitions, microvalidations, microtransformations and microprotections. Drawing on the students' stories, we further define each microaffirmation type and root the typology in the foundational elements of Critical Race/LatCrit theoretical framework. This study offers concrete examples of experiences university students found affirming that are helpful to practitioners seeking to better understand what racial microaffirmations are and ways they may be promoted. This work also expands the literature on microaffirmations and points to areas that need further research.

J	Bristol, TJ				Bristol, Travis J.			Black men teaching: toward a theory of social isolation in organizations	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						School organizational context; social isolation; urban schools; black male teachers	MALE TEACHERS; PUBLIC-SCHOOLS; RACE; EXPERIENCES; WORKPLACE; POLITICS; GENDER; LIFE	While there continues to be increasing research about Black male teachers' school-based experiences, there is less empirical evidence on the variation in these experiences for this subgroup. Drawing on Kanter's Theory of Numbers and Group Composition, the researcher used the qualitative method to compare the perceptions of Black male teachers in schools that employ just one Black male teacher versus schools with larger numbers of Black male teachers. A theory of social isolation in organizations is proposed to explain differences in the variation of school-based experiences for Black male teachers. When compared to Black men in schools with larger percentages of Black male teachers on the faculty, those Black men who were the only Black male teachers on their faculty were more likely to describe feeling socially isolated and disconnected from their colleagues.

J	Kokka, K; Chao, T				Kokka, Kari; Chao, Theodore			'How I show up for Brown and Black students': Asian American male mathematics teachers seeking solidarity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Mathematics education; Asian American teachers; photovoice; internalized racism	PRESERVICE TEACHERS; INTERNALIZED RACISM; COLOR; PHOTOVOICE; EDUCATION; MINORITY; MODEL; WHITENESS; CHILDREN; CAREER	The ratio of Asian American teachers to Asian American students is the most disproportionate of all racial groups, where Asian American students are least likely to have an Asian American teacher. In addition, little research focuses on the experiences of Asian American teachers, particularly in connection with issues of racism. Using AsianCrit, internalized racism, and stereotype management, this study investigates how Asian American male mathematics teachers conceptualize their racial/ethnic and mathematics teacher identities given the prevalence of the Model Minority Myth. Using photovoice interviews, findings indicate that participants experienced internalized racism and engaged in stereotype management by distancing themselves from other Asian Americans, discussing their own difficulties in mathematics, and actively reaching out to form relationships with Black and Latinx students. We recommend supports for Asian American teachers and all teachers of color to build critical consciousness to reduce internalized racism and empower themselves and their students.

J	Fisher, AE; Fisher, BW; Railey, KS				Fisher, Amy E.; Fisher, Benjamin W.; Railey, Kirsten S.			Disciplinary disparities by race and disability: using DisCrit theory to examine the manifestation determination review process in special education in the United States	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Review						Manifestation determination review; DisCrit; discipline gaps; race; disability	RACIAL THREAT; SCHOOL; STUDENTS; PUNISHMENT; VIOLENCE	Exclusionary discipline practices in the United States are used disproportionately in the punishment of Black students with a disability compared to White and Black students with or without a disability. One potential mechanism leading to the disproportionate use of exclusionary discipline is a process called 'manifestation determination reviews' (MDR), a process mandated under the U.S. federal Individuals with Disabilities Act that is tasked with determining whether students' offending behaviours were related to their disability. Using a disability studies/critical race theory (DisCrit) lens, the MDR process can be understood as a mechanism that serves to sustain these inequities through vague guidance in critical elements of the MDR process, lack of clarity about the composition of the MDR team, and perpetuation of a race-neutral framework. Implications for policy, educators, and school psychologists within the United States are discussed.

J	Hollinsworth, D; Raciti, M; Carter, J				Hollinsworth, David; Raciti, Maria; Carter, Jennifer			Indigenous students' identities in Australian higher education: found, denied, and reinforced	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Aboriginality; identity; (anti-)essentialism; higher education; diversity; counterstory	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; COLOR-LINE; ABORIGINALITY; DISCOURSES; POLITICS; WHITE; INTERSECTIONALITY; POSITION; SPEECH; GENDER	Indigenous Australian identities are enmeshed in racializing discourses that often occlude diversity, hybridity, and intersectionality. Australians who self-identify as Aboriginal are often disbelieved by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, or confront hierarchies of authenticity. Critical analysis of focus groups with undergraduate Aboriginal students suggests that while there are opportunities to find and reinforce their identities in Australian universities, those identities are also denied. Using counterstories and critical race theory, this study exposes dominant misrepresentations of Aboriginality in Australian higher education that can affect academic success and attrition. Universities need to abandon rigid, culturalist constructions of Aboriginal students' identities, and expectations that these can be codified and regulated. Academic and administrative staff require sustained education in the histories of defining Aboriginality, and knowledge of Aboriginal identity politics, stereotypes, and the diversity of contemporary Indigenous peoples so they can respond in culturally safe and flexible ways to Aboriginal students.

The extent to which Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) are part of these discussions is unclear as the group is considered faculty of color but not always underrepresented minorities. Using data on all four-year postsecondary institutions, this study examines AAPI faculty representation over more than two decades, focusing on the intersection of race and gender across the tenure pipeline. Results indicate a persistent underrepresentation of AAPI women as full professors similar to other women of color. Through an analysis of past and current faculty representation across rank, this study has implications for initiatives aimed at increasing faculty diversity.

J	Marrun, NA; Plachowski, TJ; Clark, C				Marrun, Norma A.; Plachowski, Tara J.; Clark, Christine			A critical race theory analysis of the 'demographic diversity' gap in schools: college Students of Color speak their truth	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racism; teachers; Students of Color; racial microaggressions; media; careers	CAMPUS RACIAL CLIMATE; PRESERVICE TEACHERS; EXPERIENCES; EXPECTATIONS; EDUCATION; MICROAGGRESSIONS; IMPACT; PERCEPTIONS; ETHNICITY; CLASSROOM	The shortage of Teachers of Color relative to the growing racial/ethnic diversity of the U.S. public school student population has caught the attention of many educators and policy makers. Several factors contribute to this teacher-student demographic diversity gap, especially the lower numbers of college Students of Color, relative to white students, enrolled in teacher education programs. Using a Critical Race Theory framework and qualitative data, this study examined the perceptions of college Students of Color about the teaching profession. Findings reveal that college Students of Color are not interested in pursuing careers in teaching because they feel that: 1) teachers are underpaid and undervalued by society; 2) teachers are negatively represented, and Teachers of Color are underrepresented, in media and popular culture; and, 3) the cumulative negative impact of the racial microaggressions they experienced over the course of their schooling has discouraged them from considering teaching as a profession.

J	Fox, B; Paradies, Y				Fox, Brandi; Paradies, Yin			Youth sport and community segregation: a study of kids? participation in Australian rules football and soccer clubs in an Australian community	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Sport; community; primary school; segregation; race; racism; Australia	SOCIAL INCLUSION; DIVERSITY; LEISURE; RACE	This research addresses the appeal for more empirical-based research on exclusionary practices in local community sport that often go unchallenged within dominant discourses. By examining how organised community sport clubs can uphold systemic segregation of various ethnic, racial, linguistic, religious and socioeconomic groups, this study also draws attention to the importance of research on race, ethnicity, and education in primary school age children; a population group often ignored in both racism studies and studies of sport. Using interview and focus group data from school principals and students (aged 9?12), including students from refugee and asylum seeker migrant backgrounds, collected over 3 years from two schools in the same multicultural community in Melbourne, Australia, this paper challenges the depiction of sport as an uncontested inclusive space in national and educational discourse, and instead demonstrates the continued existence of exclusion through systemically mediated segregation in organised community youth sport.

J	Kerr, J; Andreotti, V				Kerr, Jeannie; Andreotti, Vanessa			Crossing borders in initial teacher education: mapping dispositions to diversity and inequity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Teacher education; racism; social justice; equity; decolonization; critical theory		In this article, we share a study focused on engaging teacher candidates with multiple forms of diversity and inequity to study emerging patterns of dispositions. Our primary concern is in understanding the processes through which societal inequity becomes reconstituted through teacher education. Our study attempts to deepen discourses of equality' and equity' in education, to consider the ways teacher candidates relate to broader systems of power and global and local inequities through their role as educators. Inspired by both decolonial and Western critical theories, we frame this as research that seeks otherwise' as we invite teacher candidates to cross borders' to what is other' to themselves. In this article, we share our study's priorities, methods, methodological/theoretical framework, data analysis and findings. Our findings identify a significant gap between the priorities of social equity to which teacher candidates state they commit and the educational practices that would affirm those commitments.

RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Citizenship education; citizenship as practice; character education; Arab minority in Israel; Palestinian-Israeli conflict	CHARACTER EDUCATION; POLITICS; CHALLENGES; CURRICULUM; DIVERSITY	This study examines citizenship education in Israel from the point of view of Arab teachers, as they rework and negotiate the content and boundaries of their Israeli citizenship. Specifically, the paper studies how teachers of citizenship education in Arab high schools in Israel perceive their sociopolitical reality, how they respond to it in their classrooms, and how they conceptualize Israeli citizenship for their pupils. In doing so, the paper ponders the pedagogical strategies and emphases of these teachers, as they mediate the citizenship education curriculum, with its heavy emphasis on the ethno-national character of Israel, to their Arab pupils.

J	Bradbury, A				Bradbury, Alice			A critical race theory framework for education policy analysis: the case of bilingual learners and assessment policy in England	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						CRT; policy analysis; bilingual learners; EAL; assessment policy	SCHOOLS; REFLECTIONS; ABILITY; RACISM; ACT	This paper combines tools from policy sociology with those from Critical Race Theory (CRT) to build a framework for a CRT-based education policy analysis, based on a set of questions about the relationship between policy and racial inequalities. Drawing on a case study of assessment policy in England, the paper examines how tools from both bodies of scholarship can be used to interrogate the motivations, results, and assumptions implicit in policy. The policy used as an illustration is the introduction of Baseline Assessment, which was conducted in the first weeks of school at age four/five for the purposes of measuring progress seven years later. This policy failed to take into account the needs of bilingual learners (or children with English as an additional language in UK terminology). It is argued that this absence provides an example of how policy can serve to continue white dominance while appearing neutral and meritocratic.

Racial segregation and the limits of international undergraduate student diversity	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asian international students; racial segregation; ethnic student organizations; Asian Americans	ASIAN-AMERICAN-STUDENTS; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; ORGANIZATIONS; MOBILITY; CAMPUS	This study challenges the assertion that the influx of Asian international undergraduate students in universities across the United States creates richer educational and social environments. Drawing on qualitative research at a public university with a large number of Asian international students, this article examines how Asian American student leaders and their organization took on the difficult institutional task of actualizing the diversity of these new students in a racially segregated campus. We found that instead of viewing racial segregation practices as possibly tied to racial discrimination and privileges of normative whiteness, students expressed both support and resistance to Asian international students in race-neutral language of comfort and organizational differences that reflects the dominant ideology of colorblindness. We argue that any claims to the benefits of international student diversity must take serious account of colorblind racism and the experiences of racial marginalization and racial segregation among domestic minority and international students.

J	Cannizzaro, S; Gholami, R				Cannizzaro, Sara; Gholami, Reza			The devil is not in the detail: representational absence and stereotyping in the 'Trojan Horse' news story	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Trojan Horse; news; content analysis; representation; governance; Islamophobia	CULTURE; WAR	Using content analysis, this study investigated the coverage of the Trojan Horse news story aiming to ascertain whether its representation by the British press emphasized 'Islamist extremism' over 'poor school governance'. The sample coverage was extracted from five national newspapers and ranged from 9 June (the date of release of the Ofsted Advice Note) to 26 June 2014. Our analysis shows that the coverage reported evidence of Islamist ideology much more frequently (61.5%) than evidence of poor governance (38.5%). This suggests that the Trojan Horse news story was predominantly represented as a case of Islamist extremism and therefore covered in an unbalanced manner. Such a partial coverage relied on ideological dualisms and negative stereotypes to represent Islam and Muslims, and on the textual strategy of selecting some features (extremism) whilst omitting others (governors' professional misconduct). This bias has arguably diverted attention away from systemic problems within the national school system whilst reinforcing Islamophobic discourses.

J	Lewis, TE				Lewis, Tyson E.			"But I'm not a racist!" Phenomenology, racism, and the body schema in white, pre-service teacher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Anti-racist pedagogy; phenomenology; Merleau-Ponty; Freire; Du Bois; teacher education; critical whiteness studies	DIFFERENCE	In this article, I call for a phenomenological turn in educating white, pre-service teachers. As opposed to dominant pedagogical models which focus on changing one's beliefs about race, phenomenology points toward the importance of pre-conceptual, pre-critical forms of racial embodiment. Here I draw upon recent work on the different between body image (beliefs about the body) and body schema (what the body can do). The worry is that existing forms of anti-oppressive education miss the centrality of the schema, and thus do not go far enough in uncovering the embodied, perceptual roots of racism.

Understanding the role of schools in the Asian-white gap: a seasonal comparison approach	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asian-white gap; racial achievement gap; Asian American; seasonal comparison; school environment; non-school environment	1ST 2 YEARS; MODEL-MINORITY; ACADEMIC-SUCCESS; AMERICAN; ACHIEVEMENT; DISCRIMINATION; INEQUALITY; CLASSROOM; STUDENTS; TRENDS	Asian Americans are the most highly educated racial group in the United States and are commonly heralded as the model minority for their high academic success. Nevertheless, previous research suggests that Asian Americans may face certain disadvantages in school settings. For example, Asian Americans' academic advantage over non-Hispanic white students diminishes between kindergarten entry and the next several years of schooling. This study provides a closer examination of the educational progress of Asian American students compared to white students through a seasonal comparison approach. Using the Northwest Evaluation Association, we analyze reading and math scores for over 130,000 Asian American and white students in grades K-7 in approximately 675 public schools across the US. We find that Asian Americans have higher academic achievement than white students in general, but that these advantages are maintained primarily through faster rates of learning during the summer months. When school is in session, the Asian advantage either remains unchanged or shrinks, consistent with the view that some school processes undermine the educational progress of Asian American students relative to white students.

J	Carolissen, R; Bozalek, V				Carolissen, Ronelle; Bozalek, Vivienne			Addressing dualisms in student perceptions of a historically white and black university in South Africa	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Dualisms; higher education; inclusion; transformative pedagogies; South Africa	HIGHER-EDUCATION	Normative discourses about higher education institutions may perpetuate stereotypes about institutions. Few studies explore student perceptions of universities and how transformative pedagogical interventions in university classrooms may address institutional stereotypes. Using Plumwood's notion of dualism, this qualitative study analyses unchallenged stereotypes about students' own and another university during an inter-institutional collaborative research and teaching and learning project. The project was conducted over 3years and 282 psychology, social work and occupational therapy students from a historically black and white institution in South Africa, participated in the study. Both black and white students from differently placed higher education institutions display prejudices and stereotypes of their own and other institutions, pointing to the internalisation and pervasiveness of constructions and hegemonic discourses such as whiteness and classism. It is important to engage with subjugated student knowledges, in the context of transformative pedagogical practices, to disrupt dominant views and cultivate processes of inclusion in higher education.

J	Christian, M				Christian, Mark			From Liverpool to New York City: behind the veil of a Black British male scholar inside higher education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black British Male; Africana; Black Studies; UK and US higher education; White Supremacy in Liberal Arts Spaces; Fear of the Black Male	ACADEMY	This paper speaks to the experience of Black British male experience in academia, with emphasis on UK and US colleges and universities. It is an autoethnographic study in terms of relating, witnessing, and noting both learning and teaching experiences within the confines of higher education in the UK and US. The idea behind this paper is to highlight the need for greater access and opportunity for Black scholars to teach and study without stress and strain on their minds and bodies. There are a number of studies that confirm the efficacy in sharing one's experience as an insider' within academia as a person of color. But there are few studies that speak directly to the reality of teaching and researching within the context of Africana or Black Studies in higher education. It is noted that academia should be a place whereby liberal arts of all genres are accepted and respected; in this sense, there is still a long way to go before we can attest to the affirmative of this point of view.

J	D'Arcy, K				D'Arcy, Kate			Using counter-stories to challenge stock stories about Traveller families	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Stock stories; counter-stories; Traveller communities; educational inequalities	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EDUCATION; ROMA	Critical Race Theory (CRT) is formed from a series of different methodological tools to expose and address racism and discrimination. Counter-stories are one of these tools. This article considers the potential of counter-stories as a methodological, theoretical and practical tool to analyse existing educational inequalities for Traveller communities. Although discrimination towards Traveller communities is well documented, there has been limited use of CRT to examine this position and challenge the social injustice they experience. In this article stock stories', or commonly held assumptions and stereotypes about Traveller communities are highlighted and refuted with Travellers' own accounts. It is hoped this article will dispel stock stories, raise awareness of the real inequalities Travellers face and inform methodological debate.

A study of significance of racial and athletic identification on educational perceptions among African American male college athletes	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial identity; athletic identity; academic self-concept; student-athletes	ACADEMIC SELF-CONCEPT; STUDENT-ATHLETE; RACE; STEREOTYPES; IDENTITY; ME	The purpose of this study was to analyze the racial and athletic identities of African American male college athletes to determine how the identities might impact the athletic and educational potential and performance of this specific group of college athletes. The study revealed that participants who responded negatively to a poor athletic performance were more likely to have lower levels of academic self-concept. In contrast, college athletes who highly identified with their racial group were more likely to have higher levels of academic self-concept. Overall, the findings reveal the intricacies and complexities of being an African American college student and athlete at predominantly white institutions (PWIs) in the US. As such, the article details the implications of the findings as they relate to African American culture, American sports culture, and higher education realities.

Mujeres truchas: urban girls redefining smartness in a dystopic global south	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Smartness; border women; urban education; Chicana feminist; mujerista perspectives; alternative ways of knowing	UNITED-STATES	Set against colonial narratives of border women and neoliberal ideologies increasingly permeating school systems around the world, this article maps out ways in which a group of young women in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico embody and reconstruct notions of smartness. I draw on Chicana feminist theory to introduce the concept of mujeres truchas, a set of intelligences that stem from a life at the margins and a struggle for survival and hope. Further, they challenge Cartesian dualisms about knowledge by incorporating the rational and critical thought but also the physical and spiritual knowledges generated by everyday life in the barrio. This form of smartness also counters the individualism in post-feminist discourse by emphasizing decolonizing, healing, and collective goals.

J	Pasztor, A				Pasztor, Adel			Divergent pathways: the road to higher education for second-generation Turks in Austria	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Austria; ethnic minority students; higher education choice; second generation Turks; tracking	SCHOOL-SYSTEM; CHOICE	The article aims to explore immigrant educational pathways in relation to access to higher education (HE) in the Austrian context. Specifically focusing on Turkish youth, the author presents case studies of students who successfully entered HE in spite of their disadvantaged social, ethnic and geographic background. By further enhancing Ball's distinction (Ball, Reay, and David 2002) between embedded and contingent choosers, the article provides an in-depth understanding of the cultural and structural context in which these students' educational choices are played out. Finally, reaching out for Turner's (1960) notion of sponsored mobility, the article reflects on how the process of early selection reduces the opportunities for immigrant youth to access seemingly open and free HE.

J	Markose, SJ; Simpson, A				Markose, Susan Jacqueline; Simpson, Alyson			'I want them better than me': Pedagogical strategies employed by four immigrant parents in the face of perceived forms of exclusion by school authorities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						differential educational outcomes; immigrant literacy practices; alienation from schools	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; MOTIVATION; EDUCATION; RACISM	In Australia, students from Chinese and Arabic language backgrounds form the largest minority language groups in the New South Wales (NSW) public school system. Yet the mainstream academic performance of students from these two communities show marked differences in their levels of attainment. This article explores the home literacy practices of two immigrant families - one from a Chinese background and the other of Lebanese heritage - in order to obtain insights into how parents support their children in the acquisition of mainstream literacies. It documents parents' perceptions of their interactions with school authorities in relation to their children's educational needs. Findings indicate that despite a plethora of inclusive policies adopted by the children's schools, the families in our study perceived school authorities as exclusionary in their practices. The article chronicles the sense of powerlessness and alienation experienced by both families when confronted with the rigidity of a school system they neither knew nor understood. Despite the similarities in their experiences, the Chinese family succeeded in the acquisition of mainstream literacies while the Lebanese family continues to struggle with the demands of the school curriculum. We present the contrasting solutions adopted by the two families to meet the educational needs of their children and indicate how their culturally derived responses go part way in explaining the different levels of school achievement experienced by the two families.

Within education, it was also seen as an opportunity for addressing diversity in a historically ethnocentric educational system through the introduction of a European dimension. Against this background, this article explores Greek-Cypriot children's discourses about national others by drawing upon two sets of data collected in two studies of roughly seven years apart. Despite the different theoretical and methodological approaches of the two studies, and despite the temporal distance between them (almost three and a half years before and after Cyprus's EU accession respectively), the concept of 'Europe' was mobilised by children in highly similar ways to distinguish, evaluate and hierarchise various others and to re-produce ethnic, racial, and Eurocentric stereotypes against national outgroups and their immigrant classmates from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds	[Philippou, Stavroula] Univ Cyprus, Dept Educ, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Theodorou, Eleni] European Univ Cyprus, Dept Educ Sci, Nicosia, Cyprus	University of Cyprus; European University Cyprus	Philippou, S (corresponding author), Univ Cyprus, Dept Educ, Nicosia, Cyprus.	philippou.stavroula@ucy.ac.cy		Philippou, Stavroula/0000-0003-1488-8015; Theodorou, Eleni/0000-0001-8143-6348				Afantitou-Lambrianou Th., 2010, MEDITERRANEAN J ED S, V15, P5; Argyrou V., 1996, TRADITION MODERNITY; Argyrou V., 2010, CYPRUS REV, V22, P39; Balagangadhara SN, 2009, INTERVENTIONS-UK, V11, P50, DOI 10.1080/13698010902752731; BARRETT M, 1996, CHANGING EUROPEAN ID, P00349; Barrett M, 2005, STUD DEV PSYCHOL, P251; Brubaker R, 2000, THEOR SOC, V29, P1, DOI 10.1023/A:1007068714468; Crozier G, 2008, RACE ETHN EDUC, V11, P285, DOI 10.1080/13613320802291173; Cyprus Ombudsman's Office, 2005, ANN REP 2004 CYRP OM; Dale G, 1999, EUROPEAN UNION MIGRA, P1; Devine D., 2006, CHILDREN SOC, V20, P128; Diez Thomas, 2002, EUROPEAN UNION CYPRU; Diez Thomas, 2010, CYPRUS REV, V22, P175; Eldering L, 1997, ANTHROPOL EDUC QUART, V28, P330, DOI 10.1525/aeq.1997.28.3.330; European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia, 2005, RAC XEN EU MEMB ST 2; European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia, 2004, RAC XEN EU MEMB ST 2; Faas D, 2008, EUR EDUC RES J, V7, P108, DOI 10.2304/eerj.2008.7.1.108; Fairclough I., 2012, ANAL DISCOURSE; Gee J.P., 2011, DISCOURSE NALYSIS; Gee J.P., 2005, INTRO DISCOURSE ANAL; GEE JP, 1992, HDB QUALITATIVE RES, P227; Gillborn D, 1997, ANTHROPOL EDUC QUART, V28, P375, DOI 10.1525/aeq.1997.28.3.375; Gogolin I., 2002, EUR EDUC RES J, V1, P123, DOI DOI 10.2304/EERJ.2002.1.1.3; Gregoriou Z, 2004, COMP EDUC, V40, P241, DOI 10.1080/0305006042000231374; Hajisoteriou C, 2010, EUR EDUC RES J, V9, P471, DOI 10.2304/eerj.2010.9.4.471; Hansen P., 1998, EUROPEAN J INTERCULT, V9, P5, DOI DOI 10.1080/0952391980090101; Hansen Peo, 2002, EUR J SOC THEORY; Huberman A.

J	Howard, PSS				Howard, Philip S. S.			Taking the bull by the horns: the critical perspectives and pedagogy of two Black teachers in Anglophone Montreal schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black teachers; Montreal; Anglophone; denial; politically relevant pedagogy; Black students; African-centered schools	EDUCATION; AFROCENTRICITY	In the midst of the complicated racial-linguistic landscape that is Montreal, Quebec, the educational experiences of the relatively small population of Anglophone Blacks are often invisibilized within the education literature, and relatively little attention is paid to the nature of Black students' and educators' struggles with racism and Eurocentricity within Anglophone schools in Montreal. This article makes a contribution to the empirical literature concerning these groups. It shares the experiences of, and racism witnessed by, two Black teachers in Montreal. Their narratives paint a compelling picture of the consequences and effects of educating Black students within a colour-blind context in Montreal schools, as well as the pedagogies and personal philosophies they work through to resist and challenge the context of denial within Canadian education. The article ends with a discussion of the ways in which the teachers' pedagogies align with critical anti-racist praxis, and nascent forms of African-centred pedagogy.

J	Kempf, A				Kempf, Arlo			Colour-blind praxis in Havana: interrogating Cuban teacher discourses of race and racelessness	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						education; Cuba; racelessness; racism; anti-racism; colour-blindness; Cuban teachers; international and comparative education	PEDAGOGY; STRATEGY; SUCCESS	Despite massive gains in racial equality over the past 50 years, racism persists in twenty-first century Cuba. One of the key tools for the preservation and maintenance of racism is the discourse of racelessness through which the relevance of race is denied and silenced. Paradoxically, the racelessness frame has also been a guiding anti-racist force for over a century; an effective tool for challenging racism on the island since the late eighteenth century. Based on interviews with 41 Cuban teachers conducted in the Havana area, this article investigates teacher understandings of race and racelessness in Cuban society generally, and with regard to the schooling context in particular. Conversations with teachers reveal a paradoxical formation in which teachers using the racelessness approach, are indeed doing race work in their classrooms following an anti-racism derived from the larger Cuban race narrative as well as from their own experiences with race and racism.

J	Quiroz, PA				Quiroz, Pamela Anne			Marketing diversity and the 'new' politics of desegregation: overview of an urban education ethnography	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						race; diversity; desegregation; African American males; race practices	RACE	Situating ethnographic methods within a framework of engaged research we offer a window into the adoption, implementation, and sociopolitical dilemmas of 15 African American males participating in a program designed to maintain diversity at one of Chicagos most successful and elite public high schools. The article presents a four-year study (20072011) of an explicitly class-based and implicitly race-based attempt to engage the new politics of desegregation and the microprocesses of integration. Promoted as reaching across geographic, race, and class boundaries, the Black Male Achievement Initiative (BMAI) at Selective Preparatory Academy (SPA) is just one of many attempts to satisfy stakeholders in a political environment that promotes school choice and voluntary initiatives to desegregate schools. Situated within the local context of Chicago school reform, the BMAI provides opportunities and builds relationships even as it raises questions about racial formation, the appropriation of space, the meaning of diversity, and how such educational programs are part of the broader processes of gentrification.

J	Ndimande, BS				Ndimande, Bekisizwe S.			Race and resources: black parents' perspectives on post-apartheid South African schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						school desegregation; school choice; Black parents; post-apartheid South Africa; racism; resources	EDUCATION FINANCE	The dismantling of apartheid in 1994 brought an array of democratic changes in South Africa, including changes in curriculum and educational policies. One of the most momentous changes was the desegregation of public schools. While this was significant in South African education politics, it presented some educational challenges, especially to Black and poor children in the township neighborhoods. This article examines Black parents' perceptions of two major challenges that threaten education transformation in this new democracy: racism in formerly White-only schools and insufficient resources in township schools. It draws on an in-depth qualitative study with the parents of Black students, examining their 'common sense' about the desegregated public schools. Based on the findings, I make a claim that parents have clear and informed opinions about the education of their children. They are aware of the lack of resources in township schools and of racism in formerly White-only schools. They make different choices for their children and articulate the reasons for their choice; they articulate a nuanced grasp of the complexities affecting their choice as they respond to these opposing educational problems.

J	Oland, T				Oland, Trine			'Human potential' and progressive pedagogy: a long cultural history of the ambiguity of 'race' and 'intelligence'	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						progressivism; intelligence; historiography; racial constructions		This article examines the cultural constructs of progressive pedagogy in Danish school pedagogy and its emerging focus on the child's human potential from the 1920s to the 1950s. It draws on Foucault's notion of 'dispositifs' and the 'elements of history,' encircling a complex transformation of continuity and discontinuity of progressive pedagogy. The Danish context is identified as being part of an international and scientific enlightenment movement circulating in, e. g., the New Education Fellowship (NEF). The cultural constructs embedded in progressivism are clarified in the article: the emergence of 'intelligence' and life as a biological phenomenon from the 1920s is illustrated; the emergence of 'Black culture,' 'Negros' and 'races' from the 1930s is depicted, and the emergence of 'national cultures' from the 1940s - enhanced by UNESCO after World War II - is demonstrated. Although race somehow is replaced by culture, it is suggested that progressivism, unintentionally, exhibits a racist discourse.

J	Barron, I				Barron, Ian			The shadows of difference: ethnicity and young children's friendships	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						ethnicity; young children; friendships; practices	OUT-GROUP; IN-GROUP; ATTITUDES; FEATURES; GENDER; ETHNOGRAPHY; PREJUDICE; SCHOOLS; RACE	This paper explores the interaction of ethnicity and friendship in a kindergarten in England. Existing literature from different traditions, such as developmental psychology, sociocultural theory and postmodernism, suggests that pre-school children tend to choose friends from the same ethnic group. The research was carried out using an ethnographic approach over the period of a year. The findings indicate that the children did play largely with others of the same sex and same ethnic origin. Children's friendships, sense of self and sense of other, it is suggested, emerged not from within but from experiences of the activities in which they did or did not engage. Hence the children's ethnic identities and friendships were shaped by the internalisation of what they saw and heard as they engaged in the kindergarten's activities. These led to the children's identities being performed and internalised in particular sorts of ways that marked out the children as familiar ('like us') or unfamiliar ('not like us') to others according to their previous experiences. Thus these identity performances in relation to the activities offered seemed to be internalised and to come to affect the friendships that children formed with each other.

J	Schnyder, D				Schnyder, Damien			Enclosures abound: Black cultural autonomy, prison regime and public education	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						urban education; race and culture; prisons; ethnography		Since slavery, attempted enclosures upon Black spaces of cultural production and autonomy (i.e. music, language, art) have manifested in various forms. In the context of the post-industrial terrain of urban southern California, the formation of the prison is the dominant model of forced enclosure in the lives of Black people. Moving beyond the physical site of the prison, the conception of the prison regime is utilized to connect how racialized processes emanating from public education are informed by the formation/maintenance of the prison system. In particular, this article addresses the cultural assertions of Blackness made by Black students and how the corresponding attempted enclosure of Black cultural autonomy by the school is undergirded by a history of violence against Black spaces of cultural autonomy. Ethnographic research for this article was conducted at Southeast County High School (SCHS).

"I have the highest GPA, but I can't be the valedictorian?": two Black males' exclusionary valedictory experiences	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						African American male students; valedictorian; critical race theory; racial inequality	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EDUCATION; STUDENTS	Being the valedictorian is the highest honor bestowed upon a senior. Unfortunately, that was not the case for Jeffrey and Autry, the two high-achieving African American male participants in this critical race qualitative study, who were short-changed of their valedictorian status. Their cases reveal three themes: (1) these Black male students were shocked they did not receive this honor and were exploited in the process, (2) there were unfair institutional policies and practices associated with this title, and (3) there were drastic differences regarding the academic expectations for other students who were vying for this valedictory designation. Therefore, these African American male students experienced this academic honor as an exclusionary enterprise. Implications for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers are shared to mitigate the barriers associated with the valedictory accolade.

J	Gerrard, J; Sriprakash, A; Rudolph, S				Gerrard, Jessica; Sriprakash, Arathi; Rudolph, Sophie			Education and racial capitalism	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racism; settler colonialism; capitalism; dehumanisation	LIVES MATTER; BLACK; COLONIALISM; KNOWLEDGE; POLITICS; ORIGINS; SAVAGE; RACE	This paper works with theories of racial capitalism to show how formal education has been produced through interlocking systems of domination: capitalism, racism, and colonialism. With a focus on the enduring histories of British settler colonialism, we put forward a framework for analysing the constitutive relationship between contemporary systems of education and racial capitalism. The paper discusses three connected relations: (I) the ongoing enclosures and dispossession of land and people, with which the material infrastructures of education are built; (II) the racialised divisions of labour which education systems not only create but are also premised on, and; (III) the extraction of value in and through education, normalising hierarchised life, and steeped in racial capitalism's defining project of dehumanisation. The paper suggests that sociologies of education need to attend more fully to these relations of racial capitalism if they are to imagine beyond, and mobilise against, education's role in sustaining white supremacy.

J	Joseph-Salisbury, R				Joseph-Salisbury, Remi			Teacher perspectives on the presence of police officers in English secondary schools: A Critical Race Theory analysis	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Policing; schooling; schools-based police officers; criminalization; crt; school-to-prison pipeline		In the context of a racialized moral panic around serious youth violence, we have seen a resurgence of calls to increase the presence of police in English schools in recent years. As well as a lack of popular and political opposition, there is a dearth of critical academic consideration of the placement of police in schools, and even less from a Critical Race Theory perspective. Given that teachers' perspectives are relatively absent from academic and popular debates, this paper draws upon data from semi-structured interviews with 24 secondary school teachers. In doing so, the paper argues that an increased police presence in school will impact negatively upon learning environments, create a culture of low expectations, criminalize young people, and feed a school-to-prison pipeline. Noting that racially minoritized students will be affected most harshly, the article provides empirical evidence to warn against the presence of police in schools.

J	Campbell, SL				Campbell, Shanyce L.			Ratings in black and white: a quantcrit examination of race and gender in teacher evaluation reform	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Teacher evaluation system; QuantCrit; intersectionality; Black women teachers; education reform	HIGH-SCHOOL; STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT; EDUCATION; INTERSECTIONALITY; COMMUNALISM; TURNOVER; POLICY; BIAS	Education policy reform is often created and implemented in ways that advantage White individuals. This is even more salient when examining the intersection of race and gender identities. Using North Carolina's teacher evaluation system as a policy reform case, I examine whether there are differential observation ratings between Black and White women. The findings show that when Black and White women were similarly effective in the classroom, administrators rated Black women lower. However, there was no statistically significant influence on ratings by having a principal of the same race and gender as teachers. Black women were roughly two times more likely to be placed on a punitive professional development plan than White women. This study contributes to the narrow discourse on the effects of policies on Black women and provides policymakers with recommendations to ensure that teacher evaluation systems are justly implemented.

J	Alizai, H				Alizai, Hassina			Impact of Islamophobia on post-secondary Muslim students attending Ontario Universities	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Islamophobia; Muslim; higher education; religious identity; resistance	GENDERED ISLAMOPHOBIA; RACIALIZATION; EXPERIENCES	This study investigated the experiences of Muslim students attending Canadian institutions of higher education in the context of increasing Islamophobia. Qualitative semi-structured interviewing was used to explore the impact of anti-Muslim sentiment on the academic experiences of Muslim students and patterns of identity construction subsequent to recent national and international terrorism-labeled events such as the 2015 Paris bombings and 2015 San Bernardino mass shooting. Analysis of interview data yielded two major themes: (a) the formation of a strong religious identity in response to experiences of Islamophobia and (b) a distinction between general Islamophobia and gendered Islamophobia. The findings suggest that Muslim students in the current post 9/11 era are becoming increasingly devout, have a strong attachment to their religious identity, and are at the forefront of advocating for Muslims through education, activism, civic participation, and interfaith dialogue.

J	Carey, RL				Carey, Roderick L.			Missing misters: uncovering the pedagogies and positionalities of male teachers of color in the school lives of Black and Latino adolescent boys	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black male teachers; Latino male teachers; student perspectives; Black males; Latino males; urban education	ROLE-MODELS; DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES; PUBLIC-SCHOOLS; POLITICS; FATHERS; DISCOURSE; RELEVANT; CULTURE; GENDER; POWER	Educational stakeholders often recruit male teachers of color as solutions to the problems facing Black and Latino boys and young men in PreK-12 schools. However, given the assumptions made of these teachers' role in the lives of boys of color and their disproportionally low presence, few studies have considered what boys themselves report as missed because of the absence of Black and Latino male teachers. This case study drew from the voices of five Black and Latino adolescent boys in one urban secondary school in the United States to theorize what the participants missed (e.g. yearned for connections, reflections of self) and missed out on (e.g. seeing positive images of men of color) by not having a more robust presence of Black and Latino male teachers of color or misters. Findings indicated the need for boys' voices in advancing nuanced recruitment and retention discourses for their male teachers of color.

J	Wallace, D				Wallace, Derron			The diversity trap? Critical explorations of black male teachers' negotiations of leadership and learning in London state schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black teachers; role models; urban school engagement; Bourdieu; habitus; race	ROLE-MODELS; CARIBBEAN YOUTH; HABITUS; EXPERIENCES; POLITICS; GENDER; PUPILS; RACE; BOYS; ENGAGEMENT	Black and minority ethnic teachers are significantly underrepresented in British schools. Despite increasing anxieties about Britain's 'diversity shortage' among teachers, recent studies on the experiences of Black teachers generally, and Black male teachers specifically, remain rather sparse. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 25 Black Caribbean and Black African male teachers with five or more years of experience in London schools, this article deploys Bourdieusian conceptions of organizational habitus to explore the ways in which the national 'diversity shortage' can lead to a local 'diversity trap' in state schools that limits the range of roles Black male teachers are encouraged to pursue in schools. Findings suggest that pressures for Black male teachers to serve in racialized roles as community liaisons, role models, and school-wide disciplinarians, particularly for ethno-racial minority students, have stymied the long-term progress of Black male teachers towards departmental and administrative leadership - ranks at which the diversity shortage is even more acute.

J	Warren, CA				Warren, Chezare A.			Meeting myself: race-gender oppression and a genre study of Black men teachers' interactions with Black boys	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Gender; antiblackness; Black male teachers; Black boys; single sex schools	ROLE-MODELS; EDUCATION; MALES; SEX; MASCULINITY; ACHIEVEMENT; COMMUNITY; RELEVANT; IDENTITY; POLITICS	Increasing the number of Black men teachers and single-sex schooling options have been heralded as necessary to reverse trends in the failure of US education institutions to adequately educate Black boys. Too little research interrogates Black men teachers' interactions with Black boys for how they might reinforce anti-oppressive conceptions of race, gender and sexuality. A genre study - the multidimensional, intersectional examination of social identity to explain one's persistent dehumanization - was utilized to investigate how Black men teachers' interactions with Black boys shape the boys' understanding of Black manhood and masculinities. Regardless of schooling arrangement, findings suggest Black men teachers must recognize and disavow hegemonic gender logics in interaction efforts aimed at improving Black boys' lives. Additionally, I argue the potential of Black men teachers' interactions with Black boys to function as sites for reimagining Black boys' humanity in ways that counter persistent messages of their inferiority and disposability (i.e. aniblackness).

Rubberbanding in a liminal space: teachers contemplate intersections of dis/ability and race in inclusive classrooms	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Dis; ability critical race theory; culturally sustaining pedagogy; intersectionality; teacher perceptions; teacher development; integrated co-teaching	CULTURALLY RELEVANT PEDAGOGY; CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS; WHITE TEACHERS; EDUCATION; DISABILITY; DISCRIT; DISPROPORTIONALITY; COLLABORATION; STUDENTS; VIEWS	Public education in the United States has consistently and persistently failed significant numbers of students of color labeled with dis/abilities in terms of providing a quality education that leads to graduation. DisCrit theory provides a lens for understanding the impact of students' intersectional, marginalized identities of race and dis/ability on outcomes. We employed a grounded theory approach to explore how racist deficit perspectives and the ableist medical model of dis/ability simultaneously inform and limit what teachers imagine for their students and themselves. Key findings revealed teachers struggled to align their espoused values with their classroom experiences. Faced with challenges, teachers did not demonstrate intersectional thinking related to race and dis/ability; instead they snapped back to deficit perspectives, stretched into questioning, and rarely took action. To counter this, we identified entry points and generated recommendations to support teachers building an intersectional approach to understanding multiply marginalized students.

Imperialistic reclamation of higher education diversity initiatives through semantic co-option and concession	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Diversity; inclusive excellence; affirmative action; interest convergence; imperialistic reclamation; semantic concession; semantic co-option	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; CAMPUS RACIAL CLIMATE; INTEREST-CONVERGENCE; AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION; INTEREST-DIVERGENCE; WHITENESS; IMPACT; MICROAGGRESSIONS; TRANSFORMATION; PEDAGOGY	Affirmative Action in higher education exemplifies interest convergence, and beyond this, interest divergence and imperialistic reclamation. Diversity initiatives, such as the Inclusive Excellence initiative, have adopted key strategies and reasoning developed in Affirmative Action Supreme Court cases. This paper shows how semantic concessions and co-options within Supreme Court cases and in Inclusive Excellence scholarship have moved the focus of higher education diversity programs from access for Students of Color to educational benefits for white students. I show how current diversity initiatives are based on false premises with legal precedent. I frame these semantic concessions and co-options within imperialistic reclamation and discuss the implications.

J	Battle, J; Smiley, C				Battle, Juan; Smiley, CalvinJohn			Familia y educacion: a quantitative assessment of the impact of parental configuration on educational attainment for a national sample of Latinx students	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Latinx; family; divorce; education; educational attainment	MEXICAN-AMERICANS; MARRIAGE; HEALTH; COHABITATION; ASSIMILATION; PREPAREDNESS; PERSPECTIVE; ATTITUDES; OUTCOMES; TRENDS	The Latinx community is the fastest growing demographic in the United States and faces high rates of xenophobia and racism because of myths surrounding immigration and criminality. Therefore, Latinx communities are faced with many challenges. Parental configuration and educational attainment are key areas to explore the Latinx community in U.S. society. Utilizing a national representative sample from the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS) from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), this paper employs an intersectional framework to investigate the relative impact of parental divorce on Latinx students' educational attainment outcomes. This paper finds: (1) for both male and female students, parental divorce had no impact on educational attainment; (2) students in public schools had lower educational attainment than their counterparts; (3) cultural capital was significant for Latinx males; (4) parental social capital was significant for Latinx females; and (5) socioeconomic status proved to be significant for both males and females.

Race and the politics of educational exclusion: explaining the persistence of disproportionate disciplinary practices in an urban school district	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Critical race theory; urban education; school discipline; school-to-prison pipeline; interest-convergence; white fragility	INTEREST-CONVERGENCE; INTEREST-DIVERGENCE; ACHIEVEMENT; STUDENTS; IMPACT; BOARD	Educational research has established a link between zero tolerance disciplinary policies and increases in racial disproportionality in suspensions and expulsions of students of color. This article reports on a critical ethnography of Rivertown, a school district with urban characteristics, where we have been working with parents of color whose children are subjected to exclusionary discipline. Using the framework of Critical Race Theory in education, specifically Derrick Bell's interest-convergence principle, we argue that several interrelated barriers prevent movement toward racial equity: a culture of colorblindness and white fragility that silences race talk; contested definitions of the problem that obfuscate its racialized nature; and the persistence of a zero tolerance framework even with the implementation of a restorative justice pilot. We conclude by discussing our ongoing strategies for creating interest-convergence between White power-holders and communities of color in Rivertown.

J	Tran, HV				Hoang Vu Tran			Diversity's twilight Zone: how affirmative action in education equals 'discrimination' in the colorblind era	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Affirmative action; diversity; law; education; discrimination	CRITICAL RACE THEORY	Diversity is a ubiquitous concept in Education. Our contemporary racial discourse has been taken over by diversity talk. That is, to talk about race in the colorblind era in the contexts of school admissions or educational policy is to do so through the language of diversity. However, the hegemonic ascendancy of diversity has been dependent on the demise of affirmative action policies. This inverse relationship is not coincidental. Utilizing Critical Race Theory's methodology of constructing counter stories, this paper traces the history of diversity from the Supreme Court. By locating the ontological being of diversity from the perspective of the Supreme Court, the author establishes a historical narrative that shows the backward and bifurcated approach of how affirmative action equals racial discrimination in the colorblind era. As a result of this backward approach, diversity talk is widely accepted while affirmative action policies in education have been effectively defeated.

J	Wiggan, G; Watson-Vandiver, MJ				Wiggan, Greg; Watson-Vandiver, Marcia J.			Pedagogy of empowerment: student perspectives on critical multicultural education at a high-performing African American school	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Multiculturalism; African-American education; urban education; high-performing schools; case study research	NO CHILD LEFT; DIVERSITY	Despite decades of education reform, the US school curricula remain virtually unchanged. Multi-billion dollar initiatives such as No Child Left Behind, Common Core State Standards, Race to the Top, and Every Student Succeeds Act have not resulted in significant academic gains or curricula change. The exclusion of diversity and multiculturalism in US classrooms and textbooks underserves all students and inaccurately perpetuates a hegemonic narrative. This omission particularly disserves minority students, whose only exposure to Black history is slavery and the Civil Rights Movement. Thus, this qualitative case study examines a high-performing school, Harriet Tubman Academy (pseudonym) - HTA, that utilizes critical multiculturalism and anti-racism education. The findings reveal greater academic achievement, and the students explain that they had a greater understanding and appreciation for multicultural education because of their experiences at HTA. The findings of the study have great implications for urban school reform.

Being QuantCritical of US K-12 demographic data: using and reporting race/ethnicity in Florida Heartland Schools	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Racial re-formation; Indigenous Mexicans; Latinization; school ethnography; demography; QuantCrit	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; POLICY; STUDENTS	In this study on K-12 schools in the U.S. Florida Heartland, I take a QuantCrit approach to uncover how processes of data transformation, which I call 'racial re-formation', shape the utilization and reporting of racial and ethnic representations of students. To understand actual data use at schools, I apply QuantCrit's principles on how numbers are not neutral and how categories/groups are neither 'natural' nor given. I introduce 'racial re-formation' to identify the mechanisms behind expression of the QuantCrit principles in the data. Analyses of observations demonstrate that definitions of race/ethnicity are malleable, as personnel changed reported definitions of students as they used data in school decisions. Contrast of school records with teacher-created grade-level cards shows mismatch in student race/ethnicity between multiple school measures, while comparison of state vs. school records illustrates how policy affects demographic portraits. These practices led to varying representations, especially for American Indians and other groups, though ways to improve data collection, utilization, and reporting are offered.

The in-depth interviews reveal that women in all three groups discuss exposure to and comfort in diverse settings, but commuters and boarders are more likely to discuss habitus (re)formation than are residents. Women in all three groups discuss gaining dominant cultural capital in the form of speech and self-presentation skills, at times explicitly discussing the racialized nature of such forms of cultural capital.

J	Alexander, NA; Jang, ST				Alexander, Nicola A.; Jang, Sung Tae			'Synonymization' threat and the implications for the funding of school districts with relatively high populations of black students	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Race; poverty; school finance; 'synonymization'	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; EDUCATION; RESPONSES; EQUITY	Education stakeholders have used descriptors of poverty and race as if they were synonymous. This 'synonymization' of identities is particularly evident for black and poor students. We define 'synonymization' as a policy threat that emerges when policymakers conflate two marginalized identities, resulting in policies that ostensibly, but not actually, address biased structures. From this construct, we posit two claims: (1) largely poor districts are not largely black districts and (2) dollars appropriated to largely poor districts are not equivalent to dollars appropriated to largely black districts. Our analysis supports those claims. We also found that higher correlations between portion poor and portion black do not lessen the negative impact of synonymization for the collective as one would have expected. While funding and poverty were significantly associated, there was no significant association between funding and portions of black students even when poverty and black student profile were significantly linked.

J	Gao, F				Gao, Fang			Do heterophilous networks work? Investigating school-based social capital and the university choice process among less-privileged ethnic minorities in Hong Kong	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Social capital; homophilous and heterophilous networks; university choice process; ethnic minority; Hong Kong	EDUCATIONAL-ACHIEVEMENT; PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT; COLLEGE; INFORMATION; INEQUALITY; FRAMEWORK; STUDENTS	Much of the existing literature on social capital and university choice processes postulates that family networks of underrepresented students from poor and minority backgrounds are disadvantaged in university resources and in turn deficit in social capital returns. The literature implies that school-based networks are essential to fill the university information voids at home. Less research, however, poses questions about whether the university resources occupied by school personnel are automatically available to less-privileged minority youths. To grasp the dynamic interplay between ethnicity, class and school-based social capital, this study drew on Lin's conceptualisation of homophilous and heterophilous social networking and explored the university choice and application processes among poor and working-class South/Southeast Asian minority students in Hong Kong. The participants' accounts uncovered the restrictions of school networks on norms, expectations and accessibility of information sources. The research results raise concerns about how to activate both homophilous and heterophilous ties for minority youths' widening access to higher education.

This small qualitative study aimed to explore experiences of mentorship among a group of Black medical specialists in hopes of understanding the value and potential challenges that these relationships raise. Ten Black medical specialists were interviewed about their experiences of being mentored during their registrar training. The interview data was analysed using discourse analysis, and the results comprise of three main themes, namely: Difficulty accessing mentorship, a lack of Black and/or female role models and finally, experiences of feeling excluded from soft networks. The experiences explored in this study indicate the need for open dialogue within the mentorship dyad regarding certain taken-for-granted assumptions surrounding race, so as to aid the provision of more effective and satisfying mentorship outcomes.

J	Trieu, MM				Trieu, Monica M.			'It was about claiming space': exposure to Asian American studies, ethnic organization participation, and the negotiation of self among southeast Asian Americans	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Asian American studies; southeast Asian Americans; ethnic studies; ethnic organizations; racialization	IDENTITY; PANETHNICITY; STEREOTYPES; CHILDREN; COLLEGE; SENSE	Despite the growing number of Asian American Studies (AAS) programs and Asian ethnic organizations across colleges and universities since the 1970s, surprisingly little empirical research examines the role of these aspects of higher education on Asian American identity. How do the roles of AAS curriculum and Asian American student organizations (Asian American activities) influence southeast Asian American college students' ethnic and panethnic identity formation? Drawing on 50 in-depth interviews of 1.5 and second-generation college-educated Asian Americans, this study finds that the exposure to Asian American activities shapes respondents' racial and ethnic identity construction. Specifically, the exposure to Asian American activities: (1) evokes an informed assertion of a contextual panethnic identity; (2) serves to trigger an assertion of a hyphenated American identity; and lastly, (3) plays a direct, but differing, instrumental role on identity construction among different Asian American sub-ethnic groups.

Data is drawn from interviews and surveys conducted with Latino males that participated in New York University's Black and Latino Male School Intervention Study (BLMSIS) between 2006 and 2011. The findings revealed a dynamic interplay among how the students do school' (behavioral engagement), their intellectual involvement (cognitive engagement), and their strong beliefs in the education for social mobility shaped schooling for them. This focus on the experiences of young Latino males seeks to assist researchers, policymakers, and practitioners alike design and implement programs and policies to promote their educational progress and success.

Based primarily on group interviews and discussions, as well as observations and analysis - a theoretical domain (referred to throughout the article as Fabulachia') emerged as a site-specific outcome of events and ideas regarding race, gender and identity experienced by the research participants. Specifically, Fabulachia' functions as a theoretical hybrid space in which urban (e.g. ghetto fabulous') black college student-voices find a sense of empowerment as they construct their own narratives of leaving the hood' to attend college in rural Appalachia. This project revises and updates previous research on race and rural identity/ies in order to situate the urban black female experience into an Appalachian context. Drawing on hip hop feminism and urban education based theoretical paradigms, the Fabulachia study seeks to give voice to black females in contemporary Appalachia, with attention to their self-proclaimed ghetto fabulous' identities honed in and through their urban upbringings. The unique experiences of (Fabulachian) black females are an important and largely absent part of larger conversations of the growing body of Urban education research that seeks to situate the black student/black youth and schooling experience in the US. In the Fabulachia study, a group of black female students shared personal narratives (part-oral history and part direct response) to prompts and queries about the role of hip hop culture, race and gender identity in their lives. They also discussed and debated what it means to be a black female in contemporary (often racist) Appalachia, and about how their families and urban surroundings influenced their processes of being and becoming in the context of higher educational achievement.

J	Bernardino-Costa, J; Blackman, AED				Bernardino-Costa, Joaze; De Carli Blackman, Ana Elisa			Affirmative action in Brazil and building an anti-racist university	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Black movement; affirmative action; universities; Law 12; 711; 2012; anti-racism		This article highlights the black movement's centrality to building anti-racist universities in Brazil. It examines the questioning of the racial democracy myth within Brazilian universities as well as in the Brazilian mainstream media since the beginning of the new millennium. This debate was referred to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the constitutionality of racially oriented affirmative action measures. After the Supreme Court pronouncement, the Federal Government approved Law 12.711/2012 that instituted affirmative action within every federal university in the country. Even if it seems to be a victory in the anti-racist struggle, in this new law the racial dimension is a category tagging along behind that of social class. Considering that, the article concludes by calling for the need to redeem the original meaning of the debate, namely the anti-racist struggle.

J	Burgess, C				Burgess, Cathie			'Having to say everyday... I'm not black enough... I'm not white enough'. Discourses of Aboriginality in the Australian education context	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Aboriginal teachers; relationships of power; teacher identity; discourses; Foucault; narrative	TEACHERS; POWER; IDENTITY; WORKING	This paper interrogates discourses of Aboriginality about, and by, early career Aboriginal teachers as they negotiate their emergent professional identity in specific Australian school contexts.These discourses position the respondents via their ethnic and cultural background and intersect with self-positioning. This relates to the desire to be positioned as teacher rather than (only) as an 'Aboriginal' teacher. Consequently, the over-determination of Aboriginality includes such suppositions as the 'think-look-do'Aboriginaiity with a 'natural' connection to community, the 'good' Aboriginal teacher who fixes Aboriginal 'problems', the Aboriginal teacher as 'Other', and [the notion that] 'Aboriginal work' as easy, not real work and peripheral to core business. Through qualitative methodology, eleven Aboriginal teachers from the University of Sydney were interviewed.They were able to construct stories of early career teaching and the data was analysed to explore how the participants interpreted, accepted and/or resisted various discourses in their efforts to be agentic and resilient and to make a difference for the Aboriginal students they teach.

J	Edwards, KT				Edwards, Kirsten T.			College teaching on sacred ground: Judeo-Christian influences on Black women faculty pedagogy	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						College teaching; Black; African American women; race; gender; religion; spirituality; higher education	WOMANIST IDENTITY ATTITUDES; AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN; SELF-ESTEEM; EXPERIENCES	This study examines the perceptions and ideals of Black women faculty in the US who self-identify as possessing strong faith commitments within a Judeo-Christian denomination. The study considers the influence religio-spirituality has on their perceptions of pedagogy and student engagement. There are four major findings that emerged in this study, organized within two veins: (1) Religio-spiritual educator ideal as a guide for ways of being and teaching in the academy; and (2) Religio-spirituality's relationship to equity and emancipation. This study is significant in that it identifies a largely under-theorized religio-spiritual frame employed by many Black women faculty in the US, and contributes to the literature in its exploration of the ways Judeo-Christian Black women faculty can serve as important resources and change agents in US higher education.

J	Ferreira, A				Ferreira, Ana			"A sort of black and white past and present thing': high school students' subject positions on South Africa's recent past	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Subjectivity; positioning; youth; history; race; post-conflict society; Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)	RECONCILIATION	This article examines the discursive positions South African high school students take up in response to a teaching intervention that invites them to historicize their identities. It thus seeks to contribute to the growing body of education research on how to meaningfully engage young people in post-conflict societies with their recent past. Drawing on lesson transcripts as well as post-intervention focus group discussions with students in two different high schools, I use poststructuralist theories of discourse and subjectivity to attempt to understand students' reluctance to see themselves as historically located. The analysis shows that students feel interpellated in uncomfortable ways by a historical narrative that works to tie subject positions to fixed, racialized identities. Their attempts to escape these predetermined positions constitute ongoing negotiation of multiple discourses tied to race, history and their generational locations.

This article will explore African American sayins' as a tool to transmit the counter-hegemonic cultural value of smartness. Sayins', a facet of the African American oral tradition, are drawn from the deep structures of African American culture. Like proverbs and parables sayins' are linguistic tools which function to transmit cultural knowledge and govern modes of behavior. African American sayins' are imbued with an awareness of the contradicted lived experience and consequent values of resistance. The exploration of these funds of knowledge makes transparent the value and definition of smartness aligned with the principles of transformative resistance. Unpacking and reframing smartness within the cultural and epistemological context of the African American experience works in opposition to debilitating normative ways of knowing which inform teaching and learning.

J	Walker, M				Walker, Melanie			Context, complexity and change: education as a conversion factor for non-racist capabilities in a South African university	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Human capabilities; non-racism; identities; South Africa; higher education		The article explores the continuing effects of race-based inequalities in South Africa, with a particular focus on university education; it seeks to understand what lies beneath the persistence of race-based thinking. A conceptual framework which aligns everyday racism as a daily practice and the normative yardstick of human capabilities is outlined before examining an empirical case study of a student development programme at one South African university. The policy and historical context of the case study is sketched before proceeding to an interpretation of 70 qualitative interviews with black and white students who have participated in the programme. The data was analyzed for evidence of personal and interpersonal dimensions of racism, but also for evidence of self transformation enabled by the programme. The article argues that persistent though race inequalities still are in South Africa, there is the possibility of change and the development of inclusive social relations among diverse students through education, and that it is then the responsibility of a university to fashion critical educational opportunities that can foster this potential and reconfigure views, attitudes and relationships.

J	Henricks, K				Henricks, Kasey			Who plays? Who pays?: education finance policy that supplants tax burdens along lines of race and class	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						institutional discrimination; race and class inequalities; education finance policy; lotteries	LOTTERY GAMES; REGRESSIVITY	Many Chicagoans are getting shortchanged, particularly when it comes to money exchange between the Illinois Lottery (IL) and Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE). A significant portion of lottery sales is earmarked for education in Illinois. Because these revenues are not generated equally, however, some contribute more to education via the lottery than others. When this money is distributed in a way that transfers it from one community to another, one community's fiscal gain comes at another's expense. So the question stands: Who plays and who pays? To answer this question, I use the city of Chicago as a case study to simultaneously compare the generation and appropriation of lottery revenues. What I found was that this exchange is inherently organized along lines of race and class. Lottery revenues disproportionately come from communities comprised predominantly by people of color and the working class, and then are redistributed across all communities through education finance. When fiscal policy of Illinois public education is structured in such a way, it inequitably distributes economic capital and preserves undeserved enrichment and unjust impoverishment. This represents a state-sponsored process that captures one mechanism for the reproduction of race and class inequality.

Critical race theory (CRT) praxis is used to analyze the faculty dynamics in the candidate selection process situated in a race neutral institutional culture. This reflective case study of an educational leadership department draws on qualitative data such as field notes from faculty conversations, experiential knowledge, memos, and quantitative data describing the disproportionate rejection of Black women applying to an educational leadership program in the US. Efforts to confront a race neutral process prompted by the higher rejection rate of Black women in comparison to their white counterparts prompted some faculty to engage in race conscious discourse. Faculty in departments of educational leadership who provoke race conscious dialogue on how they are implicated in institutional racism will likely face risks they will need to (em)brace for the battle against inertia.

J	Law, I; Finney, S; Swann, SJ				Law, Ian; Finney, Sarah; Swann, Sarah Jane			Searching for autonomy: young black men, schooling and aspirations	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						black; young men; education; aspirations		This article examines the relationships between being young and black, and educational and career aspirations, drawing on new research evidence from two recent studies carried out in two urban locations in Northern England. The first of these studies forms part of a wider research project concerned with analysing the connections between aspects of racism, ethnicity and schooling in nine European countries recently completed in February 2011 and which included a quantitative survey of 30-40 young black (Caribbean/African) 15-year-old school pupils followed up by qualitative community-based fieldwork. The material examined here focuses on the perceptions and experiences of this specific group. The second smaller study involved multi-method research with 10 young black men in Leeds. In particular this article highlights the driving search for personal autonomy and agency on the part of young black men, which for many can and does, become manifest in strong levels of educational and career aspirations which are no different from other groups of young people. Further it identifies some of the creative strategies, for example in drawing on forms of social capital and other networks and resources to reinforce, cultivate and reaffirm aspirations and hopes, which will be of critical importance in determining the future outcomes of this group of young people.

J	Monroe, CR				Monroe, Carla R.			Discipline and diversity in the suburban US South	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						school discipline; discipline gap; teacher research		This study focuses on the perceptions and professional practice of Black and White teachers in a high poverty, predominately Latino elementary school in the suburban US South. The investigation explored how successful practitioners negotiated student disciplinary concerns within their classrooms. Race and gender gaps were documented in three of the four participants' classrooms as Black males were over-represented on behavioral sanctions in two classes while Asian and Hispanic males were disciplined at a disproportionately high rate in the third. When discipline gaps were documented, the disparities were associated with students' language status and grade level. The role of contextual factors in facilitating the study's findings is highlighted and implications for theory and educational practice are discussed.

J	Obasi, C				Obasi, Chijioke			Race and ethnicity in sign language interpreter education, training and practice	RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						sign language interpreting; black interpreters; interpreter education; race and interpreting		This article is based on findings from research conducted with black sign language interpreters and interpreting students in the UK. It discusses a number of issues raised by research participants reflecting on their interpreter education, training and practice and uses this to reflect on both the visibility and invisibility of race and ethnicity in the UK sign language interpreting field. Dean and Pollards application of demand-control theory is used to demonstrate the ways in which some of the environmental, interpersonal and intrapersonal demands faced by black interpreters can add to stress factors they experience as part of their role. This is compounded by the status of race as a taboo subject, which when combined with the more traditional restrictions of the role of sign language interpreter can and does work to restrict the resources available to manage these situations when faced. Questionnaires, telephone interviews and in-depth interviews were carried out as part of a three stage data collection process. The analysis in the article demonstrates the ways in which black interpreters can occupy a shifting position of minority and majority group status, where our position as interpreters can be obscured by the very fact of our blackness.
