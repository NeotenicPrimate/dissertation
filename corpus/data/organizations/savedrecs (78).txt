J	Park, JE; Lee, SH; Morgan, RM				Park, Jeong; Lee, Sungho; Morgan, Robert			A negative side of outsourcing marketing functions and market-based learning process	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						organizational learning; marketing capability; outsourcing; customer relationship management		In today's business environment, companies are driven to conduct a few functions inhouse and to obtain the rest from other sources through aggressive outsourcing. Recently, many firms have outsourced their customer relationship management (CRM) tools or systems (e.g. CRM programs, loyalty programs, and sales management) to consulting firms and other system developers. While CRM outsourcing may seem attractive at the management level considering investment cost and expertise, serious hazards are often encountered when they face serious losses in organizational learning for their markets and customers. This study contributes to marketing research by examining the importance of providing information concerning the impact of management's strategic decisions, such as the decision to outsource marketing functions. Additionally, the current study complements and extends extant outsourcing and organizational learning research aimed at identifying the underlying determinant of outsourcing, examining the relationship between outsourcing and the marketing learning process, and exploring the outcomes of an effective marketing learning process.

J	Rocha-Goncalves, F; Goncalves, VD				Rocha-Goncalves, Francisco; Goncalves, Victor da Conceicao			The role of the alliance management capability	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						dynamic capabilities view; strategic alliances; performance; alliance management capability	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; COOPERATIVE STRATEGY; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; PERFORMANCE; NETWORK; INNOVATION; FIRM; EMBEDDEDNESS; INTERFIRM; REPLICATION	This paper proposes that the frequently established association between alliances and performance can be further explained by the alliance management capability. It unfolds some relationships that are encapsulated in the simple link between the alliance-related construct and the performance measures. The research hypothesis formed a structural model and the results confirmed that the proposed moderating role for the alliance management capability is significant and that alliances are effectively used for growing and for innovating. The main outcomes are: (a) a discussion and a test of 'what is' the alliance management capability; (b) a better understanding of the reasons why alliances enhance performance, namely by leveraging growth and innovation.

J	Sharma, K; Pandit, P; Pandit, P				Sharma, Kunal; Pandit, Pallvi; Pandit, Parul			Critical success factors in crafting strategic architecture for e-learning at HP University	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						E-learning; Strategy strategic arhitecture; Critical success factors; Education		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to outline the critical success factors for crafting a strategic architecture for e-learning at HP University. Design/methodology/approach - A descriptive survey type of research design was used. An empirical study was conducted on students enrolled with the International Centre for Distance and Open Learning who were attending personal contact programs (PCPs) in professional courses so as to elicit the importance of e-learning in distance education programs. Findings - From the research questions for implementing e-learning it was found that the current practices of instruction are satisfactory, the centers where PCPs are not sufficiently equipped for the training of learners and resource persons at PCPs do not have interest in the ICT program although the learners are ICT savvy, but there is no regular electricity supply, sufficient facilities and consumables for the usage. Research limitations/implications - Although an empirical study was conducted, the respondents, the students, sometimes disclose the information and do not reply to the questions in good faith. Practical implications - The article addresses the critical success factors in crafting a strategic architecture for e-learning at HP University so as to implement e-learning for the benefit of the staff and the students. Originality/value - The article addresses the critical success factors for implementing e-learning in a traditional university environment.

J	Smith, AD				Smith, Alan D.			Corporate social responsibility implementation: Comparison of large not-for-profit and for-profit companies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						United States of America; Corporate social responsibility; Consumer behaviour; Management strategy; Economic recession; Economic sustainability; Corporate strategy; Stakeholder analysis; Ethics		Purpose - Corporate social responsibility (CSR)-based strategies have become important concepts in dealing with firms' stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the processes of stakeholder legitimacy and interest detection, namely ethical considerations and community obligations, to promote CSR as an intangible strategic asset. Design/methodology/approach - The two relatively large service-based firms (contrasting not-for-profit with for-profit) that were selected for study were Pittsburgh-based, namely the largest single employer of the metropolitan area of Pittsburgh (The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)) and WESCO, a distributor of electrical construction products and electrical and industrial maintenance products and the largest domestic provider of integrated supply services. Findings - It was found that the management teams at UPMC and WESCO approach CSR-based strategies and its initiative from completely different perspectives. UPMC functions a not-for-profit organization while WESCO is a for-profit entity. They also approach CSR differently as a result from its geographically based service and product offerings, UPMC being more local/regional and WESCO going for global markets. These differences promote differences in the groups and types of CSR that each company is currently engaged in promoting. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates that both not-for-profit and for-profit entities have a reason to be socially responsible, whether they are local or global firms. The overarching fact is that consumers expect firms to be conscience of the social concerns of the community in which they operate and socially responsible to the various stakeholder groups they serve.

Design/methodology/approach - This longitudinal study which is based on six cycles of interviews with all members of the firm over a two-year period examined how the change attempt was perceived by the strategic leadership, middle-level managers, and lower-level employees. Findings - The findings suggest that the pace of archetypal change is influenced by organization members' experience with, and capacity to, assimilate the change; that, sequentially, new structures and systems are implemented prior to new interpretive schemes; and that unresolved excursions are non-linear. These findings question the conventional wisdom about the importance of leadership in sustaining organizational transformation. Most notably, it was found that most of the archetypal change occurred after the initiating change agent (a new CEO) had left the firm and been replaced by the previous CEO who did not support the proposed changes. Originality/value - The paper offers the first longitudinal study to examine the issue of substitutes for strategic leadership. In addition to two new substitutes that should be considered at this level of analysis information systems and interpretive schemes the data also point to the impact of collective action by mid-level supervisors and employees.

J	Staron, M; Meding, W				Staron, Miroslaw; Meding, Wilhelm			Factors Determining Long-term Success of a Measurement Program: An Industrial Case Study	E-INFORMATICA SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article								Introducing measurement programs into organizations is a lengthy process affected by organizational and technical constraints. There exist several aspects that determine whether a measurement program has the chances of succeeding, like management commitment or existence of proper tool support. The establishing of a program, however, is only a part of the success. As organizations are dynamic entities, the measurement programs should constantly be maintained and adapted in order to cope with changing needs of the organizations. In this paper we study one of the measurement programs at Ericsson AB in Sweden and as a result we identify factors determining successful adoption and use of the measurement program. The results of our research in this paper are intended to support quality managers and project managers in establishing and maintaining successful metrics programs.

J	Tas, N; Tas, M; Cosgun, N				Tas, Nilufer; Tas, Murat; Cosgun, Nilay			PERMANENT HOUSING PRODUCTION PROCESS AFTER 17 AUGUST 1999 MARMARA EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Earthquake; Post-eartquake accommodation need; Permanent housing; Permanent housing construction process; Turkey	UNITED-STATES; RECONSTRUCTION; DISASTERS; KOCAELI	In recent years, one of the biggest investments and projects that developed in Turkey is in permanent housing. The emergency case experienced after the 17 August 1999 Marmara Earthquake featured the permanent housing need; thus, within the meaning of Disaster Law, a large number of housings were to be built in designated residential areas in various provinces. Once a building has been designed, impediments that arise either cannot be fixed any longer or require an extra cost to be fixed. In order to create a high quality built environment, production process of constructions as a long lasting effect becomes important. This study examines how the production process of the permanent housings to be built in Turkey after 1999 Marmara Earthquake was managed considering the current legal framework. In this context, the aim is to state how permanent housings are produced and determination of the points seen as problems by the builders (contractors) and occupants through this process. The main concern is to determine the outcomes that could act as answer to problems that might arise in permanent housing production after a probable earthquake. The obtained information is thought to act as reference in the practices of meeting permanent housing need that will arise after disasters.

Naivete and Cynicism in Negotiations and Other Competitive Contexts	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT ANNALS			English	Article							SOCIAL AXIOMS; EGOCENTRIC INTERPRETATIONS; MOTIVATIONAL ORIENTATION; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; FOCUSING FAILURES; WINNERS CURSE; TRUST; MODEL; SUSPICION; ANGER	A wealth of literature documents how the common failure to think about the self-interests of others contributes to suboptimal outcomes. Yet sometimes, an excess of cynicism appears to lead us to over-think the actions of others and make negative attributions about their motivations without sufficient cause. In the process, we may miss opportunities that greater trust might capture. We review the research on when people expect too little or too much self-interest in the intentions of others, as contrasted with rational behavior. We also discuss the antecedents and consequences of these naive and cynical errors, as well as some potential strategies to buffer against their effects and achieve better outcomes in competitive contexts.

J	Vermander, B				Vermander, Benoit			Chinese wisdom, management practices and the humanities	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Chinese tradition; Humanities; Local cultures; Sustainable development; Interpretation; Storytelling; Utopianism; China		Purpose - This article aims at showing that the relationship between Chinese classical wisdoms and managerial practices should not be reduced to the establishment of an "art of war" applicable to management practices, but should rather be understood as an ever-evolving work of critical reinterpretation, so as to liberate the creative and strategic potential that this tradition embodies. Design/methodology/approach - It does so by critically deconstructing the question of the "relevance" of Chinese wisdom for managerial practices, by assessing the way contemporary Sinology understands and interprets the concept of "Chinese wisdom", and by designing a strategy for applying these insights to managerial education. Findings - It thus shows that only historical contextualization and textual studies can ground an understanding of Chinese tradition applicable to managerial education. Practical implications - By doing so, it helps educators to re-anchor managerial education into the field and methodologies of humanities studies. Originality/value - It thus goes against the utilitarian and over-simplified syntheses of Chinese thought that are currently dominant in the managerial literature about China, and proposes new ways for making the study of China a channel through which to develop in our students a sense of relativity, complexity and empathy applicable to an array of cultural contexts.

J	Yu, BTW; To, WM				Yu, Billy T. W.; To, W. M.			The importance of input control to work performance under the agency theory framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						agency theory; input control; work performance	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; SERVICE GUARANTEE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; MODEL; INNOVATION; BEHAVIOR; DETERMINANTS; UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGIES	In the agency theory literature, output and behavioral controls have been quite thoroughly explored. However, input control (IC) that emphasizes personnel selection and staffing has only been discussed theoretically. Literature outside the agency theory, nonetheless, corroborates IC when competitions increase. With an empirical approach to strategic human resource management, this study explored the relationships between controls and work performance under the influences of two agency factors: principal-agent relationship and task programmability. Results show that controls are generally associated with work performance but more important are their moderating effects with the two contingent agency factors. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses reveal that IC is a vital factor for work performance. These findings suggest that IC deserves more attention under the conditions of increased competition.	[Yu, Billy T. W.; To, W.

J	Wen, SH; Chuang, CM				Wen, Sonya H.; Chuang, Cheng-Min			To teach or to compete? A strategic dilemma of knowledge owners in international alliances	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge-asymmetry; Location-asymmetry; International alliance; Governance-mode; Emerging economies	ENTRY MODE; JOINT VENTURES; CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION; TRANSACTION COSTS; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; DYNAMIC THEORY; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; CHOICE; MARKET	The strategic importance of learning and knowledge development in alliances has been widely recognized and discussed in literature, though focusing mainly from the view of the demand side and leaving the equally important ingredient of knowledge owners' incentives-to-teach intact. This paper blends the perspectives of the transaction-costs economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view (KBV) in a hypothesized governance model that illustrates how knowledge and location factors of international partners jointly impact alliance strategies. We first identify the relevant knowledge and location factors affecting incentives-to-teach in alliances, and then incorporated them into a framework explaining the choice of contractual or equity-based mode governing an alliance. Eight hypotheses are developed and then tested on a sample of 640 international alliances, with at least a partner from a focal emerging economy, Taiwan. Our research findings show that the contractual mode is usually aligned with higher incentives-to-teach of the knowledge owners, especially in knowledge-asymmetric and location-symmetric alliances. In a contrast, the equity-based mode, offering additional safeguarding mechanisms for the knowledge owner, is often selected in the alliances associated with a severe concern of competition, especially in knowledge-symmetric and location-asymmetric alliances.

J	Sun, LX				Sun, Lixin			Chinese maritime concepts	ASIA EUROPE JOURNAL			English	Article								The ancient Chinese always had a complex psychic relation to the vast ocean: longing, but disdaining. On the one hand, they thought there were elfish hills, immortals, and fairy trees abroad; on the other hand, they viewed overseas residents as strange. Before the fifteenth century, the Chinese people were capable of conducting maritime operations positively and entering into contacting peaceful and friendly contacts with foreign countries, the establishment of Ming Dynasty suppression of the coastal areas and the closed-door policy became its basic national policy. After the failure of the first Opium War, some coastal military officials and intellectual elites took the lead in "seeing the world"; they were cognizant of the superior might of western firepower and claimed that the Chinese should "learn from the 'barbarians' advanced skills to resist their aggression". However, even those provincial magnates who actively advocated coastal defense such as Li Hongzhang and Shen Baozhen also failed to really comprehend the oceans' great economic and military value and separated themselves from the set pattern of the old land-based coastal defense. It was not until the beginning of the twentieth century, with the introduction of A. T. Mahan's Sea Power Theory, that the Chinese people gained a comparatively profound cognition of the importance of protecting national maritime interests. The democratic revolutionist Sun Yat-sen insisted that man should strive for survival and development by means of the oceans. However, at the beginning of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, faced with the economic blockade and political pressure by western powers, the Chinese government still took land development and "coastal security" as the center and neglected the effective management of the maritime territory. Since "reform and opening-up", the second generation of central collective leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with Deng Xiaoping at its core, proposed the coastal strategic concept of "offshore defense" and the principle of "laying sovereignty and jointly exploring" for handling maritime disputes, and the third generation of central collective leaders of CPC with Jiang Zemin, at its core, emphasized a better understanding of the oceans from the height of strategy. Nowadays, under the influence of the increasing emphasis on the oceans all over the world, the voice of the Chinese government and Chinese people to establish a strong naval power has become increasingly stronger, but its action is still impeded by many aspects.

Developing a market-based approach to managing the US strategic petroleum reserve	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Markov processes; Or in government; OR in natural resources; OR in energy	OIL; POLICIES; SHOCKS	The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has not been used effectively to manage the consequences of oil shocks in the United States. The main reason is that political decision makers tend to hoard the reserves during crises and bureaucratic processes delay the sale of the reserves. Also, the enabling legislation focused on ameliorating shortages whereas disruptions result price spikes rather than shortages. We develop a Markov game of the buildup and drawdown of the reserve in which a public player aims to maximize consumer welfare at the same time private holders of inventory maximize their profit. The methodological contribution in this paper is the development of financial options to implement the public player's optimal policy. We use the solution of this game to calculate the number and value of options necessary for the private marketplace to trigger the optimal buildup and drawdown of the reserve. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

WIM calibration and data quality management	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						truck tractor (TT) method; weigh-in-motion; WIM error; WIM calibration; data quality		Weigh-in-motion (WIM) scales are installed on various higher order roads in South Africa to provide traffic loading information for pavement design, strategic planning and law enforcement. Some WIM systems produce anomalies that cannot be satisfactorily explained even by highly experienced professionals. Much of the problem relates to the difficulty in determining the appropriate calibration factors to correct systematic measurement error for WIM systems and the inadequacy of data quality management methods. The author has developed a post-calibration method for WIM data, called the Truck Tractor (TT) method, to correct the magnitude of recorded axle loads in retrospect. In addition, it incorporates a series of data quality checks. The TT method is robust, accurate and adequately simple for use on a routine basis for a wide variety of South African WIM systems. The calibration module of the IT method (i.e. the procedure to determine the calibration factor, k(TT)) has been accepted by SANRAL and incorporated into the model it uses to quantify the cost of overloading on toll concessions. Some of the data quality checking concepts are also being considered for further use and threshold values for tests are being refined by SANRAL for this purpose.

An exploratory case study used document analysis, interviews and a questionnaire to develop and test indicators of intellectual assets and related performance measures at three university libraries in Thailand. The study demonstrated the feasibility of applying an intellectual capital perspective and a scorecard process model to design a workable system for evaluating library intangibles, particularly where libraries have a pre-existing interest in knowledge management and a culture of assessment.

Methods: All members of the Psycho-Oncology Co-operative Research Group (n = 295) were invited to participate in an online survey and 180 responded (response rate = 61%). Participants rated eight priority research areas identified from a previous focus group study on a five-point scale, and ranked their top four priority areas. Within the four ranked research areas, participants selected the three most important specific research questions. Results: The highest rated research priority areas were distress identification (23.3%), survivorship (22.7%), and distress management (15.3%), followed by issues relating to health services (9.7%) and carers (8.0%). Interventions were commonly nominated among the most important research questions within each priority area. The single most important research question identified by 44% of the sample was to "Determine the most acceptable, reliable and valid screening tool to be administered routinely at diagnosis and at other key transition points to identify distress and psychosocial needs". Conclusion: This is the first Australian study to explore research priorities in psycho-oncology, and the first international study to explore these issues in depth. To ensure that the research effort is strategic, clinically relevant and cost-effective, clear priorities need to be established. The results of this survey will enable limited resources to focus on key research questions of direct clinical benefit.

An effective and explicit alignment and integration of business strategy with SPI initiatives based on measurement is essential to prevent loss of income, customers and competitiveness. By integrating SPI models and measurement techniques in the strategy management process, an organization's investments will be better aligned with strategy, optimizing the benefits obtained as a result of an SPI program. In this paper, the authors propose BOQM (Balanced Objective-Quantifiers Methodology) that integrates properly strategic management, process improvement and quantitative measurement to manage the competitiveness of software engineering organizations. Finally, this paper presents and discusses the results from implementing BOQM in a software development organization.

J	Mulgan, R				Mulgan, Richard			Where Have All the Ministers Gone?	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						ministers; public servants; Moran report; management models	AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC-SERVICE; MANAGEMENT; APPOINTMENTS; WESTMINSTER; GOVERNMENT; FRAMEWORK; HAPPENS	The relationship between ministers and public servants has been a longstanding topic among students of Australian public administration. Recent debate has centred on issues of supposed politicisation and excessive responsiveness in the Australian Public Service (APS), caused, in part, by the weakened tenure of department heads (secretaries). The recent Moran report has little to say on this relationship. It endorses changes to the appointment processes for secretaries which are presumably designed to strengthen secretaries' independence from their political masters. It adopts a view of citizen-centred service and strategic leadership that appears to marginalise ministers. Its approach to public sector leadership is taken from international management theory that works well in a business context and in the United States (US) government system. It is less well-suited to Westminster-style systems.

J	Wilson-Stronks, A; Mutha, S				Wilson-Stronks, Amy; Mutha, Sunita			From the Perspective of CEOs: What Motivates Hospitals to Embrace Cultural Competence?	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; HEALTH; DISPARITIES; LEADERSHIP; CARE	The quality domains of patient-centered and equitable care are increasingly relevant to today's healthcare leaders as hospitals care for patients with increasingly diverse cultural and linguistic needs. Hospital leaders face substantial tensions in defining their organization's strategic priorities to improve care for diverse populations with limited resources, increased competition, and complex regulatory and accreditation requirements. We sought to understand what motivates hospitals to focus on and commit resources to supporting the delivery of culturally competent care by analyzing interviews with chief executive officers (CEOs) in 60 hospitals across the United States. Hospital CEOs in our study most often embraced cultural competence efforts because doing so helped them achieve the organization's mission and priorities and/or meet the needs of a particular patient population. Less often, they were motivated by perceived benefits and legal or regulatory issues. Many CEOs articulated a link between quality and cultural competence, and a smaller number went on to link cultural competence efforts to improved financial outcomes through cost savings, increased market share, and improved efficiency of care. However, the link between quality and cultural competence is still in the early stages. Fortunately, frameworks for hospitals to adopt and steps that hospitals can take to improve the quality of care for all patients have been identified. They begin with a commitment from hospital leaders based on understanding the needs of patients and communities and are propelled by data that reveal the impact of efforts to improve care. Leaders must communicate and shepherd organizations to align the congruence between improvement efforts and business strategies.

This integrated design can change the manner of structural conception. Firstly there are presented some theoretical aspects that should be considered when performing a life-cycle assessment, such as life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC). The second part presents concisely the actual normative conditions at the European level regarding the sustainability of construction works. The third part presents a practical application of integration of environmental impact into design of buildings, by means of a case-study. The example compares the environmental impact for a single-family house, designed in two situations: classic design - by considering a masonry house and the same house designed in steel lightweight profiles respectively.

J	Snell, RS; Tjosvold, D; Wu, JL				Snell, Robin Stanley; Tjosvold, Dean; Wu, Julie Lanjun			Clarity of ethical rules for open-minded discussion to resolve ethical issues in Chinese organizations	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES			English	Article						China; conflict; constructive controversy; ethical rules	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; BUSINESS ETHICS; CONSTRUCTIVE CONTROVERSY; DIALECTICAL INQUIRY; JOB-SATISFACTION; ECONOMIC-REFORM; DEVILS ADVOCACY; CORPORATE CODES; SELF-REPORTS; CORRUPTION	In critical incident interviews, 101 Chinese mainland employees each described a work-related occasion where ethical values were at stake. Case examples and structural equation analyses indicated that clearly understood ethical rules facilitated open-minded discussion of opposing views, i.e. constructive controversy, which in turn developed interactive justice, strengthened interpersonal relationships, and promoted confidence in future discussions. However, clarity about ethical rules and engagement in constructive controversy was perceived to have no substantive ethical impact. This result was interpreted as indicating that common understanding among employees about the content of the extant ethical rules combined with open-minded discussion of the rules does not necessarily lead to agreement that bringing behavior into alignment with the extant rules is necessarily the best moral solution, and as suggesting that using constructive controversy to develop ethical rules may be better than imposing them from the top.

Agent-based modeling is a proven approach for modeling complex networks of intelligent and distributed actors. In this paper, we will demonstrate how an agent-based model can be used to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a global enterprise, considering both the system-level performance as well as the components' behavior.

Specifically the BCA highlighted the benefits of a quality education imparting skills in the areas of collaboration, teamwork and leadership all of which greatly assist the effective practice of creativity, innovation and strategy. This paper makes a useful contribution to teaching practice in several ways. The paper links comments from the BCA to a significant and ongoing debate in the strategy literature on the best approaches to teaching the practice of strategy. The paper then demonstrates, with case studies from the RMIT University MBA and the Central Queensland University MBA programs, different approaches to how this can be done. This is followed by a critical discussion of the literature and case studies. Suggestions are made for future research and teaching practice.

J	Zhang, H; Xi, YM				Zhang, Hua; Xi, Youmin			Exploration and Exploitation in Parallel Problem Solving: Effect of Imitation Strategy and Network Structure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						Agent Behavior; Group Performance; Network Structure; Strategic Behavior; Structural Equivalence	KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE	In previous studies on coordinating exploration-exploitation activities, much attention has been paid on network structures while the roles played by actors' strategic behavior have been largely ignored. In this paper, the authors extend March's simulation model on parallel problem solving by adding structurally equivalent imitation. In this way, one can examine how the interaction of network structure with agent behavior affects the knowledge process and finally influence group performance. This simulation experiment suggests that under the condition of regular network, the classical trade-off between exploration and exploitation will appear in the case of the preferentially attached network when agents adopt structure equivalence imitation. The whole organization implicitly would be divided into independent sub-groups that converge on different performance level and lead the organization to a lower performance level. The authors also explored the performance in the mixed organization and the management implication.

Strategic goals and prioritization of process previously performed in the company was used as a support to the implementation. Possible indicators were listed and confronted with occasional restraints to its implementation and further analyzed by the Balanced Score Card (BSC) point of view. Subsequently, indicators were individually analyzed and their relationship with the company's strategic goals was determined. Seventeen indicators were selected, two under financial perspective, nine under process perspective, four under customer perspective, and two under development and learning perspective. The relationship analysis showed that the indicators support appropriate monitoring of the critical processes to achieve the strategic goals, thereby consolidating the management system.

To provide data on regional demands of local visitors the Clawson Questionnaire was used. The ecotourism development strategic management plan was suggested through SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) method. The above mentioned items were identified by Delphi method (expert evaluation) in this study. Four strategies, based on competitive situations are suggested to observe the results of the analysis in the shape of strategic management plans for ecotourism development's charts. In spite of Island's rich resources, the results show that the island can be transformed into a recreational pole, inadequate socio-economic infrastructure, transparent flow of information in which appropriate marketing have placed its strategic situation into competitive conditions. Considering the technological, economical, social and cultural situations during the operating time which is called the attractiveness mark in SWOT method, the strategy of using the settlement's facilities and services by Qeshm Development Organization to provide basic short-termed services to local visitors, can be the first and most effective strategy to reach a better situation at the moment.

Nevertheless, there are very few studies that include evidence about how the effective management of certain characteristics and properties of the network, such as the work dynamics developed or the interaction in the group may be useful for the operation of the work group itself in firms that develope its activity in high-tech sectors. Thus, the objectives of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework for studying the relationship between Human Resource Activities and Social Capital while underlining the importance that human resource policies play in the management of this variable in a IT environment.

Cournot equilibria in oligopolistic electricity markets	IMA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT MATHEMATICS			English	Article						equilibrium problem; oligopolistic model; electricity market	COMPETITIVE GENERATION; SYSTEMS; POWER	Electricity markets are undergoing a liberalization process aiming at introducing competition and enhancing efficiency. In liberalized markets, quantities and prices are determined by the interactions among the different players: power producers determine their production levels so as to maximize their own profits, while energy prices and demand levels to be satisfied are decided by an independent system operator (ISO). Deregulated electricity markets are very often oligopolistic, therefore the market equilibrium resulting from the interactions among power producers and ISO can be well represented by oligopolistic models. Thus, models based on game theory are used to describe the oligopolistic strategic interactions between the firms involved, representing the market as a non-cooperative game where players decide their strategy in order to maximize their profit. This paper presents a model that describes the strategic interactions of firms based on the assumption that the generation firms are Cournot oligopolists. A linear demand curve is assumed. Moreover, a new iterative algorithm is presented for determining the Cournot equilibrium and a case study is discussed.	[Vespucci, M.

The Development of the Next Generation of Nurse Leaders	JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION			English	Article								This article explains the development of a value-added leadership focus to a graduate nursing program. With the changes to and complexity within the health care system, advanced practice nurses need academic preparation in advanced care management of populations and leadership competencies. Strategic environmental scanning suggested that some revisions could better prepare future nurse leaders. Through literature review and focus groups, faculty's analysis provided evidence for development of a different kind of advanced practice nurse. This process led to a graduate program that prepares nurse leaders who are competent in the clinical settings and leadership roles of today's health care organizations. The 40-semester hour program allows flexibility for minimum career disruption and a choice of tracks to accommodate individuals' educational needs. Grounded in practicum experiences and guided by health care theory, policy, and research, graduates possess the knowledge and competencies to assume the advanced leadership roles required in future health care systems.

Stakeholder Marketing and the Organizational Field: The Role of Institutional Capital and Ideological Framing	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING			English	Article						stakeholder marketing; activism; trigger events; cultural capital; retailing	ATTENTION; FRAMEWORK; ETHICS	This article adopts an institutional-based perspective to stakeholder marketing. This perspective directs attention to an organizational field level of analysis in which an organization's environment is punctuated by trigger events that prompt the assemblage of a particular mix of stakeholders. A thematic, interpretive, and longitudinal analysis of more than 2000 articles from 45 years of grocery retail trade journals reveals that the ensuing stakeholder dynamics that constitute an organizational field serve to afford or deny the marketer vital cultural, social, and economic capital. In turn, the capital possessed by or denied to the marketer influences the ideological frame the marketer may use in coming to terms with how to interact with stakeholders. Importantly, the authors find that strategic and institutional factors interpenetrate, presenting important implications for how stakeholder marketing should be understood.

Interestingly, the understanding of capital finance mechanisms, through financing instruments and strategies analysis, are essential to successfully advance development of agribusiness. This research primarily investigates six aspects of financing instruments and strategies of agribusiness, and uses the opinions of interviews with experts of the Agricultural Biotechnology Park in Taiwan to design questionnaires. Then, this study received 15 valid questionnaires from the experts at the Agricultural Biotechnology Park to determine the main financing instruments and strategies, as well as the dependent relationships between capital effects factors. This study contributes to providing capital financing instruments and strategy factors of agribusiness for related official authorities in their future policy decisions.

J	Pennings, JM; Wezel, FC				Pennings, Johannes M.; Wezel, Filippo Carlo			Faraway, Yet So Close: Organizations in Demographic Flux	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						demographic diversity; top management teams (TMT); mobility; team age; competitive overlap	TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS; UPPER ECHELONS; BLACK-BOX; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; HETEROGENEITY; MANAGERIAL; COMMUNICATION; COGNITION; TENURE	Change in firm governance is often associated with inbound and outbound movements of key decision makers. This research extends that observation by treating mobility as a trigger of demographic change in management teams that, in turn, influences organizational survival. Mobility occasions transformations in demographic profiles both within a firm and among firms sharing a competitive arena. In the former case, shifts in diversity may alter the quasi-resolution of conflict achieved by the firm's upper echelons, or, conversely, serve to inject novel views and ideas. In the latter case, migration may modify the demographic overlap among firms and thus rearrange their competitive positioning. We present here an empirical test of this two-pronged manifestation of demographic change and stress the moderating roles of team age and competitive intensity.

J	Tunde-Ayinmode, MF				Tunde-Ayinmode, M. F.			Audit of child and adolescent psychiatry in a teaching hospital in Nigeria: Prevalence, pattern and implication for improved services	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article								Objective. This study aimed to identify the socio-demographic characteristics, pattern of psychiatric disorders and management of children and adolescents before the setting up of a dedicated child and adolescent unit at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Nigeria. Method. A retrospective study, carried out at the Department of Behavioural Sciences of the hospital. Results. The age range of the 94 children seen was 7 - 19 years, with a mean of 16.38 years (standard deviation 2.49); 82% were aged 14-19 years and 17% 7-13 years, while only 1 child was under 7 years old. The majority of the children lived with their parents in monogamous families with 5 or more children. The majority of the parents were educated and gainfully employed. The major diagnoses were schizophrenia (50%), delirium (15%) and seizure disorders (9%). Of the patients 64% were managed as outpatients and 36% as inpatients. Drug therapy was involved in the majority of cases, and the most frequently prescribed medication was haloperidol, atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone being used in only 8% of cases. Most of the patients were referred from the primary care-associated departments of the hospital, i.e. the general outpatient department (40%) and the internal medicine and paediatrics departments (29%). Referrals from welfare, judicial and educational institutions were uncommon (3%). Conclusion. The pattern of patient presentation and management had not changed to any great extent over the past two decades. The introduction of a child and adolescent psychiatric unit is expected to improve consultation/liaison psychiatry and also child psychiatric service delivery and research. Understanding of the prevalence and pattern of presentation of mental disorders and their management is also expected to help improve the strategic planning and organisation of the new clinic.

The paper presents the interventions carried out in two industrial districts, tannery district of Arzignano and artistic glass district of Murano, in order to help the public administrations to improve the environmental situation. Introducing strategic and social considerations in environmental initiatives and implementing "radical" environmental policies, the approach used in both case studies resulted in not only environmental quality improvement, but also led to sustainable solutions with revitalization effects. Its efficacy will improve if, above all, merges with strong research and development investments. Moreover, they should have obtained the same effects if they had applied the same effects to other countries with the same local peculiarities as IIDs.

J	Ahuja, V; Yang, J; Shankar, R				Ahuja, Vanita; Yang, Jay; Shankar, Ravi			PERCEPTIONS AFFECTING ICT ADOPTION FOR BUILDING PROJECT MANAGEMENT IN THE INDIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Perceptions; ICT; building; project management; SME		Building project management requires effective communication between all project team members and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) constitute the majority of businesses in the building construction sector. A study was recently conducted with respect to SMEs to research their perceived barriers, associated enablers and benefits of effective adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT), in order to improve the management of building projects. A questionnaire survey was carried out in India to assess the importance of each identified perception. Data analysis shows that the industry and organization level barriers and associated enablers are perceived to be very important. Thus, the study identifies strategic actions to be taken by the managers at the industry and organization levels for increasing effective adoption of ICT for building project management. Analysis results have also been utilized for scenario building for ICT adoption within the building industry.

J	Berard, C; Delerue, H				Berard, Celine; Delerue, Helene			A cross-cultural analysis of intellectual asset protection in SMEs The effect of environmental scanning	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						National cultures; Intellectual property; Cross-cultural studies; Strategic management; Strategic choices	PROPERTY-RIGHTS; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; COUNTRIES; STRATEGY; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT	Purpose - This paper aims to examine the effect of national culture on the capacity of small and medium-sized biotechnology enterprises to protect their intellectual assets by analysing the mediator role of environmental scanning behaviour. The extent to which environmental scanning behaviour helps firms to protect their intellectual assets is investigated, and the effects of national cultural values on environmental scanning behaviour are analysed. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested with survey data from 123 biotechnology SMEs located in 14 countries. Findings - Environmental scanning appears to be an important step in the intellectual property strategy, as it enhances the firm's capacity to protect its intellectual assets. Nevertheless, the results show that firms located in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, high power distance and low individualism do more scanning, whereas the capacity to protect intellectual assets is perceived as being more important in firms located in cultures with low uncertainty avoidance, low power distance and high individualism. Research limitations/implications - Certain limitations should be noted. For instance, the research is based on cross-sectional data, which provide limited insight into the temporal aspects of dynamic environments. Practical implications - The study has important implications for practitioners. It demonstrates that, in international working relationships, cultural values have a direct effect on environmental scanning behaviour, and hence an indirect effect on intellectual property (IP) protection capability. Given the strategic importance of scanning and IP for innovative firms, the results could help managers to make strategic decisions, specifically in R&D internationalization through decentralization or partnership. Originality/value - Although few studies have empirically analysed the role of environmental scanning in a particular domain, such as intellectual property strategic management, or adopted a comparative cross-cultural design to do so, this paper investigates the role of environmental scanning in intellectual property strategy from a cross-cultural perspective.

EXPLORING CHARACTERISTICS OF GIS ADOPTION DECISIONS AND TYPE OF INDUCED CHANGES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: THE CASE OF ETHIOPIA	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						Adoption decisions; organizational changes; GIS; GIS communications		The adoption of geographic information system (GIS) in developing countries is limited due to contextual impediments. Despite this, there are examples in developing countries where GIS is being adopted through various projects, initiatives and incentives. One such example concerns the municipal utility sector in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The sector is largely under the control of public authorities with limited funds, yet it has been investing in GIS. Our article explores what have been the characteristics of the adoption decisions and type of induced changes, with the purpose to explore what could explain the GIS adoption process. The aim of this exploration is to find general characteristics of what would make GIS adoption successful in a developing countries context. We hypothesized that actual GIS adoption decision and induced changes depend on the overall organizational interests and strategic opportunities, which in turn depend on contextual factors. The results indicated that there were some circumstances which fused GIS adoption decisions with a certain degree of opportunism. GIS was adopted especially when it served other strategic purposes, such as structural adjustments to maintain organizational control. Furthermore, we found that higher level organizational changes, such as changes in power structure and communication lines, would not directly occur only because GIS adoption required so. These characteristics may be more profound in developing countries than in developed countries.

J	Brandau, M; Hoffjan, AH				Brandau, Michael; Hoffjan, Andreas			Exploring the involvement of management accounting in strategic decisions and control The case of offshoring	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE			English	Article						Decision making; Channel relations; Management accounting; Control	TRANSACTION; SERVICES; NETWORK; ISSUES; COSTS	Purpose - The paper seeks to explore the extent of involvement of management accounting in strategic inter-organizational decisions and control in the context of offshoring of services. Design/methodology/approach - For the present study, a multiple case study field research design was selected. A data-bank media search identified companies actually offshoring their services. In total, 17 semi-structured interviews with management accountants/managers were conducted in 14 of the identified companies. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis techniques. Findings - Management accounting is involved in offshoring activities to a much lower extent than expected. The reasons range from contractual agreements between the different parties, which substitute in part for management accounting interventions, to competence problems in accounting departments. Therefore, management accounting often fails to provide support for strategic planning and coordination. Research limitations/implications - The data obtained through the qualitative research approach have a low-scaling level, which limits subsequent analysis to descriptive statistics only. Practical implications - The paper identifies risks and actual problems associated with offshoring, which indicate an increased need for coordinated planning and information processing. Furthermore, it raises the question of how management accounting can overcome existing competence problems with respect to the support of strategic decision making, in order to fulfil its function within the company more efficiently. Originality/value - Literature does not provide convincing evidence of the practical significance of management accounting in the context of strategic decisions and inter-organizational relations. This paper shows that management accounting currently remains far removed from its function as a developer of strategic decisions and as a support function for corporate planning and coordination processes.

J	Brauer, M; Schimmer, M				Brauer, Matthias; Schimmer, Markus			Performance effects of corporate divestiture programs	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Insurance companies; Divestment; Strategic management	EQUITY CARVE-OUTS; ASSET SALES; EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; SHAREHOLDER WEALTH; OFF ANNOUNCEMENTS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; DECISION-MAKING; AGENCY COSTS	Purpose - The paper aims at extending extant research on sources of divestiture gains by suggesting a novel program-based perspective on divestitures and analyzing the performance of program divestitures in comparison to single "stand-alone" divestitures. Design/methodology/approach - Based on event study methodology, the authors analyze the abnormal returns of 160 divestiture announcements within the global insurance industry between 1998 and 2007. In contrast to prior research which relied on ex post statistical clustering to identify transaction programs, ad hoc corporate press releases issued with the divestiture announcements are used to categorize program divestitures. Findings - Empirical results suggest that program divestitures generate higher abnormal returns than stand-alone divestitures. Further analyses into the sources for these higher gains, however, do not provide support for experience effects as significant explanatory factors. Instead, results suggest that the scheduling of divestitures significantly impacts announcement returns. Research limitations/implications - The scope and single industry setting of the study suggest future cross-industry research on the influence of divestiture program characteristics on divestiture performance and the conditions under which these programs improve divestiture performance. Practical implications - Managers are advised to refrain from piecemeal divestiture behavior lacking clear strategic focus. Instead, they are encouraged to bundle their divestitures as part of a divestiture program with a clear strategic intent and shared business logic. Originality/value - While prior research on divestitures has treated divestitures as isolated events, the paper directs attention towards the analysis of divestiture programs. Further, experience and timing effects, which have been widely absent from prior divestiture studies, are considered.

Testing the synergistic effects of GnRH and testosterone on the reproductive physiology of pre-adult pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY			English	Article						cortisol; gonado-somatic index; maturation; ovarian development; photoperiod; reproductive hormones	GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; PRECOCIOUS SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT; SOCKEYE-SALMON; ATLANTIC SALMON; STEROID-HORMONES; PACIFIC SALMON; CHUM SALMON; PITUITARY GONADOTROPIN; SPAWNING MIGRATION; PLASMA-CORTISOL	To test the hypothesis that the hypothalmic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and testosterone (T) co-treatment stimulates both the hypothalmo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) and hypothalmo-pituitary-interrenal axes, the reproductive and osmoregulatory responses of pre-adult pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha were compared after GnRH and T administration either alone or in combination. Relative to controls, neither GnRH nor T treatment resulted in significantly greater ovarian or testicular growth, but co-treatment significantly increased ovarian growth after 5 months. Interestingly, the stimulation was undetectable after 3 months. However, once daily photoperiod began shortening after the summer solstice, c. 2 months before the natural spawning date, GnRH+T-treated females were stimulated to produce larger ovaries. Final fish body length and the size of individual eggs did not differ among treatment groups. GnRH+T eggs, however, showed signs of advanced vitellogenesis relative to GnRH-treated and control eggs, whereas T-treated eggs became atretic. Testis size increased significantly from initial values and most males were spermiating, but this growth and development were independent of hormone treatments. Final plasma ion, metabolite and cortisol concentrations did not differ among treatment groups. It is concluded that GnRH+T co-treatment was effective in stimulating female but not male maturation. GnRH and T treatment, however, presumably had little effect on the hypothalmo-pituitary-interrenal axis as observed by ionoregulatory status.	[Crossin, G. T.; Hinch, S. G.; Lotto, A.

The wide consensus of the energy sector community (business, academic, policy, etc.) is considered a necessity for the success of such a challenging undertake. In this respect, the creation and operation of a European strategic energy think-tank (EU-SENT2) could play a catalytic role. This paper following an overview of EU energy policy critical issues presents the principles of the EU-SENT2 and compares four main think-tank typologies. The paper focuses on 'domains of think-tank's independence' -funding, agenda setting, ideology and research - on the mission and core values of a European energy think-tank. After discussing on the applicability of alternative typologies for a European energy think-tank, its management structure and basic principals and procedures are described.

J	Hemphill, T				Hemphill, Thomas			The "creative capitalism'' corporate governance model How radical an approach to modern capitalism?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Capitalist systems; Corporate governance; Globalization; Innovation; Poverty; Multinational companies	BOTTOM	Purpose - The purpose of this article is exploratory; to evaluate the arguments for "creative capitalism'' as a viable market alternative, i.e. corporate governance model, for MNCs in lieu of the capitalist model under which they presently operate. Design/methodology/approach - The paper will first explore the attributes making up the creative capitalism model; second, compare the core attributes of capitalism to Gates' conception of creative capitalism; third, analyze how creative capitalism fits (or does not fit) within the concepts of global corporate citizenship; fourth, present arguments for creative capitalism to be considered as a viable economic opportunity for MNCs and review the latest management strategy frameworks available for implementation; and lastly, summarize the article's major arguments and offer conclusions on the viability of creative capitalism in the global economy. Findings - When compared to the essential components of capitalism and the expansion of government interference in the marketplace, creative capitalism does little more than advocate for national governments to offer financial and related incentives encouraging corporations to develop innovative solutions for alleviating poverty. Practical implications - For managers, this paper provides insights not emphasizing a "fortune at the bottom of the pyramid'', but profit opportunities available to innovative multinational corporations willing to search for profit opportunities in less developed countries. Originality/value - This is a seminal, exploratory evaluation of Bill Gates' concept of "creative capitalism'' and applies previous researchers' state-of-the-art management frameworks, including the Corporate Citizenship Model and the Strategic CSR Approach, to his proposed governance model.

Strategic HRM models have established the importance of resource dependency and institutional perspectives in understanding small biotechnology firms. These models, however, have seldom included the impact of managerial agency, particularly with regard to the role of the founder-scientist. Using three exploratory case studies of biotechnology small and medium enterprises (SMEs), we examine the role of founder-scientists in addressing the requirements of institutional legitimacy and scarce resources (human and capital) in their firms.

J	Kim, EY; Ko, E				Kim, Eun Young; Ko, Eunju			Achieving Brand Power: Bean Pole of Samsung	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL FASHION MARKETING			English	Article						Bean Pole; Fashion brand equity; Global expansion; Korea		Along with continuous increases in the globalization of market, today's business is challenged by a maturing domestic retail environment and an aging consumer market. Given this atmosphere in Korean fashion market, one of critical issues to survival for companies is a strong "brand power" with brand image (identity) and its strategic marketing Strong brands are viewed to differentiate themselves from unknown brands, resulting in favorable brand images that mirror the brand's identity. As exploratory approach, this study identifies a strategic business focus on achieving brand power and provides an insight into developing effective brand positioning and fashion marketing strategy toward global markets. By focusing on a Korean fashion brand "Bean Pole", objectives of this study are to profile the Cheil Industry in Samsung Group, define brand identity of the Bean Pole, and explore critical factors of strategic brand management. Korea's economy ranks among the top 10 in the world, and its consumers have long been familiar with Western cultures through travel abroad and mass communications. Now, the Korean fashion marketplace is characterized by two market niches; (a) primarily domestically-produced, inexpensive apparel lines and (b) high-end collections dominated by designer brands imported mostly from the U.S. and Europe. More recently, apparel retail industry has shown strong rates of growth in South Korea, increasing its attractiveness to new entrants from foreign retailers. While some retailers selling apparel are highly diverse, many retailers still retain a strong emphasis on clothing, which intensifies rivalry. Cheil Industries is an affiliate of the Samsung Group, founded in 1954, as an initiative company with force in the development of textile industry, Korea. Today, the company has established a worldwide reputation for high quality and value in the three aspects: (a) leadership of electronic material in the IT area, (b) creating high profit by business structure of chemicals, and (c) gaining competitive fashion brand power. Currently, the Cheil Industry became a leading fashion firm with dominant brand power by launching various brands in domestic as well as foreign markets. As a traditional casual brand, "Bean Pole" launched in 1989 is currently expanding to family brands with different product lines. In 2005, the company had annual sales of $950million for fashion business. "Bean Pole" is the core fashion brand of the Cheil Industries, contributing 31% ($290million) of total sales in the fashion division in 2005. Now, the Bean Pole is number 1 brand in the retail venue of casual wear and children wear. Obviously, Bean Pole plays an important role as the best brand in achieving powerful brand asset of Cheil Industries' fashion brands in Korea. This case study discusses Bean Pole from two aspects. The first thing is building brand salience. For fashion products, brand salience may be strongly related to brand image (or concept) including fashion image and style. The second thing is how to do strategic brand management. Strategic brand management involves the design and implementation of marketing programs and activities to build, measure, and manage brand equity. This study provides an insight into marketers and researchers to develop devise strategic brand management in the area of high-end fashion brand and underscore the inherent need for further, in-depth empirical research in the brand equity theory. A basic observation exemplify the brand identity of Bean Pole and its strategic brand management for sustaining strong brand equity in three aspects: brand extension, image positioning, and marketing mixes. In case of Bean Pole, success of marketing strategy for brand management heavily relies on its prestige image with high quality, establishing the brand equity. The brand equity can be leverage of brand extension entering into variety of new product categories within a same category of apparel. Especially, masstige brand positioning is critical to success of lifestyle brand extension for Bean Pole, which may have synergy effect on achieving strong brand value in both core brand and its extension. A strategic brand managing effort of Bean Pole can help companies establish brand equity. Fashion firms that are able to have a strong relationship with their customer should real a host of value, such as salient brand identity, premium brand price, and efficient marketing programs. Such understanding Bean Pole's business focus allow marketers or retailers to entry into global brand extensions.

The organizational characteristics investigated include strategic direction, decentralization of authority, system flexibility, reward system, and open-system feedback mechanism. Findings - The results of SEM indicate that officers' perceptions on organizational structure (except open-system feedback mechanism) of Korean police agency do not influence an individual police officer's preventive policing activity. The study found a significant relationship between officers' perceptions on open-system structure and preventive policing practice. Finally, the study also identified a complex network of organizational traits on preventive policing: strategic direction influences all other organizational factors; system flexibility is a prerequisite for the open system; and decentralization of authority influences the open system structure. Research limitations/implications - Although this study uniquely utilized organizational factors measured at the individual level, one may criticize the lack of a more direct organizational measure, such as organizational size, age, task scope, or number of ranks. Future study on this topic will benefit from employing both direct and indirect organizational measures. Originality/value - The current study enhances the understanding of individual perception of organizational characteristics on police officers' day-to-day preventive policing activities.

J	Lee, JWC; Mohamad, O; Ramayah, T				Lee, Jason Wai Chow; Mohamad, Osman; Ramayah, T.			Outsourcing: is the social exchange theory still relevant in developing countries?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN INTERACTIVE MARKETING			English	Article						Southeast Asia; Outsourcing; Relationship marketing; Channel relationships	RELATIONSHIP QUALITY; TRANSACTION-COST; STRATEGIC INTEGRATION; TRUST; MODEL; COMMITMENT; IMPACT; FIRM; SUCCESS; POWER	Purpose - The paper offers a viewpoint on the relevance of the underpinnings of the social exchange theory (SET) in understanding inter-firm relationships, specifically with respect to outsourcing relationships in a Southeast Asian context. Design/methodology/approach - The viewpoint is based on literature review on outsourcing trends, characteristics and underlying theories including the underpinnings of SET in combination with anecdotal accounts from practitioners in the electrical and electronics (E&E) sector as well as personal emic observations of management styles embedded within the socio-cultural context of a developing country. Findings - Management and outsourcing of contracts in a Southeast Asian context are usually done on a personal level with some leeway provided by top management. The reverse is true for developed countries where all processes and contracts need to be seen as just and transparent to stakeholders. Dominant theories identified with outsourcing generations seem to be embedded in management culture of developed countries which are largely influenced by the transaction cost economics theory and its extensions, the resource-based view and the resource-dependence view. By placing a caveat on generalizability, the paper opines that SET is still relevant in the Southeast Asian context. Originality/value - As outsourcing characteristics have changed and evolved over the years, relationship models need to be reviewed and redefined to be in congruence with the changes that are occurring. The Southeast Asian socio-cultural context can be a reference point for conceptualization of relationship models to understand E&E outsourcing relationships along global supply chains.

J	Nilsson, T				Nilsson, Tomas			The reluctant rhetorician: senior managers as rhetoricians in a strategic change context	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Conference on Rhetoric and Narratives in Management Research	MAR 12-14, 2009	ESADE, Barcelona, SPAIN		ESADE	Organizational change; Communication; Rhetoric; Senior managers; Sweden		Purpose - This paper explores strategic change communication, framed by the idea that managers can be viewed as rhetoricians. The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss senior managers' subjective experiences of rhetorical aspects of change management. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a case study from ABB Sweden (a power and automation technology company). In-depth interviews with senior managers, with vast experience of change management, constitute the empirical source. Findings - The most important finding is the managers' overall reluctance towards rhetoric. According to the managers in this study, a rhetorician is an over-enthusiastic person who "waves his arms when speaking". To master the art of rhetoric is not believed to be of particular importance when managing strategic change. Research limitations/implications - Senior managers' potentially negative attitude concerning rhetoric should be taken into account when researchers situate change management within a rhetorical frame. Practical implications - Given the large interest in "efficient" communication, generally managers should be encouraged to overcome their reluctance towards rhetoric to improve their ability to "manage meaning" constructively. Originality/value - This paper contributes to change management communication insofar as it gives voice to the individual manager. This voice indicates; in a time when rhetoric, storytelling, and charismatic leadership are making ground; that the understanding of rhetoric is much more limited than the general impression might suggest.

J	Pansiri, J; Courvisanos, J				Pansiri, Jaloni; Courvisanos, Jerry			Attitude to Risk in Technology-Based Strategic Alliances for Tourism	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY & TOURISM ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						strategic alliances; technology-based knowledge; tolerance of ambiguity; willingness to take risk; innovation	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; DETERMINANTS; PERCEPTIONS; COOPERATION; PERFORMANCE; AUSTRALIA; INTERNET	This article examines how attitude to risk in the tourism industry impacts on the role of strategic alliances in developing technology-based knowledge. A survey of Australian travel sector businesses indicates that strategic alliances in tourism contribute only marginally to technology-based knowledge. The study further found that executives in the travel sector of tourism are risk-averse and this has implications for their perceptions regarding the contribution of alliances to technology-based knowledge. The findings imply that Australian industry policy towards tourism needs to encourage strategic alliances that have the potential to stimulate knowledge-based innovation.

J	Pesme, JO; Belis-Bergouignan, MC; Corade, N				Pesme, Jacques-Olivier; Belis-Bergouignan, Marie-Claude; Corade, Nathalie			Strategic operations and concentration in the Bordeaux-Aquitaine region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WINE BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategic alliances; Acquisitions and mergers; Globalization; Winemaking; France; Viticulture		Purpose - Working from the example of two of the main players in the Aquitaine wine sector; the cooperatives and the wine merchants, the aim of this paper is to analyse the nature of strategic operations from the point of view of the concentration process taking place in the Bordeaux-Aquitaine region. Design/methodology/approach - After providing a theoretical framework about the industrial cluster and its strategic operations in the area of consolidation, the paper provides descriptive and quantitative data, collected from in-depth interviews; surveys conducted by the authors; and secondary sources. Findings - This paper provides both qualitative and quantitative evidence to prove that a number of collaborative approaches have been adopted in the region. It highlights the fact that these players are now more willing to respond to the conditions of a new competitive environment, and consequently to consider new strategic approaches. Originality/value - The present paper, contrary to these received ideas, demonstrates that the Aquitaine wine value chain is undergoing deep restructuring process. With the spotlight focused on producing a size effect on the sector through concentration, the paper examines in greater detail what this process really is. It is not limited to size objectives as it commits the players to thorough production and market changes. This led to concentration operations being analysed in terms of strategic changes, notably with regard to the margin for manoeuvre that the players are meant to design and develop.

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative interviews with firm executives were conducted and a survey was then administered. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypotheses derived from the qualitative stage of the research. Findings - The results indicate that managers perceive that social, operational, and financial alliance attributes contribute to new product opportunities and increased profitability, which in turn enhances both shareholder value and the opportunity to create societal value. Originality/value - In addition to the specific findings related to strategic alliances, the study represents an initial use of a means-end framework to gather both firm-level qualitative and quantitative data from executives.

J	Quer, DG; Claver, EQ; Rienda, L				Quer, Diego; Claver, Enrique; Rienda, Laura			Doing business in China and India: a comparative approach	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						China; India; Business policy; Strategic management		Purpose - In recent years, China and India have been experiencing a process of economic and social transformation that is unprecedented in recent human history. The consequences of the spectacular resurgence of these two Asian giants are profound and far-reaching, and are causing the centre of gravity of the world economy to be drawn inexorably toward these countries. The aim of this paper is to offer a comparative approach to the reality of China and India as regards business and strategic management. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews previous literature that has focused on comparing various issues related to business and management in China and India. Findings - The paper highlights the points of convergence and divergence in the developmental patterns of China and India, the key factors for success in each country, the entry modes that could be used and the business opportunities they offer. Originality/value - The paper provides a comparison between China and India with regard to business and strategic management, analysing the main similarities and differences between the two Asian giants.

J	Rapert, MI; Newman, C; Park, SY; Lee, EM				Rapert, Molly Inhofe; Newman, Christopher; Park, Seong-Yeon; Lee, Eun Mi			Seeking a Better Place: Sustainability in the CPG Industry	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Sustainability; Consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry; Profitability; Responsibility to the Environment; Responsibility to Consumers and Shareholders		For us, there is virtually no distinction between being a responsible citizen and a successful business... they are one and the same for Wal-Mart today." Lee Scott, Wal-Mart CEO after the 2005 Katrina disaster; cited in Green to Gold (Esty and Winston 2006). Lee Scott's statement signaled a new era in sustainability as manufacturers and retailers around the globe watched the world's largest mass merchandiser confirm its intentions with respect to sustainability. For decades, the environmental movement has grown, slowly bleeding over into the corporate world. Companies have been born, products have been created, academic journals have been launched, and government initiatives have been undertaken all in the pursuit of sustainability (Peattie and Crane 2005). While progress has been admittedly slower than some may desire, the emergence and entrance of environmentally concerned mass merchandisers has done much to help with sustainable efforts. To better understand this movement, we incorporate the perspectives of both executives and consumers involved in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. This research relies on three underlying themes: (1) Conceptual and anecdotal evidence suggests that companies undertake sustainability initiatives for a plethora of reasons, (2) The number of sustainability initiatives continues to increase in the consumer packaged goods industries, and (3) That it is, therefore, necessary to explore the role that sustainability plays in the minds of consumers. In light of these themes, surveys were administered to and completed by 143 college students and 101 business executives to assess a number of variables in regards to sustainability including willingness-to-pay, behavioral intentions, attitudes, willingness-to-pay, and preferences. Survey results indicate that the top three reasons why executives believe sustainability to be important include (1) the opportunity for profitability, (2) the fulfillment of an obligation to the environment, and (3) a responsibility to customers and shareholders. College students identified the top three reasons as (1) a responsibility to the environment, (2) an indebtedness to future generations, and (3) an effective management of resources. While the rationale for supporting sustainability efforts differed between college students and executives, the executives and consumers reported similar responses for the majority of the remaining sustainability issues. Furthermore, when we asked consumers to assess the importance of six key issues (healthcare, economy, education, crime, government spending, and environment) previously identified as important to consumers by Gallup Poll, protecting the environment only ranked fourth out of the six (Carlson 2005). While all six of these issues were identified as important, the top three that emerged as most important were (1) improvements in education, (2) the economy, and (3) health care. As the pursuit and incorporation of sustainability continues to evolve, so too will the expected outcomes. New definitions of performance that reflect the social/business benefits as well as the lengthened implementation period are relevant and warranted (Ehrenfeld 2005; Hitchcock and Willard 2006). We identified three primary categories of literature review of both anecdotal and of sustainability: (1) improvements in (2) differentiation opportunities, and Within each of these categories, several identified resulting in eleven different outcomes based on a conceptual expectations constituent satisfaction, (3) financial rewards. specific outcomes were outcomes arising from sustainability initiatives. Our survey results indicate that the top five most likely outcomes for companies that pursue sustainability are: (1) green consumers will be more satisfied, (2) company image will be better, (3) corporate responsibility will be enhanced, (4) energy costs will be reduced, and (5) products will be more innovative. Additionally, to better understand the interesting intersection between the environmental "identity" of a consumer and the willingness to manifest that identity with marketplace purchases, we extended prior research developed by Experian Research (2008). Accordingly, respondents were categorized as one of four types of green consumers (Behavioral Greens, Think Greens, Potential Greens, or True Browns) to garner a better understanding of the green consumer in addition to assisting with a more effective interpretation of results. We assessed these consumers' willingness to engage in eco-friendly behavior by evaluating three options: (1) shopping at retailers that support environmental initiatives, (2) paying more for products that protect the environment, and (3) paying higher taxes so the government can support environmental initiatives. Think Greens expressed the greatest willingness to change, followed by Behavioral Greens, Potential Greens, and True Browns. These differences were all significant at p<01. Further Conclusions and Implications We have undertaken a descriptive study which seeks to enhance our understanding of the strategic domain of sustainability. Specifically, this research fills a gap in the literature by comparing and contrasting the sustainability views of business executives and consumers with specific regard to preferences, intentions, willingness-to-pay, behavior, and attitudes. For practitioners, much can be gained from a strategic standpoint. In addition to the many results already reported, respondents also reported than willing to pay more for products that protect the environment. Other specific results indicate that female respondents consistently communicate a stronger willingness than males to pay more for these products and to shop at eco-friendly retailers. Knowing this additional information, practitioners can now have a more specific market in which to target and communicate their sustainability efforts. While this research is only an initial step towards understanding similarities and differences among practitioners and consumers regarding sustainability, it presents original findings that contribute to both practice and research. Future research should be directed toward examining other variables affecting this relationship, as well as other specific industries.

Effects of Dietary Protein on Nitrogen Metabolism and Protein Requirements for Maintenance of Growing Thai Swamp Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) Calves	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND VETERINARY ADVANCES			English	Article						Swamp buffalo; buffalo calves; Bubalus bubalis; protein requirement; N balance; protein for maintenance	NUTRIENT DIGESTIBILITY; RUMINAL FERMENTATION; UREA NITROGEN; RAVI; ENERGY	The experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary crude protein on nitrogen utilization, nutrient digestibility and protein requirement for maintenance of swamp buffalo calves. Four growing swamp male buffaloes with 12-18 months old (average initial weight 209 +/- 17 kg) were used. The calves were assigned to use a 4x4 Latin square design to receive four diets. In terms of treatment, Crude Protein (CP) levels in the diets were 5, 7, 9 and 11% of Dry Matter (DM) and all diets were isocaloric (20% above maintenance of ME). CP intake and CP digestibility of calves clearly increased (p<0.05) with increasing CP content in diet. However, increasing the levels of dietary protein did not significantly alter (p>0.05) DM intake, digestibility of DM, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber, body weight change and ruminal pH in calves. As the level of CP in diet increased, blood urea nitrogen, ruminal ammonia N, total volatile fatty acid, urinary N, N retention and N balance were observed to increase linearly (p<0.05). While N fecal was not significantly different (p>0.05), when dietary protein. levels increased. The relationship between N Balance (NB) and N intake (NI, g kg(-1) W-0.75) in swamp buffalo calves was NB = 0.883NI-0.653 (R-2 = 0.855). Present findings suggested that nitrogen requirements for maintenance of growing Thai swamp buffalo calves were 0.74 g N or 4.63 g CP kg(-1) BW0.75.

J	Thawesaengskulthai, N				Thawesaengskulthai, Natcha			An empirical framework for selecting quality management and improvement initiatives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quality management; Quality improvement; Decision making		Purpose - A growing number of publications have questioned and raised awareness of improvement fashions, especially in the area of quality management (QM), but rational decision-making process has been promoted. Thus, this paper aims to address the selection issue and presents a holistic framework for selecting a QM and improvement initiative. Design/methodology/approach - The research was carried out in three phases. Phase One established a conceptual background for the adoption based on extensive literature review. Phase Two provided empirical studies of the QM approaches adopted in three leading case companies in Thailand and interviews with quality experts. Finally, Phase Three builds a theory of selection based on cross-case analysis and a paradigm model. Findings - Triggers for the adoption are the internal factors (i.e. need to survive, sustain competitiveness, and increase operational effectiveness) and external factors (i.e. institutional push, trade barrier, and company image). The selection framework and the theory of selecting QMand improvement initiatives explain the four selection views of fashion setting, pay-off, strategic fit, and organisation fit. Research limitations/implications - Selection of quality and improvement initiatives is based on the managers' perceptions and past experiences of QM selecting decision, and upon on the information available. Originality/value - The advancement in the theory of the adoption of improvement initiatives is the main contribution of this research. The selection framework, which was theoretically and empirically grounded, has attempted to surface the irrational influences on the adoption to provide a more rational and less ambiguous justification. It provides a holistic model incorporating comprehensive selection criteria aiming to assist managers undertaking selection decisions.

J	Todeva, E				Todeva, Emanuela			Theoretical tensions between regulation, governance, and strategic behaviour in a federated world order	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Regulation; Governance; Strategic management		Purpose - The paper seeks to explore Kant's formulations on universal good will, perfect moral order, and universal peace, and the notion that the world's citizenship should be organised in a federated system of states, free to choose their own universal laws. Design/methodology/approach - This theoretical discussion is pursued in two separate sections. The first section reviews leading regulation theories that explain how governments in their decision-making capacity engage in regulation at macro-level of the entire socio-economic system. The second section follows from this argument and discusses the governance theory and alternative governance mechanisms designed and employed by governments to manage the strategic behaviour of the individual economic actors at mezzo-and micro-level of contract relationships. Findings - The paper discusses some of the current theories that underpin the analysis and interpretation of public administration practice, or public governance in different socio-economic systems. The paper looks at some of the dominant postulates of regulation and governance, and question to what extent they can be accepted as universal principles in line with Kant's argumentation. Different types of governance mechanisms are compared and contrasted in the context of strategic actors such as: the public government as a regulating authority and the firms as regulated economic actors. Originality/value - The argument in this paper is that governments as regulators of national socio-economic systems are strategic actors in their capacity to actively shape the regulatory environment, implementing various coordination mechanisms that facilitate the functioning of the economy and the society. The paper attempts to make some ethical judgements on market imperfections and government imperfections in line with Kant's concept of universal moral order.

Rehabilitating degraded forests has been being one of the Guangdong Provincial Government's most important priorities. Several successful efforts and a holistic approach have been made to rehabilitate the degraded forest landscape and increase forest cover. This paper assesses the characteristics of eight rehabilitation initiatives identified in Guangdong Province, their outcomes and influencing factors, and sustainability of technical, social-economic, long-term management and financing factors using a literature search and 22 case studies obtained by means of questionnaires and interviews. The case studies help to elucidate implementation activities and outcomes on the ground. The objective of this paper is to draw strategic lessons for sustaining and guiding current and future efforts both within China and elsewhere in the world.

Models of individual business functions are reviewed, and equations quantifying relationships presented. Using methods of system theory, including block diagrams, non-dimensionalization, and state equation methods, these business function sub-models were assembled into a composite enterprise systems model. The formulated aggregate model is illustrated with industry examples for tire companies; nonetheless the aggregate model can be used to assess other industries. Values of parameters for the system model were determined from data obtained from annual reports of publicly owned companies. Simulations closely matched the companies' published performance over ensuing years. The developed aggregate enterprise model has significant predictive capabilities for modern corporations.

J	Chen, CL				Chen Ching-Liang			Strategic thinking leading to private brand strategy that caters for customers' shopping preferences in retail marketing	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Private brand strategy; brand equity; customers' shopping preference	NATIONAL BRAND; EQUITY; PRICE; PERCEPTIONS; INTENTIONS; REPUTATION; QUALITY; LABELS; MODEL	This study proposes a private brand strategy for retail marketing through brand equity to explore customers' shopping preferences and it uses structural equation model to analyze the model's appropriateness. There are two kinds of cross-categories articles employed as the bases of a questionnaire for respondents; they include household papers and soft drinks. This study proceeds with convenient samples along with a face-to-face questionnaire in stores and also chooses consumers shopping in Carrefour, RT-Mart, and Taisuco hypermarket as samples. This proposed model displays the rigorous and robust method of SEM, and the statistically significant level of the model fits into the Likert scales (GFI = 0.947, CFI = 0.975). It reveals that private brands retail channels should focus on a private brands strategy that leads to brand equity, if possible. If the retailers offer a more complete PB strategy and bridge it with brand equity as a mediator, customers' shopping preferences will be reflected on the store's performance. Then, retailers can formalize a strategic retail channels' power and property: getting PB, bridging and mapping PB.

J	Goldman, E; Cahill, T; Filho, RP				Goldman, Ellen; Cahill, Terrence; Filho, Rubens Pessanha			Experiences That Develop the Ability to Think Strategically	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LEADERSHIP; EXPERTISE	The ability to think strategically is an admired and a sought-after leadership requirement, yet we know little about how it develops. The purpose of this study is to identify specific experiences that contribute to the development of an individual's ability to think strategically. We identified eight work experiences, including different types of organizational projects, processes, and relationships, that contribute to an individual's strategic thinking ability. We also delineate specific characteristics material to each experience. These characteristics indicate that considerable time and focus are required to develop the ability to think strategically. In addition, the experiences are not all accessed equally: Women are less likely to have nonrelational experiences, while chief executive officers are more likely to have the most challenging ones. In addition, we found differences regarding work-related continuing education activities. Respondents rated nonhealthcare conferences and reading behind all other identified experiences that contribute to strategic thinking ability. Individuals can implement several strategies to improve their strategic thinking ability, including deliberately incorporating the requisite experiences into their development plans, ensuring that the experiences incorporate the required characteristics, and improving the benefit received from attending educational programs in non-healthcare industries. Organizations can implement several strategies to ensure the experiences are as effective as possible, such as appraising gender differences across the experiences and reviewing the organization's strategic planning processes for the characteristics that best encourage strategic thinking.

Tul. & C. Tul., is common to Canadian boreal forests and has good commercial potential. Within a Pinus banksiana Lamb. stand managed for mushroom production, this study aimed to (1) document carpophore productivity (density, biomass per area) during three seasons, (2) compare productivity among three forest conditions (trails, forest strips between trails, and unmanaged forest), (3) establish ecological parameters related to productivity, and (4) define microhabitats where carpophores are present by using soil and vegetation descriptors. Mushroom density tended to be higher on the trails than under the canopy, but fresh biomass was higher in forest strips except in 2006 when midsummer precipitation was low. Trail management did not increase mushroom production but maintained it during periods of reduced precipitation. Productivity was positively related to the abundance of shade-intolerant plant species and to extractable ammonium, and negatively related to soil pH. Within the present study conditions, microhabitats suitable for the presence of carpophores had low pH. high available phosphorus, low Kalmia angustifolia L. cover, and small canopy gaps with shade-intolerant species. This study was the first step toward understanding the ecology and impacts of forest practices on the lobster mushroom.	[Rochon, Caroline; Khasa, Damase P.; Fortin, J.

J	De Rango, F				De Rango, Floriano			Trust-Based SAODV Protocol with Intrusion Detection, Trust Management and Incentive Cooperation in MANETs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Incentive Cooperation; Intrusion Detection Mechanism (IDM); Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET); Secure AODV (SAODV); Security; Trust Management	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; HOC	Distributed wireless systems present many security issues, and offering security preserving network resources is often a challenging effort. Offering security through only cryptography is not always a suitable solution if the high dynamic context of MANET is considered and the trust mechanism that reduces the computationally intensive number of security operations becomes strategic. In this work, a well-known routing protocol, called SAODV, has been considered. To improve its performance and offer more resilience to attack from malicious nodes authenticated by the network, some additional features are added. A preventive approach based on a cryptographic mechanism and a reactive approach to detect anomalous and malicious nodes are considered. An extension of SAODV offering an Intrusion Detection Mechanism (IDM) and a Trust-based Mechanism (TBM) to promote the collaboration of the cooperating nodes and penalize the selfish nodes are proposed. Simulation results were performed under a NS-2 simulator to show the effectiveness of our proposal compared with AODV and SAODV. Simulation parameters, such as Normalized Routing Overhead, Data Packet Delivery Ratio, average number of signatures and throughput of collaborating and malicious nodes, have been considered.

Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an aquatic fungus that has been linked with widespread amphibian declines, is ubiquitous in the Rocky Mountains. As part of assessing the distribution limits of Bd in our study area, we sampled the water column and sediments for Bd zoospores in 30 high-elevation water bodies that lacked amphibians. All water bodies were in areas where Bd has been documented from neighboring, lower-elevation areas. We targeted areas lacking amphibians because existence of Bd independent of amphibians would have both ecologic and management implications. We did not detect Bd, which Supports the hypothesis that it does not live independently, of amphibians. However, assuming a detection sensitivity of 59.5% (based on sampling of water where amphibians tested positive for Bd), we only had 95% confidence of detecting Bd if it was in >= 16% of our sites. Further investigation into potential abiotic reservoirs is needed, but our results provide a strategic step in determining the distributional and environmental limitations of Bd in our study region.

J	Haxthausen, O				Haxthausen, Ove			Valuing brands and brand investments: Key learnings and future expectations	JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						brand valuation; marketing ROI; marketing spend optimization; marketing strategy; brand investment; brand strategy		The paper discusses the most recent learnings from the brand valuation and marketing ROI work at Millward Brown Optimor. It emphasizes brands as a collection of perceptions that lead customers to be more likely to buy a branded product. The paper looks at the various business issues that brand valuation can address. It also discusses the different valuation approaches available, with a particular emphasis on the intrinsic value provided by the economic use approach. The three fundamental questions at the heart of our economic use approach are articulated, bringing the financial, market insight and strategic brand valuation issues together in a coherent single framework for valuing brands. The relationship between brand valuation and marketing ROI is also explored, with an emphasis on the need to measure all effects of marketing through a 'Total ROI' approach in order to fairly trade-off effects across different marketing activities. Finally, there is a look at what future trends for brand valuation and marketing ROI may look like.

J	Kauffman, RJ; Mohtadi, H				Kauffman, Robert J.; Mohtadi, Hamid			Information sharing and strategic signaling in supply chains	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Anticipated over-supply; collaborative planning; forecasting and replenishment (CPFR); demand forecasting; economic analysis; information sharing; information systems (IS); signaling; supply chain management	VENDOR-MANAGED INVENTORY; ELECTRONIC COMMERCE; INTERORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS; DEMAND INFORMATION; OLIGOPOLY; TECHNOLOGY; EXCHANGE; MARKETS; IMPACT; IMPLEMENTATION	Information sharing in procurement occurs in rich and varied industry contexts in which managerial decisions are made and organizational strategy is formulated. We explore how information sharing ought to work in procurement contexts that involve investments in inter-organizational information systems (IOS) and collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) practices. How and under what circumstances does a firm that plays the role of a supply chain buyer decide to share information on key variables, such as point-of-sale consumer demand data with its supplier, up the supply chain? This is a key issue that crosses the boundary between supply chain management and information systems (IS) management. The answers that we provide are based on our use of a game-theoretic signaling model of buyer and supplier strategy in the presence of uncertainties about final consumer demand. We also explore the connection between operational costs that are associated with the firm's information sharing and information withholding strategies. Our results provide normative guidance to supply chain buyers about how to interpret different demand uncertainty scenarios to improve their decisions and generate high value. From the IS management perspective, we show the impacts on the firm of different information sharing approaches that are made possible by present day technologies.

We asked academicians and practitioners about the availability of knowledge and the potential impact of allied disciplines on project management. We were able to assess where the allied disciplines currently stand in terms of availability and impact as well as make predictions about the future. The thoughts and visions collected from this research provide valuable insights for identifying trends in the allied disciplines and their impact on the future of project management, as well as opportunities, challenges, and obstacles.

Making Radical Change Happen Through Selective Inclusion and Exclusion of Stakeholders	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; PUBLIC MANAGEMENT; NEW-ZEALAND; STRATEGIC CHANGE; LEADERSHIP; PARTICIPATION; FUTURE; REFORM; DYNAMICS	The purpose of this paper is to explore how political leaders can gain acceptance for radical reforms through selective inclusion and exclusion of stakeholders. We had inside access to the formulation of a radical reform in the Scandinavian context and found that radical change was not secured through extensive participation, but rather through selective inclusion and exclusion of stakeholders. Change leaders cannot always choose who to include and exclude in participative processes and both proponents and opponents can influence the content in ways that make it less radical. In the context of the public sector, it becomes particularly challenging to gain acceptance for radical reforms because of the influence from multiple stakeholders, many of whom have the right to be included in the process. Based on a study of a Norwegian regulatory reform, we identify five tactics change leaders can use to manage selective inclusion and exclusion. These include deleting stages in the process, including new stakeholders, alternating the process sequence, suppressing issues, and controlling the kind of influence. By consciously including and excluding stakeholders, change leaders can secure that the radicalness of a reform is preserved in the formulation process.

J	Nyberg, D; Mueller, F				Nyberg, D.; Mueller, F.			Strategic cultural change and local discourses: The importance of being different	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational culture; Organizational change; Discourse; Resistance; Distinctiveness; Strategic change	IDENTITIES; MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS; PARTICIPATION; SUBJECTIVITY; EXPERIENCE; RESISTANCE; VARIETIES; SYSTEMS; HEALTH	This paper analyses a strategic change implementation at call centre operations of an insurance company in Australia. The empirical findings illustrate how the macro-discourse of the culture change programme was in dialogue with alternative local discourses that organizational members drew upon to make sense of the organizational "reality". This meant that the strategic change was slowly watered down and had almost no impact on the daily life in the lower end of the organization. Still, management expressed it as a success, because there was limited overt resistance. The paper contributes to the development of a more nuanced understanding of strategic change programmes in which discourses are treated as dialogical and non-deterministic, rather than omnipotent or mono-logic. Non-participation or resistance towards change initiatives are then not necessarily ideological movements for or against the change, but rather locally specific constructions of the event based on available locally produced discourses.

From the year 2000 onwards, taking into account that the significant increase in the number of strategy related studies published, the classification of strategic management as a separate area besides organizational theory, human resource management and organizational behavior, the initiations to have organized strategic management specific congresses, and so on, it is argued that in the years of 2000's strategic management demonstrates a tendency towards being a specialized, independent area in Turkey. In order to determine the evolution and intellectual structure of strategic management area in Turkey, a bibliometric study of the papers presented to the National Management and Organization Congress in the years between 2000-2008 have been done. Through the bibliometric analysis, it attempts to identify the research pattern and intellectual characteristics of strategic management studies in Turkey by examining the works that have had the greatest impact on strategic management research, the subfields studied most, the authors and publications that have received citations most, etc.	[Barca, Mehmet; Hiziroglu, Mahmut] Sakarya Univ, IIBF Isletme Bolumu, Adapazari, Turkey		Barca, M (corresponding author), Sakarya Univ, IIBF Isletme Bolumu, Adapazari, Turkey.	mbarca@sakarya.edu.tr; hiziroglu@sakarya.edu.tr					Al U., 2008, TURK KUTUPHANECILIGI, V21, P142; Andrews K., 1971, CONCEPT CORPORATE ST; Andrews K.

Communication managers, crisis managers, public affairs managers, and/or public relations managers were solicited from Taiwan's top 500 companies to participate in a survey. The results revealed that, in contrast to public relations autonomy being the strongest and sole predictor of concession strategy, legal dominance could predict defensive and diversionary responses in crisis events. The article concludes with a discussion of practical applications and theoretical implications.

J	Stefani, RT				Stefani, Raymond T.			Predicting score difference versus score total in rugby and soccer	IMA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT MATHEMATICS			English	Article						least squares; regression to the mean; prediction; soccer; rugby; gambling	FOOTBALL-LEAGUE GAMES; LEAST-SQUARES; BASKETBALL; OUTCOMES; MODEL	A common paradigm is used to show that, in rugby and soccer, score difference is more accurately predicted based on past data than is score total. Offensive and defensive ratings evolve by applying least-squares or exponential smoothing to past home scores and visiting scores, corrected for home advantage. Smoothed ratings provide a first-order prediction of score difference and score total for future matches. The average absolute error of such predictions may be minimized by employing a 'shrinking factor' L. If L is one, predictions are based solely on smoothed past performances. If L is zero, all predicted score differences are zero and all predicted score totals equal the average total score of past matches. L between one and zero shrinks predicted score difference towards zero and predicted score total towards average total score. Based on more than 3000 games contested in rugby union (Zurich/Guinness Premiership and Super 12/14) and soccer (English Premier League and Italian Serie A), L for score difference was more than that for score total. Thus, past performance was a better predictor of score difference than score total. It is suggested that a team focuses strategy on score difference (to win or draw) while score total is of no strategic interest, thus affecting prediction based on past data. Based on an evaluation of more than 2000 games, it was concluded that betting on score total is undesirable in contrast to score difference because of a relatively small number of possible bets and an unreliable profit.

M. A., Knight, J. D., Booth, N. W. H. and Van Rees, K. C. J. 2009. Nursery stock type, nitrogen fertilization and shoot pruning effects on the growth of juvenile hybrid poplar in Saskatchewan. Can. J. Plant Sci. 89: 289-301. Increased demand for wood from the forest products and bio-energy industries in Canada has generated interest in large-scale hybrid poplar production for the prairie-boreal transition region. Because of the harsh climate and short growing season, this region of Canada poses significant challenges for establishment and production of hybrid poplar plantations and Currently little Silviculture information specific to this region is available. Trials were established at two sites with different prior land use histories: a former alfalfa field and a mixed-grass pasture. Cutting (Ct), rooted cutting (RCt) and rooted plug (RPg) nursery stock of hybrid poplar [P. deltoides x (P. laurifolia x P. nigra) var. Walker] were established with two fertilization rates (0 and 100 kg N ha(-1)) and pruned and unpruned treatments. Despite the alfalfa site having higher Mounts of available N than the pasture site and tree growth being superior at the alfalfa site, foliar N concentrations indicated an N deficiency at the alfalfa site in 2003. The difference in growth between sites was attributed to a higher degree of weed competition at the pasture site. Survival of saplings was affected by the nursery stocks. The presence of roots on the initial stock was key to early survival with approximately 92% of rooted stocks surviving over winter the first year of planting, and only 41% of unrooted cuttings surviving the same period. The short growing seasons (115 to 127 frost-free days) provided enough time for RCt to recover from pruning and produce stein volumes larger than unpruned trees. For reasons unknown, RPg did not fully recover from pruning and stein volumes in 2003 and 2004 were lower than unpruned trees. Although expectations of rates of growth of hybrid poplar are lower in the prairie-boreal transition region of Canada compared with regions of North America with more moderate climates, establishment of plantations can be realized with aggressive weed control and selection of rooted stock materials.

J	Egelhoff, W; Frese, E				Egelhoff, William; Frese, Erich			Understanding managers' preferences for internal markets versus business planning: A comparative study of German and U. S. managers	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internal markets; Business planning; Manager preferences; Germany; United States	UNITED-STATES; ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGY; CULTURE; VALUES	Internal markets and centralized business planning are alternative organizational designs for coordinating the economic activities within a firm. While some preliminary theory about when to use each exists in the literature, little is known about how managers understand and decide when to use one or the other. The study develops and tests in samples of German and U. S. managers a preliminary theory about factors that influence the preferences of managers for internal markets or planning as alternative modes of coordination. Managers' preferences are influenced by key constructs of internal markets and planning theory (the perceived limits of planning, speed and efficiency of markets, motivation potential of markets), but also by differences in their institutional contexts (national government and business context, company culture, and recent company experience with planning and internal markets).

J	Choi, SH; Bae, SM				Choi, S. H.; Bae, S. M.			Strategic information systems selection with incomplete preferences: a case of a Korean electronics company	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						information systems; interactive procedure; multiple attribute group decision making; incomplete preference	PROJECT SELECTION; MANUFACTURING FIRMS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; DECISION-MODEL; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SUPPORT; IMPACT; TECHNOLOGY	This paper presents an interactive procedure with incomplete information for supporting corporate strategic information systems planning (SISP), which is based on a prescriptive group decision-making method showing how to aggregate experts' incomplete preference judgments. The system, named CoSIS, is suggested on the competency leverage concept for selecting technical or organizational enablers to attain organizational business objectives. We put the competencies between the objectives and enablers, measure the importance rates of competencies on the objectives, and derive target enablers for the company. The importance of a competency is calculated using the SISP experts' incomplete preference information regarding relationships of importance rates between competencies on each objective. The Web-based architecture of CoSIS makes it relatively easy for the SISP team to obtain this preference information from distributed experts. Using the system, we carry out the experiments for performance evaluation of our procedure.	[Bae, S.

J	Abebe, MA				Abebe, Michael A.			Leadership characteristics of declining firms attempting turnaround An empirical examination	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Turnarounds; Chief executives; Strategic change; Business failures; United States of America	MANAGEMENT TEAM CHARACTERISTICS; TOP-MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIC CHANGE; UPPER ECHELONS; MANAGERIAL CHARACTERISTICS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS; CEO DUALITY; HETEROGENEITY; RETRENCHMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between chief executive officer characteristics and corporate turnaround performance of declining firms attempting turnaround. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 60 US manufacturing firms that experience severe performance decline and turnaround from 1985 to 2000 are selected from a population of declining manufacturing firms in the COMPUSTAT database. Data on leadership characteristics are collected and analyzed using ordinary least square regression analysis and ANOVA. Findings - The general findings of the study provide empirical support for the upper echelons theory that emphasizes leadership characteristics as predictors of organizational outcomes. More specifically, the findings suggest the strong and adverse influence of long executive tenure on corporate turnaround performance. The findings also indicate that executives with output-related functional background positively influence corporate turnaround performance in declining firms attempting turnaround. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this paper have important implications for corporate governance issues in declining firms attempting turnaround. In addition, the findings also lend further empirical support for the role of strategic leadership in shaping organizational outcomes especially under declining environmental conditions. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the turnaround literature by providing empirical evidence on the role of strategic leadership in formulating and implementing turnaround strategies in declining firms.

The paper presents such an integrated, system (MIS/DES) and draw attention to the essential role of simulation based strategic quality goal-directed decision-making within it. With proposed approach it is possible to converge, or focus, comprehensive but static MIS knowledge in dynamic simulation models and to fully utilize prediction power of simulation for effective and integrated quality goal-directed strategic decision making. Importance of modeling in field of control, equality of knowledge and models, dynamic nature and complexity of models and real systems from viewpoint of modern cybernetic science are also presented in the paper. The final goal is a purposeful decision-making simulation system that guides in the right direction strategically focused management action promising implementation of strategic plans and achievement of related quality goals. In its experimental section the paper describes a quality goals model designed for concrete environment. Overall model structure, components structure, components relations, mathematical models, and other elements of modeling approach are also given in this section. Finally, an example of successfully designed simulation solution is given. The approach presented in the paper gives verbal and mathematical problem description, builds ontology of quality goals problem domain, uses Extended Petri Nets as modeling tools in order to obtain faithful model which easily can be replicated in object oriented class and object hierarchy.

J	Butler, MJR; Sweeney, M; Crundwell, D				Butler, Michael J. R.; Sweeney, Mike; Crundwell, David			Facility closure management: the case of Vauxhall Motors Luton	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Operations management; Automotive industry; Productive capacity; Downsizing; United Kingdom	OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; ISSUES	Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to present the findings of a study of factory closure management. It details the sequence and the results of the key strategic manufacturing management decisions made from the time of the announcement of the plant closure to the cessation of operations. The paper also includes an analysis of the human resource management (HRM) actions taken during this same time period and their consequences upon all those involved in the closure management process. Design/methodology/approach - The case study methodology consisted of two initial site visits to monitor closure management effectiveness (adherence to plan and the types and frequency of closure management communications). During these visits, documentary evidence of the impact of the closure decision upon production performance was also collected (manufacturing output and quality performance data). Following plant closure, interviews were held with senior business, production and HRM managers and production personnel. A total of 12 interviews were carried out. Findings - The case study findings have informed the development of a conceptual model of facility closure management. Information obtained from the interviews suggests that the facility closure management process consists of five key management activities. The unexpected announcement of a factory closure can cause behavioural changes similar to those of bereavement, particularly by those employees who are its survivors. In addition, similar reactions to the closure announcement may be displayed by those who choose to remain employed by the factory owner throughout the phased closure of the plant. Originality/value - Facility closure management is an insufficiently researched strategic operations management activity. This paper details a recommended procedure for its management. A conceptual model has also been developed to illustrate the links between the key facility closure management tasks and the range of employee changes of behaviour that can be induced by their execution.

J	Caudle, SL				Caudle, Sharon L.			National Security Strategies: Security from What, for Whom, and by What Means	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						homeland security; national security; national strategies; strategic management		This article argues that a fundamental change is taking place in how countries view, approach, and implement strategies to protect their 'national security.' In the past, strategies underlying national security narrowly focused on threats that could be addressed by military and/or diplomatic means. Now, however, 'national security' is viewed in a much broader context, with the focus on preserving that which makes a country unique, and that includes the intangibles of its culture as well as what physically lies within its borders. The result is that countries are revising existing national security strategies (including those covering homeland security or domestic security) or crafting entirely new ones to address this much broader view of that which is to be protected. Drawing on recent literature and documents addressing diverse national security strategies, this article discusses the following areas: (1) the definition of national security, (2) the purpose of a national security strategy, (3) how a national security strategy is evaluated, and (4) implications for The National Security Strategy of the United States and The National Strategy for Homeland Security as a new Administration governs.

J	Chou, PB; Passerini, K				Chou, P. Ben; Passerini, Katia			Intellectual property rights and knowledge sharing across countries	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Game theory; Intellectual property; Knowledge sharing; Public interest		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to integrate the empirical and game theoretical approaches to address the strategic interactions among countries in choosing their optimal levels of intellectual property rights (IPRs), and to identify how these countries can reach an efficient and equitable equilibrium. Design/methodology/approach - Because countries' decisions on which IPR standards and protections to implement are interrelated, the authors apply game theory to characterize the scenarios before and after the 1994 Agreement on Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) involving developed and developing countries. Findings - The model shows that the pre-TRIPS equilibrium is comprised of high-income (H-I) developed countries which choose a strong IPR protection while the middle-income (M-I) and low-income (L-I) developing countries choose a weak IPR standard. For countries to move from such an equilibrium to the uniformly strong IPR regime under TRIPS, it is necessary for the H-I countries to compensate L-I and M-I countries that do not have the sufficient conditions to attract knowledge/technology transfer This compensation covers IPR protection implementation costs and increased royalties for patents. Research limitations/implications - The model proposed in this study is not complex. In reality, the payoff functions can have more variables and parameters, which, however, may also complicate the model and lower its generalizability, Originality/value - The study explains that it is difficult for countries to reach an efficient and equitable equilibrium without the subsidies and side-payments from the developed countries to the developing countries. It builds an important bridge between the game theoretical approach and the empirical studies of TRIPS, which can be further enriched and tested. It acknowledges that it is more likely for stronger IPR standards (as in TRIPS) to be implemented than an open source approach.	[Chou, P.

We motivate this so-called VL control measure by giving an interpretation in terms of allocating resources optimally to the nodes in order to maximise some search probability. We determine the VL control measure for various classes of networks. Furthermore, we provide two game theoretic interpretations of this measure. First it turns out that the VL control measure is a particular proper Shapley value of the associated cooperative network game. Secondly, we relate the measure to optimal strategies in an associated matrix search game. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This research introduces a strategic framework of key account performance that integrates theory from relationship marketing, key account management, and customer equity. Using the three drivers of customer equity value equity, brand equity, and relationship equity - the framework captures both the relational outcomes (relationship commitment and trust) and financial performance outcomes (profitability and share of spend) of strategic decisions made in key account programs. Implications and future research are then discussed.

J	Khamkanya, T; Sloan, B				Khamkanya, Thadsin; Sloan, Brian			FLEXIBLE WORKING IN SCOTTISH LOCAL AUTHORITY PROPERTY: MOVING ON TO THE HIGHEST FLEXIBILITY LEVEL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flexible Working; Non-territorial Working Environment; Scottish Local Authority; Property		Flexible working has emerged as a modern concept for managing office resources more effectively, efficiently, and economically. The highest level of flexible working environment, a non-territorial working environment, can provide the best opportunity to an organisation managing its office area more effectively. Moreover, staff can work in the most suitable place and time. However, in the context of public offices like Scottish Local Authorities, the most flexible working concept is not particularly welcomed at present. Cultural change, inadequate support services, including information and communication technology, working schemes, and alternative working policies are the main barriers. To overcome these barriers, the Authorities need to strategically provide adequate support to staff. Moreover, promoting a good perception towards flexible working culture at appropriate levels within an organisation could be the right strategy for preventing cultural change problems.

J	Khanduja, D; Singla, V; Singh, R				Khanduja, Dinesh; Singla, Vineet; Singh, Rajdeep			Entrepreneurial ambience of engineering education in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						academic business incubator; business incubation; engineering education; entrepreneurship; entrepreneurial engineer; quality; technopreneurship; SSI; small-scale industry		Education is a social process and the form of education is a product of society-education dialectics. In this context, quality of education assumes an added importance and becomes the primary concern of all the stakeholders in education. In current market turbulence, a focus on entrepreneurship has a special strategic significance for engineering education as it reflects a growing perception that new graduates need the technical and behavioural attributes of an entrepreneur for a successful professional life. The previous paradigm of a 'science-based conceptual engineer' has given way to a 'science-based entrepreneurial engineer'. In response to this inevitable change, educationists must do rethinking on the way the students are educated by infusing creative thinking and innovation in their educational curriculum. With this change in the mindset and the relative knowledge that entrepreneurs bring forth, in many institutes some courses on entrepreneurship and innovation are being developed and offered to cater to the increasing demand. As engineering institutes meet this demand through a heightened entrepreneurial outlook, the paper discusses their strategic role in generating entrepreneurship which is a potential source of employment generation in a developing nation like India.

J	Lanskoronskis, M; Ramoniene, L; Barsauskas, P				Lanskoronskis, Marius; Ramoniene, Lineta; Barsauskas, Petras			Innovative research management as a tool for institutional competitiveness	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Universities; Competitive strategy; Research organizations; Strategic alliances; Europe	UNIVERSITY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the influence of university research management on institutional competitiveness, international visibility and fund-raising. Design/methodology/approach - The research findings are based on analysis of leading universities in six European countries: Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Czech Republic, Finland, The Netherlands and Germany. For the analysis, two criteria are chosen - institutional way of work and core partnerships. This summary is compared with theoretical background for innovative research management and the conclusion is made that these two issues are much in line. Findings - The findings suggest that majority, of leading universities in the analysed countries actively realize principles of the Triple Helix and Mode 2 Science. This is realized through innovative managerial structures and strong orientation to practical implication of research production. The findings summarise the main forms of institutional work and discuss core partnering issues. Research limitations/implications - A limited number of universities are chosen and data are mainly collected from secondary sources such as institutional documents, web site information or corporate presentations. This is why it is difficult to evaluate how some formal declarations are realized in practice. Practical implications - The findings may serve as a framework for considering changes in university research management structure or seeking increase of institutional competitiveness, international visibility and effective fund-raising Originality/value - The paper compares theoretic discussions on innovative research management through cooperation and specialization with existing practices in leading universities and provides summary and examples universities are taking to increase institutional effectiveness.

J	Lawlor, J; Kavanagh, D				Lawlor, Jim; Kavanagh, Donncha			The relationship between new technologies and strategic activities	TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT			English	Article						new technology; strategy; stent industry	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; CORE COMPETENCE; VIEW	While 'new technology' and 'strategy' are pervasive and foundational to this journal's inquiry, each term is filled with ambiguity. This paper seeks to extend our understanding by developing a model relating technology to strategy. The model is a two-by-two frame based on the distinction between 'planned' vs 'emergent' strategy and 'latent' vs 'sensible' technology. The frame generates four distinct domains that we label 'development', 'capitalisation', 'creation' and 'cultivation'. The paper then considers the 'creation'quadrant through a case history of the stent industry. This case indicates that (a) new technologies lack the 'revolutionary' characteristic with which they are normally associated; (b) that the courthouse rather than the marketplace is an important if not primary domain where new technology firms compete; and (c) that new technology firms are much more aggressive when interacting with other new technology firms than they are with firms from the existing industry.

J	Lin, LH				Lin, Liang-Hung			Mergers and acquisitions, alliances and technology development: an empirical study of the global auto industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mergers and Acquisitions; M&As; technological alliances; Total Quality Management; TQM; internal innovation	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; PROCESS MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; PRODUCT INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; QUALITY; IMPROVEMENT; CREATIVITY	Corporate-level strategy, which often includes Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) and technological alliances, ultimately wishes to maximise corporate profits and innovativeness. This Study examines how M&As and alliances affect internal technological innovation in the global auto industry. Hierarchical regression analyses reveal that M&As intensity is negatively related to innovation, whereas technological alliance is not associated significantly with internal innovation. However, Total Quality Management (TQM) implementation, such as the commitment of continuous improving philosophy, facilitates firms' internal innovation to a great extent. This Study also tries to provide deeper explanations of these findings.

J	Partidario, MR; Vicente, G; Lobos, V				Partidario, M. R.; Vicente, G.; Lobos, V.			Strategic Environmental Assessment of the National Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Portugal	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas		Critical Factors for Decision-making; Strategic options; Policy SEA	SEA	Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was used to assist the preparation of the Portuguese Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). SEA is not legally mandatory for application at policy level under the Portuguese legislation, which, like the European Directive 2001/42, only requires that an environmental assessment be conducted for plans and programmes. However the National Water Institute (INAG), the Portuguese authority mandated by the Portuguese Government to develop this integrated coastal management strategy, understanding the merits and the added-value that SEA can bring to strategic decision-making, decided that an SEA would be a useful instrument to use at this occasion. This paper reveals the development of the SEA, particularly the process, the methodology and the results. Even though previous drafts and contributes for a strategy for ICZM existed in Portugal for a few years already, the last quarter of 2008 was the key period during which a final strategy emerged. The SEA was closely developed with the strategy, each under the responsibility of a different team that, together with INAG, have managed to succeed in achieving a quite integrated outcome. The SEA proved to act as a facilitator for the integration of environmental and sustainability issues into the design and the concept of the strategy, enabled the consideration of key strategic options to fine tune the strategy, and highlighted risks and opportunities associated with the strategy, proving, in the end, to have strongly influenced the ICZM strategy.

J	Phusavat, K; Kanchana, R; Lin, BS				Phusavat, Kongkiti; Kanchana, Rapee; Lin, Binshan			Information requirements for managerial decisions in manufacturing	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Process management; Information strategy; Supplier evaluation; Operations and production management	COMPETITIVE PRIORITIES; SUPPLIER SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES; CHAIN	Purpose - The study is based on the need to improve a management process, especially the linkage between strategies, and performance measurement and analysis. This need concentrates on understanding information requirements in order to ensure high quality of managerial decisions. This study aims to develop an information-requirement baseline when considering manufacturing and supplier-selection strategies. The focus of this study is on selecting a supplier to provide transportation services for a manufacturer. Design/methodology/approach - The study collects the opinions given by eight top executives from three high-performance manufacturers in Thailand. The survey has three parts: strategic objectives for manufacturing operations, supplier-selection strategies, and possible business performance areas to be impacted. It uses a five-point scale from 1 (least importance) to 5 (extremely important). The correlation analysis was applied. Findings - There are altogether eight alignments reflecting positive interrelationships between manufacturing and supplier-selection strategies. Each alignment indicates performance information needed. For examples, top executives express the need to have information on profitability, customer relation, and quality of work life under the following circumstance - management representing a strategic criterion for supplier selection and quality reflecting a manufacturing strategy. Practical implications - The development of this baseline appears to be helpful in prioritizing the agendas of a meeting as well as time and cost for preparing management reports. The management process would be strengthened due to better information that corresponded to strategies. Originality/value - The study highlights the need to link between information requirements and strategies. This highlight enhances the research in the areas of a management process.

J	Pickard, VW; Meinrath, SD				Pickard, Victor W.; Meinrath, Sascha D.			Revitalizing the Public Airwaves: Opportunistic Unlicensed Reuse of Government Spectrum	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			English	Article								While many policy analysts have focused on the fate of the 700 MHz auctions, the digital TV transition, and the promise of white space devices, a more vast and underutilized resource has gone largely unnoticed: government spectrum. The best available data suggests that the majority of federal spectrum capacity is left unused. Strategic reuse of this spectrum could help obviate the need for significant additional reallocation while enabling a wide range of creative new uses and social benefits. Based on what little information is publicly available, it is reasonable to assume that the repurposing of government spectrum would go far in addressing a number of access-related communication problems. Repurposing currently unused U.S. government-controlled spectrum for opportunistic unlicensed use would benefit society by dramatically expanding access to high-speed broadband and increasing the pace of wireless technology innovation. This approach to spectrum policy presents a "third option" for reform, drawing from both the commons and property rights models of spectrum management.

Methods: In 3 federally qualified health centers and 1 free clinic, 19 primary care clinicians profiled patient and visit characteristics and quality of care measures for 181 consecutive visits by adult type 2 diabetic patients. Open-ended questions assessed patient and clinician perception of barriers to diabetes care and patient report of enabling factors. A multidisciplinary team identified themes from open-ended responses. Logistic regression analyses assessed the association of the identified barriers/enablers with 2 measures of quality care: glycosylated hemoglobin and prophylactic aspirin use. Results: Ranked barriers noted by patients included adherence (40%), financial/insurance (23%), and psychosocial (13%) factors. Clinicians ranked systemic factors, including financial/insurance (32%) and cultural/psychosocial (29%) factors, as important to adherence (29%) in determining quality diabetes care. Patients reported dietary and medical adherence (37%) and family/health care worker support (17%) as helpful factors. Among 175 patients with available data, glycosylated hemoglobin levels were associated with patient report of financial/insurance factors both as a barrier when visits and medications were unaffordable and as an opportunity when free or low-cost medications and services were provided. Patients' adherence with aspirin prophylaxis was strongly associated with African American race, prior prescription of aspirin and distribution of aspirin at the practice site (p <.001). Conclusions: Patients were less likely than clinicians to-identify systemic and contextual factors contributing to poor diabetes care. From the front line's perspective, enabling patient self-management and systemic support is a target for improving diabetes care in safety net practices.

J	White, C				White, Candace			Examining a crisis communication void The role of context to mitigate issues	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public relations; Communication management; Public opinion	MANAGEMENT; NEWS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of information context in crisis communication. Previous studies have examined the effectiveness of types of message strategies used during different periods of a crisis. The crisis presented in this case is unusual in that there were no crisis communication strategies used to mitigate it. There was a void where a crisis communication strategy should have been, allowing for critique of what happens when crisis communication is not proactive and strategic. Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study of crisis response developed through participant observation and interviews with key informants, verified through quantitative content analysis of newspaper coverage. Findings - The study found that when issues reported by the media are not tempered by explanation of context from the organization, increasingly negative media frames result, therefore elevating the salience of the issues and the perceived severity of the crisis. When issues are not proactively managed, people outside the organization begin to identify with the side of the issue presented in the media. Practical implications - The study provides insights into effective crisis communication management by examining the importance of proactive communication for managing public opinion. Originality/value - The paper describes what happens when proactive communication is not used during a crisis and therefore shows what happens in the absence of effective public relations, when the crisis response is no response at all.

The significance of 24 x 365 hour service availability with accurate and secured data is the business comparative and competitive advantages. Choosing the right IT contingency planning (ITCP) for disaster recovery (DR) insures business continuity and optimizes banking investment. This research investigates the essential fundamental requirements of each banking business unit and concentrates the mapping of business criticality to DR readiness by assessing recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) to guarantee business continuity under a maximum tolerable period of disruption (MTPD). The DR strategy model proposed the optimization strategy for choosing the right pattern of disaster recovery solution for each business unit requirements with decision-making information supports.

Hydrologic and Erosion Models to Assess Land Use and Management Practices Affecting Soil Erosion	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article							HILLSLOPE EROSION; INFILTRATION; PREDICTION; RUNOFF; FLOW; SIMULATION; RANGELANDS; FROZEN	We developed a new, coupled, hydrologic-erosion model and a targeted field data-collection program to quantify hillslope soil erosion rates and sediment yield in semiarid regions. While the methodology has a wide range of actual and potential applications, we use military training activities as an example. The methodology is applied at the Yakima Training Center (YTC) in south central Washington, USA where most erosion and transport occurs during extreme events of short duration, often associated with rapid rain-induced snowmelt on frozen soil. The distributed hydrologic and soil erosion modeling system is used to simulate continuous water balance and soil thermal state throughout all seasons of the year. We estimated surface runoff and sediment yield for relatively undisturbed areas as well as from roads, firebreaks, and vehicle tracks associated with training activities at the study site. Field data were collected on over 100 hillslope profile transects across the YTC to parameterize, test, and evaluate the linked modeling system. We successfully validated the modeling system against several databases, upland sediment delivery to stream networks, and measured sediment yield from 12 sedimentation ponds within the YTC. The simulation results are superior to those from a currently used model, which help to illustrate applicability of the presented erosion prediction technology.

The Value of Information Systems to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Information and Communications Technologies as Signal and Symbol of Legitimacy and Competitiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						competitive use of IS; evaluation criteria; defining IS success; IS strategic planning; IS value; legitimacy; organizational effectiveness; small to medium-sized enterprises SMEs; social norms; social issues of IT; strategic alignment	IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT; IDENTITY; ORGANIZATIONS; IMAGE; MYTH	Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face more serious challenges to their survival than do larger firms. To succeed, SMEs must establish and maintain credibility in the marketplace to attract the resources required for survival. Most co-opt legitimacy by mimicking the cues that signal credibility to convince potential stakeholders that something stands behind their promises. This research examines the role of information and communications technology (ICT) in legitimacy-building from the perspective of both SME founders and customers. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in a variety of industries to determine whether the ICT-related legitimacy schema from the customers' perspective differs substantially from that of firm founders. Results indicate that customers compare the ICT information provided in SME's sales pitches to pre-existing ICT expectations about the nature of desirable sales transactions. We describe the relationship between violations of ICT expectations, legitimacy, and purchase decisions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

FACTOR PAYMENTS, RESOURCE-BASED BARGAINING, AND THE CREATION OF FIRM WEALTH IN TECHNOLOGY-BASED VENTURES	STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL			English	Article						technology-based ventures; resource-based theory; factor payments; stakeholder bargaining; opportunity formation and exploitation	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; USEFUL PERSPECTIVE; EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH; TRANSACTION COST; REAL OPTIONS; VIEW; PERFORMANCE; ECONOMICS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; APPROPRIATION	A central tenet of resource-based logic is that undervalued resources utilized by firms organized to exploit them will produce superior economic performance over the long run. Yet when young technology-based ventures pursuing new opportunities do not possess full property over these resources, input providers retain the right to bid up factor prices to match each resource's marginal productivity. In response to these limitations in extant resource-based logic, we apply and extend Lippman and Rumelt's full payments and bargaining perspectives and propose an alternative method by which entrepreneurs can generate firm wealth through the unique bundling of cospecialized resources. Both theoretical implications and directions for future research are discussed as well. Copyright (C) 2009 Strategic Management Society.

An agent-based infrastructure for virtual enterprises using Web-Services standards	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						multi-agent; infrastructure; Web Services; UDDI; WSDL; SOAP	MULTIAGENT; COORDINATION; ARCHITECTURE; SYSTEMS	Nowadays, most products in the market are increasing unlikely manufactured entirely within a single company. Instead, a network of manufacturing companies, usually known as a Virtual Enterprise, is involved. Each of the companies becomes a node in the network to play a role in the value-adding process in the production cycle. In other words, a Virtual Enterprise (VE) is an ad hoc organization that combines the competencies of its partners and commits its resources flexibly to respond to business opportunities. To facilitate effective collaboration, suitable information systems that can enable VE partners to communicate and share data, information and knowledge across organizational boundaries are essential. One of the major obstacles towards achieving this goal is a lack of standardized technologies to allow partnering enterprises to publicise their services and expertise as well as locating and interacting with one another in a dynamic fashion. This paper proposes a multi-agent infrastructure to manage VEs and support XML-based agents coordination using a contract net protocol and Web Services standards. Feasible agent-based architectures for partnering enterprises are also suggested and illustrated.	[Fung, Richard Y.

Trauma research in the United Arab Emirates: reality and vision	SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						injury research; road traffic accidents; strategic planning; trauma research	INJURIES; FRACTURES; MORTALITY	Introduction: Trauma is a major health problem in the United Arab Emirates, and it is the second leading cause of death. Research can help us find solutions for this problem. We evaluated the published literature on trauma from United Arab Emirates to define research areas which need improvement. Methods: A MEDLINE search for articles on trauma and injury from the United Arab Emirates covering the period 1960-2005 was performed. The content of articles was studied, classified and summarised. Results: 32 articles were found, of which 18 were published in the last six years. 18 articles were on prevention and epidemiology, ten on clinical management and four on education. The first author was affiliated to the university in 19 articles. There were no articles on pre-hospital care, experimental work, trauma systems, trauma registry or post-hospital rehabilitation. Conclusion: There is a need for a strategic plan to support research in areas like pre-hospital care, implementation of trauma systems, trauma registries and post-hospital rehabilitations to reduce the socioeconomic impact of trauma in the United Arab Emirates.

J	Gavetti, G; Levinthal, DA; Rivkin, JW				Gavetti, Giovanni; Levinthal, Daniel A.; Rivkin, Jan W.			Response to Farjoun's 'strategy making, novelty, and analogical reasoning - Commentary on Gavetti, Levinthal, and Rivkin (2005)'	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						analogical reasoning; cognition; strategy-making; fitness landscapes		In his thoughtful commentary on our 2005 paper (Gavetti, Levinthal, and Rivkin, 2005), Farjoun offers three critiques and extensions. First, he suggests our approach should have explicitly considered a constructionist logic. Second, Farjoun argues that we have neglected the full array of modes of cognition between rational choice and feed back-based adaptive learning and have therefore overstated the role of our focal mode, reasoning by analogy. Third, he highlights some of the contingencies under which the various modes of cognition he identifies are effective. In response, we address each point. We first argue that a constructionist perspective is not alien either to the role of analogical reasoning or to the particular modeling apparatus we have developed. Me then suggest that despite the richness of modes of cognition that lie between rational choice and adaptive learning, theorizing about them requires simplification and the identification of underlying categories that classify such modes, which is the approach our paper employs. Finally, we clarify; how our paper adopts the contingent logic advocated by Farjoun. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Subhan, M; Ghani, ABA				Subhan, Muhammad; Ghani, Ahmad Bashawir Abdul			ANALYZING GROWTH OPPORTUNITY OF PORT FROM THE RESOURCE-BASED PERSPECTIVE The Case of Port of Tanjung Pelepas Malaysia	GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						competitive advantage; container port; growth opportunity; Malaysia; resource-based view		Capturing growth opportunity has become a major integral activity of any port to sustain growth and competitive advantage. One of the famous strategies in leveraging sustainable growth and competitive advantage is the resource-based theory application into port strategic management, viewing resources of the port (internal and external) and its capabilities as the sources for achieving competitive advantage. In this study, we attempt to identify, exploit, and analyze growth opportunity of a Malaysian port from the perspective of the theory. We analyze the port's resources in terms of values, uniqueness, inimitability, durability, and substitutability. The result is then compared with its rival ports in the region. This study recognizes that the port has successfully identified and exploited its resources for capturing growth opportunity and competing with other ports in the region. We perceive that the port will sustain its growth and competitive advantage as a major port in the region based on its current performance and rivalry circumstances. This study signifies that the higher the level to which resource-based theory of competitive advantage is applied, the higher and longer the growth and competitive advantage will be achieved by the port.

Mergers can be used to appropriate rents on consumptive third markets, even when the trade policy of these countries reacts endogenously. Competition policy inside the bloc of the two producing countries is too permissive towards mergers and acquisitions. A policy of cross-border mergers (European champions) need not imply a conflict between regional and global welfare. In contrast, the promotion of national champions may be in the interest of individual countries, but global welfare is always adversely affected.

What factors play a role in differing implementation of new innovation strategies? A collective case study was conducted at three SBUs of an international conglomerate to investigate why the SBUs implement the same corporate innovation charter in vastly different manners, both in strategic processes and in organizing for new product development (NPD). This study's contribution to the literature is twofold. First, it develops initial insights into how three SBUs implement diverse SBU-level innovation strategies in response to the same product innovation charter. Second, it extends the findings of previous studies on NPD strategy by presenting how three SBUs reshape their structure and resource allocation, changing various dimensions of their innovation strategy while also fitting the competitive structure in their individual, non-high-tech, traditional manufacturing industries as they respond to the corporate mandate. In this study, several factors were observed to influence a firm when formulating a new product innovation strategy. First, past performance and strategic typology constrain the innovation paths available. Poor past performance limits available resources whereas the strategic typology managers use limits their ability to recognize other opportunities. Next, capacity constraints provide a catalyst in moving toward process improvements. Third, management involvement in the day-to-day implementation of change is necessary to ensure that the new processes are implemented. Finally, corporate performance metrics are quite influential in how SBUs adapt to change. This study identifies that even with the immense power corporate has over these SBUs, some still dance to their own tune, ignorant of their deviation from the corporate mandate because the metric is not sufficient to detect these deviations. This study suggests the use of multiple types of metrics to minimize the likelihood of nearsighted responses to innovation charter changes.

HOME-GROWN AND ABROAD-BRED ENTREPRENEURS IN CHINA: A STUDY OF THE INFLUENCES OF EXTERNAL CONTEXT ON ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCIES	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING CULTURE			English	Article							HONG-KONG; GUANXI; ENTERPRISES; BUSINESS	As an attempt to explore the influence of external context on entrepreneurial competencies, we conducted a comparative analysis using a sample of 16 home-grown and abroad-bred entrepreneurs in China. Through a content analysis of the critical incidents during their business development, we found that both groups demonstrated a similar set of entrepreneurial competencies, with strategic, relationship, conceptual, organizing and opportunity competencies being the most predominant types. However, the orders of relationship and organizing competencies between the two groups were different due to the different behavioural elements, attributes, skills and knowledge domains constituting them. We concluded that the context is a critical yet complex dimension of entrepreneurial competencies, as the early context from which the entrepreneurs grow up has significant impacts on the formation of some competencies, whereas the current context in which they operate their businesses will determine their uses and will shape the development of other competencies.

J	Ng, ICL; Maull, R; Godsiff, P				Ng, Irene C. L.; Maull, Roger; Godsiff, Philip			An integrated approach towards revenue management	JOURNAL OF REVENUE AND PRICING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity; advanced demand; value; segmentation; sensitivity; forecasting		This paper argues that advanced demand exhibit three characteristics - that of being probabilistic, stochastic and deterministic. Deterministic demand results in revenue management practices being cross-functional. The paper proposes a new revenue management system that integrates four decision sets of the firm: the value set, the segmentation set, the sensitivity set and the forecasting set. An integrated revenue management system also links the concept of capacity to the attributes promised by the firm to the customer. The paper then proposes that service firms that do not sell 'unitised' services such as seats or rooms have to define and capture its amorphous capacity and through capacity limitation, create advanced demand and practice strategic revenue management.

J	Tarzijan, J; Brahm, F; Daiber, LF				Tarzijan, Jorge; Brahm, Francisco; Daiber, Luis Felipe			Entrepreneurial profitability and persistence: Chile versus the USA	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						determinants of profitability; persistence; sustainability; strategic management	INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE; PROFITS; CAPABILITIES; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; MARKETS	This article empirically evaluates the main determinants of business performance, focusing on the emergence and sustainability of profits for an emerging economy such as Chile. Furthermore, the paper compares the results obtained with Chilean data to those for the U.S.A. This comparison is interesting because of the recent emergence of some literature that relates geographic location to performance. The results show that the industry effect is more important in Chile than in the U.S.A., that the persistence of rents in Chile is explained more evenly for reasons associated to business-, industry- and corporate-specific effects, and that the path to lower rents is more difficult to revert in Chile than in the U.S.A.

Exploring Relationship between Information Systems Strategic Orientation and Small Business Performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						business performance; e-business in SMEs; organizational impact; strategic alignment; Strategic information systems; strategic planning; strategic orientation; Web presence		Businesses invest in developing information systems resources to gain competitive advantages. Literature has demonstrated the requirement of strategic alignment in converting these competitive advantages into sustained superior business performance. The knowledge of information systems strategic orientation and its relationship with business performance will enable these businesses to fine tune their strategic information systems applications portfolio in achieving required strategic alignment. This study focuses on the information systems strategic orientation of small businesses and investigates its relationship with their perceived business performance. The organizational impact of adoption of the initial stages of electronic business development is also examined. The data were collected from small businesses on nine strategy areas, through mail survey. The result reveals three multifaceted dimensions of information systems strategic orientation. These dimensions of strategic orientation have significantly influenced their business performance. For the adopters of Web presence, all these three dimensions remain significant in explaining their business performance.

J	Callaway, SK; Hamilton, RD				Callaway, Stephen; Hamilton, Robert, III			MANAGING DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY - INTERNET BANKING VENTURES FOR TRADITIONAL BANKS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internet banking; disruptive technology; strategic management	ORGANIZATIONS; DISCONTINUITIES; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; ADOPTION; STRATEGY; FAILURE; MODEL	This study examines the perception of the nature of technological change for Internet Banking by proposing and testing a model of the strategic management of online banking by traditional banks. Specifically, this empirical study uses a stratified sample of the FDIC database to address how perception of the technology and the environmental context (knowledge of cause-effect relations and crystallized outcome standards) impact internal and external constituency relationships (including social norms, staffing, and technology) and therefore the type of strategic control systems employed (input, output, and behavioral control systems). From a survey of 103 banking unit managers (both Internet and traditional branches) from 65 different banks, the study revealed that Internet banking showed a greater connection to external norms and values and a reduced connection to internal (corporate) technology compared to traditional banking. Further, degree and speed of disruptiveness had the opposite effect on crystallized standards, while both were associated with a greater utilization of input control systems. Clearly, uncertainty and rapidness of technological change have different impacts upon environmental perception and strategic management decisions. The study has important implications for bank managers pursuing the development of Internet Banking.

The approach integrates and evaluates the various e-readiness assessment issues, over its well-structured domains: strategy, technology, organization, people, and environment. The case studies considered concern three Saudi organizations: a government organization, a bank, and a private sector company. The results obtained provide e-readiness indicators that illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each organization with regard to e-readiness strategic development issues, information and communication technology (ICT) issues, management and organization issues, people issues, and environment issues within which the organization operates. The work shows how the approach can be practically used, and it also provides practical results that direct the organizations concerned toward enhancing their e-readiness in response to the current trend of globalizing e-business.

J	Albors-Garrigos, J; Hervas-Oliver, JL; Marquez, PB				Albors-Garrigos, Jose; Hervas-Oliver, Jose Luis; Marquez, Patricia Beatriz			When technology innovation is not enough, new competitive paradigms, revisiting the Spanish ceramic tile sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						clusters; ceramics; innovation; strategic management; technology; value chain governance; case study	ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE; PERFORMANCE; CHOICE; STRATEGY; OPTION; VIEW	As a result of the development of new industrialised countries such as China and other Southern Asian economies. traditional competitive paradigms based in advantages related to costs and quality efficiencies are no longer sufficient. These previous classical paradigms related competitiveness between the degree of technology innovation and the employment of cluster's resources by the incumbents of the industry. However, the combination of adequate knowledge and relationship management with marketing efforts brings forth a reconsideration of the present competitive models which go beyond those analyses from the point of view of clusters. The objective of this investigation will analyse the governance structure of the territorial value chain in the Spanish ceramic tile cluster, through the understanding of previous and current roles of several industries involved in the value creation system. By way of, both case study and quantitative methodology approach, the authors will explore the paradigm change where traditional chain actors are losing their grip on their contribution to the territorial value creation system as new actors appear with a more stable status.

J	Cakmakci, UM; Karabati, S				Cakmakci, Ufuk M.; Karabati, Serdar			Exploring managerial values in the changing Turkish business context	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Turkey; Management culture; Innovation; Value analysis; Business environment	TURKEY; INDIVIDUALISM; COLLECTIVISM; ORGANIZATION; CULTURES; BUREAUCRACY; COUNTRIES; YOUTH	Purpose - The aim of this paper is to explore differences in managerial values in Turkey by relating them to the changing business context. Design/methodology/approach - The research delineates individual value differences between upper-level managers and a group of MBA students who were approached through a questionnaire and in- depth interviews. Findings - The basic findings support the view that workplace socialisation may affect individual values and practices. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this paper is its exploratory nature based on the small sample size of research. Practical implications - In the context of internationalization and rising competition within the economic space, change should be high on the agenda of the Turkish private sector in adapting to the shifts in business environment. This should incorporate professional training as well as strategic HR projects aiming to transform the existing structures biased toward paternalism. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the existing management literature by identifying critical value dilemmas facing Turkish businesses in today's turbulent and internationalized business environment.

Optimizing Material Hoisting Operations and Storage Cells in Single Multi-storey Tower Block Construction by Genetic Algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Genetic Algorithms; Multi-storey Site Layout; Storage Cells		During construction, materials have to be stored properly and transported within a site area or even different storeys in a high-rise structure. The total costs for storage and transportation are prime concerns. Optimizing material storage locations so as to pay the least transportation costs induced during the project period is a typical construction management problem. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to optimize the vertical hoisting and storage layout for a high-rise multi-storey tower building in confined sites is studied. Costs include the storage and distribution costs which are calculated in terms of vertical transportation, horizontal movements and then vertical distribution expenses. The sum of these costs is set as the objective function for optimization. Since it is a typical multiple-level warehouse layout and distribution problem, which is NP-hard in nature, an effective assignment system with GA approach is applied. An example of 10 types of materials to be stored and distributed in a 30-storey building is used as a numerical example to illustrate the model development. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of applying the GA in minimizing the total transportation costs that verify the practical application of the proposed approach.	[Fung, Ivan W.

G.; Kristensen, Tore; Hingley, Martin; Lindgreen, Adam			Horizontal alliances amongst small retailers in Brazil	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						horizontal management; small enterprises; retailers; strategic alliances; Brazil	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; SMALL BUSINESS; COOPERATION; MANAGEMENT; FIRMS	Purpose - Application of the horizontal alliance paradigm has particularly relevance to small retailers. It is a powerful mechanism for independents and non-integrated chain retailers to develop competitive advantage, maintaining and improving their performance. The purpose of this article is to analyse the theory of alliance in the context of the retail sector. Design/methodology/approach - Both quantitative and qualitative research was carried out with horizontal retail alliances in Brazil. Findings - Focusing on the alliances among independents and non-integrated chain retailers, our discussion covers specifically the following issues: the reasons for forming a strategic alliance in retail; minimum criteria for the alliance activity amongst retailers; steps that managers must take to create a competitive retail alliance; critical core competencies to be developed on the retail alliance; types of retail alliances; and, finally, forms of strategic retail alliances and stages/steps to develop a retail alliance over time. Research limitations/implications - The study considers horizontal alliances in a Brazilian retail context, which is in some ways unique, however, key principles and findings are very much transferable. Practical implications/implications - The study is of value not only to researchers of retail horizontal alliances, but offers retail practitioners specific experience and guidance. Originality/value - It was identified from the literature that there have been relatively few theoretical and practical studies available that analyse the relationship between the outlined themes concerned with alliances and small retailers. The discussion in our paper provides useful information and new insights to both academics and practitioners.

J	Gillies, A; Maliapen, M				Gillies, Alan; Maliapen, Mahendran			Using healthcare system archetypes to help hospitals become learning organisations	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health services; Simulation; Decision support systems; Australia; Learning organizations		Purpose - Internationally, change in healthcare is often a result of a knee jerk reaction to high-profile adverse events. Alternatively, change is driven by a reductionist set of targets and indicators, which do not reflect the complexity of hospitals. This paper posits that hospitals would benefit from promoting organisational learning, and that system archetypes offer a mechanism for achieving this. It seeks to examine the application of healthcare system archetypes in an Australian hospital. Design/methodology/approach - Archetypes do not describe any one problem specifically. They describe families of problems generically. Their value comes from the insights they offer into the dynamic interaction of complex systems. As part of a suite of tools, they are extremely valuable in developing broad understandings about the hospital and its environment. Findings - Diagnostically, archetypes helped the hospital managers recognize patterns of behaviour that are already present in their organizations. They served as the means for gaining insight into the underlying systems structures from which the archetypal behaviour emerges. The application of system archetypes to the strategic analysis of the hospital case reveals that it is possible to identify loop holes in management's strategic thinking processes and it is possible to defy these fallacies during policy implementation as illustrated by the results of the archetype simulation model. In this study, hospital executives found that policy modification helped to avoid such pitfalls and avoid potentially cost prohibitive learning had these policies been implemented in practice. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates how system archetypes were deployed within a hospital to improve organizational learning, and provides an approach that may be deployed in other large complex health care organisations.

J	Gustavsson, M				Gustavsson, Mattias			Information quality implications of planning process integration	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information systems; Quality; Strategic manufacturing; Manufacturing resource planning	SUPPLY CHAIN; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; EXPERIENCES; OPERATIONS; EDI	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of manufacturing planning and control (MPC) process integration on information quality (IQ). Design/methodology/approach - Two case studies are conducted in the aerospace industry. The paper examines the influence of internal and external, and technical and organisational integration on the IQ perceived in the MPC processes. Findings - The paper posits links between high-integration levels and low IQ deficiency levels. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical framework developed in this study is applicable to most industries. The case implications are based on the aerospace industry. For future research, a multi-industry survey study supporting the theoretical framework is suggested, explaining the adaptations needed in different environments and testing the propositions derived in this paper. Practical implications - Production, logistics and supply chain professionals' understanding of the relationships between integration and the level of IQ can be improved. Considerations about strategic development towards a required level and type of integration in order to support better IQ levels could be simplified by using the framework and results provided. Originality/value - There has been little previous research on the links between integration level and the level of IQ. In this paper, structured frameworks of both integration and IQ are used to provide insights on and describe the relationships between integration and the quality of information.

J	Hamid, J; Tenev, S				Hamid, Javed; Tenev, Stoyan			Transforming China's Banks: the IFC's experience	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA			English	Article							IMPACT	China's progress in fixing its banking system has surprised observers. Successful experiments, some of them involving foreign investors, have emerged in China to deal with the problems of the banking system. The International Finance Corporation ( IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, has played an active role in piloting some of these approaches in close cooperation with the regulator and other strategic investors. In the period 1995-2000, IFC's strategy was to work with one or two banks to help improve their governance and skills. The idea was to create some model banks which could be emulated by others and used by the regulators to introduce modern banking practices. Once the corporate governance and business practices of these banks improved, then the IFC was able to attract foreign banks to invest in these banks. These investments encouraged other foreign banks to consider taking minority stakes in the smaller banks. The success of these experiments gave confidence to the Chinese authorities to open up the big state-owned banks for foreign investment and encouraged big international banks to invest large sums of money to take minority stakes in the big banks. While progress in reform has been remarkable, the real and sustainable transformation of the Chinese banks is far from over and will be a lengthy process. Significant challenges such as improving corporate governance and credit risk management remain. Despite the significant opening of the banking system to foreign direct investment, foreign ownership in the Chinese banking system remains low by international standards. Even with existing limitations on foreign ownership, foreign strategic investors are contributing to the transformation of Chinese banks and their role remains highly relevant for the continued reform of the Chinese banking system.

Strategic use of sheep coats can improve your economic return	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th Biennial Conference of the Australian-Society-of-Animal-Production/68th Annual Conference of the New-Zealand-Society-of-Animal-Production	JUN 24-27, 2008	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Australian Soc Anim Prod, New Zealand Soc Anim Prod			WOOL	Merino wethers from a mixed bloodline flock in western New South Wales were coated for varying periods of time after shearing between August 1999 and August 2000. The coated and a similar number of uncoated control wethers from each of nine bloodlines (three fine and six superfine) were grazed together as part of a larger mob. Dyebands were placed in the fleeces of each wether before fitting of the coats and were removed before shearing when a midside sample was taken and several subjective assessments and objective measurements were made of each fleece. It was concluded that coating sheep for 6 months after shearing is as effective in improving the quality of the Merino fleece as coating for the entire 12 month period between annual shearings. Strategic coating of sheep after shearing is a viable option for wool producers to both reduce some of the management implications of coating and extend the useful life of sheep coats. Importantly, the magnitude of the net financial gain will vary according to the prevailing micron premium and premiums and discounts applied to style and vegetable matter. A software tool is described that allows producers to identify the potential financial gain in any market scenario.	[Hatcher, S.; Atkins, K. D.; Thornberry, K.

Although today's Eastern German economy is less competitive than the Western German economy, there are important exceptions to the rule. One exception is the food and beverage industry in which Eastern German companies have gained strong competitive positions. Did they reach this position by mimicking Western German blueprints, or did they go their own way? These questions are addressed in this paper by referring to a large-scale empirical study in the German brewing sector.

J	Humphreys, E; White, RJG; Smith, DJ; Godwin, DC				Humphreys, E.; White, R. J. G.; Smith, D. J.; Godwin, D. C.			Evaluation of strategies for increasing irrigation water productivity of maize in southern New South Wales using the MaizeMan model	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Triennial Conference of the Maize-Association-of-Australia	FEB, 2006	Griffith, AUSTRALIA	Maize Assoc Australia				MaizeMan is Windows-based decision support software, derived from CERES Maize and SWAGMAN Destiny, which can be used for real-time irrigation scheduling or strategic analysis. Evaluation of MaizeMan for sprinkler and furrow-irrigated maize (Pioneer 3153) showed good predictive ability for yield, biomass, runoff and soil water depletion between sowing and harvest. MaizeMan simulations using 43 years of weather data from Griffith, New South Wales, suggested that the biggest influence on yield, irrigation requirement and irrigation water productivity is seasonal weather conditions. For example, yield of October-sown 3153 irrigated frequently to avoid soil water deficit varied from about 8 to 16 t/ha, while net irrigation and net irrigation water productivity varied from 7 to 11 ML/ha and 0.8 to 1.6 t/ML, respectively. The optimum sowing window for maximising yield and irrigation water productivity is wide, from late September to mid November. Delaying sowing beyond this may result in higher yield and irrigation water productivity; however, delayed maturity would lead to problems for grain drying and harvesting in winter and increased insect pressure. The simplest management strategy for maximising yield and irrigation water productivity is irrigation scheduling tailored to soil type. Irrigation scheduling can be assisted by real-time scheduling using MaizeMan, provided soil hydraulic properties are accurately characterised. One to two irrigations can also be saved by growing shorter duration hybrids, but the tradeoff is lower yield, while irrigation water productivity is maintained. Simulated sprinkler irrigation increased yield and net irrigation water productivity by small amounts (averages of 0.5 t/ha and 0.2 t/ML, respectively) relative to well-scheduled flood irrigation, through improved soil water and aeration status and reduced deep drainage loss.

J	Kauko, T				Kauko, Tom			FROM MODELLING TOOLS TOWARDS THE MARKET ITSELF - AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Modelling; Market; Sustainability; Residential property value		Market based analyses of residential property value traditionally fall within two broad research traditions: a 'more practical' value analysis tradition and a 'more academic' market analysis tradition. While there is a steady flow of information from the latter to the former direction, until recently very little such information diffusion has occurred from the former to the latter modelling tradition. In such a learning process, the value modelling performance could serve as a guideline for what kind of market model is valid and feasible for a given dataset with certain recognisable tendencies. On the other hand, the characterisation of particular market circumstances is a key determinant of real estate sustainability. A sustainable market generates a sustainable value, which then can be used as an attractiveness indicator in a broader sense; or in the opposite case, an unsustainable market diagnoses a problem in unsustainable value.

Flexible working supported by information and communication technology, human resource, and workspace management has emerged as a modern concept for managing office resources. Workspace management models covering both activity-based working area and portfolio flexibility are developed to assist an organisation to allocate staff and working area more flexibly and efficiently. However, public organisations like Scottish Local Authorities (SLAs) are unlikely to fully adopt commercial workspace management models. Therefore, the concept of a combined resource management strategy has been introduced to assist the Authorities in considering adoption in financial/economic terms before taking-up of flexible working in practice.

Formative Coorientation Research: A Tool to Assist with Environmental Decision Making	ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Coorientation Contexts; Public Participation; Strategic Communication; Wildlife Management		A growing body of research recommends interaction between managers and stakeholders to improve natural resource management decisions. While formative stakeholder research and summative evaluations of communication efforts have been well-studied, less research has included formative evaluations comparing managers and stakeholders to inform communication efforts. This study applies the communication concept of coorientation to the case of deer management on open-space lands owned by Cornell University and develops an approach to coorientation analysis for use with small decision-making teams. Mail surveys were used to assess the level of agreement and accuracy between decision makers and residents of nearby communities. Decision makers and residents varied in the topics for which they accurately predicted each other's responses; these differences have implications for approaches to communication. This study also illustrates the utility of coorientation research to reveal areas of difference within the decision-making team, as well as with the public.

Using a sample of 76 Sino-Japanese JVs, the findings are as follows: (1) foreign parents and JV general managers evaluate JV performance using four approaches (i.e., economic, strategic, behavioral, and learning). (2) There are significant correlations among the four approaches. (3) Learning approach is found significantly different between the Japanese parent firms and JV general managers. (4) National culture has influence on JV performance.	[Lu, Lung-Tan] Fo Guang Univ, Dept Management, Yilan, Taiwan		Lu, LT (corresponding author), Fo Guang Univ, Dept Management, Yilan, Taiwan.

J	Mattsson, J				Mattsson, Jan			Strategy by Bottom-up Abstractions of the Customer Interface	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						systems of interaction; customer interface; abstracting strategy		Recently it has been suggested that marketing should reassert itself and reclaim its strategic role from the adjacent discipline of strategic management. This can be done by abstracting strategy from the customer interface by building a mental model of the key components of the customer interaction. To accomplish this undertaking, however, we need leaders, or managers, who are able to make holistic abstractions out of complex interactions. This paper has the aim to illustrate how market, or marketing, strategy empirically has been abstracted from customer interfaces by managers in six case studies by means of finding out, and building, either generic, or specific systems of different degrees of complexity. Generic systems may yield scale economy, which specific systems may not. It is suggested that more standardised systems are more strategic in nature.

J	McLaughlin, E				McLaughlin, Eugene			'Last One Out, Turn Off the "Blue Lamp"': The Geographical 'Placing' of Police Performance Management	POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article								In this article I wish to draw attention to one of the logical if unintended consequences of a performance management framework in the UK: namely plans to close traditional 'blue lamp' police stations on grounds of economy and effectiveness. Itmust be noted fromthe outset that what is truly remarkable is the lack of academic research that has been conducted on the police station; even in police circles little strategic thought seems to have been paid to the police station. The first section of this article discusses the ironies of a hyper-centralist performance management regime. In the second section, the discussion moves to the ironies associated with the shift to hyper-localist neighbourhooddriven policing. The final section addresses the politically 'wicked issue' of closing police stations-a suitable illustration of the contradictions that plague British policing. The critical point that I wish to make is that the Home Office's performance management regime has systematically disassembled the 'structures of feeling' and traditions associated with the Dixonian policing model-this includes the asset stripping of multi-functional 'blue lamp' police stations. At its most simple, the inability of performance management to encapsulate cultural meanings methodologically means that these aspects of public police work are deemed to be not just irrelevant but an obstacle to reform.

J	Ross, P				Ross, Peter			Management strategies in the Czech telecommunications sector: a comparative study of Cesky Telecom and T-Mobile	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Czech Republic; employment relations; European transition economies (ETEs); path dependency; strategic human resource management (SHRM); telecommunications	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ENTERPRISES	This article compares employment relations (ER) strategies at the incumbent fixed line Czech telecommunications company (TelCo), Cesky Telecom (CT), and the T-Mobile subsidiary, T-Mobile Czech Republic (TMCZ). It considers the extent to which the firms were able to introduce Western-style HRM practices within the context of three changing dynamics. First, the collapse of communism in the former Czechoslovakia was followed by rapid economic liberalization and privatization in the Czech Republic. Second, telecommunications sectors worldwide were subject to deregulation and the rapid diffusion of new technologies. Third, fixed line and mobile TelCos were subject to differing challenges and opportunities. The article uses path dependency, institutionalist and strategic human resource management (SHRM) related theories to assist in this analysis. It concludes that by 2005 the introduction of Western-style HRM practices into the Czech telecommunications sector appeared less constrained by former institutional and historical constraints. TMCZ's ER policies were further influenced by its parent firm's transnational strategies that sought to coordinate better its subsidiaries and create a 'global' brand. Despite the differing circumstances of the fixed line and mobile sectors, by 2005 ER practices and strategies at the two firms were to an extent converging, as CT continued to cut costs and TMCZ adjusted its strategies to better accommodate a saturated market. Given these changes the article postulates that the Czech telecommunications sector has now shifted towards a mature transformation stage, as ER strategies increasingly reflect Western-based SHRM practices and concepts.

J	Shimizu, Y; Yamazaki, Y; Wada, T				Shimizu, Yoshiaki; Yamazaki, Yoshihiro; Wada, Takeshi			Multimodal Logistics Network Design over Planning Horizon through a Hybrid Meta-Heuristic Approach	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MECHANICAL DESIGN SYSTEMS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Logistics Network Optimization; Hybrid Tabu Search; Multimodal Transport; Multi-Term Planning; Graph Algorithm		Logistics has been acknowledged increasingly as a key issue of supply chain management to improve business efficiency under global competition and diversified customer demands. This study aims at improving a quality of strategic decision making associated with dynamic natures in logistics network optimization. Especially, noticing an importance to concern with a multimodal logistics under multiterms, we have extended a previous approach termed hybrid tabu search (HybTS). The attempt intends to deploy a strategic planning more concretely so that the strategic plan can link to an operational decision making. The idea refers to a smart extension of the HybTS to solve a dynamic mixed integer programming problem. It is a two-level iterative method composed of a sophisticated tabu search for the location problem at the upper level and a graph algorithm for the route selection at the lower level. To keep efficiency while coping with the resulting extremely large-scale problem, we invented a systematic procedure to transform the original linear program at the lower-level into a minimum cost flow problem solvable by the graph algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we verified the proposed method outperformed the commercial software. The results indicate the proposed approach can make the conventional strategic decision much more practical and is promising for real world applications.

J	Singh, R				Singh, Ramendra			Relational embeddedness, tertius iungens orientation and relationship quality in emerging markets	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Networking; Channel relations; Strategic business units; India; Emerging markets		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate in an emerging market (India), the impact of relational embeddedness of dyadic business relationships on relationship quality (RQ) and the moderating impact of tertius iungens orientation (TIO) on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 75 business managers from various industries in India was surveyed, and analysis was done using moderated multiple regression analysis. Findings - The key finding of the study is that among the five different types of connection that a firm has (with competitors (C), value chain partners (V), internal (I), external (E) entities and auxiliary (A) connections), the A-connections like those with banks, MR agencies, advertising agencies and other service providers, have the most favorable impact on relationship quality with firms' customers, when its boundary personnel exhibit high TIO (bonding) towards their customer. However, the direct impact of A-connection on RQ is negative, possibly due to the negative externalities such as sharing limited common resources. Other four connections were found to be insignificant. Research limitations/implications - A major limitation of this study is sample size (75). Hence, the findings of this study may not be generalisable. Practical implications - The findings of this study suggest that higher ability to bond disparate actors in network of business firm (TIO) have a strong and favorable impact on improving the RQ with its customers in embedded relationships. Originality/value - The major contribution of the study is to explain the moderating role of TIO in the network embedded dyadic business relationships.

J	Svensson, G; Wood, G; Mathisen, BR				Svensson, Goran; Wood, Greg; Mathisen, Bror Roger			Reflexive and critical views of leadership performance in corporate accomplishment: Framework and illustration	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Leadership; Organizational performance; Management styles		Purpose - This paper intends to shed some light on the relationship between leadership performance and corporate accomplishment through the aid of complexity sciences. The objective is to describe leadership performance in corporate accomplishment using different teleological approaches. Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses the underlying criteria of the relationship between leadership performance and corporate accomplishment. Case illustration and narrative analogy are also provided. Findings - The authors believe that the discussion highlights a potential downside of leadership performance in corporate accomplishment and its precision rarely highlighted in practice and literature. Research limitations/implications - There is a reigning assumption in management practice that is based on the belief that a top-down approach of leadership performance in management and business practices is superior to the bottom-up approach. It proffers the assumed importance of strategic management issues, but neglects the knowledge, experience, competence and awareness inherent among employees at tactical and operational levels of business practices. It also proffers a mechanical view of employee performance and ignores the worth of the generation of ideas from subordinates in management and business practices that contribute to corporate achievements. Furthermore, it neglects the fact that it is not possible to know the future nor it is predictable. Practical implications - The paper contends that the importance of top management tends to be inflated in respect to corporate achievements in the management/leadership literature. It also contends that it should be questioned as to whether the top management of corporations are largely responsible for the corporate results on which they attempt to justify their salaries and other benefits. Furthermore, the paper contends that it also should be questioned as to what extent corporate accomplishment may be derived from the performance of the top management in organizations. Originality/value - The paper strives to contribute to the ongoing discussion of leadership performance in corporate accomplishment in various ways. The principal contributions are: a set of teleological sub-processes of leadership performance and a case illustration and narrative analogies of teleological leadership performance patterns, in respect to corporate accomplishment in management and business practices. These contributions provide theoretical and managerial ideas and insights to anticipate and avoid deficient or erroneous grounds of leadership performance evaluation in corporate accomplishment.

J	Verfaillie, K; Vander Beken, T				Verfaillie, Kristof; Vander Beken, Tom			Proactive policing and the assessment of organised crime	POLICING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICE STRATEGIES & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Crime research; Policing; Strategic planning; Decision making	INTELLIGENCE	Purpose - Contemporary policing and the control of (organised) crime involve priority setting, strategic planning and the use of strategic planning tools. The purpose of this paper is to make a contribution to the fast-growing body of literature on intelligence-led policing, and explore new concepts and methods to aid the strategic decision making of actors involved in policing organised crime. Design/methodology/approach - This paper argues that priority setting and strategic planning in the field of organised crime is inherently characterised by uncertainty. The authors examine to what extent policymakers can plan and anticipate coming organised crime threats. It is argued that, while predicting such issues is impossible, policymakers can prepare for them. It is suggested that the field of scenario studies can provide tools that can support strategic planning and the assessment of security challenges in the field of organised crime control. A scenario study is presented on the vulnerability of economic sectors to illustrate and develop this claim. Findings - Scenario studies do not predict the future of organised crime, nor do they replace information-gathering methodologies and crime intelligence applications that support concrete criminal investigations. Scenario studies are sensitising tools that force strategic planners to examine the assumptions and knowledge base on which they base their decisions. To that end, scenario studies combine the analysis of law enforcement data and scientific analysis of organised crime with analysis of issues most vital to societies, regions, cities, etc. The analytical focus shifts from targeting concrete offenders to detecting opportunities and weaknesses in structural processes that may not always be visible to police organizations, but pose significant security risks if left unattended. The scenario study that is presented on the vulnerability of economic sectors in the EU illustrates that scenario studies can amend traditional crime intelligence in this manner. Research limitations/implications - The paper is limited to a conceptual study and a concrete scenario study. Future research might shed more light on implementation/evaluation issues of scenario-based planning. Practical implications - The paper offers a conceptual and methodological framework for scenario-based strategic planning. Originality/value - The paper intends to advance the debate on organized crime assessments in light of the development towards intelligence-led policing strategies. To that end, new concepts and a different methodological framework are suggested.

J	Chen, YM; Wang, SC				Chen, Yee-Ming; Wang, Shih-Chang			An agent-based evolutionary strategic negotiation for project dynamic scheduling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						multiagent systems; dynamic scheduling; negotiation model; evolutionary computation approach	MODEL	In this paper, an agent-based approach with a mutual influencing, many-issue, one-to-many-party, strategic negotiation model is proposed. The model concentrates on solving the dynamic scheduling problem of a distributed project for non-cooperative and self-interested participants. In this model, the self-interested activity agents possess various negotiation tactics and strategies formed by their respective owner's subjective preference, aim to find the contract of schedule adjustment mutually acceptable to respective participant's acquaintance while encountering conflicts over rescheduling settlement. In order to find fitting negotiation tactics and strategies that are optimally adapted for each activity agent, an evolutionary computation approach which encodes the parameters of tactics and strategies of an agent as genes in GAs is also addressed. In the final, a prototype system with a case of a distributed project for dynamic scheduling discussed in researches is simulated to validate the feasibility and applicability of the approach, and some characteristics and future works are also addressed.

Using unique data from the Helsinki Stock Exchange, which allows individual trades to be attributed to informed and liquidity traders, this paper examines strategic behaviour and intraday patterns. We find that both informed and liquidity traders concentrate trading at the open and close. The results illustrate that a significant proportion of intraday patterns can be explained by strategic trading by informed and liquidity traders.	[Comerton-Forde, Carole; Westerholm, P.

Managing Knowledge Capabilities for Strategy Implementation Effectiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						knowledge capabilities; knowledge infrastructure; knowledge management; knowledge process; strategy effectiveness; strategy implementation; strategic management	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; SYSTEMS; MODEL	The creation and the use of knowledge have increasingly been regarded as important issues for management. A wide range of studies have investigated this topic during the past decade. Notwithstanding these contributions, very little systematic attention has been paid to the linkages between knowledge capabilities and strategy implementation. Drawing from knowledge capabilities theory and strategy implementation literature, two aspects of knowledge capabilities in an organization and their effect on strategy implementation effectiveness are investigated: knowledge process capabilities (KPC) and knowledge infrastructure capabilities (KIC). This study hypothesized that KPC affects strategy implementation effectiveness (SIE) and that KPC affects KIC. The third hypothesis proposed the effect of KIC on SIE by examining the mediating role played by KIC in linking KPC and SIE. 1,321 middle-managers were sent questionnaires via electronic mail and 162 were returned. The findings indicated the presence of a mediation effect of KIC on the relationship between KPC and SIE. This study provides guidelines for middle-managers to better understand how to develop activities of KPC and KIC for SIE. It is hoped that the results of this study will enhance our understanding of the strategic importance of knowledge in an organization, especially in the area of strategy implementation.

The analysis uses primary farm-level data collected in 2002 from a nationally representative sample of more than one thousand cocoa farmers. The study describes the status of the adoption of various chemical inputs and uses a multiplicative heteroscedastic Tobit model to identify and quantify the impact of the socioeconomic environment on the incentive to invest. The results generally show that farmer, household and village characteristics are all important in explaining the farmers' decisions. The paper concludes by outlining a number of implications for strategic targeting of farmers and locations. These should serve as entry points for a successful diffusion of efficient pest, disease and soil management programs.

J	Reid, PH; Macafee, C				Reid, Peter H.; Macafee, Caroline			The philosophy of local studies in the interactive age	JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						communities and user groups; digital access and interaction; Internet; library management; local studies librarianship; philosophy service provision		The authors examine strategic priorities for local studies libraries in the context of the interactive Web. They examine the implications for access, investigations and the needs of different users. The philosophy that has previously guided local studies is articulated as a number of maxims, taking into account also social inclusion and lifelong learning. These maxims are then re-assessed and added to in the light of issues such as the acquisition of digital media objects, mass amateurisation, profiling remote users and balancing their needs with those of local taxpayers, digital service provision and creating and maintaining an effective online presence.

J	Georgantzas, NC; Katsamakas, E				Georgantzas, Nicholas C.; Katsamakas, Evangelos			Disruptive Innovation Strategy Effects on Hard-Disk Maker Population: A System Dynamics Study	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						complex systems; disruptive innovation; feedback loops; innovation diffusion; IT industry; system dynamics; technology adoption	MODEL; FEEDBACK	To encourage premium-quality information systems (IS) research in areas where dynamic complexity rules, this article combines disruptive innovation strategy (DIS) theory with the system dynamics (SD) modeling method. It presents a computer simulation model of the hard-disk (HD) maker population overshoot and collapse dynamics. Data from the HD maker industry help calibrate the parameters of the SD model and replicate the HD makers' overshoot and collapse dynamics, which DIS allegedly caused from 1973 through 1993. SD model analysis entails articulating exactly how the structure of feedback relations among variables in a system determines its performance through time. The analysis of the HD maker population model shows that, over five distinct time phases, four different feedback loops might have been most prominent in generating the HD maker population dynamics. The article shows the benefits of using SD modeling software, such as iThink (R), and SD model analysis software, such as Digest (R). The latter helps detect exactly how changes in loop polarity and prominence determine system performance through time. Strategic scenarios computed with the model also show the relevance of using SD for IS research and practice.

J	Bonneau, L				Bonneau, Line			INTER-ORGANISATIONAL TIME: THE EXAMPLE OF QUEBEC BIOTECHNOLOGY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Biotechnology; entrainment; innovation; strategy; time		This paper introduces the notion of inter-organisational time, a dominant temporal institution at the organisational field level, and an environmental dimension absent from the extant literature. I argue that concepts such as temporal institutions and entrainment can help explain persistent dynamics in an organisational field that pace innovative activities. I use Quebec's biopharmaceutical field to illustrate a shift in inter-organisational time since the technology bubble burst. I suggest that including inter-organisational time in future analyses of organisational fields may improve understanding of the strategic context of innovation.

Drawing from 87 Taiwanese subsidiaries of MNEs we examine the influences of strategic importance of a subsidiary, resource asymmetry, and characteristics of value activities on the survival rate of a subsidiary. Results show that these factors have differential effects on the survival rates of a firm's foreign subsidiaries. Specifically, strategic importance and gains in intangible resources enhance a subsidiary's survival rate, whereas local responsiveness, gains in physical resources, and similarity and mobility of value-added activities decrease its survival rate.

Managing strategic and tactical constraints in the hi-tech industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						theory of constraints; hi-tech; permanent bottlenecks; strategic constraint; tactical constraint	SYSTEM	This paper addresses the issue of constraint management in the hi-tech industry, from the vantage point of the theory of constraints (TOC). First, we argue that the hi-tech industry faces a market constraint in operations, and resource constraints in both research and development (R&D) and marketing and sales (M&S). We then make the distinction between strategic and tactical constraints, and build a methodology to identify and manage them. While the TOC enables tactical treatment of the organization's internal resource constraints, we consider the prevailing constraint to be in the external business arena. In the short term, organizations apply the TOC methodology to increase their throughput, usually by focusing on the internal constraints. This is defined as tactical constraint management. In the long term, they navigate to position themselves in relation to the business arena's constraint. This is defined as strategic constraint management. In the paper we address the strategic dilemma of where the constraints should be in the hi-tech industry and how to reposition them there. In so doing, we bear in mind the relatively high frequency at which the hi-tech industry constraints change their position, and provide examples of disruptive change.

An ethical decision-making framework for competitor intelligence gathering	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT; CODES; BEHAVIOR; VALUES; MODEL	Competitor intelligence gathering involves the aggregation of competitive information to facilitate strategic development and a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, companies are sometimes willing to carry out questionable gathering practices to collect such information. An ethical decision making framework for competitor intelligence gathering is presented in this paper that outlines the impact of several strengthening and weakening factors on individual ethical reasoning. Dialogue is provided about the management of intelligence gathering from various viewpoints, and the implications of these managerial suggestions are discussed.

J	Seo, D; Lee, J				Seo, DongBack; Lee, JeeYeun			Gaining competitive advantage through value-shifts: A case of the South Korean wireless communications industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						value-shifts; competitive advantage; wireless communication industry; data delivery	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; CUSTOMER VALUE; FIRM	The central question of strategic management is how to create competitive advantage and sustain it. This case study addresses this issue from the perspective of the nature of dynamic markets. The concept of value-shift is proposed where the change over time in which the aspect of a product or service that once had value becomes obsolete or becomes a commodity. Essentially, it loses its differentiation from other products and services as others imitate or substitute for it. It is argued in this respect that it is critical to examine ways that organizations can manipulate value-shifts to gain advantage, including delaying and riding a value-shift. These concepts and dynamics are reported in a case study of the South Korean wireless communications industry. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Asakura, Y				Asakura, Y.			Requirements for transport network flow models used in reliability analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES			English	Article						transport network reliability; travel behaviour; user equilibrium		The network reliability of transport systems has been intensively studied in the last two decades. When we discuss network reliability models, the following four categories of topics can be identified: routing and scheduling under uncertain conditions; flow models for degraded and congested networks; evaluation and measurement of reliability; network design and management. Of these, transport network flow models are essential for evaluating network reliability with traffic congestion. In this paper, we discuss the requirements of transport network flow models that are used for network reliability analysis. The network flow models developed for an ordinary network state would be modified and applied to a recovery state of a network. The network flow model should have the characteristics of explicit link capacity constraints, decreasing demand owing to traffic congestion and uncertainty of travellers' choice behaviour. A numerical example of a network flow model is then shown using actual road network data.

Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), AIDS Project Los Angeles, in collaboration with San Francisco State University's Cesar E. Chavez Institute, conducted full-day site visits and qualitative interviews in 2005 with mid-level management staff of CDC-funded community-based organizations delivering HIV prevention services to Latino communities in the western region of the United States. We found that agencies we visited (1) had not yet adapted the evidence-based interventions they were using at the time of our visit and (2) requested technical assistance and training in the areas of program development, evaluation, group facilitation techniques, consumer recruitment, client retention, intervention adaptation, and materials development. Findings from this needs assessment were used to inform our seven-pronged approach to delivering capacity-building assistance entitled "Accion Mutua" (Shared Action). The approach emphasizes strategic partnerships, stakeholder involvement, organizational self-assessment, culturally appropriate materials development, interactive training, tailored onsite technical assistance, and professional networking opportunities. This article describes our approach in detail, the assessment process we used to develop it, and its implications for capacity-building practice.

J	Basu, PK				Basu, Parikshit			Critical evaluation of growth strategies: India and China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Economic growth; Economic doctrines; Economic cooperation; Strategic choices; China; India		Purpose - This paper aims to attempt to compare the development strategies and achievements of India and China in the last 50 years and to analyse the challenges lying ahead if the trend continues. Design/methodology/approach - The paper critically evaluates the growth strategies of the two economies. Changes in approaches, achievements and failures are analysed using materials from past research and secondary data. Impacts of economic reform process and economic management capabilities have been evaluated. Critical analysis is the main approach of the paper. Findings - Based on the experiences of economic growth so far with reformed and open economies, India can learn several things from China. China has achieved better results based on investment-driven export-oriented policies that may not be sustainable in the long run. It has so far ignored the socio-political issues, which can have very serious consequences in the future. Relatively slower economic growth in India is based on stronger socio-economic foundations. Mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the two economies and rising interdependence with regional and global powers should provide a better future. Originality/value - The paper provides a comprehensive picture of strategies, outcomes and possibilities. It links past development strategies to future challenges. It may be of value to researchers and policy makers in both economies while considering future directions.

The product is composed of several sub-products, each of them, in turn, being a subject of several possible versions. The product's utility comprises both the utility of designing and creating the product's pattern example as well as the competitive utility to gain the future commercial success. The problem is to determine the income versions of designing sub-products in order to maximize the product's competitive utility subject to restrictions related to the design process. A two-level search algorithm for the problem's solution is suggested. The internal level is faced with optimizing the product's competitive utility by means of experts' information, while the external level centers on obtaining a routine feasible solution from the point of designing process.

J	Bia, M; Kalika, M				Bia, Marie; Kalika, Michel			Adopting an ICT code of conduct An empirical study of organizational factors	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication technologies; Regulation	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMPUTER ETHICS; COMPLEXITY; JUDGMENTS; ABUSE	Purpose - Following the example of Anglo-Saxon companies, French companies are increasingly establishing codes of conduct specific to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). A review of literature reveals that such codes have multiple goals, such as improving efficiency of use, IS security awareness, and ethics. This paper aims to identify organizational factors influencing the adoption and diffusion of a formal code of conduct. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was administered to 505 companies. In order to highlight the emerging nature of this practice, the study was conducted in similar conditions for two consecutive years (2002 and 2003). Findings - Results indicate that though still marginal, the adoption of ICT codes of conduct concerns an increasing number of companies. This practice is related to the degree of standardization, technological context (the degree of virtualization and the strategic importance placed on ICT by the management) and size of the organization. However, the adoption of ICT codes of conduct is not associated with specific industry sectors and nationalities. Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted in France and a generalization of the results to other countries may be questionable. Originality/value - The paper deals with a topic that has received little attention to date. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: a previously unperformed review of research involving ICT codes of conduct, and empirical results describing the organizational factors of an ICT code of conduct diffusion. It allows a better understanding of this emerging IS management practice.

J	Edmondson, VC; Munchus, G				Edmondson, Vickie Cox; Munchus, George			Managing the unwanted truth: a framework for dissent strategy	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						employee behaviour; corporate communications; strategic management; organizational change; decision making	INNOVATION; ROCKING; WORK	Purpose - Although decision makers and their superiors are obliged to be open to bad news, dissent, warnings, and problem signs, employees are often afraid to speak up. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for the study of organizational dissent strategy used during the decision-making phase of organizational change. Design/methodology/approach - After identifying the components of the frame work, it is illustrated by examining two distinct and challenging dissent experiences. Propositions are set forth for further research. Findings - It is argued that level of trust and sense of urgency will impel employees to voice opposition using four dissent strategies: organizational silence, organizational rumbling, organizational communication, and/or organizational blasting. Originality/value - The paper is of value by showing that decision makers should be better equipped to identify and manage dissent strategies before they cause harm within their organizations.

Needs for applied climate education in agriculture	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						applied climate needs; climate applications and education; cropping; graziers; ranchers	PERENNIAL PASTURE ZONE; DECISION-SUPPORT; AUSTRALIAN RAINFALL; EAST AUSTRALIA; METEOROLOGY; VARIABILITY; INFORMATION; FARMERS; AGROMETEOROLOGY; 21ST-CENTURY	This paper reports on a purposive survey study which aimed to identify needs for the development, delivery and evaluation of applied climate education for targeted groups, to improve knowledge and skills to better manage under variable climatic conditions. The survey sample consisted of 80 producers and other industry stakeholders in Australia ( including representatives from consulting, agricultural extension and agricultural education sectors), with a 58% response rate to the survey. The survey included an assessment of (i) knowledge levels of the Southern Oscillation Index and sea surface temperatures, and (ii) skill and ability in interpreting weather and climate parameters. Results showed that despite many of the respondents having more than 20 years experience in their industry, the only formal climate education or training undertaken by most was a 1-day workshop. Over 80% of the applied climate skills listed in the survey were regarded by respondents as essential or important, but only 42% of educators, 30% of consultants and 28% of producers rated themselves as competent in applying such skills. Essential skills were deemed as those that would enable respondents or their clients to be better prepared for the next extended wet or dry meteorological event, and improved capability in identifying and capitalising on key decision points from climate information and a seasonal climate outlook. The complex issue of forecast accuracy is a confounding obstacle for many in the application of climate information and forecasts in management. Addressing this problem by describing forecast 'limitations and skill' can help to overcome this problem. The survey also highlighted specific climatic tactical and strategic information collated from grazing, cropping and agribusiness enterprises, and showed the value of such information from a users perspective.

Flexibility of Suckler Cattle Farms in the Face of Uncertainty within the Beef Industry: A Proposed Definition and an Illustration	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION			English	Article						Farming systems adaptation; Farm flexibility; Uncertainty; Livestock farmers; Suckler cattle farms; Charolais area		The aim of this study, carried out in association with beef cattle producers, was to explore the capacity of farms to adapt, from a techno-conomic point of view, to both structural changes in consumer demand for beef products and market disruptions (sudden drop in beef consumption due partly to media coverage of bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE] and foot-and-mouth disease in the winter 2000/2001). The aim is to help farmers and advisors to find solutions to fit farmers' management choices with their strategic objectives. The flexibility concept was adopted in order to examine how farms reacted to the winter 2000/2001 crisis, and was based on several technical, economic and sociological surveys. A series of variables was proposed and several hypotheses were formulated regarding their impact on farm flexibility. Four types of farm strategy were identified using different combinations of the degree of importance of these variables, with technical, economic and marketing flexibilities specific to each type. The results revealed the different combinations of flexibility-types possible (technical, economic, marketing) and explain why cattle farmers reacted as they did. Analysis of farm flexibility also revealed situations where these technical, economic and marketing flexibilities were either complementary or incompatible. For traditional livestock farmers, high flexibility (technical and economic) allowed them to minimize the impact of the crisis on their systems. In other cases, low flexibility either resulted in inertia, or led farmers to react by seeking solutions outside the cattle farming system. Development groups should take into account these parameters when interacting with farmers. We propose a framework to qualify the use of information resources by farmers, relative to their flexibility.

J	Joseph, G; George, A				Joseph, George; George, Asha			A framework to integrate the enterprise domain ontology and organizational change application domain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational change; Semantics; Modeling	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a generalized framework that illustrates the potential for the resources, events and agents (REA) model to integrate business strategy and information systems planning. The essential point of connection, the business process, enables the REA to form a complementary platform to integrate strategic change information to support change strategies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a case study to illustrate application of the framework. Findings - The framework illustrates how the expanding ontology and semantic granularity and scalability features of the REA enterprise domain ontology, support mapping a range of change strategies structured using Venkataraman's change framework. Research limitations/implications - This paper is exploratory in nature. The method uses existing case information, but the nature of the work does not lend itself to the traditional descriptive approach. Practical implications - Integration of business strategy and information systems planning is critical for organizational success. Poor integration between change initiatives and systems poses a challenge in implementing change strategies. Conceptual models that support change initiatives provide users an effective medium to use domain knowledge to support change strategies. Originality/value - The paper integrates existing concepts in the REA model (with some modification to the process view of the REA to adapt to multiple change initiatives). To the authors' knowledge, there are no other papers that have offered a generalized framework for conceptualizing change initiatives of different levels.

J	Kelliher, F				Kelliher, Felicity			Small firm cooperative constructs: addressing industry power relationships	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Small enterprises; Co-operative organizations; Ireland; Pharmacology	ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE; SYSTEMS; IMPLEMENTATION; TECHNOLOGY; ADOPTION; DIFFUSION; BUSINESS; TRUST	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the Irish community pharmacy sector in the context of power relationship theory. Specifically, the paper analyses the relationship between dispensary software vendors and the independent community pharmacist; and explore dominant industry partners' influence on individual pharmacies in terms of technology adoption. The core objective is to ascertain whether the potential for a cooperative construct can be realised in this milieu. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive literature review precedes a full investigation and analysis of the Irish community pharmacy sector's competitive environment, in the context of the pre-mentioned power relationship theory. Findings - This research uncovered a potential alternative to the industry's existing power imbalance in the form of a cooperative construct between a team of independent community pharmacists and an employed software vendor. The purpose of this partnership was to ensure the installed software focused on the pharmacist's strategic needs rather than those of the dominant partners. The paper goes on to discuss the failure of this partnership in the context of independent pharmacist's future competitive survival. Research limitations/implications - Data collection was limited to the community pharmacy sector in the Republic of Ireland. Therefore, care should be taken in making generalisations from this study. Practical implications - In the absence of cooperative constructs, power relationship imbalances will continue to exist in this competitive environment, to the detriment of the small firm. Originality/value - Little research has been completed in the area of small business cooperative constructs as a means of competing successfully in a power relationship scenario. This paper goes some way to redressing this.

J	Langley, A; Kakabadse, N; Swailes, S				Langley, A.; Kakabadse, N.; Swailes, S.			Longitudinal textual analysis: an innovative method for analysing how realised strategies evolve	QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN ORGANIZATIONS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pharmaceuticals industry; Emergent strategy; Research	TECHNOLOGICAL DISCONTINUITIES	Purpose - This paper aims to present an innovative methodological framework developed out of primary research that will lead to new understanding about patterns in the strategic actions realised by firms within an industry. The framework is to be applied to increase understanding of how realised strategies evolved in the pharmaceutical industry and overcomes some of the limitations of other methods. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach was developed adapting techniques from text, thematic and content analysis to identify and categorise strategic actions realised by pharmaceutical firms (referred to as grand strategies). Strategic actions were not pre-selected but allowed to emerge during the data collection process from public announcements by firms in the industry's main journal, Scrip. Building upon the work of Pearce and Robinson grand strategies can be understood as the packages of strategic actions that firms had planned and/or realised in order to achieve long-term objectives. Findings - A framework of realised strategic actions and grand strategies in the pharmaceutical industry was developed with 23 mutually exclusive categories. The paper shows how the framework can be used as an analytical tool to explore patterns in strategic action and grand strategy evolution, temporal patterns in strategy development and strategic action coevolution. Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the categorisation is that it is based on material collected from two years of empirical data from Scrip in order to develop the methodological framework. The framework was applied to data collected over an 11 year period in order to explore how the strategic actions of individual firms had evolved and co-evolved. Data sources were limited to published sources. Originality/value - The qualitative approach presented here offers a level of depth that has not been achieved by methodological approaches previously used to explore and compare patterns in realised strategic actions by firms operating in the pharmaceutical industry. The innovative approach contributes to management research in two key ways: providing a methodological framework that overcomes the limitations of previous studies into strategy evolution; and providing a systematic approach to data collection and analysis that can contribute to theory building with regard to strategy evolution.

J	Lin, LH; Lu, IY				Lin, Liang-Hung; Lu, Iuan-Yuan			Process management and technological innovation: an empirical study of the information and electronic industry in Taiwan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product quality; process management; technological innovation	ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; PRODUCT INNOVATION; QUALITY; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; CAPABILITIES; IMPROVEMENT; ADOPTION; MODEL	This study examines how process management implementation and product quality affect technological innovation in Taiwan's information and electronics industry. This study also resolves inconsistencies in earlier research concerning the effects of the age and size of a firm on technological innovation. By testing the associated hypotheses after dividing technological innovation into process and product innovations, the empirical results herein indicate that a firm's implementation of process management promotes process innovation activity, and that product quality is positively correlated with product innovation. Hierarchical regression analyses reveal that the age and size of the firm affect only process innovation and not product innovation. The authors assert that successful management of technological innovation may require that product and process innovations be carefully evaluated. Different strategic choices between emphasising product versus process innovations may differently transform companies.

J	Oh, H; Kim, E				Oh, Hyunjoo; Kim, Eunjung			Strategic planning for the US textile industry in the post-quota era Achieving speed-to-market advantages with DR-CAFTA countries	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive strategy; Fashion; Retailing; Supply chain management; Textile industry; United States of America		Purpose - The paper seeks to develop strategic planning to enhance sustainable competitiveness in the US textile industry with a consideration of DR-CAFTA as an opportunity to establish responsive supply chain networks in the Western hemisphere. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis was based on literature reviews, trade data analyses, and site visits for personal interviews at textile and apparel companies in North Carolina and the Office of Textile and Apparel at the US Department of Commerce, Washington, DC. Findings - DR-CAFTA countries constitute the only remaining region that the US textile industry can use to achieve speed-to-market advantages from geographical proximity. Market analysis indicated both voids and opportunities in "fast retailing" supply chain networks. In developing time-to-market supply chain networks, it is suggested that the implementation of DR-CAFTA should focus on: streamlining the rules of origin, expanding the short-supply list, and coordinating custom procedures; financing options for DR-CAFTA countries' procurement of fabrics and other raw materials from the USA. Practical implications - Two models are proposed which can possibly be implemented by the US textile industry: a shortened supply chain for knitted sportswear and fashionable shirts that can capitalize on time-to-market; and triangular supply-chain networks among US retailers and textile companies, Asian textile manufacturers, and DR-CAFTA apparel manufacturers for fashion basics. Originality/value - This study has an implication for the US textile industry and policy makers to develop future strategic planning in the post-quota era. The suggestions will contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of the US textile industry in the intense global competition by achieving speed-to-market with DR-CAFTA countries.

J	Roemer, E				Roemer, Ellen			A typology of customer lifetime values in buyer-seller relationships	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						Customer lifetime value (CLV); buyer-seller relationships; real options; net present value; flexibility; risk		In the past, marketing researchers have proposed the use of simple net present value analyses to assess customer lifetime values (CLVs). However, simple net present values disregard two important aspects: (1) environmental risks affecting customer cash flows and (2) a firm's flexibility in reacting to these risks. Consequently, they are inappropriate for assessing CLVs in relationships, in which risks affect customer cash flows and suppliers are able to react. This paper suggests a typology of CLV models in accordance with the degree of environmental risk and the supplier's flexibility. The paper thus contributes to a more differentiated customer lifetime valuation and, consequently, to a more accurate basis for decision making in relationships. The use of real options analysis is recommended for relationships which are affected by environmental risks and in which suppliers are flexible. By applying real options analysis to customer lifetime valuation, the paper offers a new methodological approach, thus merging financial valuation methods with key marketing concepts.

J	Svensson, G; Wood, G				Svensson, Goeran; Wood, Greg			Strategic approaches of corporate codes of ethics in Australia: a framework for classification and empirical illustration	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Business ethics; Classification; Australia		Purpose - Research has so far not approached the contents of corporate code of ethics from a strategic classification point of view. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to introduce and describe a framework of classification and empirical illustration to provide insights into the strategic approaches of corporate code of ethics content within and across contextual business environments. Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes the content analysis of code prescription and the intensity of codification in the contents of 78 corporate codes of ethics in Australia. Findings - The paper finds that, generally, the studied corporate codes of ethics in Australia are of standardized and replicated strategic approaches. In particular, customized and individualized strategic approaches are far from penetrating the ethos of corporate codes of ethics content. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to Australian codes of ethics. Suggestions for further research are provided in terms of the search for best practice of customized and individualized corporate codes of ethics content across countries. Practical implications - The framework contributes to an identification of four strategic approaches of corporate codes of ethics content, namely standardized, replicated, individualized and customized. Originality/value - The principal contribution of this paper is a generic framework to identify strategic approaches of corporate codes of ethics content. The framework is derived from two generic dimensions: the context of application and the application of content. The timing of application is also a crucial generic dimension to the success or failure of codes of ethics content. Empirical illustrations based upon corporate codes of ethics in Australia's top companies underpin the topic explored.

J	Turner, BA; Pack, SM				Turner, Brian A.; Pack, Simon M.			Multidimensional Commitment of Intercollegiate Student-Athletes Its Effects on Intention to Leave and Satisfaction	JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF SPORTS AND ATHLETES IN EDUCATION			English	Article								Given the importance and relative financial investments institutions formulate regarding student-athletes, intercollegiate coaches and administrators must make strategic decisions in recruiting and retaining them. A lack of student-athlete persistence is detrimental to individual teams and athletic departments as a whole; thus, every effort needs to be made to retain these individuals. Furthermore, Riemer and Chelladurai (1998) argue that the success of an intercollegiate athletic department should be, at least to some degree, based on the satisfaction of its student-athletes. An important first step in this regard is to understand the dynamics of student-athletes' continued participation with (or intention to leave) their institution and their satisfaction. Based on Meyer and Allen's (1991) multidimensional conceptualization of commitment (i.e., affective, normative, and continuance commitment), the purpose of this study was to (a) assess student-athlete commitment, (b) apply the multidimensional conceptualization of commitment to three relevant foci (i.e., coach, institution, and team), and (c) relate these components of student-athlete commitment to the student-athletes' intention to leave their current university and satisfaction (with their coach, with their university, and with their team). In addition, differences in levels of commitment were examined based on gender, rank (i.e., upper-vs. under-classmen), and playing status on the team (i.e., starter vs. non-starter). Student-athletes from 11 team sports from a large, Division I-A, Midwestern university were selected to participate in this study (n = 190). Results of the study showed female student-athletes were significantly higher in their levels of commitment to their university and team, while male student-athletes were significantly higher in their affective commitment to their head coach. With regard to playing status, starters were significantly higher in their commitment to their coach. Commitment was significantly related to intention to leave for all three foci examined. Of the three, commitment to team explained the most variance (17.5%) in intention to leave. All three foci of commitment were also significantly related to satisfaction, with commitment to coach explaining the most variance (68.6%). Possible explanations for these findings, along with directions for future research on student-athlete commitment will be discussed.

Strengthening strategic government policies within the economy	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						russia; corporate governance; ownership; foreign investments	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE	Recent years have witnessed increasing state involvement in the Russian enterprise sector, which has been met with contradictory reactions from investors. In the current article, we discuss the development of privatisation and corporate governance in Russia in comparison to other CIS. We provide three company cases with subsequent discussion on ownership, control, and corporate governance in Russia, given the increasing state leverage in the country's industrial sector. Aimed at facilitating discussion among policy makers, investors, and academics alike, we finally offer an insight into strategic dimensions of the Russian enterprise sector by developing a matrix of strategic government policies within the Russian industry.

J	Williams, PAH				Williams, Patricia A. H.			Information Governance: A Model for Security in Medical Practice	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL FORENSICS SECURITY AND LAW			English	Article						Medical informatics computing; computer security; security measures; data security; action research	QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; MANAGEMENT	Information governance is becoming an important aspect of organisational accountability. In consideration that information is an integral asset of most organisations, the protection of this asset will increasingly rely on organisational capabilities in security. In the medical arena this information is primarily sensitive patient-based information. Previous research has shown that application of security measures is a low priority for primary care medical practice and that awareness of the risks are seriously underestimated. Consequently, information security governance will be a key issue for medical practice in the future. Information security governance is a relatively new term and there is little existing research into how to meet governance requirements. The limited research that exists describes information security governance frameworks at a strategic level. However, since medical practice is already lagging in the implementation of appropriate security, such definition may not be practical although it is obviously desirable. This paper describes an ongoing action research project undertaken in the area of medical information security, and presents a tactical approach model aimed at addressing information security governance and the protection of medical data.

Data warehousing for construction equipment management	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						data warehouse; decision support system; equipment management; multidimensional modeling		Equipment logistics, maintenance, and repair are important aspects of construction equipment management. A well-managed equipment fleet helps reduce downtime, as well as total maintenance and repair costs. With quickly growing fleets of equipment, large contractors tend to divert the maintenance and repair of equipment from equipment managers to project managers. As a result, the equipment managers shift their attention from operational-level decision-making to corporate-level.strategic decision-making regarding equipment management, which is often a challenging job with the current equipment management system. This paper presents an equipment data warehouse and a prototype decision support system (DSS). The proposed equipment data warehouse enables equipment managers to visually analyze the equipment fleet data from different perspectives and at various level of details. The data-warehouse-based DSS facilitates high-level, fact-based decision-making regarding equipment logistics, supplies, maintenance, repair, and replacement and has higher levels of performance and flexibility than the current equipment management system.

The cells are occupied by disputants with differing strategic interaction rules. After interacting, each disputant either retains,its strategy or adopts that of a neighbor, depending on relative strategy success. In this article, we use networks to answer questions about strategy evolution in the game of Chicken.

Innovation development in biopharmaceutical start-up firms: An Italian case study	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competencies; biotechnology; business model; start-up	BIOTECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; INDUSTRY	The aim of this paper is to analyze the business models and the strategic competences of the new Italian biopharmaceutical firms allowing them to successfully overcome the initial stages of starting up. A multiple case studies methodology was used. In particular, a thorough analysis of four Italian biopharmaceutical firms that have recently started up and shown significant innovative output was carried out. The results of this study revealed that the start-up success factors consist of competencies that are distinct and different depending on the type of business models founded: the excellence in quality, the ability to create and manage relationship networks, the technical and managerial capabilities are the strategical competences emerging from the case studies examined.

Creating community-based access to primary healthcare for the uninsured through strategic alliances and restructuring local health department programs	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						case management; healthcare; Management Academy for Public Health; rural; strategic alliance; uninsured		In 2003, the Wilkes County Health Department joined with county healthcare providers to develop the HealthCare Connection, a coordinated and continuous system of low-cost quality care for uninsured and low-income working poor. Through this program, local providers of primary and specialty care donate specialty care or ancillary services not provided by the Health Department, which provides case management for the program. Basing their methods on business models learned through the UNC Management Academy for Public Health, planners investigated the best practices for extending healthcare coverage to the underinsured and uninsured, analyzed operational costs, discovered underutilized local resources, and built capacity within the organization. The HealthCare Connection is an example of how a rural community can join together in a common business practice to improve healthcare access for uninsured and/or low-income adults.

J	Byrne, PJ; Heavey, C				Byrne, P. J.; Heavey, Cathal			Simulation model of a vertically integrated supply chain: A case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						supply chain simulation; decision support systems; and manufacturing detail	OPTIMAL POLICIES; INVENTORY; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS	This paper reports on the successful development and use of simulation for the analysis of a vertically integrated supply chain. Simulation has only recently been applied to the analysis of industrial supply chains and this model differs from existing work in this area in that the manufacturing function is modelled in detail. This is contrast to the logistical models developed using simple lead times to represent manufacturing. This paper reports on the scale of system being analysed, the type of data required to populate such a model, such as product routings, standard times, work centre capacities and shift cycles and the level of detail included in the study and the performance outputs from the model. Using this model experiments were carried out to analyse the effect of stocking policies, production controls, changing demand trends and the effect of forecasting and information sharing on supply chain performance measures. One such experiment to determine the effective trade-off from operating three different finish stocking policies is outlined in detail. These experiments provide management with a useful tool for decision support in relation to both strategic and production strategies.

A STRATEGIC MODEL FOR SAFETY DURING THE HAJJ PILGRIMAGE: AN ANP APPLICATION	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Multi-criteria decision-making; Analytic Network Process; pilgrimage; Hajj; management; strategic planning; Saudi Arabia		Saudi Arabia every year receives more than two million Muslims from all over the world to perform the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah. It must take place during a specific period of the year in a specific and limited space. In spite of the effort government agencies devote to this event, a variety of disasters usually take place each year. As the number of pilgrims is increasing every year the problem is becoming an alarming one. More and more resources are allocated to eliminate the occurrence of such disasters. More than one strategy has been proposed to make the Hajj as safe as possible. Knowing that the problem is very complex as it involves numerous actors, and many entangled criteria and elements, the question is which strategy is best. This paper presents the Analytic Network Process as a sound methodology for structuring the Hajj problem by designing an analytical model to find which strategy to focus on to make the pilgrimage as safe as possible.

J	Ottenbacher, M; Shaw, V; Ermen, D				Ottenbacher, Michael; Shaw, Vivienne; Ermen, David			The new service development process in successful small entrepreneurial firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION			English	Article						new service development process; small service firms; entrepreneurial firms; innovation process	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; FINANCIAL SERVICES; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION	This original empirical work examines the development process characteristics of small entrepreneurial service firms. The results of 12 interviews suggest that successful entrepreneurial innovation projects are the result of a five-stage process model. This entrepreneurial new service development process model differs somewhat from the proposed process models, focusing on large service corporations. Besides a more flexible and informal process for entrepreneurial services, the development cost and the final market price are strongly related to success.

Procurement of IT consulting services and firm-specific characteristics	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						resource-based view; sustainable competitive advantage; sustainable growth rate; IT consulting; firm performance	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY; SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; NONAUDIT SERVICES; USEFUL PERSPECTIVE; AUDIT	Information technology investments and the management consulting industry witnessed unprecedented growth in the last decade. This led to regulators' ( SEC and Congress) allegations that consulting services that are provided by incumbent auditors may be disguised extra payments to auditors for favorable financial reporting. However, there may be alternative valid reasons for procurement of consulting. Under new legislation ( proclaimed in the aftermath of spectacular failures like Enron and Worldcom), publicly traded corporations that engage professional services firms to provide both audit services and consulting services must now disclose the extent and nature of these services. Using the data made available by these new mandated disclosures and using the theoretical backdrop of the resource-based view (RBV), this paper examines whether investments by firms in consulting services follow predictable patterns driven by economic factors. Thus, rather than examine whether IT consulting has any ex-post value or whether procurement of consulting impairs auditor independence, this study focuses on whether investments, ex-ante, follow logical patterns consistent with microeconomic principles. Our analysis shows that procurement of IT and management consulting is consistent with the resource-based view - companies seek to develop organizational capabilities they lack as dictated by their strategic business need. In contrast to the narrow "IT Doesn't Matter" view, it can be argued that even in the current environment of IT outsourcing, firms must carefully match their IT capability (in-house or outsourced) with organizational strategy and capability to develop unique and inimitable resources as put forth by RBV. We find that companies are indeed investing consistent with fundamental tenets of financial value analysis and based on market expectations of performance. More specifically, after controlling for pressure to perform and cash availability, low margin and low turnover companies spend more on consulting services. Low-margin strategy companies expend more on consulting when their asset turnover is also low, while low-turnover strategy companies expend more on consulting when their earnings margin is also low.

J	Cho, KK; Moon, BK				Cho, Kyu-Kab; Moon, Byung-Keun			A method for selecting the optimal portfolio of performance improvement projects in a manufacturing system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						project portfolio selection; project portfolio evaluation; performance measurement; genetic algorithm	MANAGEMENT	This paper proposes a method for selecting the optimal portfolio of performance improvement projects in a manufacturing system. The proposed method consists of evaluation process and selection process for selecting the optimal portfolio. In the evaluation process, the strategic value of a project portfolio is evaluated by considering both the strategy and the performance improvement of a system. In the selection process, the objective is to maximize the strategic value of a project portfolio without violating constraints and a genetic algorithm is used to select the optimal project portfolio. The strategic value of a project portfolio obtained in the project portfolio evaluation process is used as the fitness function of the genetic algorithm. An example of a project portfolio selection in a manufacturing system is discussed in order to illustrate the proposed project portfolio selection method. Significance: This paper introduces a method for selecting the optimal project portfolio based on system performance improvement.

RCSs require firms supplying the domestic market to use a certain proportion of recycled materials as inputs. We demonstrate that, when there is no trade in recycled materials, two identical countries both set strategically stricter or laxer RCSs. However, when there is trade in recycled materials, it may be the case that one country sets a stricter RCS while the other sets a laxer RCS. When a world supply constraint on recycled materials is not binding, the main source of the asymmetric distortion in RCSs is a demand effect for recycled materials. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Key among these are enabling infrastructures and new forms of leadership, which include appreciative inquiry. In particular, we report our experiences in working with micromultinational businesses in the UK and extend the findings reported by Dimitratos, Johnson, Slow, and Young (2003) to suggest four additional success strategies for companies that are 'taking their businesses global'. We conclude with two short case studies.

Continuous improvement of the effectiveness of collaboration requires an adequate and comprehensive assessment and measurement system between the organisations. The present method, quality and maturity method QMM, for measuring the quality and maturity of innovation and R&D, examines the issue from six viewpoints: (.) R&D as part of business strategy (.) R&D as part of product and technology strategy (.) strategic implementation of R&D (.) R&D as a business section (.) R&D outputs (.) implementation of R&D projects. The theoretical background of the QMM method is in quality and maturity theories. During the 11 QMM cases that have been carried out by the beginning of year 2003, considerable amount of data has been stored in a QMM Database. This data contains 1,146 responses from 44 response groups or individual responses. There are both qualitative and quantitative data entries in the database. In this paper we will mainly focus on the presentation of the whole database, general assessment procedure of one case company, a two-level benchmarking analysis of another case company and finally, a networking analysis of six case companies. The intention of the qualitative analysis here is principally to get a good glimpse of common trends between companies: which viewpoints are most mature, which least mature? Where have opinions dispersed most? This also enables an individual company to reflect their own findings to the situation in QMM cases in general. Thus, the mutual understanding of the companies will increase and collaboration will improve.

J	Carrion, GC				Cepeda Carrion, Gabriel			Understanding the link between knowledge management and firm performance: articulating and codifying critical knowledge areas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						Knowledge Management (KM); dynamic capabilities; firm performance; partial least squares	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES; EVOLUTION; COMPETENCE; FRAMEWORK; CHOICE	The concept of dynamic capabilities is quantified in the context of strategic decision-making. Specifically, it is how business mission and value proposition formulation process, along with Knowledge Management (KM) infrastructure, help managers to create and develop dynamic capabilities by articulating and codifying relevant or critical knowledge configurations to the organisation's domain. Five constructs are proposed in a sequential way in order to capture the effectiveness of the key enabling processes that drive reconfiguration (sensing the environment, learning, coordinating, and integrating resources, respectively). A model that links reconfigurability in knowledge resource combinations and firm performance is developed, which is mediated by functional competencies (capability and value creation differentials). The model is tested in the information technology industry in Spain with 107 managers. The paper draws implications for understanding the nature and valuable role of dynamic capabilities, and how these may provide a missing link to the strategic role of knowledge.

J	Gharavi, H; Sor, RMD				Gharavi, H; Sor, RMD			Population ecology, institutionalism and the internet - Travel agencies evolving into middlemen	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						organizational change; strategic choices; transaction costs; tourism; internet; Australia		Purpose - This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of organisational transformation in light of major perturbatory change agents such as the internet. This is carried out through analysing the dynamics of change in the Australian tourist industry and travel agents in particular. Design/methodology/approach - Population ecology posits that the macro environmental conditions that operate in an industry determine the limits within which industry members can operate. Institutionalism posits that management can make strategic choices. These two theories together suggest that while a major change event like the advent of the internet sets the conditions within which organisations operate, management still had "room to play" and make strategic choices. This paper views the advent of the internet through the filters of population ecology and institutionalism. Findings - Change becomes a combination of setting macro boundaries influencing the overall direction of change and evolution follows by a micro-level strategic differentiation amongst individual travel agents. Therefore, the dynamics of change is far more complex than mere determinism and/or strategic choice. Originality/value - This paper has two distinct values. Firstly, its focus on the Australian travel agents brings a unique situation into perspective, where, the internet-enabled change is analysed comprehensively and the complexities of an evolutionary change are discussed. Secondly, it proposes a novel approach to viewing change in the industry by combining two theoretical lenses thus addressing the dynamics of change comprehensively.

J	Grattan, R				Grattan, Robert			Robert McNamara's "11 lessons" in the context of theories of strategic management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT HISTORY			English	Article						Strategic planning; Ethics; Military actions; War		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the 11 lessons propounded by Robert McNamara in the film The Fog of War and to consider them in the context of theories of strategic management, particularly the formulation of strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The film is taken as a case study and the evidence is considered against the background of Mr McNamara's career and contemporary events, triangulated wherever possible by additional accounts so that bias is avoided as much as possible. Findings - The paper finds that, despite a lifelong rational, empirical approach, Mr McNamara has discovered that there are limits to these methods. The importance of values, morals and ethics emerges. The importance of these messages is that the business strategist should acknowledge the limits of rationality and the importance of intangible factors, not least the vagaries of human nature. Originality/value - The paper is a part of a continuing study by the author of the parallels between military/grand strategy formulation and the similar activity in business.

J	Gundry, LK; Kickul, JR				Gundry, LK; Kickul, JR			Leveraging the 'E' in entrepreneurship: test of an integrative model of e-commerce new venture growth	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-commerce entrepreneurship; growth; innovation; internal processes; organisational effectiveness; technology	STRATEGIES; BOUNDARIES; ROLES	The technological and strategic framework that entrepreneurial firms use to plan and achieve firm growth is often seen as the integration and alignment of external market opportunities with internal management competencies. Results from 131 entrepreneurs of c-commerce firms revealed that the building of technology infrastructure functions as a critical antecedent to how these firms developed innovations related to internal management practices, new marketing strategies, and new product, service, and business improvements. Additionally, these innovations not only facilitated the entrepreneur's ability to grow; they also allowed the firm to attain effectiveness in the areas of creating value for customers, insulating the business from competition, and enhancing the overall value of the firm. From these findings, implications for how entrepreneurs leverage their technology towards developing and implementing new innovations and growth initiatives are discussed.

The paper highlights the significance of policy coherence between organizational levels within an institution, the importance of seeking a balance between financial and intellectual research imperatives, the necessity of promoting a strategic balance between the forms of partnership that are allowed and encouraged to develop, and the need for flexible regulation within institutions to provide levers and incentives without being heavy-handed or constricting.

An empirical investigation of quality improvement initiatives in for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals Environmental, competitive and outcome concerns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Hospitals; Operations management; Quality improvement; Management skills; Environmental management		Purpose - The objective of this study is to shed some light on quality improvement practices of for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals Design/methodology/approach - The scope and effectiveness of several quality improvement efforts are studied for a sample of 110 hospitals. Factor analysis was utilized to analyze the data collected. Findings -The results of this study tended to suggest that for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals were more similar than different with the regard to the effective utilization of quality improvement initiatives, thus underscoring the utility of quality improvement efforts despite differences in operating characteristics, strategies and operating constraints. Research limitations/implications - The sample used in this study is limited. Thus, the results should be interpreted accordingly. Practical implications - This study offers decision-makers in healthcare operational settings empirical evidence of the operational and strategic effectiveness of different quality improvement efforts, thus justifying investments related to the initiation and implementation of such quality improvement efforts. Originality/value - This study represents an important step toward understanding the effective implementation of quality improvement initiatives in different operational settings.

This paper proposes a four-phase methodology which facilitates the evaluation of the potential use of Web services in e-business systems both from a technical and from a strategic viewpoint. It is based on business process models, which are used to frame the adoption of Web services and to assess their impact on existing business processes. The application of this methodology is described using a procurement scenario.

These are discussed in relation to strategy process and business excellence. Design/methodology/approach - The case of Nissan South Africa (NSA) is used to illustrate their importance and their relation to hoshin kanri (policy deployment) practice. Findings - The paper argues that TEAs are a very important and integrative aspect of the holistic management of the organization. TEAs are also crucial to hoshin kanri and facilitate operational effectiveness. Originality/value - The paper suggests that strategic reviews, such as TEAs, are best operated when integrated together as an organization-wide managed system of review.

J	Armagan, S; Ferreira, MP				Armagan, Sungu; Ferreira, Manuel Portugal			The Impact of Political Culture on Firms' Choice of Exploitation-Exploration Internationalization Strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CROSS CULTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						exploitation; exploration; internationalization strategy; political culture		This article discusses the impact of political culture on the exploitation-exploration internationalization strategies of firms. In particular, we propose that four dimensions of political culture - nationalism, internationalism, patriotism, and cosmopolitanism - influence firms' willingness to explore new opportunities and/or to exploit existing products and capabilities across borders. We suggest that firms in nationalist home country cultures are more likely to pursue exploitation strategies, whereas those in cosmopolitan cultures are more likely to pursue exploration strategies. For firms embedded in patriotic or internationalist cultures, a mix of exploitation and exploration internationalization strategies might be the more likely choice. We conclude that these political culture dimensions may be useful to understand and predict many firm-level strategic choices, such as the type of internationalization strategy pursued, the choice of foreign entry mode and location, and decisions concerning the management of foreign subsidiaries.

CRITICAL PROBLEMS OF RURAL SMALL BUSINESSES: A COMPARISON OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND WHITE-OWNED FORMATION AND EARLY GROWTH FIRMS	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP			English	Article						Small business; minorities; rura; early growth		This study investigated the critical problems encountered by African American and White-owned formation and early growth firms in rural businesses. Analyses were conducted to determine the most critical types of problems encountered by these businesses and the relationship between the types of problems reported and the owner's race and firm's developmental stage. Strategic problems were the most critical problems by business owners in the sample, regardless of race or developmental stage, followed by administrative and operations. Although no significant relationship was found between the type of problems and the owner's race, a significant relationship was found between problem type and the firm's developmental stage, such that businesses in the formation stage are more likely to encounter strategic problems and early growth firms more often experience administrative problems.

J	Mallard, G				Mallard, G			Interpreters of the literary canon and their technical instruments: The case of Balzac criticism	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on New Trends in the Sociology of Arts	2003	Paris, FRANCE				PHILOSOPHER; SOCIOLOGY; SCIENCE; OBJECTS; SELF	Drawing insights from the ethnographies in the natural sciences, which have focused on the role of technical instruments in laboratory practices, this article asks, "What role do technical instruments play in the humanities?" Editions of La Comedie humaine, written by Honore de Balzac, are taken as a case study. Primarily based on ethnographic research with Balzac scholars, this article traces the evolution of Balzac text from a unified and unadorned text in the 1930s, to a single annotated text in the critical edition of the 1970s, and to a searchable electronic format of different versions. The author shows that the different schools of interpretation in Balzac criticism (traditional, semioticians, socio-critics) constructed these diverse editing technologies to influence the evolution of literary theories. For instance, traditional scholars' theory of authorship entertains en elective affinity with the critical edition of La Comedie humaine. Socio-critics challenged its assumptions and constructed electronic editions to develop their own theories, particularly on the genesis and reception of Balzac texts. By focusing on the epistemic cultures in which research practices are embedded, this case study complements purely institutionalist perspectives on knowledge-production in the academic field and highlights the presence of diverse epistemic cultures in literary criticism.

J	Choy, SY; Lee, WB; Cheung, CF; Shim, G				Choy, S.; Lee, W.; Cheung, C.; Shim, Geoffrey			Development of a Knowledge Management Culture Assessment Tool with Applications in Aviation Industry	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational culture; innovation; knowledge management; learning organization; aviation		Knowledge management (KM) attracts more and more attention nowadays in either research or practice. Organisations often spend a lot of time and money to launch strategic KM initiatives without first assessing whether or not their culture is ready for the implementation of such initiatives. If the culture is not ready for implementing the initiatives, the effort put will rarely produce significant long- term benefits. Instead, employees will perceive them as a waste of time, and participate less actively in the KM initiatives. In this paper, a KM culture assessment tool (KMCAT) is purposely developed for assessing the organisational culture so as to ensure the success of implementation of KM initiatives. The KMCAT takes into account coherence, control, alliance and partnership, information and communication technology as well as innovation, which help an organisation to reveal culture profiles and hence provide directions for managing the culture. A case study of applying the KMCAT is undertaken in an aviation company and encouraging results are obtained.

J	Booth, ME; Philip, G				Booth, ME; Philip, G			Information systems management in practice: An empirical study of UK companies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information systems management; ISM competence building blocks; UK companies	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; KEY ISSUES; TECHNOLOGY; BUSINESS; STRATEGY; ORGANIZATION; ALIGNMENT; SECTOR	Using the experience of several organisations from the manufacturing and service sectors in the UK, this paper seeks to explore the management efforts put into the successful exploitation of technology. In the context of this study, information systems management (ISM) is defined as the managerial and technical strategies and competencies that significantly improve or add value to the use of information systems within an organisation. Initially, a set of ISM 'competence building blocks' were developed based on an extensive trawl of the literature and existing theories. This was then used to map the practical experiences of the companies concerned. Data collection made use of semi-structured interviews with senior business and IT managers of these companies to elicit their views on ISM issues and particularly to understand how their respective organisations are addressing these issues. Whilst the majority acknowledges that IT is now an inescapable part of doing business (strategic necessity), the importance of its management is not yet fully understood particularly by senior business managers. It would seem that the more competitive and fast moving the environment, the more likely the organisation's management to be supportive and fully committed to the management of IS.

Over NASA's history, there have been unprecedented successes: Apollo missions that put people into space and walking on the moon, the remarkable findings of the Hubble space telescope and the Space Shuttle Program, allowing astronauts to perform scientific experiments in orbit from a reusable space vehicle. NASA continues to be a source of national wonder and pride for the United States and the world. However, NASA has failures too. In February of 2002, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated as it returned to Earth. This event occurred 16 years after the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded during take-off. As information was collected, investigators found that many of the problems uncovered during the Challenger investigation were also factors for Columbia. Underlying both disasters was the problem of relaying complex engineering information to management, in an environment driven by schedule and budget pressure. Once again, NASA is looking at ways to better manage space programs in an environment of limited resources.

There is no wonder that skew distributions, a striking empirical regularity in the hypercompetitive digital economy, have attracted the attention of many researchers recently. Little known by many, Herbert Simon had studied similar regularities in the industrial economy and developed empirically grounded, explanatory theories to help guide strategic decision making in the evolutionary processes of organizations. In this paper, we draw upon five seemingly unrelated research areas of Simon (skew distributions, near decomposability, causal reasoning, effectual reasoning, and attention management) and propose a holistic framework of attention-based information systems for firms to frame an enduring competitive strategy in the digital economy. As an ongoing project, the framework is applied to model Netchising, an emerging research topic in global e-business.

J	Collins, E; Roper, J				Collins, Eva; Roper, Juliet			Strategic schizophrenia: The strategic use of trade associations in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						trade association; corporate political strategies; climate change		This paper draws on and extends corporate political strategic theory through examination of how trade associations were used in reaction to ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in New Zealand. It is well established that firms can influence the legislative and regulatory process either individually and/or collectively via trade associations. The findings of this research reinforce current theory by demonstrating that firms use their membership in trade associations to gain expertise they lack, and to leverage their influence through collective advocacy. Large firms were found to be more likely to engage in collective action than small firms, and collective action was more likely on high profile issues than issues that were not receiving significant public and political scrutiny. The findings, however, also necessitated an extension of existing theory to explain firms' response when faced with competing stakeholder demands. When the social and economic objectives of a firm diverged, trade associations were utilised in the dual and contradictory strategies of protecting a firm's positive environmental image while simultaneously advocating less stringent environmental regulatory outcomes.

J	Collinson, S; Kato, H; Yoshihara, H				Collinson, S; Kato, H; Yoshihara, H			Technology strategy revealed: patterns and influences of patent-licensing behaviour in Japanese firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Japanese firms; patents; licensing; strategy; intellectual assets; make-or-buy; pharmaceuticals; electronics	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; KNOWLEDGE ASSETS; SPILLOVERS; MARKET	Patterns of patent in-licensing and out-licensing are examined among Japanese firms in the pharmaceuticals and electronics industries. Sixty-five questionnaires and 24 interview-based cases provide insights into what influences the decisions to 'make-or-buy' (in-license) knowledge assets and to 'exploit-or-sell' (out-license) R&D outputs. Firm size and resources, the existing portfolio of technologies, and ongoing exploitation strategies are all influential. Significant increases in in-licensing and out-licensing and associated changes in the management of intellectual property are also a response to changing competitive pressures and markets in Japan for both these sets of firms. Reciprocal technology-sharing agreements are evolving into more formalised relationships and firms are being pushed to improve their technology brokering capabilities. Looking beyond abstracted patent data, the study provides additional insights into the influences on strategic R&D selection as well as the general management dilemmas associated with the leveraging of intellectual assets, core competence selection and 'markets versus hierarchies' decision making.

J	Holtgrave, DR				Holtgrave, DR			A proposed format for tracking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national HIV prevention goal	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						evaluation; HIV prevention; policy	UNITED-STATES; EPIDEMIC; COST	In January 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a national HIV prevention strategic plan with the overarching goal of reducing new HIV infections in the United States from 40,000 to 20,000 per year by 2005, with a particular emphasis on eliminating the racial/ethnic disparities in new infections, In this article, a framework is proposed for tracking progress toward achievement of the goal. Information available to date suggests there apparently has been little progress in achieving the national goal and sparse expansion of resources needed to achieve the goal.

As an industry environment changes, an entrepreneurial management orientation helps firms adapt to changing market conditions. The purpose of this study is to examine the link between management style and environmental scanning. Based on responses from 201 top-level hotel executives, the findings suggest that entrepreneurial managers are more frequent scanners of the environment. (C) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - The empirical investigation reports on a study undertaken in Ireland and compares results from companies in the industrial sector with companies in the non-industrial sector. The methodology is based on a behavioural questionnaire targeted at the top 150 companies operating in Ireland and classified on the basis of number of employees. Findings - The findings indicate that significant differences are apparent between companies in the industrial sector and companies not in the industrial sector in the use of real estate assets. In particular companies in the industrial/manufacturing sectors have weakly developed corporate real estate strategies. Research limitations/implications - The main limitations derive from a relatively small sample size, a function of targeting the survey at senior executives. There are implications for companies in the under-utilisation of real estate assets and the effects of this on corporate balance-sheets requires further investigation. Originality/value - Highlights that companies in Ireland, notably those in the industrial sector, have some significant way to go in utilising their corporate real estate assets more effectively.

Opportunities and challenges: Hong Kong as Asia's fashion hub	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Textile industry; Garment industry; Fashion industry; Brands; Hong Kong		Purpose - To analyze the current situation of the Hong Kong textile and clothing industries; to investigate the influential factors that can assist Hong Kong to develop as Asia's fashion hub; and to plan for the future development of Hong Kong as a regional centre for fashion. Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides an overview of the Hong Kong textile and clothing industries by using the SWOT analysis. Based on the findings of the analysis, some recommendations for future development are provided. The sources of this study are from the government publications, journal articles, book reviews and advice of practitioners. Findings - The Hong Kong textile and clothing industries have their strengths and weaknesses. To be a regional centre for fashion, developing an original brand manufacturing (OBM) business is a preferred approach. Research limitation/implication - This paper provides a general review of the Hong Kong textile and clothing industries. To gain a more in-depth understanding of the industries and to explore some more solutions for the research problems, it is important to further investigate these issues by attempting in-depth interviews with the Hong Kong textile and clothing industrialists. Practical implications - This paper provides a very useful source of information and impartial advice for the Government, industry players, academic institutions and the media. The formation of Asia's fashion hub is dependent upon the cooperation and effort of these four parties. Originality/value - This paper analyses some of the factors contributing to Hong Kong's success and draws conclusions on strategic directions for the sustainability.	[Tam, F. Y.; Chan, T. S.; Chu, P.

We Suggest the three dimensions of the assessment - capability, behaviour and performance - as the basic conceptual building stones linking the system view of innovation and the target - KISI - to establish an integration framework. An illustrative case of the Industrial Technology and Research Institute (ITRI), the largest nonprofit R&D institute in Taiwan, was conducted to show the actual application of the framework. The integration framework provides better Support to the explanation of the assessment results with the diagnostic and strategic management of innovation problems. It is helpful to reveal in-depth issues, Such as the innovation performance may not be good in spite of good capability, or that a good performance may not be sustainable due to weak capability and aberrant behaviour. An assessment with higher resolution may be needed to produce more significant indicators for the specific types of KISI in future research.

J	Wong, EOW				Wong, Evia			Operationalization of strategic change in continuing education	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Lifelong learning; Strategic alignment; Strategic change		Purpose - Hong Kong continuing education has encountered vigorous change in recent years. It is not limited to the mode of teaching and learning. Changing government policies, fund cutting to the higher education system and the entry of overseas university degrees increase the intensity of competition in the environment to an extraordinary extent. There is a large increase in demand upon internal capabilities of both the continuing education institutions and their leaders to confront the challenging conditions. Aims to examine this situation. Design/methodology/approach - The alignment theory emphasizing strategic fit among the four elements - market competitiveness, business strategy, organizational culture, and leadership style stresses the significance of matching the four elements within the same logic which are defined as "production", "administration", "development", and "integration". Strategic fit of four elements within the same logic enhances the organization's performance level. However, the phenomenon is limited in its way of operation. The researcher substitutes the phenomenon with an operationalization model of strategy fitting the four elements within the same logic by attempting an intensive case study of the strategic change process brought forward by the leader of the Built Environment Unit (BEU) of the School of Professional and Continuing Education of the University of Hong Kong. Findings - The research concludes with a strategic change model of the BEU which emphasizes continuous learning, affection, participation and understanding. The model is built on a groundwork comprising academic identity building and culture management. Its concrete block structure is made up of contextualization in the aspects of program diversification, progression ladders and professional recognition. The whole work is reinforced by Built Environment Sustainability Symposia and a Qualifications Framework to confirm the loyalty of their students. Originality/value - The model can be referred to as a framework by continuing education institution leaders who cope with similar market-changing conditions.

J	Budros, A				Budros, A			Social shocks and slave social mobility: Manumission in Brunswick County, Virginia, 1782-18621	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							FREEDOM; BLACKS; BIAS	What factors raised or lowered manumission rates in the U.S. South? Prior considerations of this question possess three weaknesses: underdeveloped theories with limited causes of liberations, impressionistic empirical analysis, and neglect of rural liberations. The author links two types of social shocks to liberations through quantitative analysis of all liberations granted by masters in Brunswick County, Virginia, from 1782 to 1862. Manumission deterrents and generators explain the rates at which manumission documents were written and chattels were freed. The antebellum pattern of white domination and black subordination disclosed in this research sheds light on the role racial ideologies have played in black-white relations during the postbellum era and the social conditions under which whites have acceded to blacks' demands for improvements in their status.

J	Checkland, K				Checkland, K			Management in general practice: the challenge of the new General Medical Services contract	BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE			English	Article						case studies; interviews; practice management; qualitative research; role	CARE	Background Managers in general practice perform a variety of roles, from purely administrative to higher-level strategic planning. There has been little research investigating in detail how they perform these roles and the problems that they encounter. The new General Medical Services (GMS) contract contains new management challenges and it is not clear how practices will meet these Aim: To improve understanding of the roles performed by managers in general practice and to consider the implications of this for the implementation of the new GMS contract. Design of study. In-depth qualitative case studies covering the period before and immediately after the vote in favour of the new GMS contract. Setting. Three general practices in England, chosen using purposeful sampling. Method: Semi-structured interviews with all clinical and managerial personnel in each practice, participant and non-participant observation, and examination of documents. Results: Understanding about what constitutes the legitimate role of managers in general practice varies both within and between practices. Those practices in the study that employed a manager to work at a strategic level with input into the direction of the organisation demonstrated significant problems with this in practice. These included lack of clarity about what the legitimate role of the manager involved, problems relating to the authority of managers in the context of a partnership, and lack of time available to them to do higher-level work. in addition, general practitioners (GPs) were not confident about their ability to manage their managers' performance. Conclusion: The new GMS contract will place significant demands on practice management These results suggest that it cannot be assumed that simply employing a manager with high level skills will enable these demands to be met, there must first be clarity about what the manager should be doing, and attention must be directed at questions about the legitimacy enjoyed by such a manager the limits of his or her authority, and the management of performance in this role.

If designed appropriately, however performance management systems could support rather than hinder quality. This study investigates the alignments of performance management system components to a strategic emphasis on quality. Findings from a sample of 312 organizations generally support the idea that organizations are adapting their performance management systems in ways that are compatible with a quality emphasis. In addition, the study shows that a greater alignment of quality and performance management is associated with greater perceived effectiveness of the performance management system.

J	Merchant, H				Merchant, H			Revisiting shareholder value creation via international joint ventures: Examining interactions among firm- and context-specific variables	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION			English	Article							STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; ORGANIZATIONAL CONFIGURATIONS; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; ENTRY MODE; LOCATION; COOPERATION; PERFORMANCE; SUGGESTIONS; VALUATION	This study attempts to empirically reconcile the prevalent mixed findings regarding reactions of capital markets to announcements of American firms' participation in international joint ventures (IJVs). It does so by first admitting salient contextual variables into the portfolio of firm-specific variables-heretofore mostly considered in isolation-and then modeling their collective impact on these parents' shareholder value. A cluster analysis of more than 700 equity IJVs yields findings that highlight important interactions between the two sets of variables, which better inform creation and destruction of shareholder value for lJV parents. These findings facilitate development of a conceptual framework for assessing how parents can exploit the inter-connectedness between their firm-specific and contextual domains.

J	Martins, A; Ferreira, JJP; Mendonca, JM				Martins, A; Ferreira, JJP; Mendonca, JM			Quality management and certification in the virtual enterprise	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article								In the global market, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face increasing competition from large corporations for the control of the more profitable business areas. These corporations compensate for their lower agility and flexibility with easier access to information, resources and economies of scale. The virtual enterprise model of a business organization is thus often seen as one of the best strategic moves for SMEs to achieve a global reach without compromising their independence. This emerging business paradigm certainly brings new challenges to many areas of the enterprise, one of which is the quality assurance of external processes and contracted products and services. This paper introduces and discusses the issue of quality assurance within the scope of virtual and networked enterprises, and presents a novel methodology for the integration of quality management into enterprise modelling and for quality certification of the virtual enterprise. This is especially important because quality certification is becoming mandatory in nearly all markets and the well-established certification methods do not cover all the aspects of the virtual enterprise. ISO 9001:2000, the most widely used quality management system standard in the world, is presented as an interesting starting point for virtual enterprise quality management system implementation and certification. Further requirements include broadening the scope of the quality management system to include the whole enterprise life cycle, i.e. from its creation to decommission. Current auditing procedures will have to be adapted to this new business environment and, to meet such a requirement, a continuous real-time third-party auditing mechanism-fully integrated into the virtual enterprise--model is proposed. A pilot/simulator, implemented in a small virtual enterprise, in the occupational safety and health-care business, is used to illustrate the new environment as well as the novel requirements that quality systems will have to meet in the future.

J	Yan, YN; Child, J				Yan, YN; Child, J			Investors' resource commitments and information reporting systems: control in international joint ventures	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						IJV; resource commitments; information reporting	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; UNITED-STATES; INDUSTRY; POWER; FIRM; COMMUNICATION; PERSPECTIVE; INVESTMENT	This paper examines the effects of resource commitments on information reporting in international joint ventures (IJVs). Resources provided by a parent company to an IN are expected to impact on the intensity and focus of information reported to it from that IN. Findings from 20 Sino-British joint ventures confirm that a parent's resource commitment to the IJV, and the control this affords affects the information it receives from the IN compared to that received by the other parent. They illustrate how the structuring of information feedback is a purposive control mechanism. The experience of the British parent companies suggests that an effective structure for feedback of IN information requires integration between the provision of technology and occupancy of relevant IN management positions.

J	Parnell, JA				Parnell, JA			Variations in strategic philosophy among American and Mexican managers	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article							SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; BUSINESS; FIRM; PERCEPTIONS; DELIBERATE; CONSENSUS; CONFUSION; CRITIQUE; CULTURE	Strategic managers today are faced with five critical judgment calls when formulating strategies for their companies: (1) Approaching strategy as an art or as a science, (2) publicizing the strategy or maintaining its secrecy, (3) seeking strategic consistency over the long term or maintaining flexibility, (4) embracing strategic risk or avoiding it, and (5) adopting a top-down or a bottom-up approach to strategic planning. This paper compares American and Mexican managers along these five areas. Findings suggest that conventional wisdom on differences between American and Mexican managers in strategy formulation may not be true. Future research directions are also provided.

J	Barrutia, JM; Echebarria, C				Barrutia, JM; Echebarria, C			Collaborative relationship bundling: a new angle an services marketing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICE INDUSTRY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product mix; relationship marketing; servicing	PRICE; PRODUCTS	This article, proposes anew approach to bundling for both the marketing of services and relationship marketing. Reviews the literature on both bundling and relationship marketing and puts forward a new theoretical approach. Uses the case method as a means of defending the argument and justifies its use in this specific research project. Demonstrates that collaborative relationship bundling can constitute the strategic core of a company; at Least, if the firm's primary goal is to maximise the opportunities of attracting valuable customers within competitive markets. Research bears out some results from previous studies, while it finds other results to be questionable. Shows that the strategic implications of bundling are only partially explained in terms of a price or product focus, which was what previous research had concentrated on. A specific price bundle can have more strategic implications than a different specific product bundle, due to the associative power of bundling and its interactive capacity. As an essential part of this approach, a company must define bundling through an in-depth appraisal of the actual contextual experience of the customer, rather than focusing solely on reservation prices, which is where previous literature had laid its main emphasis. Calculates the lifetime value of the average customer attracted through bundling as compared to that of the average customer in the sector studied, and thus is able to demonstrate that the customer attracted through bundling is of greater value. The case method provides an in-depth explanation but the results it provides may not necessarily be generalised into other contexts. Develops therefore a model to identify the factors that explain the success registered in the case selected for analysis. Puts forward 11 propositions suitable for comparative application in other contexts.

J	Kerr, K; Norris, T				Kerr, K; Norris, T			Telehealth in New Zealand: current practice and future prospects	JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Successes and Failures in Telehealth	JUL 22-23, 2004	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA					We have surveyed the current state of telehealth in New Zealand. The survey found 22 telehealth projects active in 2003, compared with 12 identified in a previous survey in 2000. Many projects were small, localized and led by enthusiasts. Sustainability was a problem and many projects had failed to enter routine operation. Teleradiology and telepsychiatry services focused on acute hospitals were the most frequent clinical applications. The majority of projects (9 of the 22) were on the North Island, concentrated around Auckland. Telehealth appears to have special potential for rural communities and for the remote treatment (telecare) of chronic disease. However, the provision of telehealth in New Zealand is patchy and meets the same barriers to success as have been identified elsewhere, which make it difficult to move telehealth into routine operation. The obstacles constitute not so much a failure of individual projects as a lack of a driving force to take advantage of the opportunities. It is to be hoped that a suggested strategic framework can help to harness the opportunities.

The author focuses on this "shadow negotiation," exploring a series of strategic moves that took place in the case, enabling the parties to craft their negotiation process. These shadow negotiations involved positioning moves, process moves, power moves, and appreciative moves. The parallel shadow negotiation was a significant factor in the success of the Kaiser Permanente negotiations.

A strategic management/design approach is discussed by applying the two-stage design method. It gives the problem of setting the economic leadtime in the respective models. The existence of economic leadtime is ascertained numerically, and a design comparison of a periodic versus a semidynamic type is given. The pair-matrix table consisting of economics and reliability elements is then given for summary, and a strategy for demand-to-supply management is discussed on ellipse shape. Finally, an real situation is introduced and the validity of modelling shown.

J	Then, DSS				Then, DSS			Integrated resources management structure for facilities provision and management	JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES			English	Article						facilities; management; models		The primary focus of this paper is the physical resource base that supports any business: corporate operational real estate assets. In order to achieve the much-needed alignment between business strategic direction and its real estate infrastructure, the organization's strategic intent must clearly reflect its facilities requirements in its strategic business plans. The significance of the strategic role of real estate assets to corporate performance can be seen in a recent influential research report by The Industrial Development Research Foundation in which corporate real estate assets are termed the fifth resource, after the traditional resources of people, technology, information, and capital. Based on a comprehensive survey of published literature and a series of in-depth interviews of corporate real estate/facilities managers, an integrating resource management framework was developed to model the nature of interactions between strategic business planning and operational asset management in an organizational setting. The proposed framework is grounded on an understanding of the nature and demands of core business requirements from which the requirements for real estate and facility services provisions are derived. The study supports the view that research efforts aimed at improving management effectiveness of the operational Teat estate asset base should be channeled to provide models or frameworks that promote understanding of all parties involved in the process.

J	Druckman, D				Druckman, D			Puzzles in search of researchers: Processes, identities, and situations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRATEGIC ARMS-CONTROL; EXPERT PERFORMANCE; INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION; INTERGROUP COMPETITION; DELIBERATE PRACTICE; TURNING-POINTS; CONFLICT; BEHAVIOR; DETERMINANTS; MEDIATION	The theme of this keynote address is conceptual puzzles raised by empirical research on conflict management and resolution. Three types of puzzles are highlighted: those that deal with processes, identities, and situations. The process puzzles include some counter-intuitive implications of negotiating strategies and interaction process dynamics. The identity puzzles include the ways in which identity is negotiated, perceptions of ingroups and outgroups, and the connection between loyalty to groups and collective action. The situation puzzles address attribution issues, the distinction between passive actors and active agents, and the role of history. An attempt is then made to juxtapose the puzzles toward a larger conception of afield that emphasizes change in the phenomena we analyze in research and shape through practice. A number of these ideas are found also in the research of previous IACM lifetime award recipients, with whom connections are made.

Evidence of this is based on a unique dataset that allows us to estimate a firm-level demand curve for the trust, and to construct direct estimates of marginal cost. This article also shows that the strategies employed by the trust failed to deter entry. Market structure and state-level antitrust enforcement account for the failure of these strategies.

SWISS JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						student teams; cooperation and competition; constructive controversy; strategic management; instructional methods	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; HIGH-VELOCITY ENVIRONMENTS; DIALECTICAL INQUIRY; DEVILS ADVOCACY; PERFORMANCE; CONFLICT; TEAMS; ANTECEDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; CONSENSUS	Teams are increasingly recognized as critical for strategy, innovation, and other key organizational activities. This study used the theory of cooperation and competition to identify conditions that promote student team effectiveness in Hong Kong university undergraduate strategic management courses. Results from 70 teams across 12 classes indicate that groups with cooperative goals engaged in the open-minded constructive controversy; teams with independent goals avoided open discussion. Teams with a high level of constructive controversy rated themselves as effective; these teams also were rated as giving high quality presentations as measured by instructors' marks but this result was not statistically significant. These results suggest that structuring cooperative teams can help students perform well in the classroom and may help prepared them to work in the emerging team organization.

J	Winch, GM; Grezes, D; Carr, B				Winch, GM; Grezes, D; Carr, B			Exporting architectural services: The English and French experiences	JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH			English	Article								This paper reports the results of research into the experiences of English and French architectural practices competing in the developing European market. In order to do this, principals from 60 architectural practices - 30 in each country - were interviewed in order to understand the means and motives for exporting architectural services from their own country, to either the other country, or to Germany. This paper starts with a review of the literature on the strategic management of architectural practice before moving on to present the principal findings of the survey of architectural practices. In order to offer a preliminary explanation of the differences found, the results are related to distinctive features of the construction business systems in each country.

J	Kerr, CI; Ivey, PC				Kerr, CI; Ivey, PC			A review of purge air designs for aeroengine-based optical pyrometers	JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	46th International Congress and Exhibition on Gas Turbines and Aeroengines	JUN 04-07, 2001	NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA					With the advent of "power by the hour" type agreements within the civil aeroengine market, the application of engine system monitoring system data has reached the level of strategic use for inforined decision making in not only the aftennarket but increasingly in the contract negotiation stage, One of the key cost drivers in these dollar-per-hour contracts for the OEMs to analyze is the life and maintenance requirements of the turbine blades leading ultimately to blade life management. Such life management of key components is of critical importance to ensure that the economic and technical risks to both service provider and customer are minimized. The optical pyrometer, through providing a direct, temperature measurement of the turbine blades, is a primary input for providing a more realistic assessment of the component's operating history associated with the use of life usage/remaining algorithms. However, the greatest concern with the in-service use of pyrometry is the issue of fouling since the pyrometer's lens is exposed to the turbine environment. The level of optical contamination is usually minimized by introducing purge air bled from the compressor; down the sight tube to prevent both the build-up of contaminants on the exposed system optics and particles in the gas stream from coming in contact with the lens. This paper provides a review of purge air designs and the key methodologies for engine designers to be acquainted with when seeking to integrate the use of optical pyrometry systems in new engine concepts.

J	Panayides, PM				Panayides, PM			Identification of strategic groups using relationship marketing criteria: A cluster analytic approach in professional services	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article							COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; INSURANCE INDUSTRY; MOBILITY BARRIERS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; BANKING; ERROR	The integration of marketing and strategy advocated by contemporary marketing thought permeates the underlying objectives of this article. These objectives include the identification of strategic groups on the basis of marketing relationships in a professional service context and the making of inferences with respect to achieving a competitive advantage as expounded by the resource-based view. The article reviews the concepts under scrutiny prior to applying qualitative and quantitative techniques to identify the existence of four strategic groups in the context of professional ship management firms. Practice and research implications for marketing and competitive advantage of professional service firms are thereby discussed.

J	Morton, FMS				Morton, FMS			Horizontal integration between brand and generic firms in the pharmaceutical industry	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							ENTRY; DECISIONS	This paper asserts that brand pharmaceutical firms (those mostly involved in the invention and production of new drugs) engage in a set of complementary activities that are different front those of generic pharmaceutical firms (those that primarily make off patent medicines). Complementarities of the Milgrom-Roberts variety within, but not across, these two kinds of firms snake it more efficient for pharmaceutical firms to specialize in either brand or generic production. Using FDA data, I show that this is indeed the case. I then examine the firms that produce both types of drugs to see if there are market-level strategic synergies between brand and generic products. I find generic entrants that belong to a corporation that owns the brand in the market are (1) not more likely to enter; (2) not more likely to be approved faster, and (3) not more likely to deter other generics from entering. Thus the advantage, or synergy, from mixing brand and generic activities in one corporation must arise elsewhere in the operations of the firm. If not, the integrated pharmaceutical firm is not the most efficient organizational form for the production of ethical drugs.

J	Raine, JK; Beukman, CP				Raine, JK; Beukman, CP			University technology commercialisation offices a New Zealand perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						contract research; technology commercialisation; university-industry liaison; rapid product development	INDUSTRIAL-INNOVATION	Declining public funding of tertiary education in New Zealand has encouraged universities to grow research-funding links with business and industry, and to commercialise technology and other intellectual property arising from staff and student research. This paper discusses the role of university-industry liaison offices or companies in the commercialisation process. Technology commercialisation models being applied at the University of Canterbury are also presented. A preferred model is used to reduce early stage costs and complexity, to facilitate development project partnerships and investor participation, and to enhance future research funding opportunities. It also recognises the differences in culture and strategic aims of universities and industries, and aims to give value to both the university and its industrial partners.

J	Stoelhorst, JW				Stoelhorst, JW			Transition strategies for managing technological discontinuities: lessons from the history of the semiconductor industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic management; technology dynamics; technology strategy; competitive dynamics; semiconductors	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; DOMINANT DESIGNS; FIRM; INNOVATION	This paper explores the nature of competition under conditions of technological change and asks how firms can manage technological discontinuities. By drawing on the literatures on strategic management and technology dynamics it is proposed that firms should change the nature of their strategy as a technology matures. This proposition is substantiated on the basis of a historical account of the process of competition in the semiconductor industry. An analysis of competition in the wake of the four technological discontinuities that have shaped the semiconductor industry shows how critical success factors change in relation to technological change. Drawing on the lessons from the history of the semiconductor industry, a model is developed to help established firms manage the transition to a newly emerging technological regime, The paper concludes with a reflection on the nature of competition under conditions of technological change, and its implications for theory development in strategic management.

J	Feinberg, Y; Kamien, MI				Feinberg, Y; Kamien, MI			Highway robbery: complementary monopoly and the hold-up problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION			English	Article							VERTICAL INTEGRATION; CONTRACTS; RENEGOTIATION	We analyze the hold-up problem in the context of the Cournot-Ellet theory of complementary monopoly. The strategic interaction among travelers and two distinct owners of successive segments of a segment road is used as a metaphor for complementary goods that are traded sequentially. It is shown that when trade occurs double marginalization is eliminated. Furthermore, allowing for strategic placement of the tollbooths (simultaneous trade) avoids the hold-up problem but not double marginalization. Thus, this analysis suggests the endogenous creation of institutions among complementary monopolistic suppliers that assure their customers of not being held up whenever it is strategically possible.

J	Looise, JK; Paauwe, J				Looise, JK; Paauwe, J			HR research in the Netherlands: imitation and innovation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Dutch HRM Network Conference	1999	ERASMUS UNIV, ROTTERDAM SCH ECON, ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS		ERASMUS UNIV, ROTTERDAM SCH ECON	HR research; national HR developments; comparative NL-UK-USA; future developments		In this paper we present an overview of Dutch HRM Research in the last decade, based on a content analysis of academic journals in this area. Also included is a comparison between UK and USA research, on the one hand, and Dutch research, on the other. Looking back, we conclude that HRM research in the Netherlands has had a relatively institutional character and has been less focused on HRM activities in a narrow sense. Dutch HRM researchers have paid less attention to the strategic positioning of HRM, to the redesign of HRM tools in the area of through-flow and performance management (appraisal, reward systems, feedback mechanisms) and to the monitoring of the effects of HRM. In this way HRM research has not reflected the key HRM issues occupying the attention of practitioners. From more recent patterns, however, we expect Dutch HRM research increasingly to re? ect managerial concerns. This does not imply full convergence with US patterns, especially given the Dutch traditions in industrial relations and personnel management. The challenge for Dutch research on HRM is to find the right balance between market forces and institutional arrangements, including a fair position for the workers; this will have to do justice to the long established tradition of industrial democracy and consultation practices among the various stakeholders.

J	Luo, X; Ma, CH				Luo, X; Ma, CH			Stable equilibrium in beliefs in extensive games with perfect information	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL			English	Article						uncertainty aversion; rationality; common knowledge; stable set	RATIONALIZABLE STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR; BACKWARD INDUCTION; COMMON KNOWLEDGE; EXPECTED UTILITY; UNCERTAINTY; NASH	The purpose of this paper is to present a new solution concept of stable equilibrium in beliefs (SEB) by assuming it is common knowledge that players are uncertainty averse in the sense of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989. Journal of Mathematical Economics 18, 141-153). By making use of an appealing criterion of 'stability, an SEB is defined as a strategy profile supported by a stable belief system. It is shown that all SEBs constitute a unique stable belief system, and an SEB satisfies subgame perfectness. Moreover, it is shown that the notion of SEB 'refines' that of subgame perfect equilibrium in terms of path of play. Finally, following Aumann (1995. Games and Economic Behavior 8, 6-19), this paper establishes some epistemic foundation for the notion of SEB. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Curtis, D				Curtis, D			Finding energy in strategic project management: An essay in honour of Dean Fang	PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								A development project is an intervention that is designed to makes things better in a particular context or situation. It is always a problem to know what to do for the best. The Logical Framework, evaluated in this journal last year (Gasper, 2000), is a project-planning and management technique widely applied by multilateral as well as bilateral donor agencies in international development work. It was designed to prevent project managers from simply offering to do what they had always done before and instead to think strategically about cause and effect in context. The present article respects this logical approach but focuses attention upon context. Context is considered in the right-hand column of a Log Frame. The article seeks inspiration in ancient Chinese concepts of energy: Yin-Yang and Wu-Wei. The search is for a form of project management that minimizes energy consumption in its own internal processes and maximizes energy release in the context that the project seeks to transform. Context has to be examined for opportunities rather than constraints. The article advocates management by being a still presence, as against management by rushing about. It borrows the old-fashioned idea about being a catalyst and validates the now fashionable concepts of enabling and empowering. It also rediscovers at least some virtue in the Blueprint Project. The article seeks to be practical. A management development project in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa provides some illustrations and an incomplete example of what might be entailed if energy is brought into the equations of project management.

J	Le Queux, S; Fajertag, G				Le Queux, S; Fajertag, G			Towards Europeanization of collective bargaining?: Insights from the European chemical industry	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS			English	Article							PROSPECTS	Trade unionists and academic experts increasingly support the view that European Industry Federations should take a leading role in the Europeanization of collective bargaining. This article investigates whether this is a plausible prospect for the European chemical industry. Drawing on collaborative research between the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI) and the European Mine, Chemical and Energy Workers Federation (EMCEF), the article presents a comparative synopsis of industrial relations in five European countries, including recent strategic developments at EMCEF level. The study confirms the importance of national resources and steering power at sector level, especially in relation to monitoring decentralized flexibility. However, despite growing interest in transnational labour cooperation, the conclusion is that progress towards Europeanization is so far modest. More attention in the research agenda, it is then argued, should be directed to how transnational collective bargaining can be achieved.

J	Koradecka, D; Dryzek, H				Koradecka, D; Dryzek, H			Occupational safety and health in Poland	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						occupational safety; working conditions; safety management; safety research; Poland		A system of occupational safety and health (OSH) in Poland was first created after the First World War. Since its onset, it has been subjected to various changes related to the state's political and economic systems. Currently, two decisive processes have impact on OSH: (a) socioeconomic transformation and (b) Poland's planned accession to the European Union (EU). The former results in significant changes in statistics of occupational accidents and diseases and in social problems resulting from high unemployment. The latter manifests itself in efforts to harmonize the law and standards with those of the EU requirements. Within this framework, the National Strategic Program "Occupational Safety and Health Protection in the Working Environment" has been carried out since 1995. The goal of this program is to create an effective system of safety and health protection in the context of Poland's association with the EU.

J	Boyd, JP; Jonas, KJ				Boyd, JP; Jonas, KJ			Are social equivalences ever regular? Permutation and exact tests	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Fermi-Dirac statistics; regular equivalence; permutation tests; exact tests	NETWORKS; SEMIGROUPS	A regular equivalence on a relation induces matrix blocks that are either 0-blocks or regular-blocks, where a regular-block contains at least one positive entry in each row and column. The authors devise both a permutation test and an exact statistical test that separates these two aspects of regular equivalence, 0-blocks and regular-blocks. To test for the regular-block property, the natural test statistic is the number of rows and columns within each purported regular-block that fail to meet the criteria of having at least one positive entry. This statistic is computed for permutations that fix each regular-block as a whole (alternatively, within each sub-row), except for diagonal blocks, for which the diagonal entries are individually fixed. The exact test is derived by assuming that the number of zeros in each block is fixed and that each permutation of zeros is uniformly distributed. This implies that the probability of finding, say, k zeros in a given set of rows and columns follows the hypergeometric distribution, known in physics as the Fermi-Dirac statistics. These results from the separate blocks are combined by convolution to give the distribution of k zero vectors in the matrix as a whole. These tests were applied to data sets from Sampson's Monastery, Wasserman and Faust's Countries Trade Networks, Krackhardt's High-Tech Managers, and B.J. Cole's Dominance Hierarchies in Leptothorax ants. In all four cases, the 0-blocks were very significant, having only a tiny fraction of permutations with fewer errors than was found in the data. With the regular-blocks, however, there was no significant relation in the Countries data and a significant overall tendency in the other three data sets toward having more departures from regular 1-blocks in the data than in the permuted matrices.

J	Wu, B				Wu, B			Strategy analysis and system design within an overall framework of manufacturing system management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article								Manufacturing Systems Management (MSM) can be defined as a functional domain that involves all of the activities (such as design, implementation, operations and monitoring) needed to regulate and optimize a manufacturing system as it progresses through its life cycle. A previously proposed framework has specified the key functional areas of MSM, outlining the contents and relationships within them, and then logically integrating these into a closed-loop to provide the basis for the development of a set of consistent parameters and procedures. One importance element of this framework is a Manufacturing Strategy Analysis (MSA) to Manufacturing System Design (MSD) interface, which helps to associate manufacturing strategic concerns with the subsequent system design requirements. This paper specifies the structure of a MSA/MSD interfacing model within the context of the MSM framework. Providing a step-by-step guide through the complete MSA/MSD cycle, the model is based on the results from extensive analysis of the relevant methodologies and techniques available in the literature, and data gathered through industrial practice. Following a description of the functionality, processes and tools along its MSA/MSD cycle, various new features of this model will be discussed and a number of case studies will be presented to illustrate its practical application.

J	de Jong, A; Visser, D				de Jong, A; Visser, D			Black and White employees' fairness perceptions of personnel selection techniques	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						personnel selection techniques; fairness perceptions; cross-cultural comparison	APPLICANT REACTIONS; VALIDITY; UTILITY	The Employment Equity Act (1998) states that no unfair discrimination should occur against an employee in any organisational policy or practice. The diversity of the South African population may lead to opinions that certain selection techniques have an adverse impact on members of different population groups. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent black and white respondents regarded specific selection techniques as being fair. A further goal was to establish whether knowledge of selection techniques influenced perceptions of the fairness of selection techniques. The sample consisted of 328 mature university students (mean age 30,6 years) all of whom had work experience. The perceptions of the Black (uninformed) and White (uninformed) groups were compared and thereafter the perceptions of informed and uninformed black students were compared. Exposure to the subjects Strategic Personnel Management and/or undergraduate Industrial Psychology, thereby providing the student with theoretical knowledge about the nature and value of various selection techniques, constituted the variable 'being informed'. The results supported the hypothesis that the Black (uninformed) and the White (uninformed) groups have different perceptions regarding the ten selection techniques. However, no support was found for the hypothesis that the fairness perceptions of the Black (informed) and the Black (uninformed) groups would differ. The implications of these findings were discussed in terms of selection practices in South Africa. Key words: Personnel selection techniques, fairness perceptions, cross-cultural comparison.

J	Mandel, M				Mandel, M			Measuring tendency towards mutuality in a social network	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							LOGIT-MODELS; LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS; DIRECTED-GRAPHS; MARKOV GRAPHS	When trying to understand the structure of a social network, the number of mutual dyads is often used to describe tendency toward mutuality (TTM), Only few works, however, deal with measures of TTM and only the work of Rao and Bandyopadhyay [Rao, A.R., Bandyopadhyay, S., 1987. Sankhya 49 Ser. A, pp. 141-188] compares between the different measures. This paper presents the different measures for TTM, their interpretation and their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore the distribution of the number of mutual dyads in graphs which are distributed according to a uniform distribution over certain special spaces. The measures are demonstrated and compared on two independent real data sets. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	McCue, MJ				McCue, MJ			What determines hospital sponsorship of an HMO?	INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING			English	Article							FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; PREMIUMS; MARKET; ENTRY	Using a strategic adaptation framework, this study evaluates the underlying institutional, market, organizational and financial factors leading to hospital sponsorship of a health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance product. Analyzing hospitals in Metropolitan Statistical Al ens (MSAs) in 1995 and 1996, the study found that a hospital is more likely to sponsor an HMO in markets that see a combined interaction effect of a large number of competing HMOs and high HMO penetration. HMO sponsorship also is more likely among hospitals with relatively low market share. Only in small MSA markets do hospitals with greater liquidity sponsor an HMO. Finally, hospitals that are affiliated with a multihospital system and under public ownership are more likely to sponsor HMOs.

J	Jobber, D; Lucas, GJ				Jobber, D; Lucas, GJ			The modified Tichy TPC framework for pattern matching and hypothesis development in historical case study research	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						integrative strategic framework; marketing performance; strategic groups; pattern matching; historical case research	ORIENTATION; STRATEGY	Scholars' calls for an integrating View of the technical, political, and cultural (TPC) aspects of management lend to examining Tichy's TPC framework as the basis of such a view. Tichy's framework is shown to require modification to include the TPC systems of a firm's customers and competitors, and a modified TPC framework is proposed. This framework's usefulness for pattern matching to identify causes of performance is demonstrated in historical case research into a strategic group marketing IBM-compatible mainframes. A result is four testable hypotheses suggesting how firms' success marketing to organizations depends on effective integration between marketing and general management, and a potential cause of variations in performance within strategic groups and during movement between strategic groups. In addition, a method for testing and developing hypotheses by pattern matching on a modified TPC framework is demonstrated. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Hislop, D				Hislop, D			Environmental constraints and sectoral recipes: Strategy change in Britain's military industrial base	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article							DEFENSE; ORGANIZATIONS; CHOICE; FIRM; UK	There has been a significant growth in research providing a sectoral-level analysis for a range of organizational behaviour, including company strategy (Smith et al., 1990; Spender, 1989). One of the main strengths of this work is that it shows a sensitivity to how an organization's institutional-structural context influences its behaviour. This paper will add to this growing body of research through examining one particular sector: the UK's military equipment sector in the period immediately following the end of the Cold War. One of the most interesting findings from the research on which this paper is based was the similarity in strategies pursued by most of the companies examined. This similarity in strategies is explained in terms of two main factors. Firstly, drawing on elements of contingency theory it is suggested that the strategic options open to the companies examined were constrained by the specific nature of their capabilities, which were shaped by the character of military equipment markets. Secondly, it is suggested that the institutional characteristics of the UK's military equipment sector were conducive to the development of a strategic 'recipe'.

We employ a human resource control framework to examine the role gainsharing plays within the organization. Our analysis of 802 organizations suggests that gain sharing plans are used to enhance employee participation in organizations that employ market-based control methods. Organizations that rise bureaucratic or dan controls are not likely to adopt gainsharing; they are more likely to use participation initiatives that do not involve a group bonus.

J	Fuller, L				Fuller, L			Socialism and the transition in East and Central Europe: The homogeneity paradigm, class, and economic inefficiency	ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						working class; intelligentsia; transition politics; epistemology; work	STATE SOCIALISM; COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE; RUSSIA; INTELLIGENTSIA; REFLECTIONS; ENTERPRISES; COMMUNISM; SOCIETIES; POLITICS; WORKERS	The homogeneity (mass-elite) paradigm exerts inordinate influence over social research on East and Central European socialism and its transition. I explore the epistemological and methodological underpinnings of this paradigm and argue that it has masked the importance of class relations for grasping the dynamics of these societies. I help retrieve class in general, and the working class in particular, from the analytic obscurity to which the homogeneity paradigm has relegated them by juxtaposing workers' and intellectuals' perceptions of economic inefficiency. Finally I suggest ways that inattention to class under socialism has retarded understanding of the political struggles that have accompanied its demise.

Meeting the patient educational needs of the consumer is one cell-recognized aspect of quality care. Delivering quality care does not happen by chance; rather, it requires intense planning. Our academic medical center formalized this process by empowering professional staff from Nursing Development to develop and implement a patient education strategic plan. This article outlines the project management for the assessment phase of this strategic planning process. The findings were instrumental In outlining the future direction for patient education Initiatives that will benefit both the patient and the organization.

One strategy for increasing material efficiency is their reuse through various recycling technologies and systems. A framework for modeling reverse production systems (RPSs) is motivated and developed. Reverse production systems are focused on the recovery, reuse and recycling of post-consumer and post-manufacturing waste. The framework developed underlies a mixed integer Linear programming model that can be used to study the strategic design of RPSs. The framework and model are applied to the case of carpet recycling in the USA and to a regional system for the State of Georgia in particular. It is demonstrated that systems issues can he as important as individual technology development, but that above all, there is a need to foster markets for all the elements of the materials streams that are being recovered.

J	Christiaanse, E; Zimmerman, RJ				Christiaanse, E; Zimmerman, RJ			Managing electronic channels: the KLM cargo cyberpets case	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Conference in Information Systems (ECIS 99)	JUN 23-25, 1999	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK				INTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS; MARKETS	The adoption and management of electronic channels provide critical challenges for managers and researchers in the field of information systems. With the recent advent of electronic commerce, new business models have emerged to capture the value of on-line electronic channels. In electronic channels, channel functions in particular can be combined creatively to reduce costs and improve responsiveness and can be dispersed among several different players. We argue that buying processes and channel functions in electronic channels are of a key strategic nature. This paper presents an analysis of the challenges and requirements of electronic channels and illustrates these with the KLM Cargo Cyberpets case. Cyberpets refers to Pets Travel Service, KLM Cargo's recent addition to its electronic commerce portfolio which organizes and facilitates air transportation plus ancillary services for cats and dogs. The existence of 'Channel silos' and channel coordination problems were found to be one of the main inhibitors for channel effectiveness and success. The paper concludes with suggestions for managers as well as for researchers.

Prior ethical analyses of such activities have ignored the fact that large numbers of such buyouts return to public trading. The ethical implications of management buyout activity can be more fully understood if the entire buyout process is considered, beginning with the time the firm is taken private until it is returned to public trading. Using a widely employed strategic management ethical framework developed by Hosmer (1994), this paper examines the ethics of the complete buyout cycle.

Canada has been actively pursuing policy macro-level directions for health information and evidence-based decision making through the National Forum on Health and the Advisory Council on Health Infostructure, together with changes in the federal health ministry, Health Canada, and other important national health organizations such as the Canadian Institute for Health Information. It remains to be determined how these initiatives will fundamentally influence a culture of evidence-based decision making and health information availability and quality for the average Canadian. Canada has, nonetheless, recognized that our health care delivery system has fallen behind in terms of using information management and technology to enable and facilitate the ever-growing information needs of the system. Policy direction provided by the National Forum on Health and the Advisory Council on Health Information offer an agenda for action and strategic direction drawn from two broadly based, highly iterative processes.

In order to increase the competitiveness of the company, the authors have identified a number of improvement strategies which were specific to the economic and political environment in China. The center of the strategies is a vision of an integrated manufacturing strategy. The detailed design and implementation of this vision is conducted through the proposed systematic manufacturing strategic analysis. The integration process encompasses various elements such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRPII) and Real-Time Monitoring System (RTMS), it emphasises not only the use of appropriate modern technology but also the management of technology change. In this paper, a concept model is used to describe the integration process, the detailed implementation is also elaborated using a proposed implementation process model. By adopting the integrated manufacturing system, and through continuing improvement, the productivity and hence the profitability of the company is increased. It is anticipated that the integrated approach to the design and implementation of manufacturing systems will be an important contribution towards the manufacturing strategy in a labour intensive environment such as China.

The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Watershed Science Institute (WSSI), in cooperation with a number Of partners, is developing a process for creating unique, watershed-scale models to examine dynamic phosphorus (P) flows into, out of; and within watersheds using a mass balance approach. The Watershed Ecosystem Nutrient Dynamics (WEND) model tracks watershed P balances over time within each of the several land-use sectors. Long-term impacts of various strategic policy decisions on P cycling both within and export from watersheds can be modeled The Winooski River Watershed in Vermont is a case watershed in which WEND has been used to evaluate the impacts of long-term strategies an nutrient use efficiency. The objective of this study was to describe the effects of three scenarios (status quo, increased rate of development, and increased conservation policies) an P cycling. The model showed increased water quality impairment over 80 years under the status quo and development scenarios. Under the conservation scenario, P movement into the drainage network was significantly reduced.

J	Durrani, TS; Forbes, SM; Broadfoot, C				Durrani, TS; Forbes, SM; Broadfoot, C			An integrated approach to technology acquisition management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						market-place requirements; technology acquisition; software tools for technology management; technology sourcing		Research on the electronics industry in Scotland by the authors has indicated that while many companies have focused on improving their product development and process innovation procedures, they have, in general, not formalised the management of the technology acquisition process to the same extent. To fulfil this need, the authors propose a new, holistic approach to technology acquisition that integrates a number of strands of technology management. The approach leads to a generic Technology Acquisition Model that can be employed at both a strategic level and an operational level. The model provides a structured framework to identify the most appropriate technological solution to a market need, and the most suitable source for acquiring the chosen technology that best matches the strategic objectives of an organization. A software package which implements the model has been developed to provide decision-makers with a user-friendly tool for implementing the technology acquisition process. Case studies are included to verify the conceptual framework and its applications.

J	Klaas, BS				Klaas, BS			Containing compensation costs: Why firms differ in their willingness to reduce pay	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EFFICIENCY WAGES; UNEMPLOYMENT; ENVIRONMENTS; EMPLOYMENT; STRATEGIES; STICKINESS; SCARCITY; INDUSTRY; MARKET	Driven by concerns about negative reactions among employees, most firms have traditionally avoided reducing compensation in response to competitive pressures or labor market opportunities. Thus, recent moves by a number of firms to reduce compensation raises questions about why, increasingly, firms differ in their willingness to lower compensation in response to pressures and/or opportunities. Using organizational level delta obtained from over 400 human resource managers, this study examines determinants of efforts to reduce compensation-both in real and nominal terms. The results suggest that efforts to lower compensation are related to competitive pressures faced by the firm and to human resource policies and practices. These human resource policies and practices are thought to affect sensitivity to environmental change and the degree to which reductions generate incidental costs for the firm. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Part A of this research presented a theoretical model which we have termed the "Umbrella Methodology" as an alternative means for choosing the 'right' breakthrough product to develop, based on information on a number of key inputs which impact the success of new products. This paper applies that methodology to the case of the electric vehicle, which represents a breakthrough product, which is very close to market introduction. This paper is meant to be demonstrative in nature, illustrating how the methodology of Part A can be implemented. It is not a strategic suggestion or advice aimed at electric vehicle developers. The exercise shows how, even using only secondary information, product developers can make better-informed decisions regarding which breakthrough product to introduce.

In this paper we review the development of ideas in the field, drawing out common themes. The applicability and value of these themes has then been tested in practice, through the development of a technology review process with a collaborating company. The process is designed to incorporate technical and commercial knowledge from individuals across diverse business units in order that a corporate view of technology strategy may be formed. A five-process model for the management of technology is proposed to give a framework around which practical tools can be grouped coherently. The paper concludes by discussing the experience and learning which have emerged from the case, and comments on aspects of technology strategy development which are still not well supported by theory-based techniques.

J	Wirl, F				Wirl, F			Conservation incentives for consumers	JOURNAL OF REGULATORY ECONOMICS			English	Article							ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS; BENEFITS; COST	This paper investigates profit-maximizing conservation incentives of a utility, where the interest in conservation results from prices regulated below the marginal costs of supply and where consumers differ with respect to their subjective time preference. Conventional least-cost planning implies that a program should focus on inefficient consumers (those who apply high discount rates). However, this scheme provokes strategic reactions of the consumers. Hence, incentive-compatible conservation schemes-one tied to efficiency, the other tied to electricity consumption-are derived that differ starkly from the above finding and from actual programs.

J	Humphries, M				Humphries, M			For the common good? New Zealanders comply with quality standards	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article								The heralding of improved economic indicators has generated worldwide interest in New Zealand's economic experiment despite the growing concern about the social repercussions of such rapid economic Liberalisation. This paper argues that the compliance of New Zealanders to this economic experiment was achieved through the simultaneous development of a discourse of economic liberalism and a discourse of "the management of quality" and the subsequent cooption of the latter by the former. As an experiment for potential global emulation, this paper cautions those who pin their hopes for social justice on a common commitment to increasing productivity in the context of neoconservative economic policy preferences.

J	Chang, MH				Chang, MH			Product switching cost and strategic flexibility	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							COMPETITION; INVESTMENT	This paper examines the equilibrium degree of flexibility adopted by firms competing in oligopolistic product markets in which the value of flexibility arises from the initial presence of uncertainty over consumer preferences and its eventual resolution. The equilibrium choice of flexible mode depends on the following factors: (1) the cost of switching product design in response to revealed consumer preferences, (2) the difference in the acquisition costs of the flexible and dedicated modes, and (3) the precision of the ex ante information held by the firms regarding consumer preferences. The relationship between these factors and the equilibrium choice of modes is fully characterized.

J	Ellison, BA				Ellison, BA			Intergovernmental relations and the advocacy coalition framework: The operation of federalism in Denver water politics	PUBLIUS-THE JOURNAL OF FEDERALISM			English	Article							POLICY; SUBSYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; AUTONOMY	The relationship between intergovernmental relations and the formulation and implementation of public policies is not well understood by scholars. Borrowing from the advocacy coalition framework, this study contends that public policies reflect the strategic choices of federal, state, and local actors operating within policy subsystems. The success of various governmental policy strategies is dependent on the autonomy of each actor and the level of policy fragmentation within the subsystem. These variables are defined, operationalized, and examined within the context of intergovernmental relations in Denver water politics.

J	Drury, C				Drury, C			Management accounting information systems in UK building societies	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article								A significant feature of the UK economy over the past decade has been the growth in the financial services sector. Little has been written on the nature and content of accounting information systems in the financial services sector. To remedy this deficiency a postal survey and interviews were undertaken to provide information on the nature and scope of management accounting information systems within UK building societies. This paper reports on the survey and interview findings relating to the role of branch and product profitability analysis for making strategic decisions, the evaluation of branch managerial performance, transfer pricing, budgeting and the monitoring of competitor performance.

Their analysis suggestions were performed and resulted in no significant differences between the treatment conditions. However, these analyses are misleading because of normality and variance problems present in Massetti's dataset. Specifically, not controlling for individual performance differences in ideational fluency ability during experimentation created the need for the complex, but appropriate, analysis approach used in Massetti.

J	Bronn, C				Bronn, C			Applying epistemic logic and evidential theory to strategic arguments	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						epistemic logic; evidential theory; argumentation; strategic policy		This paper extends work originally reported in a previous SMJ article on strategic policy issues. To accomplish this extension, we draw on research from separate but related areas. concepts from the application of first-order logic to organizational theory and formal methods from research in knowledge representation are combined using epistemic logic and evidential theory. It is shown that the original formulation of the policy evaluation problem fits neatly into this framework. This allows application of more formal and powerful methods for representing and evaluating the evidence offered in support of strategic policy statements. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sans, Ltd.

A case in point is multiperiod compartmental modelling of the HIV/AIDS pandemic where our comprehensive taxonomy can be instrumental in the evaluation of current policy tools and the exploration of possible extensions. For this purpose we first briefly point to sample taxonomies in selected areas with a special focus on HIV/AIDS. Then we present a new matrix-based taxonomy that identifies and classifies the structure and parameters of policy-oriented multiperiod compartmental HIV/AIDS epidemic models by compartment characteristics, transition paths and kinds, infection mechanisms, mixing patterns, intervention strategies, epidemiological and health economic impact measures.

J	Fletcher, K; Wright, G				Fletcher, K; Wright, G			Strategic and organizational determinants of information system sophistication: an analysis of the uptake of database marketing in the financial services industry	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							TECHNOLOGY	This paper investigates strategic and organizational determinants of adoption/non-adoption of strategic marketing information systems that differ in degree of sophistication. We identify potentially relevant variables and relate them to the use of database marketing (DBM) systems. Using an obtained sample of 49% of all major banks, building societies and insurance companies in the UK, we compare users and non-users and, within the users, we identify intercorrelations with those variables linked to degree of sophistication. Adoption of DBM systems is closely associated with the organization placing a greater strategic importance on direct marketing decisions, strategic integration of information technology (IT) and marketing, the possession of a large direct marketing grouping and a strong marketing and information orientation. These factors, coupled with a greater degree of organizational slack and weaker organization control of resources and more decisive decision making, which separate adopting organizations from non-adopters. Once adoption has occurred, greater DBM sophistication is closely linked to the power of the direct marketing function, the importance placed on the strategic integration of IT and marketing, the size of the direct marketing grouping, and the organization's overall information orientation.

J	Guven, S; Persentili, E				Guven, S; Persentili, E			A linear programming model for bank balance sheet management	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						linear programming; banking; policy analysis; balance-sheet management		Bank balance-sheet management which involves the determination of the size and composition of a bank's assets and liabilities over a multiperiod planning horizon is one of the most prominent issues in bank strategic planning. Not only management policy choices, but legal restrictions and minimum safety requirements, dictated by the economic and political environment operated in, mean a balance has to be struck between the conflicting objectives of profitability, liquidity and risk. Bank balance-sheet management is further complicated by the fact that decisions made at any point in time affect profits, liquidity and risk, not only at the time they are made, but in the periods that follow. This paper discusses a multiperiod Linear programming model constructed for a commercial bank in Turkey, that takes into consideration this systematic relationship in the legal, financial and institutional setup of Turkey over the period 1987-1990.

J	Greenley, GE; Oktemgil, M				Greenley, GE; Oktemgil, M			An investigation of modulator effects on alignment skill	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article							STRATEGIC DECISION-PROCESSES; HIGH-VELOCITY ENVIRONMENTS; MARKET ORIENTATION; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; ORGANIZATIONAL ADAPTATION; RESEARCH PROPOSITIONS; MODERATOR VARIABLES; FIRM PERFORMANCE; RISK-TAKING; MANAGEMENT	Managers need to exercise effective alignment shill for aligning their organizations to the external environment. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of alignment shill call be undermined by managerial problems in understanding environmental change, resulting in ineffective alignment. To overcome these problems, firms need to develop mechanisms for modifying, influencing, and controlling managers' alignment shills. These mechanisms are labeled modulators, and their function is to contribute to an effective alignment of the firm, as well as modifying and influencing managers' alignment skills. However, as these modulators have not been addressed in the literature, there is little guidance for companies. This deficiency is addressed in this article by developing theory about modulators and alignment shill and by empirically testing this theory in a sample of U.K. companies. The objectives were to contribute to knowledge about the alignment process al td to provide guidance for firms in identifying modulators. The major modulators of alignment shill identified are decision making mode, market orientation, marketing capability, and organizational slack. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

It explores the theoretical relations among organizational and environmental characteristics and measures of efficiency and effectiveness. The paper develops need fulfillment as a measure of organization effectiveness. An interesting implication for organization theory is the findings that suggest that legitimacy does not enhance efficiency and that legitimacy and efficiency may be entirely independent variables.

J	Felkey, BG				Felkey, BG			Health system informatics	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY			English	Article						administration; computers; costs; databases; health care; information; pharmacy, institutional, hospital; quality assurance; standards; strategic planning; technology		The application of informatics in a health system in general and to pharmacy in particular is discussed. Informatics is the use of information technology to enhance the quality of care, facilitate accountability, and assist in cost containment. Tying the pieces of health care into a seamless system using informatics principles yields a more rational approach to caregiving. A four-layer hierarchy of information systems can be found in any health system: layer 1, the foundational layer formed by a transaction-processing system; 2, the management information system; 3, decision support; and 4, advanced informatics applications such as expert systems. Other industries appear to be ahead of health care in investing in informatics applications. Pharmacy is one of the key health care professions that must adopt informatics. A stepwise structure for pharmacy informatics has been proposed; it consists of establishing a relationship with the patient, establishing a database, listing and ranking problems, choosing among alternatives, and planning and monitoring. Informatics should be approached by determining where the department is going strategically. Informatics standards will be needed.

J	Andersson, F				Andersson, F			Small pollution markets: Tradable permits versus revelation mechanisms	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RIGHTS	A simple two-period model with two polluters is analyzed. They emit a homogeneous hazardous substance, and they are given tradable permits to pollute. The social planner issues permits and tries to learn the cost of reducing pollution by observing the quantity of permits traded in the first period. It is shown that although efficient trade is prevented by strategic considerations by the polluters, the planner learns something from observing only quantities. Comparisons are made between this approach and that of mechanism design, and it is concluded that the latter is superior in theory, but sensitive to collusion by the firms.

J	Teo, WF; Dale, BG				Teo, WF; Dale, BG			Self-assessment: methods, management and process	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE			English	Article						self-assessment; quality awards; continuous improvement; total quality management		Self-assessment is a method for reviewing the activities and performance of an organization. This paper reports the findings of a study in four organizations of their management of this process. Each company followed the key self-assessment stages of planning, developing awareness, implementation and review but carried out the process in a different manner. The level of total quality management (TQM) maturity, available resources and organizational culture were the main factors for the differences. The key to successful self-assessment is effective management and the use of a team to manage the process. The most important activities were identified as: selection of a suitable model, appropriate approach(es) for the assessment, provision of appropriate training, monitoring the progress of improvement actions, establishment of a 'closed-loop' structure for the improvement cycle and integration of improvement with the strategic business plan. It is also pointed out that self-assessment is not without difficulties, including scarcity of time, overemphasis on scoring and scores, failing to follow-up improvement actions and lack of communication.

J	Love, NF; Cooper, J				Love, NF; Cooper, J			Competition or co-operation? Strategic information management in the National Health Service: A case study of the Ceredigion NHS Trust	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper investigates the strategic planning for information management in the National Health Service (NHS). The purpose of the study is to establish whether the use of information technology (IT) to encourage competition in the NHS is effective. The approach taken to implement IT within the NHS is examined with a view to determining whether the increase in competition has led to changes in the way IT systems are developed and managed. The role of IT in increasing the competitiveness of hospitals has been crucial. This paper looks at the role of information management in encouraging competition, and whether it leads to greater efficiency and improvements an patient care. This paper examines firstly the strategy for information management in the NHS; secondly, the IT strategy in Wales and specifically in the Ceredigion NHS Trust; and thirdly, examines four developmental pilot projects. The conclusion is that the strategy of encouraging competing pilot projects is counter-productive. The pilot projects are too ambitious given the lack of previous investment in IT and that the projects themselves, although worthwhile from a developmental point of view, need substantial investment before they can be implemented. Only one of the projects has been implemented despite partial success for two of the other projects. The successful projects had the support and involvement of the senior management and this may have had an effect on the decision making process. Hospitals in the NHS, faced with tight financial constraints, will need to co-operate with other organisations in order to develop integrated systems for better patient health care.

J	Harris, M				Harris, M			Organizational politics, strategic change and the evaluation of CAD	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MANAGEMENT	This paper uses a 'case in sector' analysis to investigate the extent to which the success criteria imposed by cost accounting constrains the ability of engineers to acquire and make effective use of computer aided design (CAD). The paper examines two periods of CAD investment in a sample of UK manufacturers. In the first 'early adoption' period CAD proposals were made by junior engineers on a locally initiated 'bottom up' basis. Proposals were made according to the dictates of conventional cost benefit analysis, engineering and accounting priorities were separate, and senior management were not involved. In the second 'general adoption' period there was a general uptake of CAD throughout the sector. The paper demonstrates that the evaluation of CAD was influenced not just by the rival claims of accountants and engineers, but also by long run changes in the operating environment, and by the control devices employed by senior management. The findings bear out the view of technological change as a socially negotiated process. However, it would appear that the organizational practices associated with CAD evaluation are continually re-negotiated in the light of dynamic organizational interests and changes in the broader sectoral context.

J	Hansen, KL; Tatum, CB				Hansen, KL; Tatum, CB			How strategies happen: A decision-making framework	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This multiple-case study investigates the decision to upgrade existing computer-aided design and computer-integrated engineering (CAD/CIE) systems in four international architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms. Conventional methods of viewing strategy formation do not reflect the importance of dynamic elements (clients, champions, technical competence, etc.) in making strategic decisions. Four decision factors developed in this investigation-Tangent (impetus), Titanic (risk), Timing, and Technology-provide a useful vehicle to understand the strategic decision-making process and help to create a knowledge base of strategic issues within the AEC industry. The overall finding is that strategic decisions spring from many sources external to a formal planning process and that the strategy formation process is not linear. The research also identifies several ways for AEC firms to increase the effective use of CAD/CIE.

Pre-Baldrige steps: Personal readiness training for managers coincided with a strategic planning process that also focused on quality. An organizational quality structure was developed and quality improvement teams launched. Self-assessment: In 1994, once the management team decided to use the Baldrige criteria, it beg-an developing and implementing organizational self-assessment criteria. However, ii was not until August 1995 that the organizational self-assessment was conducted. Key areas targeted for improvement: Critical areas for improvement were selected on the basis of their alignment with the strategic objectives, their cross-functional nature, an analysis of the costs and benefits of implementation, and the probability of and ability to measure the success of the improvement. Example-complaint and feedback system: After Baldrige criteria led the agency to determine whether a complaint management process resolves issues effectively and promptly, it was apparent that complaint resolution was not monitored, acid various process improvement strategies were implemented. Summary and conclusion: Use of the Baldrige criteria has helped the agency move forward in its TQM program. Areas for improvement, as documented in the self-assessment phase, become part of the strategic plan. The criteria's focus on process and customer satisfaction are reassuring to staff in a changing health care environment.

From detailed case study work carried out in six organizations, a five-part categorization has been developed which highlights the restraining forces in the process of integrating TQM into the business planning process. This categorization is summarized in this paper, which also gives two case histories of how quality improvement has been integrated with business plans. Amongst the main findings of the study are that TQM will be difficult to sustain if it is not integrated with the business planning process of the organization.

J	HUOTARI, ML				HUOTARI, ML			STRATEGIC INFORMATION MANAGEMENT - A PILOT-STUDY IN A FINNISH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SUCCESS	A strategic information systems evaluation methodology based on the concepts of the value chain, critical success factors and the information auditing approach is presented as it has been shown that in different industries the most critical area of the value chain differs. This perception stresses that organizations have to discover the most significant area of their value chains, the critical information needed and possible problems experienced in the access and use of that information for the performance of that area in order to gain competitive advantage. The theoretical background of the suggested methodology is briefly discussed along with the research methods applied. The results of a pilot study in a Finnish pharmaceutical R&D environment are presented. It is concluded that information systems evaluation conducted in the suggested manner enhances differentiation by focusing on the most critical organizational information needs, It also highlights the problem areas in the performance of the most significant area of the value chain of this pharmaceutical R&D environment.

J	PHILIP, G; GOPALAKRISHNAN, M; MAWALKAR, SR				PHILIP, G; GOPALAKRISHNAN, M; MAWALKAR, SR			TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY - PRELIMINARY-RESULTS OF AN EMPIRICAL-STUDY OF CANADIAN ORGANIZATIONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							1980 GENERIC STRATEGIES; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; CORPORATE-STRATEGY; AMERICAN DATA; SERVICES; PERFORMANCE; WEAPON; SHAPE	The strategic use of information technology (IT) has received considerable attention in academic circles from the 1980s on and researchers have put forward several prescriptive models which businesses could adopt in order to identify the strategic potential of IT in business, Most of them tried to rationalize their theories using a limited number of success stories originating largely from American multinational corporations. Unfortunately. so far, very little empirical research has been conducted to examine the general validity of the ivory tower theories. Our project which was conducted in Montreal using a large number of Canadian companies has been an attempt to discover if we can find any evidence of the impact of academic theories on the real world of business. This paper addresses three main themes: Do Canadian organizations have a corporate IT strategy? Are organizations in Canada using IT in a strategic fashion? Can we identify any difference between the service and manufacturing sectors concerning the use of IT? In order to achieve these objectives we used two methods. Since there is overwhelming evidence in the management literature that the Chief Executive Officer's annual report to shareholders can serve as a convenient keyhole through which one can observe the evolution of corporate strategy, our first approach involved an examination of a random sample of such reports of 39 companies to see if IT matters figured prominently in them, Secondly we used a questionnaire survey of a fairly large number of companies, which formed the major part of our investigation, to ascertain top management commitment to IT as well as the external orientation of IT systems in order to address the competitive forces faced by companies.

J	MASTEN, J; HARTMANN, GB; SAFARI, A				MASTEN, J; HARTMANN, GB; SAFARI, A			SMALL BUSINESS STRATEGIC-PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER - THE USE OF PUBLICLY SUPPORTED TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE AGENCIES	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A questionnaire was mailed to the 404 small manufacturing firms in middle Tennessee. This article is based on the 123 questionnaires that were returned. The survey was developed to test a conceptual framework which describes the technology transfer process from public agencies to small manufacturers. The paper suggests that selecting technology is part of the strategic planning process. External variables such as competition and internal variables such as production problems are correlated with awareness of, prior use of, and plans for use of the transfer agents. The article concludes that although there is little awareness of these agencies by small businesses, the prior use of these agencies will lead to the future use of them. In addition, sales growth and response to foreign competition are significantly correlated with awareness of, prior use of, and plans for using the agencies. The speed of change in technological development and level of technical sophistication both in the industry and the firm were correlated with the awareness of, prior use of, and plans for using the agencies. Suggestions for improving the network between small businesses and these agencies are presented.			MASTEN, J (corresponding author), TENNESSEE STATE UNIV,COLL BUSINESS,NASHVILLE,TN 37203, USA.

The study explores whether the NCCB responds to shifts in the abortion policy environment by varying its self-presentation on abortion generally over time, across specific fora over time, or in response to actual or impending changes in abortion policy within particular time periods. The study found that from Roe to Webster, there was a significant increase in the complexity of the NCCB's general public and legal arguments and a decrease in the complexity of its congressional statements. A significant time-by-forum interaction suggested that fluctuations in the complexity of the Church's arguments were due to the strategic responsiveness of the Church to cyclical shifts in the fortunes of the pro-life agenda.

Too strong a braking produces skid, which is an undesirable condition, while weak breaking results in a long landing run. The shortest possible (optimal) landing run without any skidding requires a variable braking force to match the frictional force at all times. The maximum allowable braking force at any instant is a random variable as the ground-induced excitation and the frictional force between the wheel and the tyre are random in nature. In view of the time lag in the actuation of a servo system and its completion of the execution, a one-step prediction is employed to obtain the braking force required at a future instant. This brake management system has been tried on a simple aircraft model. The scheme is found to work well with the model.

J	JOHNSTON, S				JOHNSTON, S			MANAGERIAL DOMINANCE OF JAPAN MAJOR CORPORATIONS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							FINANCIAL STRUCTURE	This paper presents a model which suggests that four factors-financial and ownership structure, an industrial encouragement policy, barriers to entry and the labor market-combine to produce a situation in which Japanese management is freed from all the major threats to its dominance-shareholders, trade unions, government, domestic competitors, domestic speculators, foreign competitors and foreign capital. Hence, in line with classical managerial theories of the firm, Japanese managers have developed the long run strategies and policies that ape typical of the large Japanese corporations-market share emphasis, slow personnel evaluation, MIT systems, etc. Some suggestions for further work are offered.

J	MEYER, HD				MEYER, HD			ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL DISCOURSE - BUREAUCRACY BETWEEN 2 WORLDS	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						CULTURE; ORGANIZATIONS; BUREAUCRACY	FORMAL-STRUCTURE	The controversy around Weber's theory of bureaucracy that occupied post-war American organization theorists serves as a backdrop to consider differences in the institutional and cultural environments of American and continental European, notably German, organizations. I suggest that formal organizations in the United Slates emerged under institutional and cultural conditions sufficiently different from those Weber witnessed as to account for the differences in the European and American organizational discourses. European institutional-cultural conditions favored a centralized. hierarchical, obedience-based organizational form with little uncertainty tolerance emphasizing loyalty. In the US, by contrast, the primacy of the large business organization which operated in volatile markets under the cultural imperative of equality favored flatter. less hierarchical, and more nearly decomposable organizations in which compliance was based on a temporary contract. Indifference vis-a-vis the national and cultural particulars of formal organizations may have led early organization research to prematurely close off a potentially fruitful line of inquiry in the field of comparative organization.

J	BOETTGER, RD; GREER, CR				BOETTGER, RD; GREER, CR			ON THE WISDOM OF REWARDING A WHILE HOPING FOR B	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						REWARD SYSTEMS; COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONS; STRATEGIC HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATION DESIGN	SELF-INTEREST; VOTER CHOICE; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; POLITICS; SYSTEMS	We explain the deeper organizational wisdom behind what Steven Kerr called the ''folly'' of seemingly inconsistent reward structures. Modern organizations-even those Kerr specifically criticizes as ''fouled-up''-frequently need to serve two contradictory goals at the same time. Three conditions in particular require sophisticated organizations to reward A while nonetheless hoping for B. First, operative goals-e.g., for a police department-may require practical activities like ''social work'' that do not conform to the official culture of ''crime fighting command bureaucracy.'' Attempting to reward only those police activities which support the official goals would harm both the force and the citizens they serve. Second, times of great change-e.g., for environmental clean-up in Eastern Europe-require short-term inconsistencies such as supporting a highly polluting factory in order to accomplish long term ends. At one moment in time, a snapshot exposes a ''foolish'' inconsistency, but a long-term view reveals the wisdom of not attempting to treat complex problems with simple solutions. Third, some conditions of the real world will always require the individual to serve two masters, as in a classic matrix structure. Product and functional demands cannot be made perfectly consistent with each other, and to expect the organization to make them so is to wish for the impossible. Under the above conditions, it is better to teach individuals how to handle complex, inconsistent demands than it is to hold organizations responsible for eliminating them. While Kerr would work towards an organization in which ''no one needs goodness,'' we would hold our teaching and training systems responsible for making ''goodness'' and complexity part of the talent an individual brings to the organization. To put complexity and goodness beyond the individual and entirely in the province of the organization is to demand of the organization the impossible, and demean the human beings who are its substance and soul.

The ultimate purpose of this paper is to find underlying principles in successfully managing large-scale projects or programs which involve collaborative efforts of public and private sectors in the context of developing countries. For this purpose, this paper takes a system-analytic approach to the innovation process and strategic changes. From the process perspective, it explains dynamics of the technology development process of a Korean telecommunications industry and its strategic changes along three development stages: initiation, early, and late internalization stages, From the strategy perspective, some underlying principles behind the successful technology development process are identified: the focused-and-phased, the buy-for-make, and the harmonized collaboration-and-competition approaches. Finally, implications for researchers and policy makers are discussed.

A competitive advantage, in turn, increasingly will require knowledge-intensive high-value-added content in each operating system. The degree of value-added is measurable in terms of various forms of 'productivity' (performance/cost), but conventional measures of productivity are limited in their usefulness. Output divided by labour, or output divided by labour plus capital, do not adequately assess the degree of knowledge-intensive value-added content of an operation. More sophisticated forms of productivity measurement have been developed which have been demonstrated to have a high correlation with success. Much improved strategic allocation of always limited resources can result.			MERRIFIELD, DB (corresponding author), UNIV PENN,WHARTON SCH BUSINESS,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104, USA.

The study took place in an organization which manufactures car components and is the subsidiary of a major UK company. At the operational level there was considerable confusion about the objectives of CIM and consequently it had been poorly utilized. A number of suggestions were made to ensure more effective use of CIM. However, as a result of political factors within the organization there was a shift in emphasis from CIM to strategic sourcing.

Nevertheless, it embodies a significant concept related to guiding an organisation from present realities, through opportunities and hazards, to a viable future. Until recently a typical general practice could assume a stable external environment, but now it is caught up in the uncertainties stemming from the NHS reforms. For such a practice to undertake effective strategic planning it will have to develop a vision connecting the present with aspirations for the future. While vision is usually considered to be an individual talent, it is possible to develop a collective organisational vision within a general practice, and the small size of general practices makes this relatively easy. The vision needs to be broad; it needs to be continuous; and its capacity to predict the future needs to be monitored.

Some practitioners would like it believed that the principles of marketing apply to all sectors of commerce, while many in the agency/fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) world believe that the marketers in the fast rising sector of services are lagging behind in both their understanding of marketing and the implementation of marketing practices. This article examines marketing, its definition, scope and use in the context of leisure facilities, broadly defined, in the UK. While training for such marketing may not be formalised, and the strategic direction may not always be in the hands of the marketers concerned, the tactical fundamentals of marketing management exist with a conviction worthy of the envy of many FMCG/industrial marketers.

It emphasizes crucial turning points that finally led the author from antifascist radical intellectual to established member of the American sociological community. It attempts to show lines of divergence but also lines of continuity in his thought and contributions. This essay attempts to show the extent to which his background influenced the themes and orientations of his sociological work. The paper may be read as a contribution to the sociology of knowledge from the autobiographical point of view. It stresses the various stages of the author's career and attempts to show the extent to which these stages are reflected in his writings and general orientations. The paper closes with a bird's eye view of the recent past and the probable future of American sociological thought.

J	SALBU, SR				SALBU, SR			CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIVENESS - CHOOSING BETWEEN HIERARCHICAL AND CONTRACTUAL CONTROL	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article							GOVERNANCE	Metaphors from strategic management can be applied effectively to business ethics programs. While effective strategies help implement ethical decisions that are formulated in good faith, ostensibly value-neutral control mechanisms can indirectly affect die substantive nature of policies and decisions themselves. This article examines the effectiveness of various corporate social responsibility implementation strategies. it also addresses the effects of implementation choices on die substantive formulation of ethical decisions and policies. Implementation and evaluation of corporate social responsibility programs through models of responsiveness are integrated into the social policy cycle using four tools: strategic control and performance control approaches, and hierarchical control and contractual control structures. The choices made among these forms of control approaches and structures, which as implementation mechanisms are typically considered to be value-free devices, may affect the substance of corporate social responsibility content. Hierarchical control structures, which use outside directors, tend to be associated with performance control approaches, and are biased towards applying utilitarian approaches to ethical decision making. Contractual control structures are compatable with strategic control approaches, and generally favor the application of principle-based approaches to ethical decision-making. Both the content and the quality of ethical decisions will be affected by differences between hierarchical and contractual control.

J	RIND, B				RIND, B			EFFECTS OF IMPRESSIONS OF AMAZEMENT AND FOOLISHNESS ON COMPLIANCE	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article								Impression management theory maintains that the use of strategic tactics such as self-promotion can influence targets in desired directions. Self-promotion concerns an actor's attempts to establish an image of competence. In this study, a confederate attempted to sell raffle tickets to targets after promoting himself by amazing his targets with his extraordinary calculating skills (high competence), making a fool of himself by exhibiting calculating skills falling far short of pretensions (low competence), or making no impression at all. Amazing targets was achieved by communicating with the experimenter using a concealed communications device. It was found that amazement increased compliance substantially over foolishness and making no impression, while foolishness yielded the same degree of compliance as making no impression. Thus, the utility of self-promotion in influencing others, as predicted by impression management theory, received empirical support.

Results indicate that a person's Type A characteristics were related to both how the environment was perceived and a firm's strategic direction. Specifically, Type A executives with Type A personalities perceived the environment as more dynamic and were more likely to seek external diversification than were executives with Type B personalities. The results are discussed in terms of (a) the implications of the use of the Type A, coronary-prone behavior pattern in leadership and top management research and (b) the potential impact of the measure of Type A personality on the selection of managers.

The model results were used to address the strategic questions of determining the required resource levels. to provide justification for additional resources in the budget process, and to establish performance guidelines. A nonlinear behavioral model of a fisherman's probability of violation that explicitly accounted for the deterrent effect of the aircraft patrols was the basis for calculating the expected value of a patrol. The model represented a major advance in characterizing program effectiveness for the fisheries law enforcement program, providing, for the first time, a quantified estimate of deterrence and a defensible analytic basis for determining aircraft needs.

J	SAKAMOTO, A; CHEN, MD				SAKAMOTO, A; CHEN, MD			FURTHER EVIDENCE ON RETURNS TO SCHOOLING BY ESTABLISHMENT SIZE	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article							EMPLOYER SIZE; LABOR-MARKETS; STRATIFICATION; LEVEL; WAGES	Stolzenberg (1978) has argued that for white male employees the effect of schooling on log-earnings is greater in larger establishments. We replicate Stolzenberg's study using the 1979 Current Population Survey. This survey includes information on establishment size and provides a much larger sample size to work with. Our results do not indicate a positive establishment size/schooling interaction. To the contrary, when Stolzenberg's (1978) model specification is used, our findings suggest that the interaction may be negative. We explore the sources of this discrepancy and are skeptical of the conventional wisdom that returns to schooling increase with establishment size.

The western coal industry has a number of opportunities for expansion, but these depend on its ability to remain competitive. Transport accounts for over 60% of final selling price, so it is particularly important that this is organized efficiently. A simulation model was built to evaluate alternative routes across Canada. Many organizations are involved in this movement, so the model provides a range of information. This requires a substantial database to describe all aspects of operations. The information supplied by the model can help in making strategic decisions in a number of areas.

J	Lyytinen, K; Klein, H; Hirschheim, R				Lyytinen, K.; Klein, H.; Hirschheim, R.			The effectiveness of office information systems: a social action perspective	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						effectiveness; human activity systems; office information systems; social action; social systems		The purpose of this paper is to show that a number of basic issues have not been adequately addressed in existing office information systems research. Prominent among these are the nature and role of offices, the goals of office information systems development, and the nature of its organizational and managerial consequences. It is proposed that off ice information systems should be analysed as social action systems the behaviour of which is strongly affected by socially determined forces and constraints such as the behaviour-channelling influences of authority, norms, customs, habits and precedence. Four types of social action are discussed: instrumental, strategic, communicative and discursive. Three contexts for perceiving and analysing the effects of social action in offices are introduced: technology, language and organization. Office information systems changes affect elements and relationships in these three contexts in different ways. By cross-relating social action types and contexts, nine classes of object systems are identified. Each object system class implies a different category of effectiveness concerns which in turn implies different office information system design requirements. The paper notes that the existing research literature has primarily been concerned with only three of the nine object systems. For more effective office information systems development, however, the other systems also need to be considered. The paper concludes by exploring how this may be done.

J	SAWHNEY, RS				SAWHNEY, RS			AN ACTIVITY-BASED APPROACH FOR EVALUATING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN MANUFACTURING COMPANIES	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; BUSINESS STRATEGY; COST JUSTIFICATION; EXPERT SYSTEMS; MANUFACTURING SYSTEM JUSTIFICATION		The methodology presented in this paper is a non-traditional approach for evaluating capital-intensive advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). More specifically, this methodology is developed to evaluate AMT investments that are heavily influenced by non-financial considerations and that also present significant financial and operational risks to the firm. This approach is formulated based on operationalizing state-of-the-art investment management principles, with an objective of selecting and implementing AMT investments that provide the greatest improvement to production-related activities as measured by critical success factors. A knowledge-based expert system, SAAMI, is also developed to guide decision makers through this new approach. The results of the alpha test site case study highlight the acceptance of the results of this methodology by several prominent US organizations. The methodology produces new dimensions of information that complement and/or substitute traditional justification techniques for evaluating AMT investment proposals.

The contention is that this necessitates linking the process of managing technological change with the environment in which it occurs. The paper therefore explores: the connection between business strategy and technology management; the need to appreciate technology in terms of products, production processes and people; and highlights the 'complementary assets' required. It points out the opportunities as well as the pitfalls in the process of managing technological changes, and synthesizes work from a range of approaches. One example of technology management is considered from the automobile industry.

To handle such a situation, TRW's Space and Defense Sector management authorized a new integrated voice and data digital network for 20,000 employees located in 65 buildings. TRW's top management saw the network as an opportunity to integrate the company's islands of information, which were isolated within separate data networks. The project took four and one half years from design to implementation at a cost of $45 million. The management techniques employed resulted in critical milestones being met not only on time but also 10 percent under the original budget. The new network provided a single access mechanism that resulted in some unanticipated advantages that went beyond the original goals of fast response and cost containment. The network successfully addressed such problems as developing effective data networking policies, network sizing in a multi-vendor environment, sharing excess information system capacity, centralizing the network while keeping the information systems decentralized, and overcoming the "not controlled here" syndrome. TRW's experiences should prove valuable for large information-intensive companies attempting to meet similar challenges.

J	Ray, A				Ray, Asok			Sequential Testing for Fault Detection in Multiply-Redundant Systems	JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article								The paper presents the theory and application of a sequential test procedure for fault detection and isolation (FDI). The test procedure is suited for development of intelligent instrumentation in strategic processes like aircraft and nuclear plants where redundant measurements are usually available for individual critical variables. The algorithm of the test procedure is formulated by use of (1) a generic redundancy management procedure which is essentially independent of the fault detection strategy and measurement noise statistics, and (2) a modified version of sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) algorithm for fault detection and isolation, which functions within the framework of the aforesaid redundancy management procedure. The sequential test procedure is suitable for real-time applications using commercially available microcomputers and its efficacy has been verified by on-line fault detection in an operating nuclear reactor.

THE FINANCIAL PLANNING SYSTEM AT LOUISIANA NATIONAL BANK	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Financial modeling; simulation; forecasting; banking MIS; financial planning; decision support system		In 1974 Louisiana National Bank designed and implemented a Financial Planning System. For the past five years, it has been the primary reporting, analysis, and decision support tool for the Budget Committee and the primary source of financial reports for the Board of Directors. Top management of the Bank believes that, as a direct result of the use of this System, Louisiana National Bank: 1. reversed a decreasing profit trend by increasing profits more than 92% in one year, 2. creatively managed the Bank's liquidity during severe market pressures, 3. restructured the Bank's asset/liability management policies to better align with newly perceived market and investment potential, and 4. sharply reduced the cost and management burden of reporting to regulators. In addition to the quantifiable benefits cited above, use of the System resulted in several other improvements, including 1. a reduction in the amount of time required to meet periodic management reporting requirements, 2. increased understanding of financial reports by the Board of Directors, 3. improved communications between Bank executives and regulatory examiners, and 4. a discipline and structure within which the Budget Committee could establish goals and action plans. The Financial Planning System supports financial decision making at both the tactical and strategic levels. It is an integrated system which includes reporting and analysis of historical data, long and short range forecasting, and modeling.

J	Taggart, WM; Silbey, V				Taggart, William M.; Silbey, Valdur			A "BALANCED" ORIENTATION FOR THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS MANAGER	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Information systems department; user orientation; systems professional orientation; stage of systems evolution; systems manager activity		The orientation of an information systems department is influenced by the emphasis shown in the manager's activities. Each incident in the manager's daily work is another bead strung on a necklace. The choice of what type of bead it should be is up to the manager. Every incident permits a choice of emphasis: either a systems professional or a user community orientation. Recent analyses suggest that a new breed of information systems manager must emerge for advanced systems in organizations. Some of these analyses emphasize the user view without pointing to the continuing need for systems competence. Lest the pendulum swing too far in the opposite direction by ignoring technical aspects, this analysis suggests that the emerging information systems manager must bring a "balanced" systems and user orientation to the position. In so doing, the manager establishes the organizational climate in which the information systems activity proceeds.
