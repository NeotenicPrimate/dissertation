J	Hamelin, N; Nwankwo, S				Hamelin, Nicolas; Nwankwo, Sonny			Managing the environment, people and herds: sustainability of the Moroccan cedar forest	WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Sustainable development; Sustainable environment		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of human factor on ecological conditions of Moroccan cedar forest with a view to drawing out implication for sustainable forest management. The study is set against the backdrop of the global depletion of natural capital in a rare axis which, if not brought under an integrated sustainability purview, might lead to the extinction of this quickly receding natural resource. Design/methodology/approach - Data for this research are mined from publicly held databases but processed through a time series regression analysis in a way that measures variations in ecological/environmental variables. Findings - Findings reveal that changes in precipitation and temperature account for a small but significant amount of variation during the period 1940-2006. However, most of the decline is attributable to human activities such as overgrazing and illegal logging. These are having far-reaching implications for forest conservation management. Originality/value - Human agency, more than any effect of nature, is chiefly responsible for the unsustainable development in this sphere of natural capital. Whilst this may not altogether constitute new knowledge, the paper highlights ambivalent positions that both promote and constrain efforts to sustain cedar forest. Its novelty lies not only in the empirical substantiation it affords but also in ferreting out strategic initiatives to dis-incentivise unsustainable exploitation of this important aspect of natural capital.

J	Hipkin, I				Hipkin, Ian			Nuclear electricity generation in South Africa: a study of strategic innovation for sustainability	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Innovation; Sustainability; South Africa; Utility; Emerging markets; Electricity; Nuclear power; Capital projects		Purpose - The literature on sustainable business development in emerging economies deals predominantly with the entry modes of multinationals and how they adapt to local conditions. Little has been written on how organisations in developing countries innovate and employ innovations in a sustainable manner. This paper presents a case study of an innovation business in a partially developed country, but which was taken over by a South African organisation. The purpose of this paper is to study why the venture failed and what lessons this case study offers to future developing country innovators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper refers to the literature that addresses business projects in emerging countries and analyses the actions of a South African company that set out to develop commercial nuclear electricity generation using the pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) technology.The approach adopted in the paper is an assessment of the events and actions that led to the project's failure. Findings - The management of the project was flawed from the start because of a lack of measurable milestones and budgetary constraints. The South African government continued to fund the project while not controlling it. Technically, the project was too ambitious and it is not certain whether the project could ever have come to fruition. Research limitations/implications - The generalisability of results from case study research needs to be treated with some caution, but similar findings in different contexts may strengthen internal validity, and in turn lead to wider generalisability. Practical implications - The paper reinforces the challenges faced by businesses in emerging countries when developing innovative products. The need for financial control and technical milestones is emphasised even though innovations are by definition uncertain. Social implications - The benefits from the PBMR could have been significant, but the project failed at a cost of $1bn, which a country such as South Africa could ill afford. The knowledge gained during the duration of the project will be of little benefit to the country, particularly as the knowledge context was extremely narrow. Originality/value - The paper addresses a topic that has not been dealt with before in the academic literature. It highlights a number of shortcomings in the way in which a developing country embarked on an innovative project.

In this contest, the present work proposes the description of a model able to support coordinated strategic choices continually made by Supply Chain (SC) actors. The final objective is achievement of the full optimisation of Merchandise & Replenishment Planning phases, identifying the right replenishment quantities and periods. To test the proposed model's effectiveness, it was applied to an important Italian fashion company in the complex field of fast-fashion, a sector in which promptness is a main competitive leverage and, therefore, the planning cannot exclude the time variable. The passage from a total push strategy, currently used by the company, to a push-pull one, suggested by the model, allowed us not only to estimate a reduction in goods quantities to purchase at the beginning of a sales period (with considerable economic savings), but also elaborate a focused replenishment plan that permits reduction and optimisation of departures from network warehouses to Points of Sale (POS).

J	Jalal-Karim, A				Jalal-Karim, Akram			Evaluating the impact of information security on enhancing the business decision-making process	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Information security; Decision-making process; Decision making; Information management		Purpose - In today's digital economy, information secrecy is one of the essential apprehensions for businesses. Because of the uncertainty and multiple interpretations, most of the reviewed literature regarding business decision-making revealed that decisions tend to be more fluid, inaccurate, and informal. Recently, the number of organizations that have disclosed their information has been raised. The aim of this research is to theorize and empirically measure the effects of information disclosure on the accuracy of business decision-making. Design/methodology/approach - This study presents a proposed conceptual framework, which assists businesses in evaluating the extent to which information secrecy has a substantial effect on decision-making accuracy. The primary research purpose is explanatory and the conceptual framework was empirically tested to measure the effects of the proposed five independent variables: information security rules and regulations, secured internal and external business communication, security consciousness management support, business security culture, and superior deterrent efforts on efficient information security, the consequences of which on accurate decision-making processes are considered a dependent variable. Findings - The results of this study, which are based on the use of the proposed conceptual framework, indicate that information security has a substantial effect on generating accurate, effective and efficient business decisions. Information security could undermine decision accuracy when information collected has little effect on the purpose and time of decisions. Originality/value - The findings of this study present some insights into the strategic choices of any organizations and, to improve the efficiency of the decisions taken, they must improve the level and efficiency of information secrecy.

J	Kang, MJ				Kang, Minjeong			When an Organizational Message Resonates With Personal Values of Publics: Implications for Strategic Communication Management	ATLANTIC JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			English	Article								Identifying and understanding key audiences are the most essential process in strategic communication management to tailor messages to avoid misinterpretation and, more important, to engage in effective communication with key audiences to understand their values. The purpose of this study is to apply the concept of value proximity to examine its effects on people's attitudes toward an organization. To do so, this study adopted the notion of conceptual fluency to examine the moderating role of personal values, such as pro-environment versus pro-development. The key finding of this study is that individual publics' company attitudes are significantly enhanced by the degree of value proximity in organizational messages. The implications of the findings of this study are that the same message can be interpreted differently by various people, depending on factors such as prior exposure to certain messages (priming), personal values of publics, and the degree of association between the two (value proximity). These findings highlight the importance of understanding target audiences' values for strategic development of communication messages.

J	Karim, KE; Pinsker, R; Robin, A				Karim, Khondkar E.; Pinsker, Robert; Robin, Ashok			Firm size and the voluntary disclosure of nonfinancial information by private versus public firm managers	MANAGERIAL AUDITING JOURNAL			English	Article						Private manager judgments; Public manager judgments; Qualitative materiality; Strategic voluntary disclosure		Purpose - The specific purpose of this study is to understand how firm size and public/ private affiliation (employment status) affect voluntary disclosure decisions concerning quantitatively immaterial nonfinancial information. Although the prior disclosure literature is large and has considered a variety of factors including size and to a lesser degree employment status, this study offers a new perspective by considering both factors in the context of qualitative materiality. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents 136 manager participants with 24 cues representing nonfinancial, realistic business events and solicits their disclosure judgments. The cues are adapted from Pinsker et al. and contain information that does not meet widely-accepted quantitative thresholds for disclosure (e. g. 5 percent of net income), yet were identified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as more likely to be material. This paper uses a median split of total assets and total revenues to determine "large" and "small" firms. Managers' judgments are measured in an own-firm setting (The context is their current employer, which can be public or private.). Findings - This paper finds that disclosure is positively linked to firm size, but this paper do not find an employer status effect. Additional testing reveals that private firm managers are sensitive to SEC oversight and other external, competitive pressures, suggesting that they face mimetic pressures to behave like their public firm counterparts. In sum, their findings contribute significantly to the disclosure, strategic management, institutional theory and judgment-and-decision-making (JDM) literatures. Originality/value - Although there is a vast literature on public firm managers' voluntary disclosure behavior (mostly involving large firms), there is little research regarding the voluntary disclosure behavior of small or large private firm managers involving nonfinancial information.

J	Kastberg, G				Kastberg, Gustaf			Separation and reconnection episodic organizational arenas in the strategic process	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Episodes; Strategic; Social systems; Strategy; Luhmann; Strategic planning; Organizational processes	AS-PRACTICE; MEETINGS	Purpose - Within the strategy as practice field several studies have recently paid attention to organizational arenas like meetings, workshops and away-days. There has, however, been a tendency to focus on what happens " inside" separated organizational arenas. The aim of the paper is to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the separated organizational arenas and other organizational activities in the strategizing process. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is conceptual. The framework rests on Niklas Luhmann's social systems theory and draws on recent empirical studies. Findings - The main contribution of the article is the presentation of a theoretically well-founded framework that further specifies and problematizes the relationships of separated organizational arenas. By focusing and conceptualizing the conditions for separation and reconnection, a foundation for analyzing the interconnectedness between different arenas is provided. Practical implications - The paper contributes to our understanding of phenomena like meetings and work-shops in the strategic process. Originality/value - The framework is in line with, and expands the theorizing that Hendry and Seidl (2003) initiated about strategic episodes and the theorizing about first and second order observations in strategic processes initiated by Schreyogg and Kliesch-Eberl (2007).

J	Keraminiyage, K				Keraminiyage, Kaushal			AN IN-MODULE WORK PRACTICE STRATEGY FOR VOCATIONALLY ORIENTED CONSTRUCTION DEGREE PROGRAMMES: THE CASE OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROJECT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Work based training; Vocationally oriented construction degree programmes; Group projects; Group assessments; Peer evaluations	QUALITY	Students who are enrolled in vocationally oriented construction degree programmes can immensely benefit from work practice arrangements. Traditionally such work practice arrangements are organised as a "placement year" during or immediately after the degree programme. Further, these arrangements are often "work place based" practice arrangements requiring students to be based at the work place during the practice period. This system has some significant issues, especially when considering how and when the "learning" takes place. "Multi-disciplinary project" is a module designed to be a part of a vocationally oriented, combined construction undergraduate programme at the University of Salford, United Kingdom, aiming to overcome the issues of work place based work practice arrangements. As a part of this paper, pedagogical principles behind the module design are evaluated based on current literature, examining how previous research have informed the design of this module. Issues encountered during the delivery of the module are also discussed within this paper, based on the unstructured data collected while responding to student inquires and through observations. Nature of those issues are analysed by revisiting current literature, and possible solutions are discussed based on the findings of some of the previous research projects.

J	Kim, JR; Cha, H				Kim, Jangyul Robert; Cha, Heewon			The Effect of Public Relations and Corporate Reputation on Return on Investment	ASIA PACIFIC PUBLIC RELATIONS JOURNAL			English	Article						public relations; corporate reputation; reputation management; ROI; South Korea		The tangible value of public relations to corporations remains unsolved in the domain of public relations research. It is similar in the case of quantitatively proving the value of corporate reputation. In general, it is regarded that public relations is an effective strategy to acquire a higher corporate reputation that would ultimately contribute to the organisations' return on investment (ROI). This study attempted to identify the causal relationships among variables such as organisation size and complexity, public relations department size and formality, and corporate reputation, and how these variables affected economic ROI. The top 300 South Korean corporations were surveyed and their responses were analysed using structural equation modelling. Sizes of public relations departments and organisations were the most important variables affecting ROI. Both public relations and corporate reputation positively affected ROI. There was a positive correlation between the complexity of an organisation, and the size and formality of a public relations department. This suggested that even a smaller corporation could enhance its reputation and thus ROI by having a well-established public relations or strategic communication department. Implication of findings and suggestions for future study were made.

Studies show it is possible to narrow the gap between expected and actual energy consumption if technical performance, occupant behaviour, and management systems are considered together. In the United Kingdom, industries and universities have created 'Carbon Buzz' based on the principles of Evidence Based Design. Following on from this project, Rome Tre University, together with UCL and Aedas R&D, are developing a platform using structured data and comparisons to create a link between energy performance and CO2 emissions, and choices regarding design, technology, and management.

J	King, DR				King, David R.			Managing uncertainty: lessons from Xenophon's retreat	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT HISTORY			English	Article						Organizational learning; Strategic change; Innovation; Uncertainty management; Management theory; Organizational change		Purpose - The article's purpose is to address complementary perspectives for managing uncertainty by looking at a historical example. Design/methodology/approach - This is done using a case study of the experience of ancient Greek mercenaries that fought in and out of Persia over two years and approximately 2,000 miles. Findings - An unexpected finding is that the size of an organization can be instrumental to its environment fit. Research limitations/implications - An implication is that the application of existing models to the historical example suggests existing perspectives of change do not appear adequate individually in explaining or preparing organizations for change. Practical implications - A wider implication of the study involves confirming the need for research and society to better understand the role of organization politics in outcomes. Originality/value - The study uses a unique historical example to examine organizational responses to uncertainty that range between rational and haphazard explanations and it offers insights for management thought and practice today.

J	Krane, HP; Olsson, NOE				Krane, Hans Petter; Olsson, Nils O. E.			Uncertainty management of projects from the owners' perspective, with main focus on managing delivered functionality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Risk; Uncertainty management; Operational risk; Project objectives; Project ownership; Strategic risk		Purpose - This paper aims to report on the work on a doctoral thesis studying uncertainty management of projects. The thesis was in particular studying uncertainty regarding the functionality that the project should deliver. The research also addresses how the project owner's views and interests are taken care of, and the relation between the project management and the project owner in this uncertainty management. The purpose of the paper is not only to report the research findings and conclusions, but also to give insight into the research process - the researcher's "journey" in his work with the thesis is described and also some main issues regarding the context of the research. Design/methodology/approach - The research work that is reported on was carried out applying a combined research approach utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data. The research was mainly based on two case studies - one made up of two projects in the railway sector, and one consisting of seven projects in the energy sector. In both the studies, qualitative techniques were applied: interviews, observations and documentation studies. In the study in the energy sector, there was also made a quantitative study using data from the risk registers of the seven projects, with a total of almost 1,500 risk items. Findings - The study shows that the projects' uncertainty management did not have a project owner's perspective, but was mainly focused on the success factors of the project management. In the quantitative part of the studies, it was found that a great majority (91 percent) of the risk elements in the projects studied were operational risks, i.e. risks mainly concerning the projects' operational goals. Also, most of the projects' risk elements were threats (67 percent). Originality/value - There appears to be a paucity of similar studies of uncertainty management in projects undertaken in the project management research literature. Developing a better focus on the project owner and uncertainty regarding the projects' effects was found to be the main value of the work.

J	Lee, JM; Lee, KH; Kim, DS				Lee, Jung-Min; Lee, Kyung-Ho; Kim, Dae-Seok			Cloud-Based RF-Inspection for Ship Maintenance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								Smart work services can help to reduce work time and help to remove irrational processes in the process of product management, by providing proper information promptly. To make the smart work environment, the system has to be in a data-driven manner so that the data can keep its consistency. Preexisting data acquisition method in inspection job is almost based on documents or handover from other engineers. However, sometimes it produces inconsistent data which is different from updated information and it leads to potential risk factors. To prevent and reduce inconstant information between users and updated information, this paper suggests radio-frequency identification device (RFID) and cloud technology.

J	Fernandez, BL; Gonzalez-Busto, B; Castano, YA				Lopez Fernandez, Begona; Gonzalez-Busto, Begona; Alvarez Castano, Yolanda			The Dynamics of Growth in Franchising	JOURNAL OF MARKETING CHANNELS			English	Article						contract mixing; franchising; growth; simulation; system dynamics; vertical integration		A franchise company is a hybrid or plural form, typically established by both company-owned units and franchised units, where the latter receive an entire business format. We explore the reasons that explain franchise chain growth and how franchising firms choose the extent of company ownership. We build a dynamic model including contractual and system variables such as fees, royalties, investment, chain size, or trade name recognition. By means of this model, we go on to analyze the dynamic behavior of a chain and how its ownership structure evolves over time as a result of the interaction of the variables mentioned above. Using theories from strategic management and agency models, it is argued that franchise chains pursue a balanced growth that lead to superior performance.

Considering this scenario, the increasing number of participants in this supply chain is foreseen to supply the demand of goods and services, especially in the technological development area. The paper intends to evaluate the collaborative development capacity and respective measurements of performance on these partnerships established between customer and suppliers, through qualitative research with a sample of Brazilian oil and gas market representative. Design/methodology/approach: This paper intends to verify if the co-creation performance is measured after an implementation, specific in a restricted industry. The methodology consists in a bibliographical research to support the study, and it also had a questionnaire sent to Brazilian companies that take part of the oil and natural gas industry supply chain, to analyze if the results of co-creation activities are measured by this group of companies, to verify its attractiveness to develop the co-creation usage or change the type of partnership with the market. Findings: The misunderstanding of co-creation and technical partnership was noticed. The usage of teams working together from two or more organizations cannot be considered as a co-creation, because the relationship and obligations are different between these two ways of workgroup. But the companies of oil and gas industry, when questioned, were able to distinguish it, avoiding risks of incorrect results motivated by wrong interpretation of the paper content. Research limitations/implications: As related in the paper, eight companies were invited to take part on the questionnaire about co-creation, but only 50% answered it. The research should have a better result of this subject if it had been developed with more answers of Brazilian oil and gas industry companies. Originality/value: Even this kind of partnership is used in oil and natural gas industrial segment, the measurement isn't correct used. The value of this paper is to show that companies that are using co-creation could detect the best opportunities to apply it, due to the attractiveness that each situation can generate.

President Rafael Correa has sought to strengthen Ecuadorian state capacity by making use of geographically rooted 'territorial strategic assets' as a means of positioning the state within regional and trans-regional political economic frameworks, thereby lending importance to Ecuador as an economic and political actor in its own right.

Excellence creates a range of voluntary and selected behaviors that are not a part of formal nursing duties, but are practiced by some nurses and effectively improve their duties and professional roles. The dynamic nature of the nursing profession and the need for professional effectiveness has revealed the ever-increasing need for the organization of a competent generation of nurses. This research aimed to explain the process of developing professional excellence in nurses, assisted by the "Grounded Theory." Factors affecting the formation of such behaviors were also explored. Methods: This qualitative study was carried out on the basis of the "Grounded Theory" of Corbin & Strauss copy in 2008. Participants in this study included nurses from different ranks, except for first participants who were selected based on assigned indicators. Others were selected by the "Snowball Sampling Method." Data were collected through the semi-structure interview of 15 participants. Results: From 1,450 primary codes, 32 primary categories, eight subcategories, and three themes were derived in the frame of a conceptual model, with the conceptual themes consisting of professional behavior, strategic professional insight, and the establishment of professional talents management. The core variable and the basic social psychological process in this study was the professional extra role behavior, and the theory offered is the nursing professional excellence. Conclusion: Self-direction, the ability to lead others, and the management of duties and responsibilities relevant to nursing sociability are some effective factors in the Nursing Professional Excellence process. Professional excellence results from the combination of a favorable, supportive environment and the individual perspective approach.

J	Nessel, K				Nessel, Karolina			A Born Global Gradually Advancing Its Internationalization - a Case Study of Internationalization Process of a Small Tour Operator in a Niche Market	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION			English	Article						SMEs; internationalization; stage models; behavioral models; born global firms; international new ventures; international entrepreneurship; tourism industry; tour operator; niche market	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; EXPORT BEHAVIOR; FIRM; CAPABILITIES; VENTURES; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; MODEL; ENTRY	Today much is already known about the internationalization patterns of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, the research has mainly focused on outward internationalization and more in manufacturing industry than in services (and hardly in the tourism industry). Thus, the paper undertakes an exploratory research in order to verify to what extent the common framework of analysis may explain an internationalization path of SMEs in the tourism sector. To this goal, a case study of a small tour operator in a niche market of weddings abroad in Poland is undertaken. The research seeks to match the firm's internationalization characteristics with considerations of two dominant theories of SME internationalization: stage models of gradual internationalization (so called behavioral models) and models of early and rapid internationalization (businesses called 'born globals' or 'international new ventures'). The main findings of the study are twofold. Firstly, even if the general framework of the analysis suits a case of a small tour operator well, still there is a need to adapt the general framework to industry features (in particular, in terms of organization capabilities). Secondly, a further research should also take into account heterogeneity of international activities (in terms of their antecedents and process). Even if a firm is born global, its further internationalization may well be incremental in nature. In particular, an early and rapid internationalization through imports may lead to a gradual internationalization through exports. The former may result from a proactive attitude, be strategy driven, and implied by characteristics of the market and product (well in lines with models of an early and rapid internationalization). The latter, however, may stem from a rather passive attitude with almost no resource commitment (more in lines with models of a gradual and slow internationalization).

J	Notarantonio, EM; Quigley, CJ				Notarantonio, Elaine; Quigley, Charles, Jr.			Extending technology for market disruption: a case study	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Disruption; Innovation; Marketing strategy; Competitive; Brand extensions; Product innovation		Purpose - In an environment that is hyper-dynamic and faced with economic turmoil, it is crucial that organizations identify innovative competitive strategy. Using principles from Clayton Christensen's The Innovator's Dilemma, KVH Industries embarked upon a strategic market planning mission. This paper aims to describe how this company successfully turned a competitive disadvantage to an advantage by examining the market mindset and utilizing disruptive innovation to introduce a new product. Design/methodology/approach - This paper utilizes a case study to demonstrate successful application of disruptive innovation. Findings - A new evolutionary product was indicated in the research. Research limitations/implications - There may be some lack of generalizability due to this being a case study for a specific brand in a specific industry. Practical implications - It is unclear whether a revolutionary, rather than an evolutionary, product introduction would be more successful. Practitioners should recognize the competitive opportunities afforded through "disruptive innovation" strategies. Originality/value - This paper is of value to practitioners to see the success of one company's dismissal of a revolutionary product introduction in favor of a product launch that represents a "just good enough" alternative to competitors' products. It also demonstrates that there are risks associated with using a brand extension approach rather than individual branding.

J	Osman, M; Ananiadis-Basias, A				Osman, Magda; Ananiadis-Basias, Alexandros			Context and Animacy Play a Role in Dynamic Decision-Making	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION			English	Article						animacy; dynamic decision making; context; causality		Perception, judgment, and reasoning are all processes that are sensitive to cues to animacy (i.e. the presence of signals that indicate an object behaves as if it has intentions and internal goals). The present study investigated the following question: Does animacy facilitate decision-making in a dynamic control system? To address this, the present study used a dynamic decision-making task and compared behavior in four different contexts (Abstract, Animate-Social, Inanimate-Social, Inanimate-Non-social). Participants were randomly allocated to one of these contexts, and in each version they were required to learn to manipulate variables in order to bring the dynamic system to a desirable state and maintain it at that level. The findings suggest that it is not animacy per se that facilitates decision-making behavior, but rather the presence of a context. However, animacy made an impact on the type of strategic behavior implemented when interacting with the dynamic system. We argue that context induces general beliefs about causal relationships in dynamic environments that generalize across animate as well as inanimate contexts.

J	Ouakouak, ML; Ouedraogo, N				Ouakouak, Mohamed Laid; Ouedraogo, Noufou			Employee involvement in strategy-making process and company performance: the mediating role of employee strategic alignment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						employee involvement; strategy-making process; employee strategic alignment; company performance	PARTICIPATIVE DECISION-MAKING; TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; JOB-SATISFACTION; WORK; EMPOWERMENT; EVOLUTION; CONSTRUCT; CLIMATE	This article aims to study the mediating role of employee strategic alignment in the relationship between employee involvement in the strategy making process and company performance. We used structural equation modelling techniques with a sample of 372 European organisations of different sizes and from different countries. We found that employee strategic alignment plays a total mediating role in the relationship between employee involvement in the strategy making process and company performance. Our research shows the importance of employee involvement in the strategy making process, as well as the importance of employee alignment with the organisation's strategy. Our quantitative study can be complemented with a qualitative study in order to better understand how and why this relationship occurs. Our paper is the first to study and validate the mediating role of employee strategic alignment in the relationship between employee involvement in the strategy-making process and company performance.

J	Petersone, B				Petersone, Baiba			The role of public relations in foreign policy planning and execution	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Development; Strategic management; Public relations; Foreign policy; Government; Relationship management	RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; DIPLOMACY; ORGANIZATIONS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the role of public relations, conceptualized as a strategic management function, in foreign policy making, and implementation. This research study emphasizes the relational perspective and seeks to examine its applicability to the practice of public relations in foreign policy settings. Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative research study was based on in-depth interviews with nine individuals who were in charge of public relations aspects of a particular foreign policy issue in Latvian government institutions. The examined foreign policy issue was development cooperation. Findings - The research findings revealed that public relations contributed to the strategic management of the foreign policy process to a certain extent. Public relations built and cultivated relationships, researched and scanned environments, built communities around a foreign policy issue, facilitated dialogic encounters and socialized foreign policies. However, the public relations function was not involved in the entire strategic management process: analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. Although the relational perspective may be applicable to foreign policy settings and relationships that are cultivated by public relations practitioners in these settings bring outcomes on three different levels-national, organizational, and personal-this study found that public relations is not the only function that deals with relationships between an organization and its key publics. Originality/value - This research study investigated two areas that are little explored in the public relations research literature: the strategic management role of public relations in government institutions and public relations contributions to policy, especially foreign, making.

J	Ravi, SP				Ravi, Siva Prasad			Does Stakeholder Perception of Firm's Corporate Social Responsibility Affect Firm Performance?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Community; Competitive Advantage; Corporate Citizen; Corporate Social Responsibility; Customer; Environmental Issues; Perceptions and Stakeholders	FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; MODERATING ROLE	In the present-day business landscape characterised by global competition, demanding customers and depleting natural resources, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an important strategy for corporations for creating competitive advantage. CSR involves a corporation's commitment to align performance (revenue growth and profit) motives with fulfillment of social, ethical, community and environmental obligations. Researchers have found a positive correlation between stakeholder perceptions of firm's CSR performance and financial performance, assuming other factors as constant. This paper, based on analysis of Wal-Mart's performance from 2001 to 2011, found, seemingly significant negative perceptions of CSR activities of corporations result in lower performance. Once formed, changing negative perceptions is often difficult and the effort involves considerable amount of resources with questionable outcomes. This study has come to the conclusion that being a good 'Corporate Citizen' and creating positive stakeholder perceptions is a better strategic approach for firm's continuing success.

In 2008, the unit of penitentiary medicine of the Geneva University Hospitals was mandated to re-organize and provide health care at all six prison facilities. The specific aim of this paper is to outline the example as a practical solution to some of the common challenges in unifying the structure and process of health services across multiple small facilities, while meeting European prison health and local quality standards. Design/methodology/approach - Geneva's post-trial prisons are small and close to one another in geographical proximity-ideal conditions for the construction of a health mobile team (HMT).This multidisciplinary mobile team operated like a community ambulatory care model; it was progressively launched in all prison facilities in Geneva. The authors incorporated an implementation strategy where health providers partnered with prison and community stakeholders in the health delivery model's development and adaption process. Findings - The model's strategic initiatives are described along the following areas, in light of other international prison health activity and prior care models: access to a health care professional, equivalence of care, patient consent, confidentiality, humanitarian interventions, and professional competence and independence. Originality/value - From the perspective of the HMT members, the authors provide the "lessons learned'' through this experience, especially to providers who are working on prison health services reform and coordination improvement. The paper particularly stresses the importance of partnering with community health stakeholders and prison staff, a key component to the approach.

J	Sheard, G; Kakabadse, N; Kakabadse, A				Sheard, Geoff; Kakabadse, Nada; Kakabadse, Andrew			Visceral behaviours and leadership: a dark side of boardroom life?	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Leadership; Chief executives; Behaviour; Visceral behaviour; Hubris; Temptation; Discretion		Purpose - Characteristics of leaders whose behaviour is visceral include taking action based on instinct rather than intellect and exhibiting coarse, base and often negative emotions. Despite the challenge of precisely defining the nature of visceral behaviour, the purpose of this paper is to provide insight into this less attractive side of boardroom life. Design/methodology/approach - Following a literature review of the research into the negative behaviour leaders exhibit, the paper highlights four forms of visceral behaviour based on focused and intimate qualitative case studies involving the experiences of those on the receiving end of that behaviour within a boardroom context. Findings - Based on interviews with an international sample of five chief executive officers (CEOs), plus three subordinates with substantial profit and loss responsibility, the study reveals a distinctly human experience from which no one is exempt. The idiosyncratic nature of the visceral behaviour experienced resulted in each study participant's unique experience. The authors conclude that leaders need to adopt specific measures in order to control and reduce the darker human tendencies. Research limitations/implications - The experiences of study participants are presented in four case studies, providing insight into their experiences whilst also protecting their identity. The study participants were drawn from a sample of companies operating globally within a single sector of the manufacturing industry. The concepts the authors present require validating in other organisations with different demographic profiles. Originality/value - The paper presents a model based on two dimensions -choice and level of mastery -that provides the reader with insight into the forms of visceral behaviour to which leaders succumb. Insight enables us to offer managers strategic suggestions to guard against visceral behaviour and assist them in mitigating its worst aspects, in both those with whom they work and themselves.

JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED CARE			English	Article						Joint Strategic NeedsAssessment; Equality Delivery System; Ethnicity; Equality; Diversity; Equal opportunities; England		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore potential benefits in aligning Joint Strategic Needs Assessments (JSNAs) with implementation of the Equality Delivery System ( EDS) to improve commissioning of healthcare for minority ethnic groups. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on data gathered for a large research study carried out in England exploring the use of evidence in commissioning for multi-ethnic populations, to present a reflective discussion on the potential synergies between JSNA and EDS processes.Qualitative data were collected from 62 interviews with stakeholders in Sheffield, Leeds and Bradford, who, as part of their normal role, had an active responsibility to contribute to decision making for commissioning healthcare. 19 individuals working in national roles with experience in evidence use, ethnicity and commissioning across NHS, local authorities and third sector were also interviewed.Observational data were collected through regular attendance at an NHS Equality Group, which had Equality Delivery System implementation within its remit, and from a regional workshop focussing on Joint Strategic Needs Assessment improvements. Observations also came via participation in local EDS implementation meetings across Sheffield, Leeds and Bradford. These data were supplemented by a review of local and national policy literature about implementing JSNA and EDS. Findings - Formally strengthening the connection between JSNAs and the EDS has potential benefits for enhancing the evidence base about health and wellbeing needs of minority groups in general, and ethnic minorities in particular. Originality/value - NHS and Local Authority organisations need to establish structural processes to formally connect these two workstreams and to ensure adequate resource is made available, with clear direction from senior management.

J	Solomon, L; Nelson, T				Solomon, Lauren; Nelson, Tim			Energy for Life - an evidence-based approach to corporate citizenship	SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL			English	Article						Corporate responsibility; SROI (social return on investment); Social responsibility; Return on investment		Purpose - With the objective of developing an evidence-based corporate responsibility program aligned to core business functions, this article aims to outline the review process undertaken by AGL in identifying the long-term focus for new strategic partnerships. It also seeks to lay the foundation for AGL to better assess the outcomes of the program in the future. Design/methodology/approach - In undertaking the review, AGL drew on employee surveys, stakeholder consultation, sustainability indicators and new research on the demographics of customer hardship. Core focus points of financial hardship and household safety were identified as priorities for the program and new long-term partnerships were developed to specifically address these causes. Findings - The research underscores the priority placed by AGL on the development of long-term strategic charity partnerships and the integration of various components of the program including employee giving, volunteering and specific targeted initiatives. Research limitations/implications - There is greater scope to expand on the foundations laid in the paper, in particular to explore outcomes-based measurement techniques as they are applied to community investments and employee engagement. Practical implications - The paper outlines the potential benefit of developing an evidence-based strategic approach to charity partnerships, which can be integrated with employee engagement opportunities.

TECHNICAL SOLUTION FOR LOW IMPACT STORM WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE URBAN AREA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						storm water management; low-impact storm water management (LISM); runoff; infiltration; retention pond		It is known that sewerage construction management for storm water represents a major problem which is augmented through urban development into the last years. Urban development leads to reducing the infiltration rate of the rainwater and thus to increased discharge peak. Both aspects have an undesirable impact on the storm water management and on the environment. A very important and actual problem is to find out solutions to create similar flow conditions for rainwater drainage after urban development with the natural conditions before. These new orientation of the development known as 'low impact development' has the goal to find technical solutions to achieve an optimised storm water management. One of these solutions can be obtained by means of efficient artificial or natural infiltration of a part of the rainwater into underground. In this paper the actual situation of the above-related problems and a set of technical solutions with infiltration systems for achieving the main goal of the development of low-impact storm water management (LISM) with application will be discussed.

J	Svetsky, S; Moravcik, O; Stefankova, J; Schreiber, P				Svetsky, Stefan; Moravcik, Oliver; Stefankova, Jana; Schreiber, Peter			Computer Support for Knowledge Management within R&D and the Teaching of Bachelor Students	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING			English	Article						component; knowledge management; knowledge management system; technology - enhanced learning; educational technology; computer assisted learning		Knowledge plays a key role within research, development and education. One of the major challenges for knowledge management is to select the right knowledge from numerous sources, including know - how of individuals, and to transform it into useful, practicable knowledge. The focus should always be on supporting strategic organisational goals. In this context, from the organisation's strategic point of view, it is very important to link an institutional knowledge management system with the knowledge management systems of individuals. This paper presents personalised IT - support for knowledge management within industrial R&D and especially for teaching and learning. The support is based on the use of a long term developed in - house software that enables individuals (managers and teachers) to process and manage knowledge on their desktop computers in a user friendly way. Within the implementation of "Technology - enhanced learning" at the Faculty of Materials Science and Technology, a pre programmed work environment called BIKE (Batch Information and Knowledge Editor) was developed. However, this desktop environment works also as a teacher's personalized knowledge management system. It is programmed by the lead author of this paper who is a teacher; therefore the outcomes into teaching bachelor students are implemented directly into the classroom. The paper also presents how such IT - support complements, at a personalized level, the existing organizational knowledge management tool known as the university's Academic Information System. Some examples from teaching are presented, communication channels (teacher - student forums) were also mentioned as a part of the teacher's knowledge management personalised system. In this case, the BIKE environment is demonstrated as an alternative to learning management systems based on the so called WEB 2.0 technologies.

J	Thirumanickam, N; Ahmad, B				Thirumanickam, Nagaretnam; Ahmad, Bedah			Performance Measurement System in Higher Educational Institutions in Malaysia: An Exploratory Study of the Implementation of Balanced Scorecard	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						Performance Measurement System; Balanced Score Card; Higher Education Institutions	MANAGEMENT	High budget allocations for higher educational institutions have increased the responsibility and accountability of these institutions to their stakeholders. Hence issues of performance measurement and accountability have become very crucial for these institutions. It is necessary for the institutions to examine their performance measurement system to achieve organizational excellence. Traditional systems focusing on financial measures only will not suffice and thus the institutions should focus on strategic performance measurement systems including financial and non-financial perspectives. This study aims to examine the type of performance measurement system used by the faculty/department of accountancy in higher educational institutions in Malaysia. The findings of this preliminary study revealed that the perceptions of the responding institutions were in favour of a strategic performance measurement system. However the findings also showed that the institutions were not implementing their performance measurement system in a strategic manner.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ecodesign; design for environment; DfE; electronics; developing countries; South Africa; sustainability	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; ECO-DESIGN; STRATEGIES; BARRIERS; GREEN	Globally, firms are increasingly adopting ecodesign practices in order to design products with lower environmental impact. This paper reports on a study which investigated the adoption of ecodesign practices among a sample of 30 South African electronic design firms, explored through a mixed methods approach. Key findings indicate relatively low awareness of ecodesign practice and very few firms implementing these practices with specific, strategic intent. Outliers demonstrate and have accrued significant benefits. Among the sample, there were also firms that reaped benefits coincidentally through the application of sound engineering principles, suggesting scope for win-win scenarios. Regulations were considered to be the most important motivating factor whereas cost concerns and conflicts with other product requirements were identified as being important hindering factors. Firms reported benefiting in terms of gaining strategic advantage but few are achieving demonstrable cost advantages. This study suggests that there is considerable scope for improvement.

The marketing channel modes are discussed through fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The selection results of marketing channel modes are calculated on the basis of two overall performance evaluation conclusions by using the game theory. Meanwhile, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is adopted to pick the channel members, who are chosen by comparing the corrected matching scores between mutually cooperative telecom product set and individual distributors channel in accordance with the performance evaluation result of social distributors.

J	Zdolsek, D; Kolar, I				Zdolsek, Daniel; Kolar, Iztok			Management disclosure practices for disaggregated (financial) information in Slovenian unlisted companies	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						studies; disaggregated (financial) information disclosures; management's choice of disclosure policy; management behavior; strategic management; Slovenia	SFAS NO. 131; AGENCY COSTS; DETERMINANTS; IMPACT; MARKETS; FIRM	The focus of the present study is the management practice of disclosing disaggregated (financial) information in a company's annual report. In this study, a sample of 232 Slovenian unlisted companies has been examined. The results show that less than a quarter of the companies disclose disaggregated information. Moreover, the multiple regression analysis reveals that the scope of the disclosed disaggregated information is not influenced by the company's size, financial leverage, profitability or growth, but that only a company's membership in the construction industry sector is a relevant determinant. Furthermore, additional analysis reveals that the companies' proprietary information does not influence the management practices regarding which disaggregated information to disclose.

J	Zhang, Y; Cheng, Z; Harvie, C				Zhang, Yu; Cheng, Zhiming; Harvie, Charles			The Roles of Size and Size Difference in Australian and Chinese Inter-firm Collaborations	AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Collaboration; Size; Size Difference	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; FIRMS; COMPLEMENTARITY; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; TRUST; COST; COOPERATION; INTEGRATION	There has been considerable debate on the contribution and significance of firm size to the establishment, operation and success of business collaboration. One important source of this debate arises from differing definitions of firm size used in previous research. This paper uses firm size categories and size differences between collaborating firms to examine their contribution to the formation and performance of inter-firm collaboration in Australia and China. Both qualitative case study and quantitative data analyses are adopted in this paper. Results from both the qualitative case study and quantitative study in Australia and China show that size plays a significant positive role in the formation and performance of business collaboration. Firms prefer collaborating with larger partners. Bigger firms are more likely to achieve success collaborations. However, size difference plays a negative role in business collaboration. Collaborating with a bigger partner makes it harder to succeed. On the other hand, size and size difference play very different roles in performance and outcomes of business collaboration in different countries. This paper compares the roles of firm size and size difference in Australian and Chinese inter-firm collaboration. The results provide important strategic implications for business managers, industry regulators, and policy decision makers regarding international business collaboration.

It explores how Perak experienced a tremendous transformation in her political and economic structure, one that paved the way for modernization and rapid economic progress. This development was the direct result of Britain's colonial government involvement in Perak's administration. Their intervention broke down many traditional barriers that had long confined Perak's economy to a state of self-reliance, and also managed to integrate her economy with international trends by encouraging foreign investment and utilising cheap labour. These changes brought in new technologies and infrastructure that set the stage for Perak to become one of the most progressive states in Malaya's post-independence history.

J	Bolle, F; Liepmann, H; Vogel, C				Bolle, Friedel; Liepmann, Hannah; Vogel, Claudia			How much social insurance do you want? An experimental study	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Solidarity; Social insurance; Experimental economics	OTHER-REGARDING BEHAVIOR; STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE; REGULATORY FOCUS; PROSPECT-THEORY; RISK; PREVENTION; SOLIDARITY; PROMOTION; PREFERENCES; INEQUALITY	Social insurance such as unemployment insurance is in many countries mandatory for the majority of workers. The extent of such insurance is determined by a political process, i.e. ultimately by the workers themselves. If unemployment were purely accidental then all risk averse workers should vote for a party which promises complete coverage of the unemployment risk. In an experimental investigation on the basis of the Solidarity Game (Selten & Ockenfels, 1998) we compare voluntary ex post-solidarity transfers toward unfortunate low income subjects with mandatory solidarity transfers for which the rules are determined ex ante in a voting procedure. Less than a quarter of our subjects vote for complete coverage of their and others' risks and less than 12% vote for zero transfers. This result can neither be explained by Expected Utility Theory nor by income based social preferences nor by standard parameterizations of Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979: Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). The results are compatible with a warm glow approach (Andreoni, 1990) which extends to mandatory transfers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	O'Reilly, E				O'Reilly, Erin			Language Counseling Trends: Implications for Beginning Language Learner Strategy Instruction	STUDIES IN SELF-ACCESS LEARNING JOURNAL			English	Article						language advising; language counseling; metacognition; self-management; strategic self-regulation		This paper summarizes a qualitative, exploratory research project using archival data from language counseling reports written for adult, Arabic foreign language learners (N = 19) enrolled in weeks 1 - 10 of an intensive, academic Arabic language program at a West Coast school in the United States who attended a language counseling session at a self-access center. The goal was to analyze reports for possible trends in students' needs using Oxford's (2011) Strategic Self-Regulation ((SR)-R-2) model as a framework to better inform targeted strategy instruction for this population. The study used a two-cycle coding method. Descriptive codes were developed using a constant-comparison approach for first cycle coding. An axial coding approach was used for the second cycle, where the descriptive codes were collapsed into four major themes analyzed using frequency counts. Results indicated that students struggled with vocabulary, aural input discrimination, study management, and stress. Discussion includes practical applications for language counselors. Limitations and suggestions for future research related to trend analysis and the (SR)-R-2 model in language counseling are discussed.

J	Waring, T; Skoumpopoulou, D				Waring, Teresa; Skoumpopoulou, Dimitra			Through the kaleidoscope: Perspectives on cultural change within an integrated information systems environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Integrated information systems; Cultural change; Higher education	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; TECHNOLOGY; OPERATIONS; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; POWER	The study of information systems and their influence on organisational culture is a complex and highly contested area of research which has been the subject of much theorising. This paper intends to add to the debate through a longitudinal case study of an integrated information system implementation undertaken within a large UK university. The system known as SITS (Strategic Information Technology Services) was introduced into the university in 2006 and the focus of the research has been on culture change within the SITS environment. Document analysis, interviews and participant observation were used to collect the data for this study. What has emerged from this study is that current approaches are unable to account for the complexity of cultural studies within an integrated information systems environment and therefore we have developed the concept of the 'cultural kaleidoscope' as a heuristic to better understand the nature of cultural change within these circumstances.

The area of a unit cell is 37.743 75 mu m(2). The proposed single-poly MTP cell is erased and programmed by the FN tunnelling scheme. We design a 256 bit MTP memory for PMICs (power management ICs) using the proposed single-poly MTP cells. For small-area designs, we propose a selection circuit between V10V and V5V, and a WL (word-line) driver by simplifying its logic circuit. We reduce the total layout area by using pumped internal node voltages from a seven-stage cross-coupled charge pump for V10V (=10 V) and V5V (=5 V) without any additional charge pumps. The layout size of the designed 256 bit MTP memory is 618.250 mu m x 437.425 mu m.

J	Bedre-Defolie, O				Bedre-Defolie, Oe.			Vertical coordination through renegotiation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Vertical contracts; Rent shifting; Renegotiation; Buyer power	CONTRACTS; EXTERNALITIES	This paper analyzes the strategic use of bilateral supply contracts in sequential negotiations between one manufacturer and two differentiated retailers. The first main result is that, despite the feasibility of general supply contracts which are functions of own quantity (but cannot be contingent on the rival's quantity), the first contracting parties have incentives to manipulate their contract to shift rent from the second contracting retailer and these incentives distort the industry profit away from the fully-integrated monopoly outcome. The second main result is that if the contract terms between the manufacturer and the first retailer can be renegotiated from scratch in the event that the second retailer has no agreement, then the monopoly outcome can be achieved, often with full rent extraction from the second retailer. Moreover, there are conditions under which renegotiation from scratch yields higher joint profit for the firstly contracting parties than no renegotiation. These results do not depend on the type of retail competition, the level of differentiation between the retailers, the order of sequential negotiations, the level of asymmetry between the retailers in terms of their bargaining power vis-a-vis the manufacturer, or their profitability from being the monopoly retailer.

J	Makar, S; Wang, L; Alam, P				Makar, Stephen; Wang, Li; Alam, Pervaiz			Managing FX Risk During the Euro Crisis	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article								Since the start of the Great Recession in 2007, treasurers have been challenged to manage cash flow uncertainty-including the impact of exchange rate (FX) changes. Today, FX risk management has become particularly important for companies doing business in the Eurozone. But current hedge accounting practices cannot accurately predict future cash flows in FX risk management. In this article, the authors help treasurers and CFOs analyze those accounting deficiencies in the Eurozone context. They also discuss the strategic implications of the hedge accounting problem.

Ra; Lee, Young Hee; Kim, Youngho			A computer-based finger-tapping system for evaluating movement of the affected hand following stroke: A pilot study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Rehabilitation; Neuroplasticity; Noninvasive brain stimulation; Motor sequence task	STIMULATION	The objective of this study was to develop a computer-based finger-tapping system and to investigate whether the system is effective for evaluating motor function by performing pilot tests of the effects of three interventions, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), peripheral sensory stimulation (PSS), and PSS combined with tDCS (PSS + tDCS), on the movement of the affected hand in stroke patients. The developed system consists of two parts, the finger-tapping input system and finger-tapping analysis software. The finger-tapping input system can detect the states of four buttons and transmit these states to the finger-tapping analysis software, which measures the reaction time. Three stroke patients participated in an experimental session to test the effects of each intervention on motor performance. Each session included three blocks for the determination of (1) baseline of motor performance (Base), (2) the motor performance after each form of stimulation (Pre), and (3) the motor performance following motor training and rest (Post). The results showed that the mean response times for all blocks (Base, Pre, and Post) did not differ significantly with tDCS and PSS, but significant decreases were found between Base and Post and between Pre and Post. In addition, there was no significant difference among the interventions at Pre; however, PSS + tDCS facilitated considerably greater training effects than tDCS or PSS at Post. The developed system was able to evaluate motor function through motor training after a combination of PSS and tDCS. In the near future, we plan to apply the developed system to more patients with relatively good motor function to extend our findings to a general outcome, and expect that these results could be used to design an appropriate rehabilitative approach.

The analysis of multiple ties in longitudinal egocentric network data: A case study on bidirectional relationships between trust and drug use	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Egocentric data; Dyadic analysis; Longitudinal bivariate regression; Bayesian inference; Dynamic networks	HIV RISK; MODELS; SMOKING	We extend multi-level models to examine single egocentric network ties to the joint analysis of paired dynamic ties. Two analytic challenges are addressed. First, inference needs to account for multiple layers of nesting: ties are nested within pairs, pairs are nested within time points, and time points are nested within egos. Second, the focus is on the relationship between two dynamic ties; specification of outcome and predictor may be difficult. Instead, we treat both ties as outcomes. Our approach is used to analyze trust and reported drug use between egos and alters over time in a Bayesian framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Comulada, W.

Comparison of strategic and operational good practice for private security personnel in the night-time economy and the Cairns City model	SECURITY JOURNAL			English	Article						private security; security industry; model of good practice; security training; roles and responsibility	ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; DRINKING; PATRONS; VENUES; CCTV	Private security personnel are the guardians of patrons in the night-time economy (NTE). However, there is a disconcerting lack of research concerning issues for private security personnel specific to the NTE. Such issues include the duty of care, a risk management approach to staff and patron care, code of conduct, interactions with other service agencies, data and information sharing, incident reporting and functions and resource procedures for private security personnel. There is also little research concerning the ability of security personnel to contribute to reducing alcohol-related harm and injury in the NTE through strategic and operational good practices. To fill this gap, interviews and focus groups were carried out in order to document these strategic and operational practices. These were compared with available models in the literature. It was found that the Cairns City model exceeded recommended good practice, particularly through the industries involvement in a community crime prevention frame-work in the NTE.

J	Rija, M; Bronzetti, G				Rija, Maurizio; Bronzetti, Giovanni			Innovative IC Framework in the Non-Profit Sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR			English	Article						IC Framework; Intellectual Capital; Non-Profit Sector; Performance; Strategic Management; Value Creation	KNOWLEDGE ASSETS; MANAGEMENT; MARKETS; ECONOMY; PROFIT	The importance of intellectual capital in the non-profit sector generates the need to measure its role in the value creation process. The purpose of the paper is to study the application of intellectual capital within the non-profit sector, by turning attention to resources such as: knowledge, experience, and skills. Organizations, which are able to increase the knowledge of their staff and transform this knowledge into skills to improve services, can easily meet users' needs and, thereby, become competitive. This contribution proposes to study how people's knowledge can contribute to increasing social value, which is the non-profit organization's aim. Furthermore, the goal is to demonstrate how collaboration between staff and volunteers is essential to professional services. Finally, the research proposes a conceptual framework in which intellectual capital helps in defining the strategic issues, which non-profit organizations must tackle in order to achieve their social programs.

Methods: The participants were 12 adults who were overweight or obese and 2 family members. Data were collected from iterative fieldwork in the obesity clinics of two hospitals. Data were analyzed using text analysis and taxonomic methods. Results: Weight management behaviors among participants varied according to the recognition of the body and motivation for weight control, Participants behavior was discussed in the socio-cultural context of obesity. Patterns of weight management behavior among participants were categorized by focus: strategic self-oriented type including managements for the body as a social asset and for health, selective neglect type, and passive group value-oriented type including type dependent on others and managements for beauty. Conclusion: Participants' weight management behavior was guided by folk concepts of body and health. and constructed within the socio-cultural context. It is necessary for health care providers to understand physical and psychological problems arising from the repeated trials, excessive control of weight, and Western cultural discourse on beauty ideals among adults who are overweight or obese. Therefore, interventions should be tailored to address individual and community needs.

From this subject others have appeared such as eco-efficiency and cleaner production. Those subjects have gained relevance. However, there is a lack of knowledge on these subjects either in the academia or in industry. In this context, the present work aims at performing a bibliography analysis on the publications of the terms eco-efficiency and cleaner production in four journals from production engineering. The following indicators were considered: total number of publications identified, number of published articles, definitions used by the authors, number of key-words, and number of articles related to those to subjects as well as the references from those articles. It is concluded that seven publications from the four studied journals deal with cleaner production and no publications on eco-efficiency was identified. This result demonstrates that both subjects are not extensively approached by those journals from production engineering field.

J	Guerin, C; Hoc, JM; Mebarki, N				Guerin, Clement; Hoc, Jean-Michel; Mebarki, Nasser			The nature of expertise in industrial scheduling: Strategic and tactical processes, constraint and object management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS			English	Article						Expertise; Scheduling; Cognitive control; Constraint management	HUMAN OPERATOR; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; SUPPORT	This paper focuses on industrial scheduling expertise from a cognitive and ergonomic perspective. In line with the authors' previous study of timetabling, it considers both a higher level of abstraction in the cognitive control of symbolic processing during scheduling, defined by strategic processes, and a lower level, specified by tactical processes. Within the tactical level of control, two dual problem spaces can be defined: the Constraints Space (CS) and the Objects Space (OS). The constraints adopted in this paper are considered as relations between variables that cannot be represented in the solution (a Gantt chart). Objects, on the other hand, are constraint satisfactions and can be represented in the solution. This study compared twelve novices and six experts as they scheduled and then rescheduled manufacturing orders with the use of a Gantt chart. Actions on the interface and concurrent verbal reports were collected. As was the case for the scheduling of timetables, experts used a higher level of abstraction than novices in the control of processing. This was particularly evident for generic procedures, which are found less often in timetabling. Experts were more likely than novices to use external representations (objects) as activity support, whilst novices managed more constraints in their heads. Finally, in comparison with object management, constraint management is proportionally more important in timetabling than in industrial scheduling. Relevance to industry: A better understanding of the processes used by schedulers would bring about improvements in human machine cooperation for scheduling. This stake is crucial to the enhancement of productivity and customer satisfaction. Moreover, the task of schedulers is to design a schedule, rather than to execute it. One of their roles is to contribute to the prescription of work carried out on the shop floor. Since scheduling decisions impact on workers, it is also important to understand schedulers' problem-solving processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The findings suggest that consensual culture is the best fit with social capital. Also, high level of organizational identification, trust and cohesiveness increases job satisfaction and lowers turnover intention. If applying the results practically, organizational identification, improvement of welfare system, stress control, and coaching program for personal development are the most optimal solution.

A framework for environmental risk management	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								Aero engine designs can have a life time of over 45 years, which is long enough for the understanding of environmental problems to change significantly. This places the aero engine designer in a position of uncertainty, as unforeseen environmental problems could affect the viability of a design. 'Risk' is used to describe future uncertainties that can lead to undesirable consequences. This paper presents a framework for environmental risk management that allows the designer to answer the question: what is the risk to a design from its environmental impacts over the life cycle? The framework provides a process for turning complex environmental business hazards into a form that can be used to develop mitigating actions within the design process. The paper demonstrates the framework through two examples and discusses findings, leading to conclusions on what is required to implement the framework into a business.

J	Yu, JH				Yu, Jung-Ho			Dynamic priority evaluation model for IS adoption in construction management	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						construction management; information system; priority evaluation	TECHNOLOGY PLANNING FRAMEWORK; IMPLEMENTATION	The process of determining the order of Information Systems (IS) adoption in construction management processes, which are highly interrelated with one another, is generically dynamic because the IS adoption in one management process affects the other management processes, consequently changing the order of IS adoption throughout the entire process. In this paper, we discuss the Dynamic Priority Evaluation Model (DPEM). A priority evaluation criterion in DPEM is the expected IS benefits, which is represented by the efficiency increase of management processes through the IS adoption. The efficiency increase is determined as the most fundamental IS benefit through a survey. The prediction of the efficiency increase is based on four factors, namely the structurization level, beneficiary level, information utilization level, and information gain easiness level. These factors are verified through a case study. In addition to considering these four factors, the strategic importance of each management process and the relative importance of the four factors are incorporated into the calculation of the efficiency increase. Finally, the DPEM is expressed in a mathematical and process form to reflect the condition of the precedent IS adoption. Through another case study, the validity of the proposed DPEM method is verified for prioritizing the construction management processes for IS adoption based on the expected IS benefits. Ed: highlight - while the original is acceptable, the edited version is more fluent and legible. Further, DPEM is capable of considering more information than the experts are able to consider.

By bearing this need in mind, this study aims to examine competitive factors in Balkan countries to develop a road map for investors. To do this, we used World Economic Forum's "Global Competitiveness Index" to analyze the case of Balkan countries as a region to cluster and compare them based on Global competitiveness factors. Analysis results pointed out those Balkan countries were clustered in two groups and scored lower or medium level on almost all competitive factors as the region. Based on these findings, authors suggested various strategic recommendations at micro and macro level.

J	Lu, Y; Karpova, E				Lu, Yao; Karpova, Elena			An Investigation of Chinese Textile Firms' R&D Performance	CLOTHING AND TEXTILES RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						China; textile industry; research; development	EXTERNAL TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY; LARGE-SIZE; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; PANEL	The purpose of this study was to enhance the understanding of Chinese textile manufacturers' research and development (R&D) performance. Specifically, the study empirically examined (a) current trends of R&D activities in the Chinese textile industry; (b) R&D intensity among Chinese textile firms and determinants of its variation; and (c) R&D effectiveness among Chinese textile firms and factors impacting it. The research results are based on survey data from 768 textile manufacturers located in a Southeastern County with a mature textile and apparel cluster. Logistic regression was employed for data analyses. The results showed that R&D investment levels among Chinese textile firms are relatively low in comparison with advanced textile industries in developed countries. Chinese textile firms with international operations had a higher R&D intensity, or investment level, than those without international operations. Foreign ownership and financial resources were not significant predictors of the firm's R&D intensity. Chinese textile firms that relied on acquiring new machinery/technology and were involved in internal R&D activities were more likely to have higher R&D effectiveness, which translated into positive profit margin. The R&D intensity did not contribute significantly to R&D effectiveness. To offset increasing production cost and sustain its diminishing low-cost comparative advantage, the Chinese textile industry's next step is to focus on R&D. The study offers strategic directions to the industry and policy makers that might be helpful to keep the industry competitive in the global marketplace.

As being failed to effectively evaluate, monitor, and control the business processes, paradigms of BPM have evolved continuously with changes in information technology (IT), and vice versa. BPM should be implemented based on a synthesis of suitable technology and techniques, which support the integration of business processes. Accordingly, a method is required to carefully select the business processes that will be tackled first in a BPM project. However, an in-depth analysis of criteria for selecting processes to improve has not been done before. In this study, an integrated method for business process improvement, which includes the evaluation criteria of business processes to improve, the decision framework for business process selection, and the four types of business process improvement strategies, is developed. Finally, we apply a method to a BPMS planning project in a Korean government agency in South Korea, to show this method's practical utility.

J	Ujunju, MO; Wanyembi, G; Wabwoba, F				Ujunju, Michael Okumu; Wanyembi, G.; Wabwoba, Franklin			Evaluating the Role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Support towards Processes of Management in Institutions of Higher Learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ICT; Competitive advantage; Strategic management; Data		The role of Information and Communication Technology in achieving organization's strategic development goals has been an area of constant debate, and as well perceived in different management dimensions. Most universities are therefore employing it (ICT) as a tool for competitive advantage to support the accomplishment of their objectives. Universities are also known to have branches or campuses that need strong and steady strategic plans to facilitate their steady expansion and growth. Besides, production of quality services from the various levels of management in these universities requires quality strategic plans and decisions. In addition, to realize the steady growth and competitive advantage, ICT not only has to be an additive but a critical component towards supporting management processes in the universities. This research sought to determine the role of ICT in supporting management processes in institutions of higher learning in Kenya. The research investigated how the different levels of management used ICT in their management processes and whether the use had any effect on management processes. The research further made recommendations to the universities on better use of ICTs in their management processes. A public university in Kenya was used as a case study in this research.

Management of valves to improve performance reliability of distribution systems	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								The overall reliability of a distribution system depends largely on valve reliability, location, and adequacy of number as well as the frequency of failure of water mains. Clearly valve management is an essential aspect of distribution system management. This article describes applications of the Strategic Valve Management Model (SVMM) to demonstrate how the computer program can be used to identify pipe segments associated with pipe breaks, determine which valves to close to isolate the breaks, and perform analyses of valve management alternatives (including present worth costs) to reduce customer service interruptions. Valve management alternatives include the addition of new valves, improvement of valve reliability by exercising valves, or a combination of the two. Simple performance indicators were developed to evaluate the performance of valve-isolating systems. This article expands on previous publications by demonstrating applications of the SVMM to hypothetical and actual water distribution systems.

J	Hunt, HG; Sinha, P; Yin, Y				Hunt, Herbert G., III; Sinha, Praveen; Yin, Yuan			Additional Evidence on Analysts' Decision to Issue Disaggregated Earnings Forecasts: Strategic Biasing	ABACUS-A JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING FINANCE AND BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						Analyst forecast bias; Analyst forecast disaggregation; Analyst forecast error; Strategic biasing		This study examines why analysts issue disaggregated earnings forecasts to I/B/E/S. Some recent studies suggest that analysts with superior forecasting ability issue disaggregated earnings forecasts to build reputation in the marketplace and stop forecast disaggregation once their reputation has been established. Based on an analysis of I/B/E/S forecast data for U. S. firms from 1998 to 2008, we find that, in a given year, about 20%-34% of analysts disaggregate for some, but not for all the firms that they follow. This evidence of selective disaggregation by analysts suggests that reputation building alone does not fully explain the decision to disaggregate forecasts. We hypothesize that the decision to disaggregate earnings forecasts is at the firm-level as well and is systematically related to the analysts' bias in the issued forecasts. Our findings are that (a) analysts' overall optimistic bias and forecast errors decrease monotonically with the level of forecast disaggregation, and (b) analysts that selectively disaggregate their forecasts for some firms or who do not persistently disaggregate a given firm's forecasts exhibit more positive bias and larger forecast errors. Our findings are consistent with the notion that the analysts who issue biased forecasts, for example, to curry favour with the management, are less likely to provide disaggregated information as part of the forecast.

J	Khota, I; Pretorius, L				Khota, Irfaan; Pretorius, Leon			HARVESTING IP-BASED VALUE POTENTIAL: THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SCORECARD AS A MECHANISM TO CAPITALIZE ON TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, KNOWLEDGE, AND IP	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Intellectual property; strategy; value-creation		There is a staggering decline in the capitalization of intellectual property (IP) and low levels of investment in R&D, particularly with respect to emerging nations within the global IP environment, which limits accelerated industrial growth. In most emerging markets, this necessitates that management address multiple competencies better, that exploit organizational resources, knowledge, and management ability, to adapt faster than the competition. Our research offers a management model to address this management challenge strategically. This research also indicates that IP as a value creation mechanism is currently not a top management priority although investors increasingly look toward good IP management as an indicator of future organizational growth. The research presents the IP Scorecard, a further inductive development of Kaplan and Norton's traditional Balanced Scorecard. The IP Scorecard is a strategic management tool that enables management to drive a robust industrial growth strategy that is explicitly positioned within the knowledge economy, identifying target areas for organizational development around knowledge and IP management, in order to achieve the competitive higher-ground, by strategically creating and capitalizing on value arising from innovation and R&D activities. The IP Scorecard sensitizes management on where and how to carve out competitive turf, particularly from a knowledge and IP value creation perspective, seeking ultimately to enhance corporate/shareholder and product-life-cycle value. The paper encompasses limited field research fundings on key IP-related strategic management considerations that promote leadership in innovation and R&D, across the product life cycle.

J	Muhtada, D				Muhtada, Dani			Managing workforce diversity: an Islamic perspective	INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF ISLAM AND MUSLIM SOCIETIES			English	Article						Workforce; Diversity; Management; Islam; Multiculturalism		Workforce diversity is an inevitable phenomenon of the day. Diversity management is then developed in response to this reality. The discourse has been widely implemented in many western countries and some other countries across the world. Yet, it does not sound loudly in the Muslim countries. The objective of this paper is to discover Islamic perspective of workforce diversity management. The results show that pluralism and multiculturalism values are strongly promoted in Islamic teaching. Although, some conceptual problems regarding conservative views on diversity might constrain diversity workforce management, but a strategic solution to this issue is not impossible. This paper basically favors the idea of implementing the Lewin-Schein change model (i.e., unfreezing - change [moving] - refreezing) for managing diversity in the Muslim society context but with a more focus given to the substantive aspects of diversity management (i.e., elaborating Islamic values on diversity). The role of such qualified Islamic scholars is crucial in this regard.

A dataset of 371 potential SFRB (including many operating reservoirs) characterized by 40 variables have been surveyed across central Scotland. However, the spatial properties of these SFRB, such as water storage (which relates to flooding depth) in different regions, are ambiguous. This paper uses geostatistics on the Scottish dataset. Spatial analysis showed that ordinary kriging, which is a spatial interpolation method, could be successfully applied to estimate numerical values for all key flood control variables everywhere in the study area. Moreover, the probability that certain threshold values relevant to flood control managers were exceeded can also be calculated by using disjunctive kriging. The findings provide an effective screening tool in assessing flood control using SFRB.

J	Indounas, K; Roth, S				Indounas, Kostis; Roth, Stefan			Antecedents and consequences of strategic price management: An analysis in the New Zealand industrial service context	AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategy; Market orientation; Price management; Industrial services; New Zealand	MARKET ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE	The purpose of the present study is to (a) measure the extent to which selected contextual variables have an impact on the adoption of strategic pricing by industrial service providers and (b) determine the effect of the adoption of strategic pricing on the process that industrial service providers use for levying their prices. The current study represents the first attempt to empirically examine the aforementioned topics in an industrial service context. Data were collected from 120 industrial service providers operating in four different service sectors in New Zealand through a mail survey. Moreover, qualitative research through 16 in-depth interviews was carried out. Regarding the antecedents of strategic pricing, customer orientation, interfunctional co-ordination and higher formality were found to boost its adoption. With reference to the effect of strategic pricing on the pricing process used, differences were found among low and high strategic prices. (C) 2011 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.

J	Ahmad, S; Perret, SR; Nawaz, R; Shivakoti, GP				Ahmad, Sajjad; Perret, Sylvain-Roger; Nawaz, Rab; Shivakoti, Ganesh Prasad			Relationships between farm size and operational performances in irrigated cropping systems under contrasted governance systems in Punjab (Pakistan)	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Canal irrigation; institutional reforms; crop diversification; intensification; Pakistan	WATER PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT	This paper investigated the farm level diversity in operation and farm performances under two different governance situations in irrigation systems of Punjab Province of Pakistan: Farmer-Managed (FMIS) and Government-Managed Irrigation Scheme (GMIS). Questionnaire surveys and multivariate analyses were conducted. Farms typology was developed based on farm size. Results reveal a water-land-farming strategy nexus. Larger farms perform better in both schemes. Wheat cropping is a strategic choice, specialized, and exclusive, with low input, and low income. Conversely, maize and rice cropping tit well in diversification and intensification strategies, leading to higher farm income. Also poor financial basis and extension services for smaller farms do not support intensification and diversification. The paper shows that productivity of production factors, level of intensification, farm size are closely interlocked, in a general context of poor performances and institutional reforms. Groundwater access is also a key to success, since canal irrigation only cannot sustain an intensification-diversification process. The paper concludes that transfer of canal irrigation management to farmers will not solve all issues, and yet remains probably the only long-term solution. Areas for public intervention on, inter alia, land, finance, extension, markets remain necessary in FMIS and towards smaller farms.

However, studies in the domain of e-government and alignment, particularly in developing countries are scarce. In this research, the authors examine the significant impact that IS/IT alignment can have on e-government project implementation success. Through inspecting e-government projects, the authors capture the role of alignment in e-government and discuss strategies that can be adopted to improve implementation success. An empirical enquiry based on case studies of e-government projects by Tunisian public administration reveals that a dynamic approach to alignment can be adopted and consequently supported through partial alignment of horizontal integration. This empirical enquiry also reveals that political support can be seen as a key influencing factor that impacted success. Finally, the findings are used to propose a framework to analyze the alignment of e-government projects.

J	Chaimankong, M; Prasertsakul, D				Chaimankong, Mayookapan; Prasertsakul, Dissatat			Impact of Strategy Implementation on Performance of Generic Strategy: Evidence from Thailand	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Generic strategies; typologies; Miles and Snow; firm performance; strategy implementation	ORIENTATION; MANAGEMENT; MILES	The purpose of this paper is to examine the strategic orientation in terms of Miles and Snow typologies of the firms in emerging country and investigate their implications on performance. Unlike previous research, this paper focuses the importance of strategy implementation to the performance implications of Miles and Snow typology. Data was collected from 111 key informants from firms in Thailand's chemical industry using probability sampling. The one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) results showed that prospectors performed better than the other three strategic types, whereas reactors exhibited the lowest performance scores. While the success in strategy implementation is found to be a significant predictor of firm performance, the two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) results revealed that the success in strategy implementation did not alter the relationship between Miles and Snow strategic type and a firm's performance. This finding suggests that the relationship between Miles and Snow strategic type and a firm's performance may be universal, regardless of the location where the study is conducted. However, additional studies in other contexts are required before the conclusion can be made whether the strategic type - performance relationship will be contingent on strategy implementation.

Recently, alliances have been linked to the organizational learning literature where alliances create environments for learning and knowledge transfer. This phenomenon is the main purpose of this paper, where it will define and discuss the key facilitating learning elements in strategic alliances. The study used an in-depth case study method. Two respondent organizations were used to gather data for the purpose of the study. One case was from the manufacturing sector and the other is from the service sector. Both entered into alliances with learning from foreign parent partner as one of the key objectives. The final part of the paper will summarize the findings and suggest key elements promoting learning from foreign parent partner to the 'child businesses in the case of international strategic alliance which include learning as one of their alliance objectives.

J	Suss, W; Trojan, A				Suess, Waldemar; Trojan, Alf			An integrated action plan as a structurally preventive approach in the social space: the socially oriented prevention programme Lenzgesund in a disadvantaged district in Hamburg-Eimsbuttel	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-HEIDELBERG			English	Article						Germany; Public health services; Local prevention programme; Urban district development; Disadvantaged people; Health reporting		Aim Development and evaluation of an integrated action plan on health promotion in a disadvantaged district by a public private partnership of the local health authority and a research project of the University Medical Center of Hamburg funded by the German Ministry of education and research (prevention research). Subject and methods With the research projects, two major goals have been formulated that refer to the well-known Public Health Action Cycle: Development of district-related small-scale health reports in view of benefits for process and outcome control, as well as situation analysis. Development and testing of an evaluation method for setting-related prevention/health promotion ("capacity building"). The "science practice project" consists of a considerable work plan that is structured by work packages. It is based on a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods (secondary statistical analyses, expert interviews, interviews with residents, etc.). Results have so far been published in two "district diagnosis" reports and other publications as well. Results An "integrated concept for fields of action" for social areas can be defined as inter-sectoral or coordinated actions of departments-and dynamic management and action instrument for local actors. By implementing the strategic concept, aims of the integrated fields of action are to be met as well as new goals, which have developed during the course the programme. Core quality criteria and requirements for a sustainable integrated action are presented. Conclusion Successful courses of action to improve quality of life in disadvantaged districts ask for integrated action plans due to complex problems on the one hand, and manifold relations and constellations between involved actors on the other.

Therefore, this planning has to be taken into account and should provide planning direction on the bases of its results. Basically, the manager of strategic planning, leadership and strategic thinking and to act to help planners designed the tools, processes and concepts is a group. At the same time, the organization of the development and effective strategies will help to place. The purpose of this research is to provide SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis and to present new suggestions based on the opinions of students in the distance education system. In this work, we have applied Survey Method. The study group has consisted of 70 students and 11 instructors of Mersin Vocational School of Higher Education (MVSHE). All the data was surveyed during the spring semester of 2009. In the development of the questionnaire, a relevant literature has been investigated. Also, expert opinion has also been provided for the survey materials and survey articles. The questionnaire is finalized according to the expert's opinion. The questionnaire was applied in the internet environment to both the students and the instructors. The outcomes of the survey have been evaluated quantatively along the direction of the survey's fundamental question: "What are your views on strategic planning (SWOT) of distance education?" The suggestions have been made about the distance learning education based on the findings of the survey.

A static and dynamic strategic portfolio analysis: The positioning of Iberian seaports	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EFFICIENCY; PORT	The various changes that have occurred in the seaport industry have had a continuous and substantial impact on seaport activities and management in recent decades. The highly competitive and rapidly changing environment faced by business has greatly increased the need for strategic planning. Thus, it is relevant and appropriate to apply strategic positioning tools to seaports given how competitive strategies play a key role in the growth and development of this industry. This research aims to analyse the strategic positioning of the leading Iberian Peninsula seaports using the BCG matrix from a static and dynamics perspective for the period between 1997 and 2008. The findings reveal a better positioning of Spanish seaports in relation to total traffic. Furthermore, considering container traffic, the results point to the seaports of Algeciras, Valencia and Barcelona as having attained a remarkable position of leadership. However, according to the time series analysed, the ranking of seaports has not changed significantly.	[da Cruz, M. R.

J	Parsons, JE				Parsons, John E.			Do trading and power operations mix? The case of Constellation Energy Group in 2008	JOURNAL OF ENERGY MARKETS			English	Article								For the first seven years following its creation in 2000, Constellation Energy Group was a leader in the merchant power business, and its stock significantly outperformed the industry. Then, in 2008, in the space of less than two months, the company found itself in a liquidity crisis in which its stock lost more than 70% of its value, leading to a forced sale at a low price. What happened? Constellation's crisis illustrates the hidden dangers that arise when a power company's trading operation stops playing a subordinate function and becomes the strategic focus of the business. The case highlights the illiquidity of many commodity trading portfolios, which increases the danger of potentially large contingent capital requirements. These are often overlooked in traditional value-at-risk calculations. It is therefore easy to underestimate exposure and the capital implicitly dedicated to the trading operation, exaggerating its profitability. When the trading unit shares a balance sheet with other operations, such as generation and customer supply, the capital required for trading is often borrowed from these other units at zero cost. Trading can improve the profitability of generation and customer supply if it is organized as a support function. If it is to be a profit center of its own, it should be organized on its own balance sheet, separate from the other operations.

Storm-surges Indicator for the Polish Baltic Coast	TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								Storm surges appear in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea and, depending on row of factors, have different sizes, specifically characteristic for each region of the sea-coast. Observed climate changes are characterized with greater dynamics of weather phenomena. To compare the risk of storm surges to different areas, a new method had to be developed. Storm-surges indicator is used to compare the risks to the South Baltic water areas, varied along with conditions therein and the hydro meteorological and local conditions. The studies on the relations between the parameters and the occurrence of storm surges were carried out as well. The storm surges indicator "W" is related to the number of storm surges observed at the stations in the particular regions, the maximal wind velocity and the max sea level occurring during the same storm surges. The storm surges indicator was calculated for the period of 1955-2008 for the Polish coastal zone. The intention is to use this indicator for research and forecasting purposes. Assessment of the tendencies and variability of the regional phenomena indicators in timescale prove occurrence of certain regional changes of hydrometeorological conditions.

Three of the most frequently used fuels have been tested: urea, glycine and beta-alanine. Thermal analysis was used in order to investigate the behavior of individual metal nitrates and fuels. The major difference in terms of thermal behavior of the individual metal nitrates is also reflected in the behavior of metal nitrate fuel binary mixtures. In all cases, the ignition of the combustion process was performed at 400 degrees C. Beryllium nitrate did not generate a typical combustion process with urea, while beta-alanine and glycine triggered a low intensity combustion process. Magnesium nitrate and calcium nitrate reacted very energetically with beta-alanine. Strontium nitrate and barium nitrate generated low intensity combustion reactions with beta-alanine, leading to the formation of metal carbonate and unreacted metal nitrate. The phase composition of the samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction. The results reported hereby show the importance of a rational fuel selection, especially when the preparation of mixed metal oxides is aimed and mixtures of metal nitrates are used. In the case of alkaline-earth metal oxides, experimental results evidenced that urea is not a suitable fuel for Be(NO3)(2); beta-alanine is an adequate fuel for magnesium nitrate and calcium nitrate; none of the three fuels triggered a vigorous combustion process with strontium nitrate or barium nitrate.

Risk management and regulation compliance with tradable permits under dynamic uncertainty	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Risk; Permits; Regulation; Enforcement; Dynamic uncertainty; Option; Pricing; Equilibrium	POLLUTION-CONTROL; MARKETS; PUNISHMENT; CRIME	In this paper, we explore the effects of dynamic uncertainty on the risk management of regulated industries and emission market. We consider as major sources of uncertainty the stochastic growth of demand for the industry output (e.g. electric energy) and the ensuing lack of information on the pollution levels of individual firms, their behavior and the behavior of the regulator. These sources of uncertainty are common in pollution permit trading as not only does the market respond to the volatility of fundamentals but also to the vagaries of the institutional structure, created by public policy and enforced through regulation. The paper shows that in the presence of strategic behavior on the part of the agents involved, even though both the level and the volatility of output increases over time, trading of permits is a highly effective instrument of risk management, since it allows the firms to pool the risks arising from the volatile environment, thereby simplifying enforcement, reducing emissions and improving resource allocation. Moreover, uncertainty plays a subtle influencing role, since on one hand it broadens the regulator's deterrent power over potential polluters, while on the other it reduces the expected value of the sanction for the individual firm.

For the purpose of this paper, the relationship between strategic approach and knowledge management capabilities of universities has been analysed through a comprehensive review of related literature and identification of related measures. Since there have been few efforts in concentrating on the relationships among strategic viewpoints of universities and knowledge management capabilities, there has been an attempt to conceptualise a pervasive model which encompasses influential indicators on knowledge-based competency of universities regarding their capabilities in strategic knowledge management. An exploratory factor analysis has been conducted in order to identify the most important factors affecting the successful management of knowledge so as to gain the knowledge-based competency.

Strategic market orientation in mental healthcare: A knowledge synthesis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic market orientation; Knowledge synthesis; Mental healthcare demand; Mental healthcare supply; Stakeholders; External environment		System amendments, budget cuts and market forces have led to a deregulation of the Dutch (mental) healthcare system. Mental healthcare providers are forced to critically examine their strategic position, which increases the need for more knowledge on the strategic market orientation tools that are applicable in mental healthcare. The literature shows that a mental healthcare provider needs to develop knowledge within four domains of strategic market orientation: mental healthcare demand, mental healthcare supply, stakeholders, and the external environment. This article aims to answer the question as to which information and instruments are available for mental healthcare providers to develop this knowledge. Information was gathered via telephone interviews with policymakers and advisors of nine large mental healthcare providers in the Netherlands, complemented with the literature related to the four domains. This resulted in a knowledge synthesis on strategic market orientation in mental healthcare. This knowledge synthesis provides mental healthcare providers with a framework that needs to be operationalized in practice, leading to concrete guidelines for the development of a marketing function in mental healthcare organizations.

J	Brettel, M; Land, S; Thalmann, J; Austermann, D				Brettel, Malte; Land, Simon; Thalmann, Julia; Austermann, Dominik			Cultural differences in leadership in SMEs: new product development in China and Germany	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						international management; national culture; SME; China; new product development; leadership	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; MARKET ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; GENDER; IMPACT; DETERMINANTS; ANTECEDENTS; INFORMATION; PERSPECTIVE	The present research examines the effect of national culture on the relationship between leadership behaviour and early- and late-stage activities (initiation and implementation) in the new product development process in SMEs. The research develops and empirically validates a theoretical framework with large-scale survey data from Western Germany and China (represented by the Greater Shanghai business region), two culturally diverse settings. The findings suggest that national culture has a significant moderating impact on the effect of certain antecedents to successful new product development activities: participative leadership is a more important driver of new product development activities in Germany than in China, while consideration and management emphasis affect new product development more in China than in Germany. Moreover, the study indicates that the effects of culture on the relationships examined grow stronger as an organisation's size decreases. The present research addresses recent calls in the new product development literature to broaden our understanding of cultural dependencies in our theoretical models. The paper concludes by drawing implications for both theory and practice.

It is based on multiple case studies performed in textile factions and cotton mills in Curvelo and Diamantina, micro-regions in the Minas Gerais State. The data were collected in two stages interviews. The corpus included 51 respondents in the first stage and 62 in the second stage, from the operational and management levels. The content analysis was based on the structural, formative and relational dimensions from the perspective of managers and subordinates. The results showed that the addition of workers who develop values inherited from century-old manufacturers represented a strategic option that supported the change of individual competencies into collective competencies, thus determining the work dynamics and the nature of the learning process in the organizations under study.

Emergent Dynamics of Workforce Program Reductions: A Hybrid Multi-Level Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM DYNAMICS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Agent-Based Modeling; Hybrid Simulation; Strategic Human Resources Management; System Dynamics; Unintended Workforce Consequences	MANAGEMENT; MODEL	This paper reports on research that explores designing a hybrid system dynamics/agent modeling (HSDAM) simulation methodology to evaluate potential effects of a new human resources policy in a company. The study measures the effect of changes in the company's pension policies on individual employee retention, promotion and employment longevity. The Delphi method for elicitation of expert views was used, as four expert panels composed of human resource specialists and general managers participated in model design and predicted employee behavior. The model integrates multi-level organizational data inputs from macrolevel business data to granular individual-level employee information. Each simulation run used four years of workforce longitudinal data at the start. Initially, the expert panel predictions did not validate simulation results. However, once alteration of a key model parameter recalibrated individual employees as more economically rational, later runs provided strong support for the model and modeling approach. The simulation results confirmed, among several expert panel predictions, that setting a policy that decreased the likelihood of employee willingness to retire due to replacement income concerns could lead to other consequences with potentially adverse strategic implications for the firm.

J	Chen, HR; Wang, XM				Chen Huarong; Wang Xiaoming			Study on National Sustainable Development Strategy Management Based on Stakeholders Management Theory	CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						sustainable development; strategic management; stakeholders		Based on the stakeholders management theory, this paper provides a new strategic management method for the National Sustainable Development Strategy. By taking China's National Sustainable Development Strategy Management as an example, this paper identifies all the stakeholders involved and then assesses stakeholders from two dimensions, namely "Importance" and "Attitude", by which all of the stakeholders are divided into six categories. On this basis, further analysis is made to work out strategic management programme by scheduling the strategic emphases, steps and management countermeasures for different types of stakeholders so as to provide theortical evidence for the practice of National Sustainable Developnent Strategy management.

J	Cheng, CY				Cheng, Chun Yun			Determinants of early entry: governance choices and syndicate networks in US venture capitals' Internet investments	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						heterogeneous investor networks; homogeneous investor networks; entry timing	CROSS-INDUSTRY; MARKET ENTRY; FIRMS; SUBFIELDS; ALLIANCES; ORDER	This research addresses the issues of governance choices and attributes of network participants as determinants of early entry by integrating a network perspective into the strategic management literature. Our arguments are tested using data on 813 Internet portfolio companies' investments by the venture capitals (VCs), one of the most rapidly developing sectors of the financial service industry in the USA. The results provide little evidence that governance choices between sole investments and syndicate networks may affect the decision to invest in early movers in the Internet industry. Nevertheless, the attributes of VC investors in initial investments affect the likelihood of investing in early movers. The propensity for syndicate investments in early start-ups in the Internet industry increases with the presence of heterogeneous investors' attributes but decreases with the presence of homogeneous investors' attributes.

J	Dahan, J; Dufour, Y				Dahan, Jacqueline; Dufour, Yvon			Middle managers' career success and business strategy in the Canadian aerospace industry A configurational analysis in the context of innovation and costs leadership	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Career success; Middle managers; Business strategy; Management strategy; Configurational approach; Aerospace industry; Canada		Purpose - The main aim of this paper is to investigate the way middle managers picture their career success and the business strategy of their firm with the following key question in mind: "Is there a relationship between the two?". Design/methodology/approach - This research is based on a "polar sample" of two companies of the Canadian aerospace industry that use generic business strategies which differ considerably along the continuum of strategic approaches from one another. A list of 50 people was made in collaboration with the executives of the companies investigated. A total of 74 percent (37) of the middle managers invited to be interviewed accepted the invitation. The interviews lasted on average 90 minutes. They were analyzed using NVivo software. Findings - The analysis yielded a set of four empirical configurations of career success. The idea of central orchestrating theme has been at the core of configuration theory since its inception but few researchers have set the task to investigate them let alone in studying career success. Four core unifying themes were found: "just watch me", "one for all and all for one", "eureka", and "thanks but no thanks". Each of the company strategies provides a receptive context for no more than two coexisting configurations of career success, one leading to a rapid ascent and the other to a slower one. Originality/value - Few studies have looked into how middle managers portray career success for themselves. Furthermore, the literature is wanting in another crucial respect: the researchers do not take into consideration the particular strategic context of the firm. This paper argues that the paths toward career success must be understood in the context of the business strategy of the firms that give them form, meaning, and substance.

To know where to invest and the risk/performance profile, it is necessary to know the profit and loss profile of the building in the future, in addition to building costs. A correct real estate valuation does not exist if upstream a deep knowledge of real estate, financial, statistical, investors' psychology (science or knowledge) cycles, as well as an experience of years do not exist, which allows to acquire sensibility even towards unpredictable events. The dynamic real estate management is the necessary tool to increase the recurring revenue, the capital gain, to improve cash, decrease risks. The real estate manager, consisting in a team with integrated skills, with "on field" experience, with business logical knowledge, with roots on territory, able to share the business risk, with knowledge of public administrations' procedures and complexity, is able to support the real estate investor in the development procedure. The evolution of the decision process must follow the trend that since 2009 has seen the overcoming of redevelopment projects compared to new building projects, with higher costs and complexity, but more sustainable from the environmental and space rationalization point of view. Redevelopment processes will be framed in complex territorial development projects, with guarantees of transparency of administrative processes and times, in order to attract international funds, that today are prevented to operate due to great uncertainty of the administrative process management in Italy.				fecchio.alberto@efmnet.com; casara.ernesto@efmnet.com					AA.

Strategic management for squeezing ground conditions at the Argyle Diamonds block cave project	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Block cave; convergence; squeezing ground; underground mining; undercut		The paper elaborates on a methodology of damage assessment based on conditions encountered in the Argyle Diamonds Underground Project (ADUP). It has been developed iteratively over a number of months and has been used to comprehensively represent damage conditions as the undercut front advances. Correlation between damage and convergence has been established. The ground support regime that has been implemented at ADUP to withstand very severe squeezing (Hoek & Marinos, 2000) has produced the outcome that only in limited areas of extreme squeezing (in excess of 20% convergence) has stripping and rehabilitation been required to enable undercutting operations to continue. This issue highlights the importance of the implementation of adequate guidelines to maintain drive stability and safety during undercutting. The long-term and strategic implications of correlating damage conditions with convergence and therefore deformation are that a practical predictive model can be developed. This can then be used to forecast the level of damage that is likely to occur in the undercut drives and extraction level drives based on displacement modelling. This model allows an optimised level of support and reinforcement to be designed depending on the predicted damage conditions. Such a " predictive" model could be used to estimate the optimal level of support and reinforcing (and to establish a realistic budget and schedule for the work), as well as an ongoing tool for forecasting damage conditions (and remedial support and reinforcing) during undercutting and block caving progression.

J	Geers, K				Geers, Kenneth			Strategic Cyber Defense: Which Way Forward?	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cyber; doctrine; deterrence; arms control; IPv6		Cyber security has evolved from a technical discipline to a strategic, geopolitical concept. The question for national security thinkers today is not how to protect one or even a thousand computers, but millions, including the "cyberspace" around them. Strategic challenges require strategic solutions. This article considers four nation-state approaches to cyber attack mitigation: 1) Technology: Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6); 2) Doctrine: Sun Tzu's Art of War; 3) Deterrence: can we prevent cyber attacks?; 4) Arms control: can we limit cyber weapons? These threat mitigation strategies fall into different categories. IPv6 is a technical solution. Art of War is military. The third and fourth strategies are hybrid: deterrence is a mix of military and political considerations, while arms control is a political/technical approach. Technology and doctrine are the most likely strategies to provide short-term improvement in a nation's cyber defense posture.

I describe my involvement in the formulation of urban policy in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and beyond, and my attempt to understand the student revolt at Berkeley, which spread throughout the United States and indeed much of the world. I further discuss my long involvement in the issue of affirmative action, on which I in time changed my views, originally based on a distinctive conception of the course of ethnicity and ethnic and racial groups in the United States, from critical opposition to acceptance, and my similar involvement in the debates over social policy in the United States, in which a complex point of view has too often been summarized under the term neoconservatism.

J	Gong, LM; Jiang, SS; Greeven, M				Gong, Limin; Jiang, Shisong; Greeven, Mark			Does one size fit all? The governance mode and strategic position of cluster innovation platforms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						industrial cluster; innovation platform; governance mode; Zhili garment; Shaoxing textile	TECHNOLOGICAL REGIMES; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS; SERVICES; POLICY	Despite its significant role, governments encounter a policy dilemma how to intervene in the economy to promote industrial cluster upgrading while not foregoing market driven innovation. This paper focuses on government-supported innovation platforms within industrial clusters. Through a comparative case study in China, we find a general pattern among cluster characteristics, governance mode and strategic position of innovation platforms. The contributions of our paper are: 1) exploring a distinctive pattern of service innovation, 'innovation through services'; 2) proposing a typology for innovation platforms; 3) enriching the knowledge-based theory of clusters by innovation practices in developing countries. Our results also imply that national and provincial policy for innovation platform should keep flexible because one size does not fit all and must be locally adapted. Finally, the co-evolution of the industrial cluster and innovation platform within the cluster is a promising direction for future research.

J	Gray, K; Higgins, M				Gray, Keith; Higgins, Matthew			Legacy, trust, and turbulence in the NHS healthcare commissioning process: An exploratory study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Commissioning; Healthcare; Legacy; Relationships; Trust		The Health & Social Care Bill has focused attention on the commissioning processes evident within the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. Through a detailed exploratory empirical study of commissioning in the NHS, this paper examines how the implicit models constructed through the discourses surrounding the Bill create tensions for the existent commissioning process. Significantly for the research and more broadly in terms of healthcare policy, it highlights the centrality of legacy and trust when considering the introduction of change. The changed nature of the relationships within the commissioning process has wider implications on the commissioning partners, influencing strategic direction, and investment in innovation.

The aim of this study was to investigate these competencies in very preterm children compared to full-term children, describing thus how language, executive functions and verbal short-term memory observed at the end of preschool age (6 years) affect literacy at 8 years. Forty-two monolingual Italian very preterm children (mean gestational age 29.7 weeks), with no history of major cerebral damage, were followed longitudinally at 6 years by investigating language (vocabulary, grammar, and phonological awareness), executive functions (syllabic and phonemic fluency) and verbal short-term memory (vowel span, non-word repetition) and assessed again at 8 years on literacy (word and non-words reading and spelling). Two cross-sectional groups of full-term children were recruited (34 children at 6 years and 26 at 8 years). Preterm children showed lower abilities in language at 6 years and in literacy at 8 years, while no differences between groups regarding syllabic and phonemic fluency and short-term memory were found. Linear regression analyses revealed that in the preterm sample both language and verbal short-term memory had a predictive role on literacy with some differences in function of word versus non-word reading and writing These findings revealed the importance to analyze both language and short-term memory in preterm children at the end of preschool age, with relevant implications for interventions to improve literacy at school age.

J	Gundolf, K; Meier, O; Missonier, A				Gundolf, Katherine; Meier, Olivier; Missonier, Audrey			Mergers between size-unequal partners: strategic risks and hurdles	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Organizational change; Merger; IT; Integration process; Innovation; Strategy		Purpose - This article aims to explore how and why the creation of technological innovation during a merger can end in failure. The objective is to propose new analytical elements to improve the formulation and execution of the integration process between an SME (small and medium enterprise) and a large enterprise. Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop a theoretical framework based on the main research results from several fields, including technology transfer, innovation dissemination, and management. This case study then focuses on a merger in the IT sector in real time. Findings - This study allowed the authors to test theoretical elements, especially the choice of the integration method, which may favour the creation of technological innovation during the integration period. The authors present new reasons for the failure of co-created innovation between an SME and a large enterprise in the IT sector. This case study allowed them to test theoretical elements such as the choice of an integration method which could favour the creation of technological innovation during the integration period while enriching scientific knowledge by proposing a dynamic approach to the integration process. Originality/value - Before managers can envisage symbiosis between two merging firms, they first need to go through a period of exploration, which may entail costly mistakes. Yet this exploration period may be necessary to enable them to discover the limitations of a strictly rational approach to the integration process and to broaden their normal frame of reference. For this in-depth study, the authors benefited from free access to a substantial amount of information that is generally unavailable for scientific research, which greatly contributed to their work. The authors' theoretical framework is not exhaustive, but they tried to incorporate the most significant research results.

J	Gupta, S				Gupta, Seema			Interdependence between experience marketing and business strategy	JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Business strategy; Management strategy; Experience marketing; Marketing; Cross-level interdependencies; Barriers to imitation; Employee empowerment; Customer orientation		Purpose - The extant literature on experience marketing takes a narrow functional approach engaging with issues like defining an experience brand and recommending strategies for creating a unique customer experience. The purpose of this research is to focus on the cross-level interdependencies in the organization and examine interrelatedness between business strategy and experience marketing. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the extant literature on business strategy and experience marketing and investigating an in-depth case study on experience marketing this article arrives at strategic principles of experience marketing. It uses an in depth analysis of a case study of an experience hotel brand covering multiple facets of its business strategy in all its complexities. Data were collected from six sources of evidence: documents, archival records, interviews, direct observation, participant-observation and physical artifacts. A total of 17 interviews lasting from one to several hours each were conducted with senior management. Analysis of the benchmark case was combined with extensive review of literature on business strategy to draw strategic principles of experience marketing which are amenable to further evaluation for enhanced generalizability. Findings - The six dimensions of business strategy: customer orientation, unique company capabilities, barriers to imitation, internal marketing, employee empowerment, and visionary leadership were found to be interrelated with experience marketing. This article also brings focus on research on cross-level dependencies by outlining a detailed agenda for future research and operationalizing the constructs. Originality/value - The linking of experience marketing with business strategy is a novel perspective as the extant literature deals with the subject only in the context of the functional area of marketing.

The increasing amount of underground installations requires strategic work that helps to define the most profitable cabling targets. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a methodology to consider the underground cabling process. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a cabling concept that covers the issues on how cabling should be carried out. The analysis is based on techno-economic and reliability analyses. The methodology consists of several steps that together constitute the concept. Findings - The underground cabling concept comprises several steps that can be simplified into questions: where, what, when and how the network cabling process is carried out. The analysis of these questions and the related features of the network show that different approaches to the renovation can cause significant differences in profitability between the renovation strategies. Research limitations/implications - The underground cabling concept provides a method to analyse the cabling process, and it contains several alternatives for applying the concept. Thus, the applicability of a certain method depends on the network and the objectives of the distribution system operator. Practical implications - Renovation planning of the network has become common in distribution companies. Traditionally, ageing of the network has been the driver for the renovation. However, in the future, the scope of renovation planning should also include other renovation drivers, such as reliability. Originality/value - The methodology proposed in the paper can be applied in the renovation and development process of distribution networks. The results are universal in the electricity distribution.

Evaluation of Strategic Software Investments for the Canadian Cabinet Industry	FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL			English	Article							MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; DECISION; ADOPTION; FIRMS; US	Software investments are increasingly important to remain competitive in modern manufacturing. However, wood product industries generally make minimal information technology (IT) investments and are slow adopters. This study determines the types of software that could contribute the most to the future competitiveness of the Canadian cabinet industry using industry and IT expert input into an Analytic Network Process model. Findings include the following. The Quality strategy is the most crucial for the industry's future competitiveness, with a normalized weight of 0.332, and the Delivery strategy is the least important (0.111). For software, Operations & Engineering and Enterprise Resource Management applications are the most important, having final priorities of 0.227 and 0.222, respectively. Content applications are relatively unimportant (0.087). The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results are robust for varying weights of all strategies except Customer Service. A higher emphasis on the Customer Service strategy increases the priority of the Customer Relationship Management and Collaboration applications to the first and the second-highest priority, respectively.

J	Hopp, C				Hopp, Christian			The acquisition and utilization of market information in new venture development and the contingent nature of new venture organizing activities	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						entrepreneurship; process; PSED II; business plan; marketing; new venture emergence	BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; ORIENTATION; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION; MODEL; INVESTMENTS; DYNAMICS; STRATEGY; SUCCESS	Using data from the Second Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics, this study analyzes the role of information acquisition and utilization in new venture development. We employ competing risk analysis to make use of the longitudinal data structure in PSED II. Our results highlight the contingent nature of information acquisition in assisting the nascent entrepreneur in carrying out organizing activities. Our results show that marketing and business planning activities only create value when entrepreneurs also engage in information acquisition with potential customers. We empirically disentangle a contingent structure among organizing activities in new venture creation and highlight the interdependencies.

J	Hota, AR; Bajpai, P; Pratihar, DK				Hota, Ashish Ranjan; Bajpai, Prabodh; Pratihar, Dilip Kumar			Evolutionary neural networks for strategic bidding in electricity markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Brazil; Electricity industry; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Neural nets; Bidding strategies; Deregulated electricity market; Neural network; Particle swarm optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; CONGESTION-MANAGEMENT; POWER	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a neural network-based market agent, which develops optimal bidding strategies for a power generating company (Genco) in a day-ahead electricity market. Design/methodology/approach - The problem of finding optimal bidding strategy for a Genco is formulated as a two-level optimization problem. At the top level, the Genco aims at maximizing its total daily profit, and at the bottom level, the independent system operator obtains the power dispatch quantity for each market participant with the objective of maximizing the social welfare. The neural network is trained using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the objective of maximizing daily profit for the Genco. Findings - The effectiveness of the proposed approach is established through several case studies on the benchmark IEEE 30-bus test system for the day-ahead market, with an hourly clearing mechanism and dynamically changing demand profile. Both block bidding and linear supply function bidding are considered for the Gencos and the variation of optimal bidding strategy with the change in demand is investigated. The performance is also evaluated in the context of the Brazilian electricity market with real market data and compared with the other methods reported in the literature. Practical implications - Strategic bidding is a peculiar phenomenon observed in an oligopolistic electricity market and has several implications on policy making and mechanism design. In this work, the transmission line constraints and demand side bidding are taken into account for a more realistic simulation. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper has introduced, for the first time, a neural network-based market agent to develop optimal bidding strategies of a Genco in an electricity market. Simulation results obtained from the IEEE 30-bus test system and the Brazilian electricity market demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, as compared to the conventional PSO-based method and the genetic fuzzy rule-based system approach, respectively.

J	Hrehova, D; Ziaran, P				Hrehova, Daniela; Ziaran, Pavel			ANALYSIS OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE PUBLISHED OUTPUTS IN THE AREA OF MARKETING ETHICS EDUCATION	COMMUNICATION TODAY			Czech	Article						marketing; ethics; scientific journal; education; firms; university		Considering that marketing ethics is an interdisciplinary area includeing wide spectrum from marketing, management, finance and accountancy to philosophy, politics and law it requires general knowledge both of the students and academicians. Marketing ethics provides innumerable amount of the materials and topics for open discussion as well as for application in practice. Aims: Monitoring of academic journals in the area of marketing ethics tuition accessible in electronic databases by means of Centre for scientific-technical information SR portal. Procedure: (1) We focussed our attention on the content of monitored scientific and scholarly publications, which are of double character. (2) We paid attention to positive and negative attitudes towards marketing ethics education from the point of view of significant academicians and experts. (3) We summarised the most important literary sources in the marketing ethics area (a) we investigated scientific sources in the area of entrepreneurially ethics tuition in general as well as the position, which is represented by the area of marketing ethics; (b) we analysed its content and its structure in academic journals in the specific area of marketing ethics tuition. Methodological and ideological basis for our survey was the publication, Half a Century of Marketing Ethics: Shifting Perspectives and Emerging Trends" by the authors Schlegelmilcha and Obersedeera. We had the goal to find an optimal result, i.e. the articles dealing with the area of marketing ethics tuition, we tested various combinations of logical information retrieval items for each journal individually and database EBSCO, ProQuest, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ABI/Inform, Business Source Premier. From the journal review we suggested six categories: measurement of ethical values and attitudes; particular pedagogical methods; proposal and structure of ethics course; measurement of education efficiency, ethics integration on the Faculty level; ethical codices and norms, (1) in order to be highly consistent and relevant for categorization of the journals, (2) to enable to monitor academic knowledge and research trends in this area in clear and comprehensible way. We have elaborated in the survey our own "local" impact factor for the specific area of marketing ethics education and tuition. Results: Discussions of academicians, specialists and students about marketing ethics and ethical issues are useful and important. Students need preparation, mentoring and counselling while solving ethical problems, which occur during marketing ethics tuition in the academic field, but also in practice. Academic and scientific sources in the area of marketing ethics education are an excellent "instruction". In the centre of academic interest in the area of marketing ethics there are topics about academic methods and measurements of ethical values and attitudes related above all with marketing education. Marketing ethics should include tuition of one or several topics: marketing principles, marketing management, strategic marketing, marketing research, digital/new media of marketing, marketing of services and trade marking.

J	Huang, HI; Lee, CF				Huang, Hsun-, I; Lee, Cheng-Fei			Strategic management for competitive advantage: a case study of higher technical and vocational education in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competitive advantage; higher technical and vocational education; industrial organisation theory; institutional performance; resource-based view theory; Taiwan	RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; ECONOMICS; VIEW	Higher technical and vocational education institutions in Taiwan face the pressure of an oversupply of student places and fierce competition from domestic and international institutions. To cope with these challenges, higher technical and vocational education institutions that are better equipped to respond to market requirements are expected to achieve competitive advantage and superior performance. A sector-specific model of competitive advantage for higher technical and vocational education institutions in Taiwan is, therefore, developed and tested. The model integrates theories of strategy and competitive advantage, namely industrial organisation theory and resource-based view theory. It is concluded that integration of industrial organisation and resource-based view theories provides a useful framework in which to comprehensively and systematically analyse an industry sector in relation to competitive advantage. This study also highlights that institutional performance depends on the match between the state of the environment surrounding the higher technical and vocational education institutions and their use of resources.

J	Iqbal, T; Khan, N				Iqbal, Tahir; Khan, Nawar			Export Performance a Vital Indicator for Measuring Industry Competitiveness: Evidence from Pakistan Textile and Clothing Industry	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION			English	Article						Export data exploration; Textile and clothing sector; Export performance; Competitiveness		Federal Bureau of Statistics Pakistan is regularly collecting and maintaining data for exports for industrial sectors (textile, food and other manufacturing commodities) and Service Sector. Export performance is a vital indicator for measuring any industry competitiveness. Pakistan Textile and Clothing Export data from 2005-2006 - 2009-2010 was explored for competitive performance analysis. Sector was further divided into three categories low, medium and high based on their share. Performance was anlaysed using SPSS. 19 and Microsoft Excel. It was found that Cotton Yarn, Knit-Wear and Towel had positive compound annual growth rate (CAGR), whereas, Cotton Cloth, Bed-Wear and Ready-Made Garment comprising of 50-60% of the group had negative CAGR. Poor performance were found to be due to low quality, less value added products, weak competitive intelligence, low product mix, lack of skills, weak marketing, high production cost, out dated technology, old manufacturing techniques, electricity and gas shortage and severe competition from China after its integration into World Trade Organizations (WTO) Structures on termination of post quota regime. To achieve sustainable competitiveness, foreign investment should be encouraged through making strategic alliances with major players by exploiting competitive advantage of raw material and low wage labour potential. Moreover, industry should be strengthen upstream and downstream through advancement in biotechnology, development of energy availability strategies, investment in technology, institutionalising workers skills, exploiting low labour cost, improve marketing, and transforming small and medium units into well-organized high quality, high value added, low cost competitive large units.

J	Isouard, G				Isouard, G.			The Pathology Workforce Crisis: future solutions	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pathology; workforce; pathologist; career structure; leadership; medical scientists		Introduction: A recently released report, the National Survey of Pathology Workforce 2011, has painted a bleak future for clinical pathology services in terms of a looming major workforce shortage. Approach: A review is undertaken of the current pathology workforce situation to determine the key contributing issues, future demands, workforce needs and strategic solutions. Findings: A workforce crisis in pathology is upon us, with approximately a third of the total workforce expected to leave within the next five years. This represents a real threat to the future capacity of the workforce to sustain quality services at current levels and the likely growth of demand for pathology testing into the future. Conclusion: Four strategies are recommended to address the future pathology workforce needs in Australia through leadership and workforce development. These are; increasing supply of the workforce; redistributing the workforce from areas of lower to higher demand; improving productivity; and reducing demand for pathology services.

The paper brings up the key differences between traditional learning and work-based pedagogy. It presents the strategic partnership between MUAS and Mikkeli Theatre as one form of collaboration in work-based pedagogy. As a conclusion it can be said that requirements of working-life and the main tasks of the University of Applied Sciences put a great deal of pressure onto professional education. In response to these demands new pedagogical models must be developed and researched. Compared to traditional classroom teaching, work-based pedagogy has changed the context of assignments, evaluation and the schedule of the studies. It has also laid more emphasis on the collaborative relationships between students, teachers and working-life.

This exploratory study investigates the mediating effect of SMA on the relationship between Porter's (1980) competitive strategy and firm performance. The contingency model incorporates the two dimensions of SMA, i.e. the usage of SMA techniques and the changing role of accountants in the strategic decision-making process. The results of partial least squares appear to support SMA usage mediates partially the relationship between product differentiation strategy and firm performance. There is also a positive relationship between business strategy and strategic role of accountant. However, it is unable to find support on the positive association between strategic role of accountant and firm performance.

J	Li, XW; Kuang, WD				Li, Xiaowei; Kuang, Weida			Prepayment behavior of China's mortgage borrowers: evidence from the loan-level data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS			English	Article						China; Housing markets; Consumer behaviour; Borrowing; Property finance; Mortgages; Prepayment; Segmentation; Risk management	VALUATION; MODELS	Purpose - There exists a large volume of literature evaluating the mortgage prepayment risk based on the USA's and other developed countries' experiences. With access to detailed loan- level data provided by a national mortgage lender in China, the purpose of this paper is to revisit the empirical question of the determinants of mortgage prepayment probability. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilizes unique loan-level data from a large national residential mortgage lender in China to provide insights into borrowers' prepayment behavior in China under recent market conditions, focusing on the customers' behavior and the segmentation analysis of the prepayment risk. Findings - The results from a logit model indicate that housing appreciation rate and the stock market performance are important considerations for Chinese borrowers. It was also found that borrowers show the heterogeneous prepayment behavior in different groups. For instance, households who purchase new houses are less sensitive to the LTV ratio. These findings provide empirical support for the risk management in the rapid growing mortgage market in China as well as those in other transitional economies. Research limitations/implications - Because of the lack of the literature in the immature mortgage markets, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further using their own datasets. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for policy makers to further strategic decision making using a quantitative framework which has not been fully developed in most of the state-owned banks in China. Originality/value - This paper has contributed to the analysis of Chinese mortgage prepayment pattern using a large recent micro-loan level data set. As mortgage borrowers' behavior can be country specific due to the differences in housing policies and housing market structure, this paper sheds new light on the driver factors determining mortgage prepayment in China's mortgage market.

J	Lourens, C; van Vuuren, LJ; Eiselen, R				Lourens, Colette; van Vuuren, Leon J.; Eiselen, Riette			Measurement of Organisation-Professional Conflict in the industrial psychology profession	SA JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							ETHICS; ACCOUNTANTS; PRINCIPLES; CODES; WORK	Orientation: Professionals, employed in organisations, operate within professional and organisational contexts serving different stakeholders. Subsequently, professionals may experience tension or conflict between their role as professional and employee. Research purpose: To establish the measurement of the perceptions and experiences of industrial psychology (IP) professionals, employed in South African organisations, with regard to Organisation-Professional Conflict (OPC) as well as the antecedents associated with this phenomenon. Motivation for the study: Although the extent to which professionals experience OPC is welldocumented for medical and accountancy professionals, the extent to which IP professionals experience this phenomenon remains unclear. Research design, approach and method: A structured questionnaire was developed and applied as a cross-sectional survey to all registered South African IP professionals employed in organisations. Responses based on the N = 143 self-selecting respondents were captured and utilised for statistical analysis. Main findings: OPC in the IP profession can be considered as the incongruence between professional organisational roles and duties, and their responsibility to adhere to professional obligations. Professional autonomy and strategic alignment were found to mitigate the occurrence of OPC, whereas power tension and compromise of professionalism seem to exacerbate the occurrence thereof. Practical/managerial implications: The research might create an awareness of the existence of OPC amongst the respective stakeholders. Knowledge of OPC may have implications for professionals who render their professional services to organisations. Contribution/value-add: The findings may inform formal professional associations, industrial psychologists employed by organisations, their employing organisations, and the governing board, about the nature and extent of OPC.

J	Pereira, MM; Melao, NF				Manuela Pereira, Maria; Filipe Melao, Nuno			The implementation of the balanced scorecard in a school district Lessons learned from an action research study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Portugal; Schools; Balanced scorecard; Strategic management; Performance measurement; Public schools	MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the benefits, obstacles and challenges in implementing the balanced scorecard (BSC) in non-higher education public schools, more specifically, in a Portuguese school district. Design/methodology/approach - An action research approach was used to develop a BSC, help to implement changes and reflect about the outcomes. Findings - The paper presents the BSC for the school district and discusses five benefits, two obstacles and three challenges that emerged from the study. While some findings are in line with those found in other levels of education, others seem to be context-specific. Research limitations/implications - The results refer to a single intervention in Portugal and the methodology used precludes any generalization attempts. Practical implications - The findings are particularly relevant to the Portuguese context, providing evidence that the BSC can overcome some weaknesses of schools in the area of strategic management, as identified by the literature. They also raise implications for the wider field of the BSC's use in non-higher education public schools, suggesting reasons why things may go wrong. The results may be of value to practitioners wishing to make the implementation of the BSC more effective. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the scarce body of literature on the application of the BSC to non-profit organizations by providing an understanding of its possible benefits, obstacles and challenges in non-higher education public schools. It shows how the BSC methodology can be adapted to fit the specific requirements of a school district. This is one of the first papers to discuss an application of the BSC to non-higher education public schools.

URBAN PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION MEETING ECOLOGICAL PURPOSES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						urban planning; ecological purposes; sustainable development; environmental quality		The urban areas play an important role in achieving the objectives of the EU Strategy for Sustainable Development. The environmental, the economic and social dimensions interfere the hardest inside the urban areas. A high quality of the urban environment also contributes to achieving the priority of the revised Lisbon Strategy, which aims 'to make Europe a more attractive place to live and invest. The 6th Environment Action Program (EUA) has called for achieving a Thematic Strategy on Urban Environment, and has helped to ensure that environment legislation is in place to tackle most environmental challenges in the EU. This was a key finding of the final assessment of the 6th EAP (2002-2012), adopted in August 2011. In the context mentioned above, the Urban Environment Management Plan of the Municipality of Drobeta Turnu Severin (Dr. Tr. Severin), a strategic document, will set environmental targets in the short, medium and long term, for the city of Dr. Tr. Severin. It will define the strategic vision, mode of action for achieving the targets set, but also their planning in time, to guide current management decisions, to gradually improve the environment and life quality of our citizens in a sustainable manner.

JOURNAL OF PLACE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Knowledge City (KC); General success factors (GSFs); Key success factors (KSFs); Critical success factors (CSFs); Tehran; Knowledge management; Strategic management; Iran		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify general success factors (GSFs), key success factors (KSFs) and critical success factors (CSFs) needed to change Tehran to a Knowledge City (KC). Design/methodology/approach - The paper briefly reviews the literature related to KCs, and especially the factors necessary for a KC. Through the review of the literature GSFs are identified, followed by statistical evidence to determine which one of the GSFs are KSFs and which can be considered as CSF or competency factors (CF). Findings - The findings of the research indicate that there are 27 relevant items and seven main factors as GSFs for changing Tehran to a KC. Also, the authors find that all seven GSFs are both KSFs and CSFs. Research limitations/implications - As the research is limited to a specific city, the findings cannot be generalized. Also, limited familiarity of the concept of KCs by practitioners and academic members can be considered as another limitation of the study. Practical implications - This study is of benefit to those authorities/agencies trying to change Tehran to a KC. Originality/value - The paper provides insights to different dimensions of KCs, and has identified GSFs, KSFs and CSFs for a city that intends to become a KC.

J	Nishimura, A				Nishimura, Akira			PROFIT OPPORTUNITY, STRATEGIC INNOVATIONS, AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						Uncertainty; profit opportunity; strategic innovation; profit opportunity-based variance analysis	SYSTEM	This paper reexamines the concept of profit in management accounting from the viewpoints of opportunity, profit opportunity, and strategic (feed forward) innovation. The information required today for strategic management and performance evaluation has become distinct from accounting profit information required for traditional management, given the current transitory and uncertain business environment. However, management accounting cannot exist without profit. Therefore, this paper seeks to examine the source of profit and clarify the profit opportunity-based aspects of contemporary management accounting through the analysis of opportunity, profit opportunity, and strategic innovations. For this purpose, the paper first addresses the relationship between opportunity and profit opportunity. Second, in association with management accounting, it seeks to understand current innovations intended to enhance profit opportunity. Thirdly, effects of innovations and profit opportunity on target costing in Japan are discussed. Lastly, this paper develops profit opportunity-based variance analysis that is useful in feed forward planning and feedback control processes. Increased use of strategic innovation management is found to yield more useful variance analysis and strengthen the strategic feature of management accounting, which can contribute to future innovation in management and help objectively recognize and reduce opportunity costs.

J	Rao, MT				Rao, Madhu T.			Control and Coordination of Information Systems in Multinational Corporations: An Empirical Examination of Subsidiary and Host Country Factors	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Control; coordination; mechanisms; multinational corporation	ORGANIZATIONS; UNCERTAINTY; ENTERPRISE; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	In multinational corporations (MNCs), subsidiaries operate in environments separated, not only by geographical distances, but also by time, language, politics, and legal frameworks. Such heterogeneity of operating environments puts great demands on the management of information systems (IS) to control and coordinate the organization's worldwide IS operations. This study examines the factors influencing the integration of the IS function across subsidiaries in MNCs. Specifically, the impact of subsidiary strategic role, perceived environmental uncertainty (PEU), and host country IS resources on the use of formal and informal mechanisms of control and coordination is examined. Multiple regression models were run on matched sets of data collected from 54 headquarters-subsidiary pairs. The relationship between the strategic role of a subsidiary and the level of integration was found to be significant. Moderate support was also found for the hypothesized relationship between IS resources and integration, though not in the direction expected. There was no support for the predicted relationships involving perceived environmental uncertainty.

JOURNAL FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL & PLANNING LAW			English	Article						Natural resources; sustainability; resource efficiency; eco-efficiency; life cycle thinking		Compared to climate protection and the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency, the saving of natural resources has been a somewhat neglected field of EU sustainability law. Based on the thesis that from an environmental policy perspective it is not resource scarcity as such but the environmental impacts associated with resource use that must be addressed, the article analyses the existing EU law and possibilities for strengthening resource efficiency and eco-efficiency in EU law. In particular, it discusses possible strategic concepts and instruments, focusing on activity-based strategies such as product life cycle thinking.

Due to the (non) presence of certain characteristics, the extent to which managers tend to be potential leaders is estimated. For purpose of the research the survey was conducted in a total of five companies on strategic, tactical and operational level of management. The results are compared with previous research conducted in 2002-2003 within the project "Comparative study of the functioning of management". Managers in agribusiness showed a majority in tendency of thinking like leaders and in other related segments their behavior is closely to contemporary knowledge on effective leadership. Due to other companies, agribusiness does not show the significant differences in according to which is concluded that this sector is dominated by well-known and well-established managerial practices. The fact is that a dynamic business environment of the food industry requires first and foremost the high professionalism, innovation and the ability to coordinate from its leading human resources. Regarding to actuality of leadership subject in domestic and foreign scientific public, and its importance for the business success of enterprises, the study provides an overview of the characteristics of management in selected Croatian agribusiness enterprises.

J	Riot, E; de la Burgade, E				Riot, Elen; de la Burgade, Emmanuel			Stamping La Poste: an illustration of the influence of societal effects on strategic change	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic change; Postal services; Productive work systems; Fit; Societal effect; France; Social factors; Organizational change; Monopolies	SERVICE; ORGANIZATION	Purpose - The aim of this paper is to explain how the globalisation of services can be limited or enhanced by societal effects. Design/methodology/approach - This analysis is based on a single case study. The authors use a qualitative and longitudinal approach, with in-depth interviews and archives collected during a six-year period of participant observation inside the firm. Findings - The authors argue that societal dimensions are at play in the evolution of services activities, and that their influence is especially strong in ex-public services monopolies. They illustrate the limits of strategic change due to the specific dynamics of societal effects. The authors first look at the evolution of strategic fit before and after multiple changes in La Poste. They then identify different types of reactions at local level. They conclude by insisting on the enduring influence of social patterns and traditions on the adoption of new technologies and modes of organisation. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this research is that a more thorough comparison with other European national leaders in postal services would have helped strengthen this analysis. Practical implications - A first practical implication for services firms is that societal changes should be greatly considered in their globalisation process and that societal changes are often underestimated. Another practical implication is that a globalisation of services process must certainly be situated at a global level based on national and local specificities built in time. Originality/value - While comparative studies on international management have often focused on the different modes of organisation depending on culture and institutions, the impact of globalisation on services have been left relatively under-explored. This paper takes the example of the service industry to show that cultural reasons are not sufficient to explain why the internationalisation of services may encounter difficulties. Other factors such as societal effect should be included.

Ergonomics Program Management in Tucurui Hydropower Plant using TPM Methodology	WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION			English	Article						TPM; Hydropower Plant; Health Pillar		This paper aims to present the benefits achieved in the ergonomics process management with the use of the TPM methodology (Total Productive Maintenance) in Tucurui Hydropower Plant. The methodology is aligned with the corporate guidelines, moreover with the Strategic Planning of the company, it is represented in the TPM Pillars including the Health Pillar in which is inserted the ergonomics process. The results of the ergonomic actions demonstrated a 12% reduction over the absenteeism rate due to musculoskeletal disorders, solving 77,0% of ergonomic non-conformities, what favored the rise of the Organizational Climate in 44,8%, impacting on the overall performance of the company. Awards confirmed the success of the work by the achievement of the Award for TPM Excellence in 2001, Award for Excellence in Consistent TPM Commitment in 2009 and more recently the Special Award for TPM Achievement, 2010. The determination of the high rank administration and workers, allied with the involvement/dynamism of Pillars, has assured the success of this management practice in Tucuru Hydropower Plant.

However, a potential massive deployment of femto-access points (FAPs) poses a big challenge in terms of interference management, which requires proper radio resource allocation techniques. In this article, we propose alternative optimal power/bit allocation strategies over a time-frequency frame based on a statistical modeling of the interference activity. Given the lack of knowledge of the interference activity, we assume a Bayesian approach that provides the optimal allocation, conditioned to periodic spectrum sensing, and estimation of the interference activity statistical parameters. We consider first a single FAP accessing the radio channel in the presence of a dynamical interference environment. Then, we extend the formulation to a multi-FAP scenario, where nearby FAP's react to the strategies of the other FAP's, still within a dynamical interference scenario. The multi-user case is first approached using a strategic non-cooperative game formulation. Then, we propose a coordination game based on the introduction of a pricing mechanism that exploits the backhaul link to enable the exchange of parameters (prices) among FAP's.

J	Sarif, SM; Ismail, Y				Sarif, Suhaimi Mhd; Ismail, Yusof			MACRO STICKINESS IN STRATEGIC PLANNING OF MALAYSIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING			English	Article						Strategic planning; Higher education; Resource-based perspectives; Stickiness; Malaysia	ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICES; ADAPTATION; UNIVERSITY	Stickiness is an economic phenomenon in terms of cost, imposed preferences, policy paradigm and national priorities that caused planning to be inadequate and less responsive. Purpose of study - This study investigates the influence of macro stickiness in strategic planning of Malaysia's higher education. Design/methodology/approach - It uses personal interview with academic administrators and representatives of selected academic staff associations to obtain data to accomplish research objectives. Findings - The results show that the informants argued that national unity, economic advantages to attract foreign investment, and sound economic growth influenced the strategic planning of Malaysia's higher education. Research limitations and/or implications - The results of the study are essential to assist policy makers and strategic planners in formulating Malaysia's higher education policy. Originality/value - Recent study on "macro" level stickiness confirms that policy makers and government confirmed that the government cannot exclude previous policy documents that contained three major elements, i.e., national unity, foreign direct investment and sound economic growth in designing national economic and social policies.

J	Sedysheva, M				Sedysheva, Maritana			Strategic management system and methods of controlling as key elements of military expenditure policy-making process	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Estonia; National economy; Public finance; Expenditure; Armed forces; Utility function; Balanced Scorecard; Military expenditure; Budgeting; Strategy		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual approach to determining an optimal strategy development process and controlling of the defence spending, by utilizing the decision-making system adopted in the Republic of Estonia. Design/methodology/approach - The author offers a part of the Balanced Scorecard model named "Management and Control Perspective" as one of the improvement tools for the system of planning military expenditures and effective utilization of budgetary funds. Findings - The results show that the Balanced Scorecard application, using the "utility function", will allow the Estonian Defence Forces to overcome important barriers to strategy implementation by interrelation of military planning and budgeting processes. Research limitations/implications - One suggestion for further research might be established as a way of improvement and development of methods directed to application of the utility function in the decision-making process. This approach will improve calculations of strategic perspective plans and will reveal the essence of the budgetary policy on the whole by taking into consideration expenses features of the business and non-profit organizations. Practical implications - By using the Balanced Scorecard the paper offers a new strategic method of planning and controlling the military expenditure in the Estonian Defence Forces. Originality/value - The present paper provides direct evidence of the alternative methods forecast measures and the possibility of using mathematical models in the strategic planning process.

J	Serdukov, S				Serdukov, Svetlana			From the chaos of transition economy to "normalized" managerial practices: The role of group interaction in creating meaning in managerial work	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						transition; ideology; identity; longitudinal; Kazakhstan	STRATEGIC CHANGE; SOCIAL IDENTITY; SENSEMAKING	The purpose in this paper is to explore the interplay between managerial sensemaking, representations and identity in the context of a transition economy. Using the approach of theory of social representations (Moscovici, 1961), a thirteen year long observation of a group of twelve owners/managers was adopted The research concluded that managerial practices emerged in social interaction. These practices existed in relations of co-production and were embedded in the social construct. During the transition period, the content of managerial actions, narratives and identity changed in the same way under the influence of shared culture, ideologies and day-to-day social practices. This is one of the rare longitudinal studies of transition economies where the process of emergence of a small social group was observed and the pattern of evolution identified.

J	Shen, SSQ; Perera, S				Shen, Sabrina Shi Qiong; Perera, Sujatha			DIAGNOSTIC AND INTERACTIVE USES OF BUDGETS AND THE MODERATING EFFECT OF STRATEGIC UNCERTAINTY	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						Budgets; diagnostic and interactive uses; diagnostic control systems; interactive control systems; moderating effect; strategic uncertainty		The existing literature suggests that under certain environmental conditions control systems such as budgets can be effective only if they are used interactively. However, empirical evidence to support such a proposition is scant. This study examines the moderating effect of strategic uncertainty on the effectiveness of budgets when used as (a) a diagnostic control system; and (b) an interactive control system. In examining these relationships, the intervening role of individual motivation is also considered. Findings based on the data gathered from a questionnaire survey of large and medium size public sector organisations in Australia confirm that while diagnostic use of budgets is more effective in motivating individual performance under low strategic uncertainty, interactive use of budgets is more effective when strategic uncertainty is high. This study contributes to both the theory and practice.

J	Shimanuki, S; Saiki, T				Shimanuki, Seiya; Saiki, Tomoko			Technological diversity management of medical device enterprises	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Japan; Manufacturing industries; Medical appliances; Product development; Knowledge management; Technological diversity; Medical device enterprise		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine knowledge creation and technological diversity management by medical device manufacturers, to identify strategic directions for innovation in the medical device field. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses two types of data to assess the importance of multiple technologies and technological diversity in product development: patent applications and approvals of medical devices for sale and use in medical treatment. Additional perspective is provided by the results of a survey of management styles. Findings - While knowledge-creating innovation frequently combines multiple technologies, the scope of technological diversity, the variety of types of technology combined may be wider in low-risk than in high-risk innovation. Research limitations/implications - The sample size is too small to justify claims of statistical significance. This research should be extended to incorporate more cases and explore the theme in greater depth. Practical implications - Companies that choose a high-risk strategy are likely to be more focused on related multiple technologies with which their researchers are already familiar. Conversely, companies that choose a low-risk strategy may have more room to experiment since, if something goes wrong, the risk to patient health is lower. Innovative medical device enterprise to seek high-risk device development is proposed to manage optimal diversity for it. Originality/value - This paper analyses two case studies relevant to growing interest in technological diversity and knowledge management in knowledge-driven innovation in the medical device industry in Japan.

J	Talamo, C				Talamo, Cinzia			Enhancement and knowledge	TECHNE-JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ARCHITECTURE AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Knowledge; Assessment; Information; Management; Maintenance		Many issues related to enhancement strategies emerge nowadays both from the scenario offered by public real estates and from the current processes of conveyance of public assets to local authorities. On one hand it is still difficult, from a strategic point of view, to approach in the medium-long term the chronic problems of the public estates due to deterioration, obsolescence and organizational inadequacy. On the other hand there is the risk that inadequate levels of knowledge lead on one side to a prevalence of the binomial enhancement-alienation and on the other side to a lack of full comprehension of the actual potentialities of the existing assets. In this direction it is possible to analyze the topic of enhancement through, among many, the key of knowledge during the lifecycle of a building.

J	Thite, M				Thite, Mohan			Taking India to the world CEOs' perspectives on the internationalization of Indian IT multinationals	JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Indian multinationals; IT services industry; Emerging economy multinationals; Indian IT CEOs; India; Multinational companies; Information technology		Purpose - The aim of this paper is to deal with the purpose, process and prospects pertaining to the rapid internationalization of the Indian information technology (IT) services multinational corporations (MNCs) with a view to explore the issues, challenges and strategies of MNCs from emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents the key findings of in-depth interviews with the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of the top three Indian IT MNCs on a range of issues pertaining to international management. Findings - The findings suggest that the Indian IT multinationals are typical born-global MNCs that have successfully leveraged on the availability of large and low-cost Indian IT talent pools and have pioneered the global services delivery model from a global network of development centers. They are currently diversifying into emerging markets where they realize that they need to localize their workforce and business models. They face several challenges in globalizing their talent pool and becoming truly global corporations. Practical implications - The MNCs from emerging economies are adopting a different growth trajectory and strategic mindset as compared to traditional, western MNCs. They bring several distinct country- and firm-specific advantages to the twenty-first century global economy and are eager to establish themselves as innovative global players in their own right. Originality/value - The CEOs play a defining role in shaping the strategy, destiny and direction of a firm. By looking at the internationalization of the top three Indian IT multinationals from the perspective of their CEOs, the strategic apex, we get invaluable, though incomplete, insights into the motives and constraints behind their strategy formulation and implementation.

J	Thomas, HG				Thomas, Harold			Policy imperative, management challenge: a case study in college of education reform from Kwara State in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						college of education; governance; institutional planning; managing change; policy formulation; reform		In 2007, Kwara State in Nigeria embarked on a process of college of education reform. This article explores the strategic and managerial issues associated with that process. It sets out the policy imperative for reform within the context of an urgent need to improve the quality of education in Nigeria and traces progress over a four year period, drawing upon experience at both the Ministry of Education and college level. The article analyses the impact of what was a 'top-down' initiative, focusing in particular on the policy formulation process; the experience of developing an institutional plan; and the factors that made reform such a management challenge. The article concludes by highlighting lessons that might be learned from the Kwara experience.				haroldgthomas@hotmail.com			Cambridge Education and colleagues on the Education Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN); United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID)	The author gratefully acknowledges support from Cambridge Education and colleagues on the Education Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN) with whom he worked as a consultant during the programme.

Modelling and benchmarking organisations' memory capabilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						benchmarking; Greece; holistic model; knowledge management; organisational memory		The paper proposes a functional model for enhancing and evaluating organisations' memory capabilities. The model consists of well-tested and refined managerial measures that interact seamlessly with one another in order to deliberately preserve past experiences and make them available to support subsequent and increasingly sophisticated activities. Further, it applies the phenomenological model of human memory on the organisational field, by introducing that organisational memory is founded on individual and team interactions, knowledge management processes and technology. The proposed model is based on five dimensions: a) bond quality between employees; b) knowledge diffusion processes; c) organisational training systems, d) knowledge storage capabilities; e) memory and knowledge-based decision making procedures. It acts as an organisational memory diagnostic tool of whether an organisation provides and enhances organisational memory and reveals certain ways of acting towards forming organisational memory. Finally, the paper implements the proposed model in four business sectors in Greece, discusses the findings and proposes a number of strategic policies towards organisations' memory enhancement.

The empirical results show that hotels with international chain strategy alliances enjoy higher resource utilisation efficiency than independent operated hotels. The hotel with the more diversification of precompetitive alliances enjoys less resource utilisation efficiency. Furthermore, the deregulation of tourism in China had no impact on the results.

J	Zheng, JY				Zheng Jiyong			The "Conflict-Reconciliation" Cycle on the Korean Peninsula: A Chinese Perspective	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article						"Conflict-Reconciliation" cycle; Northeast Asia; China; North Korea; South Korea		A unique phenomenon, the "conflict-reconciliation" cycle prevalent on the Korean peninsula consists of three levels of fluctuating mechanisms: the vibrating China-U.S. rivalry at the international level; the chaotic Northeast Asia (NEA) management mechanism at the regional level; and the vicious cycle of mutual cognition at the bilateral level. This cycle has been shaped by the diversified strategic objectives of NEA countries, the instability of the Republic of Korea (ROK) political structure, the fluid nature of the power structure of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the impulse of related countries to influence the regional situation. The key to reverse and to reorient this cycle toward a more amicable direction lies in the proper handling of big power relations, the improving of regional political cycles, the upgrading of the diplomatic strategies of related countries, and understanding the DPRK more precisely. As one of the most important issues confronting ROK diplomacy, the "conflict-reconciliation" cycle offers a reference for solving other regional and international problems, such as the rivalry between China and the United States against the backdrop of China's rise, the proper role of ROK diplomacy, the mutual understanding between the two Koreas, and the DPRK's efforts to ease its political dilemma through economic means.

J	Arsenijevic, J; Tot, V; Nikolic, M; Milin, D				Arsenijevic, Jasmina; Tot, Vilmos; Nikolic, Marija; Milin, Dragana			The gap between science, education and economy of Serbia and developed countries	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						National strategy; science; education; competitiveness; economy	INNOVATION	This study examines problems of national development in Serbia from the perspective of science, higher education, and economy. Indentifying these problems is based on presentation and analysis of indicative examples and data, and previously defined factors of national development related to knowledge, finally pointing out to the evident gap between Serbia and the most competitive countries. The study is based on perception of strategy of scientific and technological development of Serbia (2010 to 2015), national strategy of economic development (2006 to 2012) and lack of strategy of higher education, and revolves perspective of science, technology and higher education in Serbia. It was shown that in Serbia, there is no compliance between higher education, science and economy. Small percentage of highly educated population (6.5%) and brain drain contribute to problem deepening. This paper suggests that there is no systemic and strategic planning of these decisive factors of development. The existing strategies are not complied or sufficiently precise in essential issues, such as priority fields of economic development, harmonization of higher education (budget quotas) with the needs of economy and scientific and technological development, measures of brain drain prevention and encouragement of scientific cooperation with foreign countries.

It also examines the indirect effects of a marketing strategy on consumer satisfaction via the price and service quality. To clarify, it employs the concept of natural logarithms and the Lagrange function to develop a conceptual model and form an optimal marketing strategy. In addition, the study develops a model based on the conception of game theory to identify the global marketing strategy in a competitive environment. In order to illustrate the viability and contributions of the mathematical model; the empirical research employs the structural equation modeling to test the interrelationships among research constructs. The mathematical and empirical results offer an optimal guideline for a global marketing strategy to provide direction for allocating strategic resources in a competitive environment. The results of the structural equation model support the intermediary roles of price and service quality in the relationship between marketing strategy and customer satisfaction. A coordination-integration strategy can reduce price, and both standardization and coordination-integration strategies can reduce price and enhance service quality and then enhance customer satisfaction in the global service market.

Deliberate strategy and the tangible link to performance: Lessons from South African higher education	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Deliberate; emergent strategy; performance; higher education institutions		The notion of deliberate versus emergent strategy has long been debated. However, researchers have failed to show which method will bring about an increase in organisational performance, which is the bottom line for business organizations. The study proposes that higher education institutions (HEIs) can be regarded as businesses, and thus, also have to be concerned about their performance within competitive environments. Using a quantitative methodology, we set out to explore the environments in four public HEIs in South Africa and sought information on their use of deliberate strategy. The study then compared their use of strategy with their performance (determined by their research outputs - an inarguable measure of performance in the current South African higher education landscape). The paper further compared two types of HEIs in South Africa, namely traditional universities and universities of technology. Statistical significance testing was done to determine mean differences between the various groups. The paper found that with regard to deliberate strategic management processes deployed, there were no significant differences between the types of institution. However, a significant finding was that more deliberate use of strategic management was likely to result in higher research outputs in HEIs. The article concludes with recommendations to policy makers regarding their strategic management directives.

J	Bruggen, A				Brueggen, Alexander			Ability, Career Concerns, and Financial Incentives in a Multi-Task Setting	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						ability; career concerns; explicit incentives; implicit incentives; multi-task	INFORMATION ASYMMETRY; PERFORMANCE; CONTRACTS; SCHEME; SLACK	In a laboratory experiment, I investigate the role of perceived own ability in a multi-task setting with career concerns under fixed wages and under financial incentives with a higher weight on the task measured with noise. I find that in the absence of career concerns, participants allocate effort evenly between tasks under fixed wages and allocate more effort on the task measured with noise, both irrespective of individual ability levels. However, in presence of career concerns, perceived own ability matters for effort allocation. In particular, career concerns distort effort allocation of agents with high perceived ability, whereas agents with low perceived ability show less distorted effort allocation. In the presence of career concerns, the interaction between financial incentives and perceived ability is always disordinal, which implies that low ability agents exhibit less distorted behavior under any compensation contract. A higher explicit incentives weight on the task measured with greater noise helps to balance effort allocation, but makes all agents worse off due to the strategic behavior of agents. To keep their chances on the labor market high, ability agents increase their effort allocation to the precisely measured task slightly in anticipation of a strong focus on the precisely measured task of low ability agents. These findings are in line with economic predictions and show that perceived own ability moderates the relationship between financial incentives and career concerns on effort allocation.

J	Carmichael, DG; Balatbat, MCA				Carmichael, David G.; Balatbat, Maria C. A.			ON THE ANALYSIS OF PROPERTY UNIT SALES OVER TIME	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Analysis; Property sales; Uncertainty; Markov chains	ACCOUNTS	Investors in multiple unit developments, such as apartments, townhouses, condominiums and connected dwellings, rely on a stream of sales in order to achieve a viable cash flow, a dominant issue. At the feasibility phase of a development, sales over time are estimated, and commonly this is done deterministically. However, with uncertainty in sales, such estimates may not be realised when the market is tested, and the investor's hoped-for cash flow may not be attained. Accordingly some acknowledgment of this uncertainty should be made in order to assess the associated risks. In this light, the paper presents an analysis of sales over time where uncertainty in sales is taken into account. The underlying model developed is based on Markov chains, specifically adapted to sales. Actual development data are used to illustrate the paper's approach and conclusions. The model provides useful core information on sales, both in quantum and timing, to the investor. The model provides a tool useful to practitioners, and one complementary to their existing sales analysis approaches. The paper provides an original contribution, and one of practical use, to established investor practices in the analysis of sales of multiple unit developments.

J	Hofmann, E				Hofmann, Erik			Compensation and Buy-back Deals in Supply Chains: Analyzing Strategic Decision Areas by Using AHP	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Barter; Countertrade; Industrial contract; SCM; Analytic hierarchy process		Practice reports suggest that the oldest form of trade - barter - is taking shape in supply chain management and production research. The paper highlights the phenomenon of countertrade in supply chains and takes first steps towards the conceptualization and explanation of a potentially powerful competitive tool - the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) - in practice.To test the construct, the model is applied to an illustrative case. The illustrations and the decision model shed light into why, and how, firms use countertrade in supply chains to support long-term business success. The identified forms of countertrade in supply chains exhibit different strengths with regard to a set of business objectives. The results contribute to the academic discussion of reciprocal agreements in supply chains as well as to the field of strategic production research in general. This paper should be of interest to practitioners as well as to academics specializing in supply chain management and strategic alliances in business networks.

This paper collects 16,228 maintenance records of a representative hospital in Taiwan and further analyzes the cost distribution. Besides, by calculating the maintenance cost of per square meter of floor area per year (dollar/m(2)/year) and comparing with the previous studies, this paper also points out the relationship between maintenance cost and the operation ages. Moreover, this paper establishes a hybrid grey model termed as EGM(1,1), which adopting exponential series to identify the residual error series resulted from grey model, to predict the maintenance cost. The repair cost of hospital building from 1998 to 2006 is adopted to demonstrate the applicability and practicability of EGM(1,1). Results show that the proposed model can predict the tendency precisely.

The analysis mostly relies on research on cluster activities and human resource strategies that enable a firm to achieve a competitive advantage. The study is based on some evidence of clusters from Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, India and Developed Countries. This study reveals that, firms see the joining of clusters as a way of sustaining their competitive advantage and to enhance the regional economic development. Through clustering, they can share their strategic information, increase their innovative capabilities and find new market places, which broaden the competencies associated with individual professions. Finally, based on interview discussions with cluster managers in different countries, the results of this research confirms that, cluster activities support the Human Resource Management (HRM) of the cluster's core firms to enable them to survive in this competitive world.

J	Varkkey, H				Varkkey, Helena			ASEAN AS A 'THIN' COMMUNITY: THE CASE AGAINST ADOPTING THE EU ACID RAIN FRAMEWORK FOR TRANSBOUNDARY HAZE MANAGEMENT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA	JEBAT-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY POLITICS AND STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article						ASEAN; European Union; community; transboundary pollution; acid rain; haze; environmental cooperation; regional cooperation		Transboundary haze is a recurring problem in Southeast Asia. Academic discussion has focused largely on the failure of ASEAN to promote effective regional cooperation on the issue. On the other hand, EU action in the 1980s had been successful in mitigating acid rain at the regional level. The two cases are similar - both are anthropogenic pollution problems that originated in particular states in the region, but which effects were felt more severely in neighbouring states. Furthermore, both regions have institutionalised organisations in which all concerned states are members. Therefore, scholars have often looked towards the European experience with acid rain as a potential framework for effective ASEAN action over the haze. However, this paper argues that this strategy is misguided. This is because, unlike the 'thick' EU community with pooled sovereignty and sufficient clout to influence regional outcomes, ASEAN is a 'thin' community which was designed to advance the individual national interests of its member states. Therefore, ASEAN-level haze mitigation programmes cannot be expected to be effective in the same way that acid rain programmes have been in Europe. Thus, this article suggests that haze abatement in Southeast Asia should not depend solely, or even mainly, on regional action.

J	Wood, J; Lambert, MF				Wood, J.; Lambert, M. F.			CUSUM charts for monitoring clinical practice quality using primary care prescribing data: a case study of an initiative to encourage generic prescribing of proton pump inhibitors	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS			English	Article						control charts; general practice; healthcare quality assurance; proton pump inhibitors; statistical process control	STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; HEALTH-CARE; IMPROVEMENT	What is known and objective: Expectations on organizations to monitor quality of care are growing. Whilst relevant data are increasingly becoming available it is, in many cases, difficult to distinguish real effects from background variation. Here, the potential usefulness of cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts for monitoring the use of medicines is explored through a case study of an initiative to encourage the prescribing of lowest cost proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in the context of implementation of national guidelines for the management of dyspepsia. Methods: This was a longitudinal study involving analysis of routinely collected prescribing data, set in all 12 primary care trusts (PCT) in the North East Strategic Health Authority. In it, comparison (by subtraction) of the time-series of the percentage of generic PPI prescription items for Gateshead with the mean of the other 11 PCTs was used to reduce both variation and bias. This was followed by the construction of a CUSUM chart displaying the effect of the Gateshead initiative. Results and Discussion: The simple process of comparison was very successful both in removing extraneous trends and reducing background variation, and the CUSUM highly effective for displaying the evidence for the hypothesized step-change in prescribing behaviour consequent on the Gateshead initiative. The effectiveness of the CUSUM here is strongly linked to the success of the preliminary comparison step. What is new and Conclusion: CUSUM, a statistical process control technique, has already been tested as a tool for interpreting hospital and general practice mortality rates. Here, its potential for more general applications in quality monitoring is demonstrated using routinely collected prescribing data. Such data contain valuable information about changes in clinical practice and CUSUM charts, when coupled with the idea of removing time trends and extraneous variation by reference to average behaviour, can provide a simple but effective technique for extracting it.

J	Huang, L; Kao, PH				Huang, Leo; Kao, Peng-Hsiang			How to tell a good tour guide under different strategic orientations	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tour guide; balanced scorecard; Delphi; structural equation modeling (SEM); travel agency	GROUP PACKAGE TOUR; BALANCED SCORECARD; PERFORMANCE-MODEL; MANAGEMENT; PARADIGM	The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance measurement systems, based on the balanced scorecard concept, to empirically measure the tour guide performance of outbound travel agencies under different strategic orientations. The theoretical model identifies underlying variable dimensions - financial, customer, operational process and learning perspectives - which combine traditional subjective or objective measures with operating measures of a tour guide's performances. A two-stage survey is employed to explore the performance measurement systems of tour guides and to build up a meaningful evaluating model. In the first stage, twenty experts explore and analyze those four dimensions to measuring a tour guide's performance by a three-round Delphi survey. The second stage, rating and identifying the dimension attributes and building a model that also presents those cause-and-effect relationships among the four dimensions of tour guides' performance measurement, is done through the structural equation modeling (SEM) method approach. Tour guide performance measurement is an important tourist satisfaction attribute that is of key concern to travel agent practitioners. Finally, the paper proposes an optimal tour guide performance evaluating model under a cost leadership and differentiation strategy separately that matches the essential needs of an innovative performance measurement system development under different strategic orientations, overcoming the traditional performance measuring shortcomings.

Aims The purpose of the study is to evaluate the paradigm shift in overall screening and management strategy of HIV in antenatal women for last four and half years in an urban medical college. Methods The study was conducted from 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008 and all registered and unregistered pregnant women who attended ICTC clinic and also for emergency admission (unregistered) were counseled and blood samples were tested as per NACO guidelines with cafeteria choice of opt in and opt out strategy. Reactive women in antenatal period were counseled and discussed about anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and universal treatment regime. Seroprevalent women were counseled about their spouse, personal habits and demographic status. Marked improvement was seen in the use of contraceptive and drug abuse. During labor mother and baby were given nevirapine as per NACO guidelines. Results The seroprevalence of HIV reactive women in our Centre was 0.23, 0.19, 0.14 and 0.12% in the year 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and zero prevalence in 2008 till date. Spouse positivity was noted in 80, 58.33, 72.72 and 70% in the set period from 2004 to 2008. Conclusion Marked improvement was noticed in all the strategic points from registration, counseling, screening and availability of improved diagnostic kits for screening HIV 1 and HIV 2.

J	Khan, RH				Khan, Razib Hayat			The Use of Real Option Analysis (ROA) to assist in Security Solution Decisions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY			English	Article						Real option; Real option analysis; Security solution decision; Uncertainty		Security management, security risk management and security service evaluation involve deciding on a security strategy and an appropriate set of security solutions to align with the strategy. However, as there are limited budget, time and resources available to identify, select, employ, monitor, review and maintain the set of security solutions, multiple perspectives must be taken into consideration in the decision making process. One important factor for constructing effective security solution decision is to make the decision dynamic. The nature of security risk changes day by day. As time passes old risks may go away and new risks may arise. So it is necessary to make the security decision in such a way that it can keep pace with the frequently changing security risks. The security solution decision must be satisfied with the demand of changing circumstances due to changing in time and changing in technologies so that decision maker can maintain an acceptable risk level and demolish the undesirable effect of uncertainty by providing improved risk assessment and management activities. Real Option Analysis (ROA) can be seen as a promising alternative to offer effective and dynamic security solution decision making process. It offers possibilities to improve decision making in security solution decision. This paper investigates how ROA could be used to assist in security solution decisions by integrating ROA with Security Decision Making Process (SDMP) which facilitates any organization to achieve better business continuity plan. Later the framework is tested through a simulation example. Real option thinking has been applied to several software designs and engineering concepts, such as eXtreme Programming (XP), COTS-based development, project investment analysis, decision making in software prototyping and strategic software reuse. Comparing with the software engineering issues, planning a security solution decision through ROA includes more uncertainties.

Drawing from a sample of 106 firm-supplier relationships in the field of logistics, long-term orientation is found to be a bi-dimensional construct. This study identifies one dimension linked to the desire to maintain a relationship that is expected profitable and another associated with concessions/sacrifices. The results obtained also show how two of the main antecedents of long-term orientation - trust and dependence - influence in different ways the two identified dimensions.

The effects of variations in the implementation of a stepwise managerial strategic crisis model and corporate reputation capital on post-crisis share price values: A qualitative and quantitative analyses of specific South African companies	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Crisis management; ideal type model; case study analysis; share price; reputation capital	ISSUE MANAGEMENT	The paper proposes a structured, stepwise approach to the management of reputational risks in order to assist in defining strategies for crisis management. A series of case studies of selected South African firms' responses to specific crises in comparison to an ideal type stepwise model were analyzed and the effects on specific share price values explored. The effect of reputation capital on share price values, six months after the crises each of the selected companies sustained was also investigated. Correlation analyses tentatively indicated that the number of steps taken by management in the companies concerned in conformance with the model, and the speed with which they were implemented, affected post-crisis average share price values. Corporate capital as measured by perceptions of reputation and brand strength, were also found to be associated with greater company post-crisis share price resolution.	[Coldwell, D. A.

J	Yudina, VI				Yudina, Vera, I			FROM THE HISTORY OF CULTURAL POLICY IN PRE-REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA: RUSSIAN MUSICAL SOCIETY IN SECOND HALF OF 19 CENTURY	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						cultural policy; state support; the private initiative; modernization of art life; Imperial Russian musical society		The topicality of problems of cultural policy in modern conditions forces to address to the history of the question. In the article by example of activity of the Imperial Russian musical society in the second half of the 19th century some elements of the theory of cultural policy are considered. They are the parity of the private initiative and the state strategy in the field of musical culture, the basic directions of development. concert practice, music education system. In the art sphere it is accepted to speak about the cultural policy of the state in connection with the Soviet stage of domestic history. However, in pre-revolutionary history there were examples of purposefully cultural strategy, which had favourable consequences for the development of domestic art. This is history of Russian musical society, which was formed in 1859 at the initiative of the outstanding representatives of domestic musical culture (A. Rubinshteyn, M. Vielgorsky, V. Kologrivov, D. Stasov, etc.). It was initially thought as an important cultural-strategic project, which aimed at the All-Russia development of new forms of musical practice. But only with the state support of the members of the Imperial family, the society could promote development of musical culture countrywide; activate the development of composers' creativity that favourably affected the condition of the domestic culture. In the article, personal contribution of separate representatives of the Imperial family to development of the Russian musical society is considered by example of authorised documents (the Charter, materials of the Congresses of the Society); certain directions of its activity in the sphere of development of music education and concert practice are analysed. Special attention is given to interaction of the capital's General management and local branches. A conclusion is made that the purposeful cultural strategy of the Imperial Russian musical society defined the objects of modernisation of the art life of the country (development of secular forms of musical life, expansion of educated audience) and worked out practical actions for their realisation (formation of system of music education, preparation of professional performers), which finally led to considerable activization of the role of musical culture in the society life, to the growth of prestige of musical activity and to the development of spiritually-valuable aspects of social being of music.

J	Huang, SJ; Show, CR				Huang, Sheng-Ju; Show, Chiang-Ren			An analysis of Taiwanese meat demand within domestic and imported upon entering into World Trade Organization (WTO)	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Meat; almost ideal demand system (AIDS) model; demand analysis	SYSTEM; MODELS; IDEAL	For the meat demand within domestic and imported upon entering into World Trade Organization (WTO) analysis, the almost ideal demand system (AIDS) model is utilized. The empirical results show that: domestic pork was the primary choice of Taiwanese (50.14%) among the meat items; seasons have significant effect on meat consumption; Reaction of Taiwanese were sensitive for domestic pork, domestic fishery product and imported chicken. In addition, among all meat items, imported chicken, imported beef, domestic pork and domestic fishery products have the highest expenditure elastic ties, indicating that Taiwanese would increase their consumption of these meat items more than the others. Finally, the substitution effects significantly existed in the following meat items: domestic pork and imported pork, domestic chicken and domestic fishery product, imported beef and imported chicken; the complementary effects significantly existed in the following meat items: domestic chicken and imported pork, imported beef and imported pork. The complementary effects existed between domestic pork and that of the meat items of domestic fishery product, imported beef and imported chicken. The results of this study indicate that domestic and imported meat items is not totally substitutable. In order to reduce the impacts of imported meat items on domestic markets, self-ruling production control can be a way. Strategic marketing can also be applied to segment markets using domestic meat items with distinct qualitative attributes or different harvest seasons from imported meat items.

J	Wang, CN; Wang, CH				Wang, Chia-Nan; Wang, Chih-Hong			A (data envelopment analysis) DEA-based systematic approach for selection of strategic alliance candidates: Case by the biotechnology industry	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic alliance; data envelopment analysis; biotechnology; efficiency	EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS; DECISION-MAKING; INEFFICIENCIES; MANAGEMENT; MERGERS; IMPACT	Enterprises become more and more difficult to maintain success in the highly competitive environment. This is the reason why many enterprises start searching for strategic alliance partners to strengthen their competitive advantage. However, facing a future of uncertainty, choosing the suitable partner of strategic alliance has become a difficult task. Based on data envelopment analysis and heuristic techniques, this study proposes a new systematic approach, which calls alliance candidate selection. The objective of alliance candidate selection is to assist biotech companies to evaluate the operation efficiency and find the best candidate of strategic alliance. Realistic data are collected from biotechnology businesses of Taiwan published stock market. Target company and 19 biotechnology companies for decision making units were collected. This research tries to help target company to find the right alliance partners for future integration. By analysis of alliance candidate selection, the results show that, the predicted benefits of 3 candidates as first priority 4 ones suggested and 10 of the ones not recommended. The results are sound for enterprises to find the future candidates of strategic alliance by many industry peoples. Alliance candidate selection can effectively provide all the essential analysis and recommendations to enterprises, for finding the right candidate of strategic alliance.

Existing recommender systems in an exhibition are usually based on the pre-recorded preference information on exhibition and are voiced about invasion of privacy. In this paper, we propose a booth recommender system based on Bayesian network reflecting customer's dynamic preference without invasion of privacy in offline exhibition environment. The proposed methodology is evaluated with real transaction data of a Korean exhibition and compared with collaborative filtering methodology. From the experimental results, we can see that considering the visiting sequence of booths and customer's dynamic preference result a better performance. We expect that the proposed methodology can be extended into other areas such as department stores, outlets, museums, and other large-scale exhibitions.

First of all, a three-layer hierarchy of 3GWC adoption factors is developed by referring to the relevant literature and industry reports. A questionnaire of pairwise comparisons in the fuzzy AHP format is then designed and distributed to experts familiar with the handset market in Shanghai, China. These surveys are then analyzed using fuzzy AHP to establish an understanding of the weights and impacts of the various factors. The results show that the four most important factors for the adoption of 3GWC systems are: (i) handset price and voice and data-transmission fees; (ii) handset aesthetics; (iii) personalization; and (iv) network coverage. These findings suggest that providers of such services should customize and diversify the content/applications they offer and ensure the speed and reliability of network access. In addition, handset designs should be in accordance with consumer demands. If these steps can be achieved, then consumers will adopt 3GWC services more rapidly.

This campaign was the largest mass immunization campaign ever conducted in the country. Therefore, in addition to strategic and micro-planning and financial and social mobilization, issues of safety (eg, safe injection practices and waste management) were at the forefront of campaign preparations. Waste management practices were promoted through guidelines, training, and implementation of locally appropriate solutions. These experiences show that, with detailed planning and preparation, in addition to collaboration among key partners, effective management of waste during campaigns in low-income countries is both feasible and beneficial. However, challenges remain in implementing environmentally appropriate solutions. This campaign served as the launching pad for a focus on ensuring that proper waste management practices are used both in the routine immunization program and in subsequent campaigns across Bolivia.

J	Choe, JM				Choe, Jong-Min			How to classify the types of inter-organizational relationships in manufacturing firms	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Inter-organizational relationships (IORs); electronic IORs; control mechanisms; inter-organizational information systems; traditional communication media	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COST MANAGEMENT; TRUST; COOPERATION; FLOW; ORGANIZATIONS; COMMUNICATION; MARKETPLACE; INTEGRATION; ALLIANCES	This study empirically examined the relationships among types of inter-organizational relationships (IORs), degrees of inter-organizational learning, trust and collaboration, and appropriate forms of IORs control devices in manufacturing firms. Based on the usage levels of inter-organizational information systems (IOSs) and traditional communication media (TCM) as well as the amount of transaction and management information exchanged between trading partners, the four types of IORs that have been suggested in the research of Choe (2008) were identified. The four types were: traditional market relationships, electronic links, strategic alliances, and virtual organizations. The results of cluster analyses represented the forms of IORs that may be similar to the four types of IORs. According to the results of this study, it was found that the levels of inter-organizational learning, trust and cooperation in electronic links are significantly higher than those in traditional market relationships. However, it was incompletely demonstrated that the degrees of inter-organizational learning, trust and collaboration in virtual organizations are significantly higher than those in strategic alliances.

The model adopted the resource-based view (RBV) approach to identify competitive strength. The RBV method states that organizations with the right resources coupled with the appropriate management skills and capabilities will develop competitive strength and organizational performance. Results generated by AMOS graphics v. 18, an SEM statistical software, confirm the adequacy of the model for companies engaged in the industrial products sector. Financial strength was found to be a better predictor of competitive advantage than management strength. The results also confirm that competitive advantage has a positive impact on the profitability and performance of organizations.

J	Hsu, Y				Hsu, Yen			INNOVATIVE PRODUCT DESIGN APPROACHES FOR IMPLEMENTING MARKETING STRATEGY: THE LINKAGE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product design; innovation; marketing strategy	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; CONSEQUENCES; ANTECEDENTS	Taiwanese consumer electronic products are favored by consumers globally, owing to the producing industry's ability to rapidly generate innovations. This study examined local consumer electronics industry enterprises for their product marketing strategies adopted to establish market advantage to deal with global competition. For assessing their product innovation approaches to marketing strategy, a questionnaire survey was conducted, and through factor analysis and cluster analysis these companies were classified into four different marketing strategic groups (Market Leader, Market Focus, Market Challenge, and Market Niche). In-depth case study was then conducted on selected companies in each of these groups. These enterprises in different marketing strategic groups each adopted a different approach in design innovation. More importantly, there exist tight relationships between enterprises in each group and their corresponding characteristics in innovation type, market goals, appeals, and features. This model of marketing strategic group and its matching characteristics may serve as a reference list. For example, a company may choose characteristics according to its current group; or, if a company is interested in moving into another group, it will know which characteristics to adopt.

J	Nekrasov, VL; Khromov, YA				Nekrasov, Vyacheslav L.; Khromov, Yevgeniy A.			N.S. KHRUSHCHEV AND THE NEW ENERGY POLICY (LATE 1950S - EARLY 1960S): POWER, REFORMS, IDEOLOGY	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						N.S. Khrushchev; dualism of party and state leadership; energy policy; reform of the administration of industry and construction in 1957		The article examines a theme insufficiently explored in the historiography of participation of N.S. Khrushchev as the party and government leader in formulating and implementing development programs and projects of the fuel and energy complex (FEC). The urgency of this perspective of the research is due to the close relationship of the issues of forming a new energy policy in the USSR with Khrushchev's struggle for political power, his initiatives to reform the management of the economy, ideas about achieving the objectives of the communist Soviet society. Documents of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, memoranda addressed to N.S. Khrushchev, materials reports, transcripts of meetings, memoirs clearly confirm N.S. Khrushchev's self-interest to various fields of development of the FEC. High concentration of efforts on development of oil and gas and electricity were sanctioned by N.S. Khrushchev, who personally supervised the most important strategic programs and projects in the area of FEC. During 1955-1957 issues of fuel and energy sector were woven into N.S. Khrushchev's political struggle for power and economic reforms. The defeat of the anti- Party group became a factor speeding up the process of forming the new energy policy. Management of fuel and energy sector became one of the most complicated questions in the discussion of governance reforms in industry and construction in 1957. N.S. Khrushchev, and members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee supporting him, for example, A. I. Kirichenko, believed that either there is a need in full decentralization of the management of industry and construction, or in general "economic councils should not be created". In general, management reform in the energy sector led to its decentralization. N.S. Khrushchev attached great importance to the development of electric power. Under him a long-term program was created of development of the nuclear industry for 1956-1960. At meetings of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee plans were regularly discussed for building nuclear power plants. N.S. Khrushchev said that modernization of the economy is "...electrification of the whole country, i.e. economic development, equipping of our nation with energy resources in order to create conditions where we could produce as much as our society needs. That is what communism is". Progress in technologically advanced sectors of energy - oil and gas industry, the construction of nuclear and hydroelectric plants were considered as an achievement and an advantage of socialism. At the XXII Congress of the CPSU, N.S. Khrushchev put forward a comprehensive program of energy sector development. General perspective envisaged the implementation of major projects in the electricity and gas industry. The decision of the XXII Congress of the CPSU fixed new priorities in energy policy brought them under ideological justification in the form of construction material and technical base of communism. Nevertheless, the formation of the new energy policy in the second half of 1950s - the first half of 1960s did not eliminate the energy imbalance in the Soviet economy. Tensions in providing the economy with fuel and energy existed throughout the period of N.S. Khrushchev's leadership as a current economic problem of the Soviet government.

The beneficial pricing strategy can benefit the vendor more than multiple buyers in the integrated system, when price reduction is incorporated to entice the buyers to accept the minimum total cost. Negotiation factors is very important in the in fuzzy model, it can balance the cost saving between the players. A numerical example with sensitivity analysis is provided to demonstrate the theory. Finally, this paper can prove that the price reduction mechanism is a mutual beneficial strategic partnership between the vendor and buyers.

The model adopted the resource-based view (RBV) approach to identify competitive strength. The RBV method states that organizations with the right resources coupled with the appropriate management skills and capabilities will develop competitive strength and organizational performance. Results generated by AMOS graphics v. 18, an SEM statistical software, confirm the adequacy of the model for companies engaged in the industrial products sector. Financial strength was found to be a better predictor of competitive advantage than management strength. The results also confirm that competitive advantage has a positive impact on the profitability and performance of organizations.

A body of recent research shows that companies that have best harnessed change in CRM architectures have realized significant strategic advantage. CRM is about creating a competitive advantage by being the best at understanding, communicating, delivering and developing existing customer relationships in addition to creating and keeping new customers. An effective CRM strategy aims to personalize the customer's experiences across all organization touch points. By coordinating the customer's interactions, a firm is able to optimize customer satisfaction, which translates into increased profitability and revenue. Realizing the significance of CRM in the present relationship era, the firms across the globe have begun to think about CRM as integral to their marketing strategy. However, a successful CRM strategy calls for a perfect alignment between strategy, processes, technology and people. To ensure such coordination among the various components of Customer Relationship Management, a marketer must possess knowledge about its application and implications and therefore, the present paper makes a modest attempt to educate marketers about the same.

There is a limited time for adaptation to the new environment in terms of legislation, society, and economy. Maintaining reliable services and a secure IT environment is even more difficult with perpetual changes like mergers and acquisitions, supply chain activity, staff turnover, and regulatory variation. Nature of the changes has become discontinuous; however, the existing approaches and IT solutions are inadequate for highly dynamic and volatile processes. The management of these challenges requires harmonized change management and knowledge management strategy. In this paper, the selected change management strategy and the corresponding knowledge management strategy and their IT support is analysed from the public administration point of view. SAKE project (FP6 IST-2005-027128 funded by the European Commission) approach and IT solution are detailed to demonstrate the strategic view and to solve the knowledge management and change management related problems and challenges in public administration. The current situation of economic downturn and political change forces public administration to follow the reconfiguration of existing resources strategy, which is appropriate on the short run, moreover the combined application of personalization and codification strategy can result in long-term success.

Strategic Buying to Prevent Seller Exit	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							BUYER POWER; COUNTERVAILING POWER; MERGERS; CHOICE	We consider a dynamic oligopoly model in which a seller may drop out of the market when demand for its product is insufficient in the first period. Buyers suffer some disutility if a seller exits the market and so their first-period purchase decision not only depends on current period preferences and prices, but also on the potential effect that their behavior has on the probability of seller survival. Specifically, some buyers may choose to purchase from the seller with the lower survival probability even though they like the other seller's product better, a behavior that we call "strategic buying." We analyze how the incidence of strategic buying depends on parameters and also the implications of the strategic buying motive for sellers' first-period pricing decisions.	[Clark, C.

J	Faria, A; Wensley, R				Faria, Alex; Wensley, Robin			Rethinking Authority and Legitimacy in Strategy: A Perspective from an Emerging Economy	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						legitimate authority; strategic management; emerging economies; government; critical perspective	INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; GLOBALIZATION; MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS; COLONIALITY; CAPITALISM; DIMENSIONS; GOVERNANCE; LEADERSHIP; EMERGENCE	The field of strategic management (SM) has presumed that the relationship between the state and market is unproblematic and that the role of the state should be seen solely within the context of regulation. Hence, the authority of CEOs within multinational corporations depends on the construction of its legitimate and sole validity and also on the delegitimation of other types of strategists-namely, government strategists. This paper emphasizes the territorial-international dimension of authority and legitimacy to argue that the SM literature delegitimates the authority of government strategists. The paper suggests that SM in Brazil can be reorientated to help restore the legitimate authority of government strategists and challenge the sole privileging of strategists within big corporations.

But convertible debt terms are usually set before the asset substitution opportunity. This allows shareholders and convertible debtholders to play a strategic noncooperative game. Two risk-shifting Nash equilibria are attainable: pure asset substitution when, despite no conversion, shareholders benefit from shifting risk, and strategic conversion when, despite early conversion, convertible debtholders expropriate wealth from straight debtholders. Even when initial convertible debt is designed to minimize the risk-shifting likelihood, the risk of asset substitution remains economically substantial - contrasting with the agency theoretic rationale for issuing convertible debt.

J	Merigo, JM; Gil-Lafuente, AM; Gil-Aluja, J				Merigo, Jose M.; Gil-Lafuente, Anna M.; Gil-Aluja, Jaime			Soft Computing Techniques for Decision Making with Induced Aggregation Operators	INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						OWA operator; Induced aggregation operators; Adequacy coefficient; Decision making		We present a method for decision making by using induced aggregation operators. This method is very useful for business decision making problems such as product management, investment selection and strategic management. We introduce a new aggregation operator that uses the induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator in the adequacy coefficient. We call it the induced ordered weighted averaging adequacy coefficient (IOWAAC) operator. The main advantage is that it is able to deal with complex attitudinal characters in the aggregation process. Thus, we are able to give a better representation of the problem considering the complex environment that affects the decisions. We study some of the main properties of this approach and we see that it includes the IOWA operator as a special case. We also see that sometimes this approach becomes the Hamming distance or more precisely, the induced OWA distance (IOWAD) operator. We further extend the IOWAAC operator by using the hybrid average, obtaining the induced hybrid averaging adequacy coefficient (IHAAC). We end the paper with a numerical example of the new approach in a decision making problem regarding product management.

J	Moule, P; Young, P; Glogowska, M; Weare, J				Moule, Pam; Young, Pat; Glogowska, Margaret; Weare, Jayne			Early Stroke Discharge Team: a participatory evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERAPY AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						early stroke discharge; health and social care interface; multidisciplinary team; participatory evaluation		Aims: International evaluation of Early Stroke Discharge (ESD) has concentrated on measuring the impact of service provision. This research aimed to address the question, 'How did the ESD team members and external stakeholders experience the service implementation process?' Methods: Between October 2009 and February 2010, six team members and four external stakeholders were interviewed as part of a participatory evaluation. Interviews were used to explore the experiences of the process of inception and implementation of the team. Transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis. Findings: Five themes related to the experiences of the introduction of the ESD team: Setting up the team; team working experience; team within the context of other services and professionals; effectiveness in achieving aims; learning for the future. Within the themes issues relating to funding, leadership, team management and working were highlighted. Conclusions: It is clear that at the inception of a new ESD service it is crucial to engage all stakeholders in the development of the service, and review the interface with existing care provision. Decisions regarding the management and leadership of the team and professionals within it are also required, and should be guided by an understanding of the patient care pathway.

J	Yamin, T				Yamin, Tughral			NUCLEAR DISASTER MANAGEMENT	IPRI JOURNAL			English	Article						Nuclear; Disaster Management; Chernobyl; Fukushima		Arguably a nuclear emergency triggered by an act of war, sabotage or a natural disaster can be the most complex crisis to handle. The crippling of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan by a combination of an earthquake and a tsunami is a case in point. A highly disciplined nation, geared towards managing earthquakes and tsunamis and maintaining a high level of nuclear safety found itself struggling to handle this epic tragedy. Pakistan has a very small nuclear industry, which so far, has escaped any significant, glitches in its operations. A clean track record is not reason enough to conclude that nuclear emergencies may not take place. Officials at the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) point out that a Nuclear Emergency Response Plan (NERP) is being prepared in consultation with the experts of the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA), Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and the Strategic Plans Division (SPD). It is expected that this Plan will cover all kinds of contingencies to handle nuclear disasters. One hopes that it will include guidelines not only for the rescue and relief organisations but also for the general public to follow in a nuclear emergency. This paper aims at underscoring the importance of integrating the common man in the nuclear disaster management plan.

Costing Logistics Services	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						third party logistics; outsourcing; costing; survey; Greece		Third Party Logistics (3PL) providers' paradigm has grown into a critical and common strategic approach, due to the benefits of the outsourcing model. Over the past two decades, 3PL's sector has played a critical role in the Greek economy. Logistics providers have extended their scope beyond traditional transportation and warehousing activities to also include many other main logistics services such as procurement, distribution, inventory management, packaging, and order processing services. In the services-oriented business sector (in general) the realization of the true costs of the provided services is a critical success factor. Specifically, a 3PL company by assessing the costs of services can confidently pursue the logistics objective of providing desired customer service at the least total cost. This paper presents and evaluates the costing systems that the 3PL's companies have used. It is based on a survey that is focused on logistics providers in Northern Greece. This survey aimed at first to identify the adopted costing system, to assess its significance for both the provision of services and the designing -redesigning of services' portfolio, to estimate the degree of satisfaction by top managers, and to recognize the problems regarding the existing costing system such as the non-value added logistics services.

J	Martin, EC				Martin, Eric C.			Media Reform and Development in Bosnia: An Interorganizational Account of the Media Issues Group	SOUTH EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS			English	Article						International Development; Cross-Sectoral Cooperation; Media in Bosnia		This manuscript focuses on development assistance players' efforts to cooperate, coordinate and collaborate on projects of mutual interest. I target the case of the cross-sectoral and international Media Issues Group designed to reform and develop the media sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I identify and categorize variables that influenced interorganizational relationships to summarize lessons learned and potentially inform similar interventions. This work suggests that cooperation, coordination and collaboration are constrained by contextual, strategic and procedural variables. Through participant narrative based on observation and interviews, this work clarifies the nuances within these three sets of variables for potential extrapolation to other settings. Perhaps more importantly, it provides lessons learned that can inform future international community interventions in market development activities.

Results show that factors such as strategic assets, entrepreneurial management system, subsidiary autonomy, and the entrepreneurial orientation of senior managers are important to the survival of small-medium sized multinational firms. This study also finds that an entrepreneurial management system is of greater comparative importance to high-technology manufacturing companies, while autonomy is more important to financial services companies.

J	Wu, WL; Yeh, RS				Wu, Wei-Li; Yeh, Ryh-Song			Managing effective knowledge acquisition in outsourcing alliances: A supplier's perspective	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						suppliers; international outsourcing alliance; knowledge acquisition; learner characteristics; partnership; informational technology	INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; JOINT-VENTURES; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; CAPABILITIES; COMPETENCE; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS	Knowledge acquisition through international outsourcing alliances often plays a key in increasing a firm's technology capability. However, knowledge acquisition is not an easy process, as it relates to the firm's learning ability, the quality of the partnership, cross-national communication, and knowledge ambiguity, etc. Few studies discuss knowledge acquisition from the perspective of suppliers in newly industrialized economies, and often overlook the usefulness of information technology in the learning process. As a result, there are still some research gaps on this topic. Therefore, this study adopts the supplier point of view to explore the differences between suppliers with more or less effective knowledge acquisition. Using a sample of 204 cases of international outsourcing alliances, this study shows that learner characteristics, partnerships, and the use of information technology are the primary factors affecting supplier knowledge acquisition. This study also investigates the different learning patterns of tacit knowledge acquisition and explicit knowledge acquisition.

J	Erdem, F; Sumer, FE; Alan, AA; Baser, GG				Erdem, Ferda; Sumer, Fulya Erendag; Alan, Aylin Aktas; Baser, Gozde Gul			Cultural Dimensions of Academic Organizations: A Pilot Research on Faculties of Economics and Administrative Sciences	EURASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Academic organizations; organizational culture; universities; faculty members; Turkey		Problem Statement: Academic institutions have been feeling greater pressure of acting in conformity with universal values and education standards every passing day. However, the first step of an academic organization developing a vision and strategy to this end is its thorough understanding of present cultural properties. Hence, examining cultural properties of academic organizations by considering the perceptions of their faculty members as a dominant group must be given priority for the development of the research and student-training processes. Purpose of Study: The purpose of this paper is to determine cultural dimensions of academic organizations based on perceptions of the faculty members. The basic research question regards which cultural dimensions become apparent in academic organizations and of what they are composed. Methods: In this research, qualitative and quantitative methods were used together. Researchers realized semi-structured interviews with the faculty members, first in their won organizations. Later, based on the interview notes, a questionnaire composed of a wide-item list towards academic organizations' culture was developed. This questionnaire was applied to 200 faculty members working in faculties of economics and administrative sciences in six public universities. Basic cultural dimensions were determined and interpreted. Findings and Results: Leading dimensions in culture of academic organizations according to perceptions of the faculty members were as follows: Management style-value consistency, changeability, motivation and communication. Management style is regarded important, especially in providing autonomy. It was determined that organizations' initial missions and values didn't completely overlap with their present applications and universal values. While motivation is perceived as an interactive phenomenon, change is perceived as a phenomenon that will be resisted. Also, it is observed that academic relationships in these organizations are continued within small groups. Conclusion and Recommendations: This pilot research seeks to determine which cultural dimensions should be thoroughly aassessed in academic organizations and which need to be analyzed in detail for the contextual conditions affecting the content of these dimensions. In order for strategic management to take interest in higher education in Turkish institutions in the last term, it is necessary for them to have data from these types of studies.

J	Gallego, G; Krishnamoorthy, S; Phillips, R				Gallego, Guillermo; Krishnamoorthy, Srinivas; Phillips, Robert			Competitive revenue management with forward and spot markets	JOURNAL OF REVENUE AND PRICING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; capacity allocation; competition; market; strategy; Nash equilibrium	ADVANCE-PURCHASE DISCOUNTS; DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; PRICE DISPERSION; YIELD MANAGEMENT; MODEL; ALLOCATION; EFFICIENCY; GAMES	We consider a market with two capacity providers - an entrant and an incumbent - each with fixed capacity, who compete to sell in a spot market and a forward market. Prices are fixed and the providers make strategic capacity allocation decisions. The model is designed to study the competitive interactions between a low cost entrant, who sells at a lower price in both the forward and the spot market, and an established incumbent. The key question we investigate is the type of equilibrium behaviour we could expect from the two providers under different assumptions about market structure, demand and available capacity. We study two cases: (a) when there is a single buyer and (b) when there are multiple independent consumers. For the single buyer case, we identify the conditions under which the buyer would buy forward solely from the entrant or solely from the incumbent or from both. The conditions for the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the game between the two providers are established. For the case of multiple independent consumers, we identify competitive strategies for the entrant and incumbent and establish conditions for a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. The results show how competitive considerations can motivate capacity providers to offer capacity in a forward market even in the absence of market segmentation.

J	Milano, GV; Treadwell, SC; Hopson, F				Milano, Gregory V.; Treadwell, Steven C.; Hopson, Frank			How Corporate Diversity and Size Influence Spinoffs and Other Breakups	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								In recent months, the list of large diversified companies that have decided they would be worth more as several smaller, focused companies has grown sharply. In many of these cases, it has been outside pressure from activist investors that has motivated these actions by management-and with some pretty favorable results. But what is driving these strategic actions and what is most important in determining whether breakups create value? To answer this fundamental questions, it is critical to decide whether large, diversified companies have a value recognition problem or a value creation problem. In this article, the authors present and try to integrate the findings of two separate but related research studies on business diversity and size with the aim of identifying their implications for corporate strategy and helping company executives create more value for their investors. The specific reasons for underperformance by large diverse companies vary greatly, but there are a number of potential problems discussed in this article, including organizational "distance," capital allocation, human capital allocation, cross subsidies, and ineffective governance. Instead of waiting for activist investors to demand a breakup, executives of large diverse companies should be proactive in addressing the potential weaknesses of their organizations. Private equity firms understand how to make diversification work and many of today's executives could learn some valuable lessons from these firms. Large diverse businesses should embrace " Internal Capitalism," a corporate culture and set of practices that emphasizes the importance of strategic decision-making that is linked through continuous performance assessment to the corporate goals of boosting efficiency and sustainable growth.

Due to the dual nature of the protection offered by covered bonds, they have a justified place in investors' portfolios. This paper studies the pricing of covered bonds and tests it with data gathered from the Nordic countries. Using the tested reduced form model, it was possible to price covered bonds with satisfactory results. The estimated model was highly statistically significant and performed according to the economic reasoning behind it. The estimated model also worked well in comparison to research conducted earlier on competing models, such as the structural models.

Data is collected by a three-industry comparative survey. The empirical results show that: 1) Two positive influences of consumers' perceiving CSR performance on their corporate associations and product associations are respectively partially and fully mediated by consumers' CSR trust; 2) Product category is a moderator of the relationship between consumers' CSR trust and product association, and the positive path from product association to purchase intention. This study could help managers to understand how consumers think about CSR, and provides them strategic guidance to implement CSR programme in China.

This paper applied refined failure mode and effect analysis and genetic algorithm techniques to develop and establish an integrated risk analysis model for improving preliminary design of NPD. Three core items, technological performance, cost, and schedule risk, were used to improve the process of preliminary design and resource allocation in NPD projects. Risk severity, occurrence, and correlation characteristics are collected for each core item. A real study case was implemented to conclude an improving design decision and process change for NPD project.

J	Dodangeh, J; Yusuff, RBM; Jassbi, J				Dodangeh, Javad; Yusuff, Rosnah Bt Mohd; Jassbi, Javad			The best selection of strategic plans in balanced scorecard using multi-objective decision making model	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Balanced scorecard; initiatives; multi-objective decision making; goal programming		In an increasingly competitive business environment, many organizations have adopted the strategic planning approach in an attempt to achieve excellence in business. Implementation of appropriate strategies plays an important role for organizations' success. Balanced scorecard is an appropriate tool used for designing operational strategies. However, one of the balanced scorecard problems is its selection in strategic plans' performance. In this paper, a model was established for the selection of strategic plans in "balanced scorecard" using "goal programming model" which is one of the multi-objective decision making models. So, using the consensus of organizations' managers and experts' opinions, the measures and general objectives of the four perspectives are first determined in BSC, and then, using experts' opinions and taking the relative importance of decision makers' opinions into consideration, by using "goal programming model", the performances of strategic plans are selected in the BSC model. The results show that the introduced method is more reliable and acceptable and the experts verify the model for selecting strategic plans in the operation of BSC. The introduced method was used in a study and the extracted results from it were analyzed from different points of view. However, in this article, initiatives are called strategic plans.

LEADERSHIP, CAPACITY BUILDING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN CONTEMPORARY AFRICA	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						ACBF; Africa; Capacity Development; Fragile States; Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); Politics; Sustainable Development; Transformative Leadership; Universities		There is now real optimism of the prospects of Africa reclaiming the 21st century given its recent sterling growth performance and the number of successful reforms undertaken. There have been considerable and noticeable efforts to invest in innovation, infrastructure, integration, institutions and a revamp of incentive systems to develop new values that allow for transparency, accountability and greater social inclusion. New forms of leaderships have emerged at various social levels and institutions to drive a development agenda based on peer-learning and knowledge-sharing. Africa, in so doing, is unearthing deep skills and the reaping low-hanging fruits needed to speed its ambitions to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and sustainable development. This broad development agenda has required Africa to adopt strategic and practical solutions to the development challenges it faces. This volume interrogates a number of issues that are crucial for the attainment of sustainable development in Africa: a responsive governance framework, the demographic transition and youth bulge, conflict and related dynamics - such as disarmament and demobilisation, capacity building in post-conflict and fragile states, the role of donors in enhancing (or otherwise) local development efforts, the need to understand the 'softer-side' of capacity development; and above all the role of savvy and strategic leadership. Understanding these issues and beyond, by organizations like the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF), will determine whether Africa will achieve its development ambitions in the very near future.

J	Arenas, D; Fosse, J; Murphy, M				Arenas, Daniel; Fosse, Jeremie; Murphy, Matthew			Acciona: a process of transformation towards sustainability	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Strategic management; Organizational change; Renewable energy; Leadership		Purpose - This teaching case seeks to explain the main aspects of Acciona's sustainability strategy and the process of transformation of the company after the new CEO took office in 2004. It also aims to present some possible difficulties of maintaining such strategies in the new economic and political environment. The purpose of the case is to show how three aspects play a relevant role in a company's transformation towards sustainability: cultural change; collaboration with external stakeholders; and the innovations introduced. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a case study that narrates the process of six years of transformation towards sustainability of a company. The case was constructed through the analysis of company documents and several interviews with key actors in the company as well as external stakeholders. Findings - The paper shows how cultural change, collaboration with external stakeholders and innovation form a vital combination in the transformation process towards sustainability. It also reveals that acquisitions and internationalization can help accelerate or consolidate this process. Practical implications - The paper is presented as a teaching case with discussion questions at the end. The aim is to engage readers and participants in educational and training programmes in discussions about the factors that may contribute to start and maintain a transformation towards sustainability. The practical implication of the paper is to show how cultural factors, collaboration and innovation form a vital combination for changing the way businesses do things. Originality/value - The value of the case lies in showing how business efforts of embedding sustainability into business practice can be more effective by combining cultural factors, collaboration and innovation.

J	Beachboard, J; Aytes, K				Beachboard, John; Aytes, Kregg			Information Orientation, Information Technology Governance, and Information Technology Service Management: A Multi-level Approach for Teaching the MBA Core Information Systems Course	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH			English	Article						MBA Core IS course; information orientation; IT service management; IT governance	MODEL; BUSINESS	Core MBA IT courses have tended to be survey courses that cover important topics but often do not sufficiently engage students. The result is that many top-ranked MBA programs have not found such courses useful enough to include in their core MBA requirements. In this paper, we present a design of an MBA course emphasizing information technology and intending to be a valuable part of a core MBA program. The primary audience for this course is the general MBA student, and the primary teaching objectives of the course are for students to (1) recognize that IT plays a vital role in the functioning of most modern organizations, (2) recognize that the effective application of IT requires the active engagement of non-IT as well as IT management, and (3) acquire the tools and concepts necessary for non-IT managers to participate in the effective management of an enterprise's IT resources. The basic framework by which we accomplish these objectives conceptualizes IT management into three domains of activity: executive-level IT governance, enterprise-level IT governance/management, and functional-level IT governance/management. Executive-level IT governance issues reside at the board and executive level and include parameters involving the strategic application of IT. Enterprise-level IT management/governance includes those activities that are best accomplished through joint business and IT management participation, such as the development of IT service level agreements. These two areas are most emphasized in the course. Functional-level IT management refers to those activities that should be solely the responsibility of IT managers. This framework provides a means for parsing out IT management responsibilities with the intent of emphasizing that some IT management activities require the involvement of non-IT managers. As a means for helping students understand what an enterprise needs to do well to use IT to support its goals, we applied the Information Orientation framework (Marchand, Kettinger, & Rollins, 2001). This framework considers how well organizations (1) collect, process and maintain their information (information management practices), (2) share information and use it to support decision making, and (3) employ specific IT management practices. These three domains comprise an organization's " information orientation maturity,"which is posited to relate to an organization's success. To provide explicit implementation guidance, we delve more deeply into specific actions that managers can take to raise their enterprise's information orientation by synthesizing the topics of IT governance and enterprise architecture as presented by a number of prominent authors. Included at this level are such things as executive-level IT steering committees, the management of IT investments, and the laws, industry standards, and legal and ethical issues involved in enterprise level IT decisions. We then take the discussion down to the next level and use the concepts of IT service management to convey how managers can align IT services with business needs. The IT Services Management (ITSM) literature (1) emphasizes the design of IT services rather than the specification of business applications and technology, and (2) makes explicit the linkage between IT services and the business processes they are intended to support. An IT service orientation helps make the relationship between IT investment and business value more explicit and offers a vocabulary more easily understood by non-IT management, thus helping to improve communication between IT and the activities it supports. Finally, to help solidify students' conceptual understanding, the course includes an experiential learning component. We assign a semester-long project where student teams consult with area businesses (or not-for-profit organizations). The assignment calls for the structured application of one of the conceptual frameworks introduced in the course. The students administer structured surveys, perform open-ended interviews, conduct participant observation, and analyze their findings, providing oral and written reports to the client and to the class. We find that students not only benefit from their own efforts but vicariously through the sharing and comparing of experiences with other groups. MBA students have generally found this course design useful. Pre-and post-course survey data indicate that students better appreciate the roles that non-IT managers play in the effective application of IT resources as a result of the course.

J	Bentley, Y				Bentley, Yongmei			Managers' perspectives of logistics and supply chain changes during the recent economic downturn	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						economic downturn; logistics; supply chain; management	STRATEGIC DECISION-PROCESSES; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT	This research has examined the decisions taken by logistics and supply chain managers across three countries during the economic recession of 2008-2010. A quasi-longitudinal approach was adopted, with four questionnaire survey rounds being carried out across the period, with a total of over 300 responses being received. The findings from the first two survey rounds indicated that only a limited number of companies had made significant changes to their logistics strategies, but this number increased as the recession continued. While the most common company response was to downsize the organisation, there were also other strategic changes such as those in the use of third-party logistics, in warehousing choices, and in a move to more local suppliers. In the broader context, the results contribute to the understanding of how companies evolve their logistics strategies when dealing with significant changes in their external environment.

Organisational identity and the business environment: the strategic connection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						aspirations; business domain; business environment; business strategy; core competency; dynamic capabilities; mission; organisational capability; organisational identity	MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; GENDER	In fast changing business environments, the domains in which organisations function often transform causing competitive strategies to become obsolete and requiring that the organisations' missions evolve. Strategies and missions consequently are shifting and ephemeral bases for defining organisations and their relevant business environments. A potentially more enduring and evocative basis for defining organisations and their relevant business environment is their identity. The articles in this special issue focus on the development, composition and evolution of organisations' identities, the interaction of their identities with changing business environments, and the correspondence of these dynamics with business strategies and organisational capabilities.

An object oriented programming platform for ontology based KMS	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Knowledge worker; tags; synonym tags; object-oriented; feedback; query; response; ontology		Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) is seen as an essential strategic tool for organizations to manage corporate knowledge captured in the database as well as leverage the same for performance enhancement. Knowledge is represented in a Knowledge Base (KB) which consists of symbolic knowledge structures. Ontology is one of such structures that represent concepts and their relationships within a domain. The proposed KMS with ontology based KB is developed using object-oriented programming platform. Because ontologies are closely related to modern object-oriented software design, it is natural to adapt existing object-oriented software development methodologies for the task of ontology development and this approach has been adopted in this paper. The proposed KMS is a help desk to provide responses to client queries that helps the organization to enhance its performance on repeated queries as the system acquires knowledge on a query repetition through maintenance of ontology based KB.

J	Del Nord, R				Del Nord, Romano			Does the market demand a different kind of research?	TECHNE-JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ARCHITECTURE AND ENVIRONMENT			Italian	Article						Building and Construction Process; Project Management; Organization models; Knowledge management; Collaborative Tools		The current situation calls for research to be directed towards strategic objectives for recovery aimed at the transferability of results. For technological research in architecture, this involves analysing critical situations in the processes of transforming the built environment and, in the first place, in the construction of public works. The article identifies them as the conflict between the main decision-making areas and the inefficiency of the procedural mechanisms introduced to overcome them. The assumption is the recovery of an ethical dimension, but research has a duty to promote a technical and managerial culture, which is currently lacking, and to develop tools that facilitate informed consultation among the players. Even at international level, priority should be given to acting on organizational process models that highlight transdisciplinary collaboration principles in real time and throughout the entire development of an intervention programme	[Del Nord, Romano] Univ Florence, Dipartimento TAD, Florence, Italy		Del Nord, R (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento TAD, Florence, Italy.							0	1	1	0	0	FIRENZE UNIV PRESS	FIRENZE	JOURNALS DIVISION, BORGO ALBIZI, 28, FIRENZE, 50122, ITALY	2239-0243			TECHNE	Techne		2011	1						70	75					6	Architecture	Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)	Architecture	V7X9K	WOS:000421391900009					2022-01-23

Findings suggest that congruence between identity and image leads to strategic action that will support CSR; incongruence will likely lead to hierarchical differences in organisational identity claims, multiple organisational identities, and inconsistent and unclear strategic actions that are reflected in a less robust, negative reputation. It is proposed that organisations which project an image of CSR must also integrate CSR into the identity of the organisation.

Because of rapid economic and population growth as well as change in consumption patterns in last decades, municipal solid waste management (MSWM) has become an important strategic decision so that the evaluation and assessment process is attached a prime concern. Avoiding the injustice which may be caused by subjective factors, this paper sets up a hybrid model of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and analytical hierarchy process for a MSWM alternative selection. A case study for MSWM alternative selection in Dalian Development Area of China is presented to demonstrate the practicality of this model.

The study is motivated by the need to find an optimal mix of interactive factors that will optimize the result of decision to apply ICT to manufacturing processes. The study used Factor analysis model based on the sampled opinion of forty (40) operations/production managers and two thousand (2000) production line workers of three leading manufacturing firms: Uniliver Plc., PZ Plc, and Nigerian Breweries Plc operating in Aba Industrial Estate of Nigeria. The results shows that a progressive mixed factor loading matrix, based on the preferred ordered importance of resources factors in the formulation, implementation, monitoring, control and evaluation of ICT projects of the selected firms led to an average capability improvement of 0.764 in decision efficiency. This is considered strategic for achieving balanced corporate growth and development.

J	El-Baz, H; Zualkernan, IA				El-Baz, Hazim; Zualkernan, Imran A.			Employee competency maturity model and its application in global software outsourcing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						outsourcing; global software; competency; employee competency maturity model	TRUST	Global Software Outsourcing (GSO) is a complex process. Success often depends on a host of diverse competencies. This paper presents a model for specifying personnel competencies that adequately capture the competency dimensions of the Job-Focus, Role-Focus, and Person-Focus. In addition, the maturity levels of these competencies in each dimension can be specified at one of five levels. Employee Competency Maturity Model (ECMM) is illustrated by applying it to competency descriptions embedded in SCRUM, DSDM and OpenUP process descriptions. ECMM provides a foundation for management of employee competencies, based on which firms may make strategic outsourcing decisions in the future.

J	Garland, R; Brooksbank, R; Werder, W				Garland, Ron; Brooksbank, Roger; Werder, Wayne			Strategic marketing's contribution to Australasian golf club performance	SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Australia; New Zealand; Strategic marketing planning; Sport organizations; Competitive performance; Golf	SIZED MANUFACTURING FIRMS; ENTERPRISES SMES; CHINESE SMALL; ORIENTATION; GOVERNANCE; BRITISH	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which strategic marketing planning is carried out by Australasian golf clubs and the impact such planning has upon their business performance. Design/methodology/approach - A research methodology borrowed from the "for profit" sector is applied. In total, ten basic strategic marketing practices, each with its own hypothesis, are investigated through a web-based survey of secretaries/managers of 180 Australian and New Zealand golf clubs. Findings - Analysis shows that while strategic marketing is being adopted by most clubs, compared with their lower-performing counterparts (on measures of competitive business performance), the higher-performing clubs place a far greater emphasis upon each of the ten basic strategic marketing practices. Research limitations/implications - While the survey had a 24 per cent response rate, a small follow-up survey of non-respondents showed no significant difference in answers to four crucial questions. Self-reported, relative performance measures, widely used in the "for profit" sector, have been utilised. The ten basic strategic marketing practices are assumed to be antecedents of success rather than a consequence of such success. Originality/value - In addition to providing initial understanding of the extent of strategic marketing planning practice in a sport management context in Australasia, this paper identifies those practices which differentiate higher competitive business performance from lower performance.

J	Ghobadian, A; O'Regan, N				Ghobadian, Abby; O'Regan, Nicholas			Building from scratch a marketing services giant by acquisition Case study and interview with Sir Martin Sorrell, Chief Executive of WPP	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Acquisitions and mergers; Strategic decisions; Strategic leadership; Growth		Purpose - Mergers and acquisitions are among the most intensely used strategic decisions. Yet research by both academics and consulting groups suggests that many mergers and acquisitions fail to add value. On the other hand there are many companies that successfully use mergers and acquisition to grow and add shareholder value. One such company is WPP. The aim of this paper is to explore why WPP has been successful in its acquisition strategy while so many other companies fail. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on documentary evidence and a semi-structured interview with Sir Martin Sorrell - Chief Executive and founder of WPP. Research limitations/implications - The case study offers a unique insight into thinking of a successful acquirer and sheds light on how mergers and acquisitions are managed by WPP. However, because of its design the findings are not generalisable. Originality/value - This case study sheds light on how mergers and acquisitions can be used to create a alpha 9 billion company from a standing start.

J	Grant, B; Fisher, J				Grant, Bligh; Fisher, Josie			Public Value: Positive Ethics for Australian Local Government	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article						Local government; public value; strategic management theory	MANAGEMENT	The challenges confronting Australian local government are typically problematised in terms of either economic sustainability and efficiency, or the 'democratic deficit' resultant from amalgamations. Comparatively little attention has been paid to a justification of local government aimed at reinforcing its legitimacy against reform processes initiated by other tiers of government. In an attempt to rectify this deficit, this paper explores the applicability of Mark Moore's (1995) theory of Public Value to Australian local government. We argue that despite Rhodes and Wanna's (2007) objections to the applicability of Moore's theory to Westminster political systems, Public Value provides both an accurate sociological heuristic and a normative theory of politics and public sector management for Australian local government.

A legitimate leader will be readily accepted by organizational members, thereby facilitating the achievement of organizational goals. The legitimacy of leadership is not only concerned about the legal aspect, but also moral and psychological aspects. This article proposes a conceptual framework of leadership, based on Islamic values as the main thrust of leadership legitimacy. Given that in Islam, legal and ethical values are integrated, a leader is expected to internalize the Islamic core values and realize them in his organization. Moreover, Islamic core values are implemented in conjunction with task-related values, leading to a comprehensive treatment of organizational leadership. As a logical development, organizational members will confer legitimacy on the leader and become loyal and committed followers. In this respect, the Conceptual Framework of Islamic Leadership (CFIL), which is in congruence with the concept organization sustainability, is a holistic approach in understanding leadership legitimacy.

J	He, JK				He Jiankun			China's Voluntary Mitigation Target and Road of Low-carbon Development	CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						climate change; low-carbon economy; carbon intensity; emission reduction target		China is going through a rapid development stage of industrialization and urbanization. Although tremendous achievements have been made in the aspects of energy conservation, improvement of energy effectiveness and development of new and renewable energies, because of the rapid development of economy, it is difficult to change the huge total amount and fast increase of CO2 emission in the near future. China has to confront the tough challenge to address global climate change. China plans to reduce carbon intensity, that is, CO2 emissions per unit GDP, by 40 to 45% by 2020 compared with the 2005 level. It is a strategic option to coordinate domestic sustainable development with coping with global climate change on the basis of China's national circumstances, representing the core content and key measures for transforming development pattern and realizing low-carbon development. To achieve the target, more capital and technology inputs are required for energy conservation and low-carbon development during the twelfth and Thirteenth Five Year Plan period than in the Eleventh Five Year Plan period. In addition, energy conservation achieved by structural adjustment, industrial upgrading and product value-added improvement is also expected to play a greater role. Therefore, China should strengthen technological innovation, make greater efforts to transform the development pattern, take advantage of the synergistic effect of policies and measures while coping with global climate change and building a domestic tow-oriented society. China should also establish an industrial system characterized by low-carbon emission. Then China will ultimately achieve a win-win situation in both domestic sustainable development and coping with global climate change.

J	Hudayati, A; Auzair, SM				Hudayati, Ataina; Auzair, Sofiah Md			Performance Measurement System, Organisational Learning and Business Unit Performance in Islamic Banks	ASIAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Performance measurement system; interactive control; organisational learning	MANAGEMENT CONTROL-SYSTEMS; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; MARKET ORIENTATION; STRATEGY; FIRMS; ANTECEDENTS; INNOVATION; RESOURCES; LEVERS; IMPACT	This study examines the relationship between performance measurement systems (PMS), business unit, and profit and loss sharing (PLS) financing performance in Islamic Banks. Two elements of PMS were studied-strategic PMS and interactive use of PMS. Utilising the survey method, questionnaires were mailed to 256 business units of Islamic Banks in Indonesia, of which 99 were returned. Employing the resourced-based view, it is expected that the effect of PMS on both performances is indirect through organisational learning. Nevertheless, strategic PMS is also expected to have a direct relationship with business unit performance. Tested using Partial Least Squares regression, the results indicate that the interactive use of PMS is indirectly related to performances through organisational learning. Strategic PMS was found to be directly related to business unit performance. The findings highlight the role of PMS in enhancing organisational learning in Islamic Banks, which translates into high performance.

J	Islam, R; Ismail, Y				Islam, Rafikul; Ismail, Yusof			PRIORITIZING ISSUES OF MALAYSIAN VISION 2020: AN APPLICATION OF THE ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS AND QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING			English	Article						Vision 2020; Prioritization; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Quality Function Deployment; Malaysia		The objectives of this research are to obtain the people's perception towards a number of issues pertaining to the realization of Malaysian Vision 2020, to rank the challenges of Vision 2020 and to collect suggestions to expedite the realization of the vision. Based on a nationwide survey, an affinity diagram was formed and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied to identify the main issues for implementation. Furthermore, the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) model was utilized to show the strength of relationships between the various challenges of Vision 2020 and twenty categories of suggestions obtained in the survey. The respondents were also asked to rank the nine strategic challenges of Vision 2020, and the results show the three most crucial Vision 2020 challenges: 'Establishing a fully moral and ethical society', 'Establishing a united Malaysian nation made up of one Bangsa Malaysia (Malaysian nation)', and 'Creating a psychologically liberated, secure and developed Malaysian society'. The AHP prioritization process also identifies the salient public suggestions. The findings suggest that the government machinery should keep the public better informed of the issues, improve their perceptions and solicit their contributions. Since this study focuses on urban respondents with higher educational qualifications, future studies should focus on those in rural areas. As the government needs to be aware of the public feedback on the issue, this survey has managed to identify what are lacking in the government's efforts and what more need to be done in order to expedite the realization of Vision 2020.

J	Kamhawi, EM				Kamhawi, Emad M.			IT and non-IT factors influencing the adoption of BSC systems: a Delphi study from Bahrain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Balanced Scorecard; Performance management systems; Delphi method; Information technology; Business strategy; Strategic information systems; Bahrain	BALANCED SCORECARD; IMPLEMENTATION; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - This study aims to underline the role of information technology (IT) in adopting Balanced Scorecard (BSC) systems/initiatives in Bahrain. It seeks to highlight this role through comparing the IT-related factors/requirements against the non-IT-related ones that contribute to the implementation of such systems. Moreover, it provides a better understanding for the adoption of such systems through investigating the availability of such factors in Bahraini organisations. Design/methodology/approach - A Delphi method was utilised relying on a panel of 67 BSC experts from 34 Bahraini organisations. Findings - The results indicated that IT requirements for adopting BSC initiatives had the same level of importance compared to non-IT requirements. From the non-IT-related requirements, management factors such as "clear strategic management" and "top management support", and implementation factors such as "preparing implementation plans" and "proper training and guidelines" came on the top of the requirements list. On the other hand, the study suggests software interface characteristics such as "graphical user interface" and "easy to use application", and data quality factors such as "standard data formats" and "data accuracy" as the top IT-related requirements. Originality/value - This study extends current research efforts related to the adoption of BSC systems. It provides insights for understanding how organisations get ready to implement such initiatives in both IT and non-IT-related areas. Moreover, it equips practitioners with an initial checklist of pre-requisites for undertaking such performance management systems.

J	Kim, C; Xu, YZ; Hyde, KF				Kim, Changju; Xu, Yingzi; Hyde, Kenneth F.			Advertising versus Sales Promotion: An Examination of the Japanese Food Industry, 1976-2008	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Marketing budget allocation; Sales promotion; Advertising; Short-term vs. long-term; Effects of sales promotion		The issue of increasing sales promotion at the expense of advertising has been examined with growing concern over the last two decades. This study provides an exploratory analysis of the issues of allocation of marketing communication budget in the Japanese food industry: advertising for the long-term versus sales promotion for the short-term. Based on data collected from Nikkei Need-FinancialQUEST (Nikkei Digital Media, 2011), an increase in marketing budget allocated to sales promotion relative to advertising was observed in a time series analysis study from 1976 to 2008. The use of sales promotion budget has a two-fold effect on financial performance: the sales promotion budget is positively related to sales volumes and negatively related to profitability. Managerial implications of these findings and areas for future research are discussed. Research shows the weakened power of traditional advertising in a diversified media environment; the growth rate differential of sales promotion relative to advertising has become noticeable in recent years (Kim, 2010; Li, Lee, Lee, and Griffin, 2011). However, in spite of qualitative and quantitative research in the last two decades, there is a gap concerning the outcomes of advertising and sales promotion budget allocation decisions in the industrial sector. The aim of this article is to give a better understanding of whether the paradigm shift in budget allocation from advertising to sales promotion exists, and if this is the case, how marketing firms' financial performance is affected in regards to sales volume and profitability. To address these issues, this study examines the budget allocation decisions for advertising and sales promotion from the perspective of short-term versus long-term objectives (Quelch, 1983; Achenbaum and Mitchel, 1987; Buzzell, Quelch, and Salmon, 1990; Jones, 1990; Low and Mohr, 1999, 2000; Rossiter and Percy, 1997). The issue of increasing sales promotion at the expense of advertising has been viewed with growing concern by both practitioners and academics over the last two decades. In this context, considerable attention has been paid to the fundamental changes in the advertising-to-sales promotion ratio (Quelch, 1983; Johnson, 1988; Buzzell, Quelch and Salmon, 1990; Messinger and Narasimhan, 1995; Ailawadi, 2001). Partly as a result of the growing buying power of retailers, manufacturers have been reducing their commitment to advertising activities and spending much more on trade promotion and consumer promotion. The rapid growth in the relative proportion of trade promotion compared to total sales promotion is remarkable. This study seeks to identify the changes in the relative emphasis on communication strategy at the industry level in Japan over an extended period of time. Therefore, we propose: H1: The proportion of the marketing communications budget allocated to sales promotion, versus advertising, has increased in Japan. H2: The proportion of the marketing communications budget allocated to sales promotion increased sharply around the time of the collapse of the bubble economy in 1991. In regard to consumer package goods manufacturers, the growth rate of sales volume may be lower than of the growth rate for sales promotion (Teramoto, 2001). This is not surprising due to the saturated market in Japan. A short-term perspective is defined as the degree to which management emphasizes short-term objectives and tasks, generally one year or less, and thus encourages short-term results (Burke, 1984; Rossiter and Percy, 1997). The short-term results of a sales promotion strategy are illustrated in an increase in sales volume. Yet the effect of sales promotions on sales volume does not last particularly long. This is because the carry-over effects of sales promotions are relatively low, compared with the level of purchase during the promotion period (Cotton and Babb, 1978). Often a company using sales promotion aggressively has a difficult time selling the products at full margins. Consumers would expect or demand lower prices all the time, so sales promotions may result in decreasing profitability for the firm (Rossiter and Percy, 1997; Jedidi, Mela and Gupta, 1999; Low and Mohr, 2000, Teramoto, 2001). Therefore, we propose: H3: Expenditure on sales promotion is positively related to sales volume. H4: Expenditure on sales promotion is negatively related to profitability. In order to test the hypotheses, time series analysis of financial data in the period 1976-2008 was undertaken (Otsuki, 1998; Teramoto, 2001; Kim, 2010). This study focuses on the Japanese food industry. First, the food industry has been broadly accepted in past research along with the consumer packaged goods sector. Second, the food industry is one of the most challenging industries to have experienced changes in market conditions in recent years. Data was collected from Nikkei Need-FinancialQUEST over a period that exceeded three decades (fiscal years 1976 to 2008 inclusive). The data was gathered from all food manufacturing companies that provided public information on financial performance. The sample includes companies currently listed on the stock exchange as well as others that are no longer listed. Data on 10 firms that provide advertising, sales commission and promotional expenses for the entire analysis period are analyzed separately to test the hypotheses. Consistent with previous research, this study considers the total amount of sales commission and promotional expenses as sales promotion. The study analyzed the relationship of sales promotion with total sales (sales volumes) and profitability (return on sales, ROS). To test the hypotheses stated earlier, simple linear regression was employed. For hypotheses 1 and 2, the dependent variables are advertising and sales promotion; the independent variable is the year. For hypotheses 3 and 4, the dependent variables are total sales and ROS, and the independent variable is the relative proportion of sales promotion in the total marketing communications budget. Research findings show that the relative emphasis on sales promotion relative to advertising has increased in the Japanese food industry, in the period 1976 to 2008. This change occurred around the time of the burst of the bubble economy, in fiscal year 1990. Subsequently, analysis shows sales promotion is positively related to sales volume increase, but negatively related to profitability. The relative proportion of budget allocation between advertising and sales promotion is a critical issue in today's environment with its challenging market conditions. Therefore, strategic decisions regarding budget allocations need to consider the importance of short-term sales increases while simultaneously maintaining high profitability by building the long-term brand franchise through integrated marketing communications (Eagle et al., 1999).

J	Kim, YL				Kim, Yong-Lyun			Program evaluation for strategic planning and resource management: An approach for school effectiveness evaluation	KEDI JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL POLICY			English	Article						program effectiveness; strategic planning; theory-based evaluation; multi-attribute utility analysis; school management		To be successful in this era of continuous reforms, the ability to plan strategically is essential for leaders in school management. In establishing a strategic plan for school management, the practical use of a program evaluation technique, particularly an approach focusing on the effect of each program service as well as the program as a whole, provides precise and specific information about school improvements. The purpose of this study is to explore the conceptual structure of a concurrent program evaluation approach that provides a guide for the strategic planning of resource management by prioritizing the effect of program components and activities. In addition, this study illustrates how to apply the methodological steps of the proposed approach to an evaluation case in education.

J	Kockar, I				Kockar, Ivana			Generation scheduling with emissions trading scheme and transmission capacity constraints	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Generation scheduling; Emission trading scheme; European Union; Free carbon allocations; Auctioning of carbon allocations; Transmission capacity; Constraints modelling; Emission		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how emission constraints imposed by the emission trading scheme (ETS) in the European Union, as well as transmissions capacity, can affect the outcome of the generation scheduling. The aim is to demonstrate the application of the generation scheduling tool which includes both the ETS and transmission constraints, and helps evaluate their effect on emission reduction, costs, and generators' behavior and availability. It can also be used to help generators make strategic decisions regarding utilization and purchases of carbon allowances. Design/methodology/approach - The paper extends the generation scheduling formulation to allow for additional constraints modeling. The formulation is based on the mixed integer programming approach with linearization of generation cost and emission functions, and the possibility to split the system into zones in order to investigate transmission congestion. Findings - The paper presents six case studies that include unconstrained and constrained operation, both from the emission and transmission points of view. It also illustrates the effect of free allocations versus auctioning. The case studies look into the system with wind generation that can be constrained due to transmission limits, and their impact on emission reductions. This is often the case in systems where most of the wind generation is located in the area which does not have sufficiently strong links to the rest of the system where the majority of loads are. Research limitations/implications - The extension of the work will be inclusion of stochastic nature of emission prices and wind availability. It will also be used for further studies on systems with high wind penetration and insufficient transmission capacity. Originality/value - The generation scheduling tool and the results from the paper could be useful for generators when making decisions on how to use or purchase their emission allocations, as well as for evaluation of the adverse affect of transmission congestion on carbon emission reductions.

Supplier-led outsourcing: an intertemporal hierarchical framework	IMA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT MATHEMATICS			English	Article						supply chain management; outsourcing; differential games	COMPETITION; MARKETS; CHANNEL	Building up a supply capacity to meet future and uncertain demands for products is a strategic issue which is both costly and dealt with in numerous approaches. For example, oil and gas contracts as well as production of fashion goods or production for peak demands (as they recur at Christmas time) involve decisions distributed in time with the sole purpose to meet a demand that may outstrip the capacity when the selling season comes. This paper considers the problem of the firm with a capacity to build up various production operations and inventory combined with the use of multiple suppliers that may complement its supply needs. This problem is treated under different types of contracts in both a single-period and a multi-period context in a supplier-led, firm-follower environment, thereby leading to a hierarchical supply game. A solution of the games formulated is then used to derive some strategic insights regarding the process of inventory (and capacity) build up to meet specific time and peak demands.

Scale, Scope, and Structure in the Community Chorus Industry	JOURNAL OF ARTS MANAGEMENT LAW AND SOCIETY			English	Article						chorus; management; nonprofit; voluntarism		Choral music is the leading form of public participation in the arts in the United States. This article describes choral music from an organizational perspective, using a strategic management framework to examine total market scale, scope of activity, and internal structure. While many tens of thousands of choruses are embedded in educational and religious institutions, this article focuses on independent, community-based choruses. Data from public and private sources, including the leading national service organization for choruses, shows that an estimated 3,000 of these choruses operate in the U.S. They are typically organized along club models, with significant contributions to finances and governance made by chorus singers. Summary data in the article show variation in governance and program activity within budget ranges and among chorus types including professional, symphonic, volunteer, and children/youth.

J	Liao, SH; Chang, WJ				Liao, Shu-Hsien; Chang, Wen-Jung			A metamorphosis of university from past to present: a three-stage development trajectory with strategic management perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTINUING ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND LIFE-LONG LEARNING			English	Article						strategic management; SM; organisational development; OD; university; continuing education; CE; innovation		In the past, university is a close system and rarely pays much attention to the environmental challenges. However, over-concentrated universities, decreased birth rate and limited funds of government have imposed great pressures on these traditional higher education institutes (HEIs) and force them to undertake many engineering programs so as to survive. From strategic management (SM) perspective, the fundamental problem is how firms to achieve and sustain their competitive advantage. Most studies so far get used to over-simplification of the relationship among environment, strategy and performance for lack of complete research framework. This study examines a metamorphosis of university in life-long learning society by incorporating organisational development (OD) to continuing education institute (CEI). Therefore, this paper proposes a three-stage development trajectory and a strategic map to outline the core value of SM. Finally, we conclude with some issues in the need of future research.

J	Mao, CK; Hu, JL; Chen, CM				Mao, Chi-Kuo; Hu, Jin-Li; Chen, Chun-Mei			Are the fixed-mobile telcos more competitive? A cross-country efficiency study	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Efficiency; Fixed-line; Mobile; Telcos		The trend to integrate fixed-line and mobile service is emerging in the telecom industry. This paper compares the efficiency of fixed-mobile telcos which off er both fixed-line and mobile services with fixed-only and mobile-only telcos for the period 2000-2007. The DEA (data envelopment analysis) method is employed to measure the relative efficiency of the three carrier groups. These sample operators are leading companies in the telecom industry based upon their rankings in Forbes global 2000 and are divided into the three operating models of mobile-only, fixed-only, and fixed-mobile service. The empirical results show that there are significant differences among the three groups and for each year across the 8-year period. The strategic decision not to spin-off the mobile business from fixed-mobile operations was correct. In the future, it is anticipated that a single operating license will authorize the provision of the integrated services of fixed-line, data, mobile, and broadcasting. Therefore, from the long-term perspective the future for fixed-mobile service carriers is promising.

J	Meier, O; Missonier, A; Soparnot, R				Meier, Olivier; Missonier, Audrey; Soparnot, Richard			The evolution of the governance model in instances of highly innovative strategic mergers	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Corporate governance; Acquisitions and mergers; Decision making		Purpose - This paper aims to answer two questions: firstly, how does the mode of corporate governance evolve following a merger between two specific companies looking for a joint innovation policy? Secondly, what are the factors that guide decision makers towards choosing one governance model over another? Design/methodology/approach - In order to answer these questions, this study focuses on two unlisted SMEs within the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, where joint innovation plays a key role. The authors studied the corporate governance decisions made during a strategic alliance between a small enterprise (called eStat) and a medium-sized enterprise (called Mediametrie), formed with a view to building a strategic partnership based on technological innovation. The method chosen to carry out this research involved a single case study based on passive observation (153 days of observation), participant observation, the conducting of 70 semi-structured interviews and the analysis of internal documents such as the memorandum of understanding. Findings - From a critical reading of the "standard'' (disciplinary/shareholder, relating to process profitability issues in particular) and the "strategic'' (the importance of human capital, relating to innovation issues in particular) approaches, the authors demonstrate how the managers of the newly-created company (Mediametrie-eStat) gradually opted for a renewed, resource-based corporate governance model. Originality/value - Contrary to what underlies existing literature addressing corporate governance, this paper shows the need to consider the dynamics involved in the adoption of the corporate governance model when a merger deals with strategic innovation issues.

J	Mohideen, PBA; Ramachandran, M; Narasimmalu, RR				Mohideen, P. B. Ahamed; Ramachandran, M.; Narasimmalu, Rajam Ramasamy			Construction plant breakdown criticality analysis - part 1: UAE perspective	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Construction; Pareto analysis; Plant and equipment; Maintenancemanagement; Breakdowns; Criticality analysis; United Arab Emirates		Purpose - The purpose of this paper to develop a novel strategic approach to handle corrective maintenance procedure in the event of a breakdown/disruption of service. A proposal to minimize the recovery time and the breakdown cost in the system in construction plant is presented. Design/methodology/approach - The past plant breakdown records of a construction organization are considered for the analysis. From the previous breakdown records, a high level metric using Pareto analysis and the cause effect analysis is used to identify the main breakdown main codes (BMC) and the subsequent breakdown sub codes (BSC). Prioritized BMC and BSCs are used to formulate dedicated breakdownmaintenance teams, which act swiftly in the event of the breakdown with the modified methods. Findings - The study was conducted, on four different types of heavy lifting/earth moving/material handling system equipment, which are used to load/unload/haul and transport construction materials. Failure due to tyre puncture and allied problems contribute to maximum failure. A strategy plan to minimize this type of failure is proposed. With the identification of the most contributing BMCs and BSCs, it is further proposed to develop an "overall breakdown maintenance management". Research limitations/implications - The collected data pertains to the construction plant located in a particular region, namely the Middle East, and hence the proposed solution is dedicated/relatively applicable to similar plant from the same region. A more robust model can be suggested considering the work environment in the other regions. Practical implications - The proposed methodology is highly adaptable by similar industries operating in the Middle East region. Social implications - Construction plant and equipment contribute to the success of construction organizations, by providing enhanced output, reduced manpower requirement, ease of work and timely completion of the project. Delays in completion of projects generally have both social and economical impact on the contractors and the buyers. The proposed model will bring down the lead-time of the project and enable the contractors to crash down their project completion time. Originality/value - Numerous studies on preventive maintenance models and procedures are available for a system and in particular to construction plant maintenance in the literature. This model attempts to handle the issues of unpredictable breakdowns in the construction plant to minimise the breakdown time. The proposed model is a novel approach which enables a quick recovery of the construction plant, attributed from the breakdown parameters derived from the previous history of the work records/environment.

Background research consisted of the following three parts. First, a Decision Support System (DSS) provided an illustration for the proposed system; its three elements of interest include Kaizen case-base, Model-base and User-interface. The first element accumulates useful cases for developing new cases. The second element accumulates models to utilize the case-base effectively, including the Kaizen strategic model, Kaizen objective model, Kaizen data analysis model, and model building blocks and subroutines. The third element links Kaizen case-base, Model-base and Kaizen engineers. The linkages are realized by four procedures: installation of proposed support system, construction of Kaizen case-base, evaluation of the case-base, and development of new cases. The second portion of our research was a discussion of Kaizen casebase from three viewpoints: its utilization purpose, its information structure, and data types accumulated in it. Thirdly, investigation of the three primary model types mentioned above was performed and the proposed model-base was constructed. Proposed system was designed to maintain and improve Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in a manufacturing system through discussions with Kaizen experts whose factory collaborated in this research.

J	Palander, T; Vesa, L				Palander, Teijo; Vesa, Lauri			Potential methods of adjustment to declining imports of Russian roundwood for the Finnish pulp and paper industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Finland; Pulp production; Wood; Imports; Russia; Export tariffs; Supply chain management; Strategic planning; Demand management; Procurement	PROCUREMENT; FINLAND	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate optimal strategic decision alternatives for Finnish pulp production companies in response to rising export tariffs on Russian roundwood. Traditionally, increasing the domestic or Russian supply to pulp mills satisfied their wood requirements. However, once this conventional strategy could no longer be implemented (in 2008), the wood requirements were met by adjusting pulp production (reducing) and wood procurement (increasing domestic procurement). Design/methodology/approach - As the primary research data for the study, the procurement situation in 2005 was used to describe the conventional business strategy for purchasers of Russian or domestic roundwood. Possible business strategies were then simulated for changing pulp production by Stora Enso, with the goal of adjusting roundwood requirements, to develop a globally-optimal strategy to solve the procurement problem. Findings - After removing production by the northernmost Finnish pulp mill, the authors could not find a globally optimal solution for the wood-procurement problem. It was found that Russia's tax policy (high export tariffs on roundwood) will have large implications for Finnish wood procurement (i.e. the use of domestic wood vs imported Russian roundwood), and can dramatically change the basis, type, and location of pulp mills. The reduction or total elimination of imported Russian roundwood caused severe supply shortages and reduced pulp production. Originality/value - Based on the results of analysis, the authors recommend adjustment methods to assist strategic wood-procurement decisions, given the need to adapt wood-procurement logistics to an unpredictable and complicated pulp production environment that requires continual optimization of the wood flow.

The systems analysis-based approach proposed here involves stakeholders in defining: study areas/issues, flow limits (based on infrastructural, sustainability and management reasons), and the optimization objective function. The approach includes using a newly developed computer optimization model to speed analysis of stakeholder proposals. The optimization model calculates multi-period water distribution and allocation strategies, minimizing unsatisfied demand or optimizing economic effect. Implementing the approach would identify opportunities for improving water supply, conveyance and demand management, and help investment planning and international negotiations.

Development of a Primary Healthcare Nursing Program in Small Rural Riverina Communities	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						primary health care nursing; rural communities; health promotion		Three primary healthcare nurses were funded by the Commonwealth Government to establish a primary healthcare program for three clusters of small rural communities (four towns in each cluster) of less than 1000 people. The role of the nurses was to include the provision of clinical nursing support to GPs in outreach locations similar to that of a practice nurse; to support community development activities; and to foster the development of collaborative partnerships with other service providers and key stakeholders. Initial success led to continued funding for the program and the inclusion of a cohesive strategic approach to enhance community collaboration and sustainability. This led to the development of a community engagement model involving (1) community assessment; (2) community consultation; and (3) project planning. The model acknowledges that rural nursing is more holistic and people-orientated rather than task orientated, where nurses need to display leadership and be agents of change. It also embraces the notion that the individual's health and wellbeing responds positively to active participation in community activities, and those communities that encourage participation have better health outcomes. A case study is provided, describing the nurse's role in the establishment of a Seniors' group in one community.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT IN FRAGILE ENVIRONMENTS: INSIGHTS FROM PARLIAMENTS IN AFRICA	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Fragile States; Conflicts; Capacity Development; Parliamentary Strengthening; Coordination; Harmonization And Governance		Capacity development in fragile environments in Africa has often proven to be a complex undertaking. This has largely been because of existing knowledge gaps on what exactly causes fragility of states, the economy and society. The liberal peace development model that generally informs post-conflict reconstruction and capacity development has a limited conception of fragility by narrowly focusing on the national dimensions of the problem, promoting donor-driven solutions, emphasizing minimal participation of beneficiary actors in the identification and prioritization of capacity development needs, and by subcontracting the design and management of projects and programs. The resulting capacity development impact has generally been disappointing. In the absence of homegrown strategic plans, stakeholder participation and ownership, international development partners have all too often addressed capacity gaps by financing training, supply of equipment and professional exchanges of parliamentarians and parliamentary staffers. These efforts usually achieved their presumed number targets but tended to ignore addressing the larger issues of political economy within which capacity development take place. However, the recent re-conceptualization of parliamentary capacity development as a development of nationally owned, coordinated, harmonized, and aligned development activities seems to be gaining growing attention in Africa. As the experience of Rwanda eloquently demonstrates, capacity development is essentially about politics, economics and power, institutions and incentives, habits and attitudes - factors that are only partly susceptible to technical fixes and quantitative specifications. These structural factors have to be negotiated carefully and tactfully.

J	Scott, C				Scott, Colin			Management control system support of initiatives for disruptive students	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management strategy; Ethics; Schools; New Zealand; Behaviour modification		Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to investigate the management control system (MCS) support of school initiatives to develop the school climate and to re-engage disruptive students. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts an approach of critical action research interviews with management and document reviews informed by Habermasian concepts to investigate practical concerns of schools with a complex problem and which add to the body of knowledge. Findings - Using Habermas's discourse ethics distinction between the pragmatic, ethical and moral it was observed that both schools had gone beyond pragmatically informed strategic initiatives to include more rational problem solving responses: one school is more ethical the other more moral. Both schools' MCS are better explained by Otley's categorisation based on three concerns of MCS, the transactional, the strategic and stakeholder aspirations. Both schools' MCS displayed a stakeholder concern. Research limitations/implications - As only two schools where investigated the generalised conclusions need to be considered cautiously. Practical implications - Schools should be supported to take initiatives to develop a supportive school climate and improve the rationality and justice of their practices. In schools, MCS cannot just be developed from strategic considerations. Originality/value - The paper uses Habermasian social philosophy to illuminate MCS support in schools of their response to a complex problem.

It focused on how top leadership makes decisions in the short term that guarantees the long-term viability of the organisation. The best performing organisations are consciously strategic in their leadership planning. These top leaders also have the ability to align human resources in an effective way directly to the business strategy. This article identifies some of the direct and indirect pathways in which strategic leadership influences the operational strategy and performance of business organisations in South Africa. This research pinpointed theoretical and substantively meaningful endogenous organisational capabilities that mediated this relationship and exogenous organisational factors that moderated this relationship.

Uncertainty in availability venerated by inventory management controls in a generic repairable item sustainment system	ANZIAM JOURNAL			English	Article								For defence logistics, strategic planning is typically based on mean values. Supply flows are estimated from average throughputs, and supply chain resources are allocated to meet average demands. Operations management is also based on mean values. Mean-value based inventory management techniques are the preferred way to maintain the availability of spare parts. Recent research suggests that defence maintenance systems using such inventory management techniques are sensitive to stochastic variability in stock demand. We illustrate that these deliberate planning actions can lead to increased uncertainty in the prediction of output measures such as operational availability. We use Discrete Event Simulation as well as Design of Experiments methods to model a maintenance system for a single type of repairable item. We demonstrate that the inclusion of inventory management leads to increased average availability of spare parts for a vehicle fleet. However, in some cases the variation in availability decreases the system's apparent reliability.	[Sherman, G. D.; Owen, K. R.; Pincombe, A.

Reflections after the tenth anniversary of Wal-Mart's entry to the United Kingdom	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Business performance; Supermarkets; Competitive strategy; Globalization; United Kingdom	UK	Purpose - The paper seeks evaluate to the comparative progress of Asda in the UK since its surprise takeover by Wal-Mart in 1999. Wal-Mart expected to become the number 1 retailer in the UK and many commentators saw massive problems ahead for local retailers. These expectations were not met; this paper investigates why. Design/methodology/approach - Asda's progress is considered through a brief discussion of the company's history to 1999, an investigation of the changes Wal-Mart subsequently made to Asda's operations, the comparative impact of these changes and then a consideration of the restrictions on impact deriving from organisational, competitive and environmental factors. Findings - Despite the strong rhetoric on entry, the commercial reality has seen only moderate success for Asda and a widening gap to the market leader, Tesco. Explanation for this includes competitive strategy and reactions, market restrictions particularly in land-use planning and unwillingness by Asda (Wal-Mart) to alter their focused store format strategy in line with competitor actions and market directions. Research limitations/implications - The analysis is at a macro corporate and national level, drawing mainly on published data. Research implications include the rebalancing of considerations of organisational competence and market environment factors on international success. A focus on political and non-market activities is suggested, though an unwillingness of companies to reconsider strategic directions is also indicted as a key factor. Practical implications - Implications for national and international strategic decision making at the corporate and governmental levels are identified. Businesses can use the findings to re-consider their positioning and actions. Reflections on hyperbolic reactions to takeovers might also be provoked. Originality/value - No other paper has considered the market level changes in connection with Asda since its take-over by Wal-Mart and sought explanations for the relative (lack of) performance. The conclusion, that Asda has not been as successful as reported in the literature and the media, is original.

As regards to comprisement, the marketing segmentation has been seen according to three levels: first, it restricts itself to the identification of groups that have similarities and differences between them, in the second level includes what results from the identification of homogenous groups, which is the selection of targeted segments; and, in the third level of comprisement includes, beyond the mapping of homogeneous groups and choice of target groups, the preparation of compounds marketing. The second question focuses on what is the internal forum of decision of company which is the product differentiation, that takes, as reference, the offerings of company and competition and which is, by excellence, in the market, that are its segments. In this context, this theoretical article has three main objectives: i) consolidate the understanding of the concept, the process and the bases of market segmentation and explain some doubts incidents ii) redeem the conceptual differentiation between market segmentation and product differentiation, iii) to clarify market segmentation in the anthropological perspective.

Defining a bearing replacement strategy using Monte Carlo methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Monte Carlo methods; Maintenance; Engine components	RELIABILITY; MAINTENANCE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a bearing replacement strategy which employs the Monte Carlo simulation method. In this contribution the method is used to estimate the economic impact on the selection of a particular bearing change strategy. The simulation demonstrates that it is possible to identify the most cost-effective approach and thus suggests a suitable bearing replacement policy, which in turn allows engineers to develop the appropriate maintenance schedules for their company. Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops the Monte Carlo method through a case study approach. Three case studies are presented. The first study is detailed and chronicles the design, development and implementation of the Monte Carlo method as a means of defining a bearing replacement strategy within a subject company. The second and third cases outline the application of the Monte Carlo method in two different environments. These applications made it possible to obtain proof of concept and also to further prove the effectiveness of the Monte Carlo simulation approach. Findings - An effective development of the Monte Carlo approach is proposed and the effectiveness of the method is subsequently evaluated, highlighting the benefits to the host organization and how the approach led to significant improvement in machinery reliability through a bearing replacement strategy. Practical implications - The design, development and implementation of a bearing replacement strategy provide a simple yet effective approach to achieving significant improvements in system reliability and performance through less downtime and greater cost savings. The paper offers practising maintenance managers and engineers a strategic framework for increasing productive efficiency and output. Originality/value - The proposed bearing replacement strategy contributes to the existing knowledge base on maintenance systems and subsequently disseminates this information in order to provide impetus, guidance and support towards increasing the development companies in an attempt to move the UK manufacturing sector towards world-class manufacturing performance.

Facility types included adult family homes, residential care facilities, and traditional assisted living facilities. Adult family homes were more willing to admit residents with higher care needs. By contrast, assisted living facilities' policies did not support the provision of intensive services, but their policies promoted higher resident autonomy, suggesting that consumers may have to choose between autonomy and help with complex needs when exploring assisted living for long-term care.

J	Thrassou, A; Vrontis, D; Kotabe, M				Thrassou, Alkis; Vrontis, Demetris; Kotabe, Masaaki			Towards a marketing communications model for small political parties. A primary principles strategic perspective for developed countries	CROSS CULTURAL MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Politics; Strategy; Marketing communications; Small parties; Developed countries	CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR; CONSUMPTION; INTERNATIONALIZATION; KNOWLEDGE; EMOTIONS; BRANDS; VALUES; FIRM	Purpose - Through a comprehensive literature review and data analysis, the purpose of this paper is to adopt a multi-perspective interrelation of different dimensions of existing theory to eventually bridge the fields of political and business marketing, identify the underlying causes of voter behaviour, and distil the critical factors of small political parties' (SPPs') strategic marketing communications (MCs) success. The research finally develops a preliminary conceptual strategic MCs model for SPPs that fits the context of developed countries and concentrates on the strategic aspects of MCs. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is largely conceptual and is based on an extensive literature review and secondary data; strengthened through additional and focused quantitative and qualitative data. Findings - The findings indicate an increasing association between business and political marketing, an environmental context that stimulates and nurtures a symbiotic relationship between parties and voters, an enhanced role of "perception management", and substantial divergence of SPP reality from classical theory. Research limitations/implications - Further and focused primary research is required towards model testing. Practical implications - A scientific basis is provided for practical strategic implementation of MCs by SPPs. Originality/value - The research value stems from its focus on SPPs, its contribution to the generic discussion on business marketing theory applicability to politics; its reinforcement of existing research on the subject through further data and analyses; and additionally to existing researches' focus, its concentration on the strategic aspects of the subject and its contribution to literature of an analogous strategic political marketing model.

It examines differences across three decision domains as well as between subsidiary geographic locations. The decision domains are, first, general management decisions related to strategy and management/operations; second, IT systems investment decisions; and third, international transfer pricing. The results showed that, generally, the decision authority for management/operational decisions was more extensively delegated to overseas subsidiaries than decision authority for strategic decisions. The decision delegation for international transfer pricing was found to be low. There were differences between subsidiaries in different geographic locations. In general, the delegation of decision authority for all decision domains was broader to North American and European subsidiaries than to Asian subsidiaries. We show that decision delegation is not a monolithic activity, but a complex activity which is not yet fully comprehended by theory.

Veloso Gomes., 2011. The Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Portugal. A comparison between the Technical Report proposals and the official Document.. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1430 - 1432. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 This paper presents a critical comparison between the proposals of the technical Report "Basis for a National Strategy for Coastal Zone Management" prepared for the Portuguese Ministry of Environment and Territorial Planning (June 2006) and the approved Law entitled "National Strategy for Coastal Zone Management" (ENGIZC, Government Resolution 82, 8 Sept. 2009). The referred technical Report was coordinated by the author and it is the result of intense work and reflection of an independent Working Group (WG) appointed by the Ministry with expertise and experienced knowledge. After public discussion the revised content of the Report was published as book by the Ministry. The approved Law (ENGIZC) was based on the referred Report but includes more political and governance issues. Between 2007 and 2009 several changes occur in the legal and institutional framework related water and water resources. The new Water Law, the definition of a national Water Authority and the creation of new regional Water Authorities have strong implications on CZM with very important positive aspects but also negative consequences. The aim of reducing fragmentation of responsibilities on the CZM has not been achieved. A comparison of the WG Report and the approved ICZM Strategy is presented. A comment will be included on the contribution given by the "Strategic Environment Assessment" that was performed in a voluntary way during the preparation process. That contribution was less relevant that one should expect because the teams were aware of Strategic and Environment issues.

Casualties were mainly in the Khao Lak areas, one of the most popular coastal cities of the Andaman sea of Thailand in Phang Nga Province. Thailand has out in place a disaster early warning system through the establishment of the National Disaster Warming Center (NDWC) in on 30th May 2005. NDWC and its interagency departments and international organizations have implemented knowledge-based capacity building programs to increase awareness and resilience in diaster management at the Government function levels and the community level since 2006. It was found that the tsunami prevention and preparedness practices for tourism sector and private entrepreneurs had not yet been developed. This may result in detrimental impacts if tsunamis of the same magnitude will occur again in the future. A project entitled "Tsunami Prevention and Preparedness Practices for Tourism Sector and Private Entreprenur in Khao Lak, Phang Nga Province of Thailand" is now proposed to be implemented in about 30 selected hotels, resorts and business entepreneur strategic early warning and risk management plans to provide participatory planning, disaster preparedness and response practices selected hotels, resorts and business area building and to demnstrate utilization of appropriate telecommuncation technology for disaster early warning system for toursim and private sector entrepreneur located in Khao Lak Areas, Phang Nga. The project will provide adaptive learning tools in the tsunami prevention and preparedness practices for tourism sector and private entrepreneur in Khao Lak of Phang Nga and can be expanded to others areas which are located in the tsunami prone areas of Thailand and in other countries.

Such integration of technology and information presents a strategic avenue for creating efficiencies in the development of highly complex products. This paper examines the implementation of a sophisticated computer aided design (CAD) package in a small company. The strategic aim was to bring components into the CAD environment, supporting each component with procurement information. The intention was that this would lead to: reduced design cycle times through the development of parts libraries; improved efficiencies in planning; and reduced manufacturing cycle times. In a small commercial environment, such strategic development presents a challenging task.

J	Yeh, QJ; Chang, AJT				Yeh, Quey-Jen; Chang, Arthur Jung-Ting			Technology-push and need-pull roles in information system security diffusion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information system security; ISS; technology cluster; technology-push; TP; need-pull; NP; information system security diffusion; ISS diffusion; technology management	ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS; USER ACCEPTANCE; SMALL BUSINESS; DEMAND-PULL; ADOPTION; THREATS; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; MODEL; FRAMEWORK	Research of information system security (ISS) usually conceives of security models on the basis of positive, strategic benefits, such as planning or developing a security baseline. However, ISS works only when it enables an organization to protect against attacks, so managers seldom adopt positively based new security measures. By theorising ISS as a technology cluster that consists of distinguishable but interrelated countermeasures, this study analyses managers' security concerns on the basis of two forces - technology-push (TP) and need-pull (NP) - traditionally applied to technology diffusion. Both TP, which entails managers' perceived security threats, and NP, or requirements associated with the industry, organisational readiness, and security incidents, forces may prompt organisational ISS diffusion. The empirical findings suggest this conceptualisation effectively explains organisational ISS diffusion, though NP forces appear dominant. In general, organisations are less likely to adopt new security measures unless compelled to do so by industry or security gaps or if they are large enough and technically prepared for security innovations. Therefore, organisations should adjust their security plans to align with the threats facing their industries.

There is no strength as essential as an ability of differentiation by excellent products or services at attractive markets in long-term period. Innovation provides sustainable market success. Therefore, it is one of the key strategic success factors. The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss knowledge and findings of original primary research into South-Moravian companies within two research projects of Internal Grant Agency Faculty of Business and Management Brno University of Technology, which have been conducted in 2009 and 2010. The research projects have been focused on innovation management and its assessment. Author proved with help of questionnaire survey that in many companies an unsuitable model of innovation process management is employed. There is no clearly defined problem description, innovation project management, coordination of activities, communication or cooperation. Vague objectives cause changes in the stages of the innovation process, missed deadlines and increased costs. This finding is not affirmative for our business environment. Therefore, the paper presents solution of this problem which is seen in holistic approach to innovation management developed by A.T. Kearney and called "House of Innovation".

J	Zyngier, S				Zyngier, Suzanne			Knowledge Management: Realizing Value Through Governance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Evaluation; Governance; Knowledge Management Strategy; Knowledge Management Tools; Measurement		Knowledge Management (KM) governance is the implementation of authority through a framework to ensure the delivery of anticipated or predicted benefits of KM strategy development and implementation in an authorized and regulated manner. KM governance also relies on measurement and evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of all aspects of KM, particularly the outcomes of strategy implementation to ensure that strategic benefits are realized. This paper examines the results of a global survey of people involved in the development and implementation of KM strategies. Responses came from 34 countries across every continent. Using descriptive and inferential statistics, this paper finds clear evidence of the measurability of KM outcomes through KM governance. These research findings strengthen the proposition that KM governance supports the capacity of KM governance to realize and reveal the value from, or the return on investment (ROI) of KM strategy development and implementation; the selection of KM tools and techniques is less of a consideration in this regard.

Generic Multimodal Ontologies for Human-Agent Interaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						multimodal ontology; ontology matching; interface agents; Semantic Web; human-agent interaction	SYSTEMS	Watching the evolution of the Semantic Web (SW) from its inception to these days we can easily observe that the main task the developers face while building it is to encode the human knowledge into ontologies and the human reasoning into dedicated reasoning engines. Now, the SW needs to have efficient mechanisms to access information by both humans and artificial agents. The most important tools in this context are ontologies. The last years have been dedicated to solving the infrastructure problems related to ontologies: ontology management, ontology matching, ontology adoption, but as time goes by and these problems are better understood the research interests in this area will surely shift towards the way in which agents will use them to communicate between them and with humans. Despite the fact that interface agents could be bilingual, it would be more efficient, safe and swift that they should use the same language to communicate with humans and with their peers. Since anthropocentric systems entail nowadays multimodal interfaces, it seems suitable to build multimodal ontologies. Generic ontologies are needed when dealing with uncertainty. Multimodal ontologies should be designed taking into account our way of thinking (mind maps, visual thinking, feedback, logic, emotions, etc.) and also the processes in which they would be involved (multimodal fusion and integration, error reduction, natural language processing, multimodal fission, etc.). By doing this it would be easier for us (and also fun) to use ontologies, but in the same time the communication with agents (and also agent to agent talk) would be enhanced. This is just one of our conclusions related to why building generic multimodal ontologies is very important for future semantic web applications.

J	Brosnan, B; Cheyne, C				Brosnan, Bruno; Cheyne, Christine			Stronger communities? Changing prospects for community-led strategic planning in New Zealand	COMMONWEALTH JOURNAL OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE			English	Article						New Zealand Local Government; Network Governance; Community-Led Strategic Planning		New Zealand's Local Government Act 2002 ushered in a new phase in local government, a phase that is best characterised by the term 'empowerment'. Not only were councils empowered to promote social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being, in contrast with previous more prescriptive legislation, but citizens were empowered to engage in community-led strategic planning. In many respects the new statute reflected contemporary international public management trends in which governance is increasingly being conducted via networks of public and private actors. However, with the change of government from a centre-left Labour-led coalition to a centre-right National-led government following the November 2008 general election, it is less certain that local government and communities will continue to experience a strengthening of the pluralisation of governance that has been a feature of the past decade. This article argues that the potential disempowerment of local government, and possible attenuation of community-led strategic planning in New Zealand, comes at a time when the momentum for devolution to local government and other communities is increasing elsewhere.

J	Conceivious, HIP				Conceivious, Hubert Ignatius Percy			THE IMPACT OF CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ON SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The complexities of being a supplier to motorcar manufacturers, also known as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), provide an array of challenges to component manufacturers. Customer-specific requirements (CSRs) add to the convolutions of a supplier's quality management systems when producing components for the various motor manufacturers. The catalytic converter industry (CCI) forms part of the component supply chain in the motor industry. The CCI consists of a plethora of suppliers to produce the catalytic converter. This paper focuses on three of the five main suppliers, namely the 'monolith substrate manufacturers', the 'coaters', and the 'canners'. Most OEMs required that critical and strategic suppliers should be ISO/TS 16949:2009 certified. ISO/TS 16949: 2009 refers to an internationally recognised specification, specifically adapted for the motor industry. The specification indicates the minimum requirements and also makes provision for additional requirements known as CSRs that can be specified by the OEM.

The literature reports empirical evidence inconclusive, still more unfinished when analyzing their effects from an internal perspective or via processes. This study provides novel empirical evidence to this debate by examining the influence of conformity quality on the outcome of the firm, operationalized by the average total cost of the company. The proposed model examines the effects of conformity quality on non-quality costs, discriminating between those arising from external and internal failures. To this end, various measuring instruments have been developed in order to capture the complexity of the constructs conformity quality, quality failures and non-quality costs. The empirical application is based on the study of 82 Spanish hotel establishments.

J	Drnevich, P; Brush, TH; Shanley, MT				Drnevich, Paul; Brush, Thomas H.; Shanley, Mark T.			Strategic Implications of Information Technology for Resource and Capability Outsourcing Decisions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Decision Support; Information Technology (IT); Knowledge Management; Outsourcing; Performance	TRANSACTION-COST; FIRM; KNOWLEDGE	Outsourcing generally involves non-strategic resources and/or non-asset specific capabilities. However, in this paper, the authors examine the non-traditional, but increasingly more common, use of IT to facilitate theoretically inconsistent outsourcing decisions involving core resources and capabilities. The authors reconcile theory with practice by developing propositions to explain how IT can enable such outsourcing decisions and how performance advantages may ensue. The authors develop a finer-grained perspective of the constructs of knowledge-based resources and capabilities. The paper concludes with a discussion arguing that such IT-enabled outsourcing decisions, if implemented correctly, can provide an organization with both capability advantages and cost benefits, resulting in higher performance.

This work has five defining features: (i) the same body of work is processed sequentially and handed one unit to another; (ii) the handover of work is characterized by short cycle times and the frequency of handover is greater than in traditional offshore work; (iii) the functional units of the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory operate in a peer-to-peer relationship where each functional unit audits the work of other units; (iv) the knowledge transfer between the different work units and work history between units is effected through specialized mechanisms and a distributed human agency called the composite personae; and (v) the constituent units of the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory feature similar work capabilities, as opposed to the more traditional model of global teams where the distributed teams usually possess complementary work capabilities. The distributed units of the 24-Hour Knowledge Factory work on the same body of work and do very similar work; therefore, the units have nearly identical capabilities. The authors identify two sets of research issues surrounding this phenomenon that fall within the technical paradigm and the organizational paradigm of information systems.

The proposed fuzzy abstraction hierarchy (FAH) represents a similarity relationship based on the integrated notion of data abstraction and fuzzy relations. Based on FAH, the authors develop query relaxation operators like query generalization, approximation, and specialization of a value. Compared with existing approaches, FAH supports more effective information retrieval by processing various kinds of cooperative queries through elaborate relaxation control and providing ranked query results according to fitness scores. Moreover, FAH reduces maintenance cost by decreasing the number of similarity relationships to be managed.

J	Mathew, M; Subramanya, T; Agarwal, N; Dambal, A				Mathew, Mary; Subramanya, Tejas; Agarwal, Nivedita; Dambal, Anirudha			Role of HR Professionals in the Indian Information Technology Sector	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						HR density; strategic HR; Indian IT Industry		This qualitative paper aims to understand the activities and strategic role played by Human Resources (HR) professionals in the Indian IT organizations. This paper presents results from an exploratory field study of HR professionals in 28 IT organizations of Bangalore. Data is collected from HR professionals in these organizations to assess career support that HR professionals receive, the size increase of these professionals given the overall manpower size increase (HR density), replication of parent's HR practices, and the HR activities these professionals engage in, in this sector Results showed that HR played an important role in recruitment, culture building and training and development. However technical personnel seemed to have a greater say in compensation related activities, even though it is traditionally a core HR activity. The strategic contribution of HR to the organization was also analyzed. It was found that in these organizations, the strategic role of HR was understood. The growth in the number of HR professionals with reference to the age of the company was also looked at. It is evident that initially for a young company there is a high need for HR personnel and as the companies grows old the HR processes get standardized and hence the requirement for new HR personnel decreases. The higher HR density has implications on HR activities practices in Indian IT companies. Likewise the more fully parent's HR practice is replicated in Indian IT companies, the more some HR activities are influenced.

J	Powell, SR				Powell, Steven R.			An Analysis of the Latin American Wireless Telecommunications Market Portfolios of Telefonica and America Movil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Internationalization; Latin America; Portfolio; Telecommunications; Wireless		In response to slowing growth, intensifying competition in their traditional wireless voice, text markets with an eye toward increasing revenues from offering a bundle of mobile and fixed-line voice, data, text, and video services to subscribers, management at Telefonica and America Movil have restructured their companies and reconsidered their internationalization strategies. This paper focuses on the two companies' Latin American wireless market portfolios, providing background on why these reorganizational and strategic actions were taken. In particular, the paper compares the portfolios with respect to their market attractiveness and competitive positions in 2008 relative to 2002 on both an overall average and degree of variance basis across the markets in the portfolios. The portfolio analysis technique employed in the paper may have wider applicability for formulating corporate strategy.

J	Aidemark, J				Aidemark, Jan			A Multi-Dimensional Knowledge Management Systems Planning Approach	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge management; strategic planning method		The paper presents a strategic planning approach for knowledge management systems. This research approaches the problem of failing KMS's by focusing on the planning phase. The result can be summarised as a set of frameworks for the strategic planning of knowledge management systems, i.e. information systems for the support of organisational knowledge processes. The approach is built on a broad set of theory, which has been used to discuss issues in KM/KMS from very broad perspectives. We approach the problem area from a strategic point of view, assuming that the problems of the area are based on a socio-technical dimension and that a multiple-paradigm approach is necessary for dealing with the problems of the various KM areas.

J	Grienitz, V; Blume, V				Grienitz, Volker; Blume, Volker			STRATEGIC PLANNING OF FUTURE PRODUCTS WITH PRODUCT SCENARIOS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product scenarios; scenarios; evolutionary algorithms; monitoring; scenario planning		Manufacturing based corporations often find themselves confronted with complexities of increased pressures to innovate in order to ensure their comparative market positions. In order to react to various exogenous changes corporations need to develop strategies that match their manufacturing resources as well as products with the markets requirements. Product scenarios represent a holistic approach for managing innovation processes and technologies efficiently. The analysis through evolutionary algorithms for compatibility between and amongst the product structure segments provides the necessary information about their suitability. The resulting scenarios, roadmaps and regular monitoring processes are prerequisite for the managerial decision making process and the implementation of product and technology strategies.

J	Himura, Y; Fukuda, K; Cho, K; Esaki, H				Himura, Yosuke; Fukuda, Kensuke; Cho, Kenjiro; Esaki, Hiroshi			An evaluation of automatic parameter tuning of a statistics-based anomaly detection algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT			English	Article							INTERNET	We investigate an automatic and dynamic parameter tuning of a statistical method for detecting anomalies in network traffic (this tuning is referred to as parameter learning) towards real-time detection. The main idea behind the dynamic tuning is to predict an appropriate parameter for upcoming traffic by considering the detection results of past tau traces of traffic. The tau is referred to as the learning period, and we discuss in particular the appropriate value of tau. This automatic tuning scheme is applied to parameter setting of an anomaly detection method based on Sketch and the multi-scale gamma model, which is an unsupervised method and does not need predefined data. We analyze the tuning scheme with real traffic traces measured on a trans-Pacific link over 9 years (15 min from 14:00 Japan Standard Time every day, and 24 consecutive hours for some dates on the same link). The detection results with parameter prediction are compared to those with ideal parameters that maximize the detection performance for upcoming traffic. We also analyze predictability of the ideal parameter considering the past changes in it. The main findings of this work are as follows: (1) the ideal parameter fluctuates day by day; (2) parameter learning with a longer tau is affected by significant events included in the period, and the appropriate tau is about three traces (days) for everyday 15 min traces and around 1.5 h for 24 h traces; (3) the degradation in detection performance caused by introducing parameter learning is 17% with tau = 3 for everyday 15 min traces; (4) the changes in the ideal parameter have no periodic correlation, and can be modeled as a random process followed by a normal distribution. We show that one cannot consistently use a fixed parameter in statistics-based algorithms to detect anomalies in practice. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Paulus, O				Paulus, Odile			Museums as Serigraphs or Unique Masterpieces: Do American Art Museums Display Differentiation in Their Mission Statements?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mission; museums; lexical analysis; differentiation; isomorphism; strategic balance	ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; QUESTION	The author sets out to measure the strategic equilibrium between differentiation and isomorphism through an analysis of mission statements presented by art museums in the United States. The mission statements are compared with one another, with the mission statements of other samples and with institutional definitions of museum. The results show that museums tend to take a position of strategic balance between differentiation and isomorphism. The museums converge with regard to their program of activities, absence of any mention of employees, definition of quality when referring to professional standards, and the search for qualitative objectives in the reach for visitors. The mission statements mention values, visitors, services provided, raison d'etre and geographical domain. Museums give more importance to communication and education and less to research and preservation in accordance with institutional recommendations. Most museums want to attract the public to their collection, but they differentiate by their local anchoring, their raison d'etre and the mention of some components in their mission statement.

J	Schiavone, F				Schiavone, Francesco			The liberalisation and diversification of the European electricity industry A country-based view	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								European Commission directives for the liberalisation and deregulation of the European electricity industry were adopted almost at the same time in several nations. But each country had specific market structures and internal conditions. The aim of this paper is to analyse descriptively if and how differences between the home countries of European electricity firms affected, quantitatively and/or qualitatively, their diversification strategies after liberalisation. Research consisted of collecting and analysing data on the strategic actions of the main European electricity firms. The analysis covers a period of ten years (1998-2007), i.e. the first ten years after the first European directive. This paper sheds light on the link between pre-liberalisation specificities and attributes of a national electricity market and the post-liberalisation diversification strategy of its national electricity companies.

J	Tenuche, M				Tenuche, Marietu			Foreign Direct Investments, Strategic Assets and Sustainable Development: A Critique of International Investment in Nigeria's Steel Sector	JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW			English	Article						Foreign Direct Investment; International Capital; Management; International Agreements; Multinational Corporations; Foreign Capital		Advocates of trade liberalisation that include the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) and their adherents in the third world encourage foreign direct investment as a means of stimulating economic development in these economies. The arguments in favour of foreign investments are that it provides among other benefits, the required capital for development, facilitates technology transfer, and improve infrastructure development. Foreign direct investment is however criticised for its negative impact on the economies of the third world for a number of reasons. Multinational corporations (MNCs) that account for the highest contributors to FDI through private capital investment are accused of sharp practices that include exploitation, corruption, unethical business practices and environmental degradation. Through their activities, MNC engender loss of sovereignty and policy-making by host economies and loss of control over resources among other negative impacts. One instrument used by Foreign Capital to subjugate developing economies is the control of management of projects and programmes into which investments are made. Management control is therefore a primary objective of investors and this is usually accomplished right from the time agreements are reached between the host states and the investors. The study concluded that more often than not, the implication of management control over investment on developing economies include the desire to recoup capital invested at the shortest possible time, total dependence of the sector on investors for future development, reaping huge profits at the expense of local communities, damaging social networks and instigating political instability by the non-recognition and lack of respect for existing social conditions. Certain measures are therefore inevitable if FDI is to engender sustainable development.

J	Agnetis, A; Messina, E; Pranzo, M				Agnetis, Alessandro; Messina, Enza; Pranzo, Marco			Call planning in European pharmaceutical sales force management	IMA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT MATHEMATICS			English	Article						marketing resource allocation; call planning; sales force efficiency; application/pharmaceutical	TERRITORY ALIGNMENT; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; MODEL; DEPLOYMENT; IMPACT	In this paper, a mathematical model for the allocation of sales representatives is presented. The model takes into account some special features of pharmaceutical marketing, such as customer profiling (physicians), sales response functions and multi-product (drug) promotion procedures. The main peculiarity of the model is that it is suitable to those markets (such as European markets) where the detailed information about historical physician prescriptions is not available to pharmaceutical companies. A heuristic procedure has been designed and run to plan nationwide representative calls to more than 46000 physicians. A computational study, based on real data from a major pharmaceutical company, shows the feasibility of this algorithmic approach, resulting in significantly enhanced productivity. Moreover, the algorithm can be also employed as a tool to evaluate costly strategic options concerning sales force sizing and training.

I.; Chaturvedi, Alok			Examining the Implications of Process and choice for Strategic decision Making Effectiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Agent Software; Agent Technology; Decision Support Systems (DSS); Distributed DecisionMakingSystems; Knowledge Management; Security Management; Strategic Planning		Most strategic decision-making (SDM) approaches advocate the importance of decision-making processes and response choices for obtaining effective outcomes. Modern decision-making support system (DMSS) technology is often also needed for complex SDM, with recent research calling for more integrative DMSS approaches. However, scholars tend to take disintegrated approaches and disagree on whether rational or political decision-making processes result in more effective decision outcomes. In this study, the authors examine these issues by first exploring some of the competing theoretical arguments for the process-choice-effectiveness relationship, and then test these relationships empirically using data from a crisis response training exercise using an intelligent agent-based DMSS. In contrast to prior research, findings indicate that rational decision processes are not effective in crisis contexts, and that political decision processes may negatively influence both response choice and decision effectiveness. These results offer empirical evidence to confirm prior unsupported arguments that response choice is an important mediating factor between the decision-making process and its effectiveness. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings and the application of agent-based simulation DMSS technologies for academic research and practice.

Given that organizational identity is a viable strategic element for organizational competitive advantages, this study explored how today's U. S. textile and apparel firms describe themselves as organizations, compared the findings with business classification descriptions provided by the U. S. Census Bureau, and investigated the relationship between organizational identity congruence and performance. Results of content analysis of web-based communication data and multivariate statistical techniques suggested that the majority of U. S. textile and apparel manufacturers and wholesale merchants use self-descriptors such as product provider, service provider, or business partner, rather than Census Bureau terms such as manufacturers or wholesalers. The findings also showed that organizational identity congruence is positively associated with various organizational performance outcomes. The study concludes with the contributions and implications of the study findings, limitations, and future research opportunities.

J	Jih, WJ; Lee, SF				Jih, Wen-Jang; Lee, Su-Fang			Effects of e-CRM Value Perceptions on Website Loyalty: An Empirical Investigation from Customer Perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Customer Relationship Management; e-Commerce; e-Customer Relationship Management; Marketing Strategies; Website Loyalty		Web-enabled customer relationship management, or e-CRM, holds the promise to simultaneously achieve the conflicting goals of strategic flexibility and operational efficiency in developing and executing innovative e-commerce marketing strategies. A new multi-disciplinary field involving such diverse areas as marketing, information systems, and consumer behavior, e-CRM seeks to strengthen customer relationship via a portfolio of trust-building practices with the support of powerful information technologies. While most literature in e-CRM has focused on how firms formulate and implement e-CRM initiatives, there is a dearth of literature on viewing the overall quality of an e-commerce firm's e-CRM practices from the consumer point of view. This research proposes such a consumer-oriented concept, e-CRM value, based on existing e-CRM research literature and examines the effect of e-CRM value on website loyalty. It was found that customers' perception of e-CRM value has a positive causal effect on their website loyalty. The implications of this finding for the theory-building of e-CRM and marketing practices of e-commerce firms are discussed.

To respond this transformation, strategic partnership has been gaining increasing attention. However, recent research points out that it still lacks the methodology to optimize the existing suppliers that would help buyer establish long-term relationship. This paper proposes a two-phase Domain Driven Data Mining (DDDM) methodology for strategic supplier selection. Phase one is termed domain knowledge acquisition and analysis, while phase two is supplier set optimization. Meanwhile, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), set theory and association rule mining are included in the two phases. Furthermore, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the proposed supplier selection model. Simulation results indicate that it, is more efficient than single AHP or association rule algorithm. In short, the proposed model employs both qualitative subjective judgments and quantitative objective data to select strategic suppliers. It optimizes the existing suppliers, which would provide the basis for the buyer establishing long-term relationships with fewer suppliers.

The perspectives of Thai managers were surveyed using a structured instrument. The analysis identifies seven dimensions of marketing management knowledge: promotion management, price management, logistics management, product innovation management, strategic marketing management, cross-cultural management, and target marketing management. The incidence of transfer is highest for activities in strategic marketing management, followed by price management. Transfer in product innovation management and target marketing management tends to vary with the age of the joint venture. Joint venture firms with foreign partners originating from Western, advanced, industrialised nations recorded the highest incidence of knowledge transfer occurring within product innovation management. This trend also holds true for the management of promotion activities. The incidence of transfer in target marketing management is lowest among firms with foreign partners from neighbouring nations. The incidence of knowledge transfer within product innovation and target marketing also tends to vary with the age of the joint venture. An analysis based on industry classification revealed that the transfer of knowledge regarding logistics management occurs most for firms in the manufacturing sector. In the service sector, the highest incidence of knowledge transfer within the areas of promotion management and target marketing management occurred in the agricultural sector	[Mohamad, Osman; Ramayah, T.] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, USM Pulau Pinang 11800, Malaysia; [Hathaivaseawong, Nit] Rajabat Suratthani Inst, Fac Management, Surattani, Thailand		Mohamad, O (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, USM Pulau Pinang 11800, Malaysia.	osman@usm.my	Ramayah, T./E-4629-2010	Ramayah, T./0000-0002-7580-7058			Akaah I.

J	O'Reilly, K; Ugray, Z				O'Reilly, Kelly; Ugray, Zsolt			An Exploratory Look at Attributes of Internet Use and Adoption by Franchisees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Electronic Marketing; Franchising; Internet Adoption; SME Business-Model Transformation; SME Competitiveness; SME Productivity Improvements; SMEs	E-BUSINESS; SMES; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE; COMMERCE	This case study explores the attitudes and perceptions of franchise owner-operators in regard to their acceptance of advanced Internet innovation and technologies. Because these franchisees serve a dual role as both the decision maker and the end user of new technology and innovation, they provide a dichotomy of perspectives that yield insights into many aspects of business leadership, customer service, and operational proficiency. Findings suggest five key attributes of Internet use and adoption by franchisees. The data in this exploratory case study also reveals three areas of disparity regarding franchisee behavior worthy of consideration by practitioners and academics: (1) The inward focus of franchisees, (2) project costs are considered superficially, and (3) the micro SME as change agent. This research is significant and accretive by capturing the voice of franchisees in regard to Internet acceptance and by providing a strategic look at how the franchise micro SME is significantly different than non-franchised and larger SMEs.

Design A descriptive observational study was used to identify and classify tasks associated with an 'unoccupied bed' Methods Four project nurses held informal discussions with all levels of staff in four divisions of the hospital (surgery, internal medicine, cancer care and women's and newborn). Field notes were made throughout the process and the project nurses met regularly to compare findings and identify similarities. Results This study identified three main areas of nursing work, which centre on the 'unoccupied bed': 1) bed preparation for admission; 2) temporary transfer; 3) bed preparation post patient discharge. Conclusion The unoccupied bed is not resource neutral and may involve considerable nursing time. The time associated with each of the reasons for the bed being unoccupied remains to be quantified.

J	Ricci, S; Marinacci, C				Ricci, S.; Marinacci, C.			Modelling Support for Maritime Terminals Planning and Operation	TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								The maritime terminal design process is a complex stepwise series of strategic decisions involving the engagement of a relevant amount of resources. In fact operating conditions near the maximum capacity cause congestion effects with negative consequences on regularity and quality service. Therefore, in order to maximise its effectiveness, a strong need of methodological support is required. With this aim the authors developed different methods and models capable of supporting some of these decisions: a regressive method for preliminary dimensioning of harbour terminals and a sea-side operation combinatorial model for traffic analysis and capacity estimation. They are able to be integrated in a chain of models taking into account dimensions and manoeuvrability of ships, terminal morphology, handling equipment, storage areas, etc., with the aim to support the planning process and operational management.

Setting: Medium-sized Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Lebanon, PA, from 2007 to 2009. Practice description: The pharmacy service at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Lebanon, PA, encompasses all aspects of inpatient, outpatient, clinical, and managerial services. Medications are provided to more than 40,000 outpatients each year, and inpatient services covered nearly 62,000 bed-days of care in fiscal year 2008. We maintain direct clinical pharmacy input on all medical care areas, as well as in behavioral health and primary care. Our site also employs three postgraduate year 1 and two postgraduate year 2 pharmacy residents each year. Conclusion: Successful pharmacy renovation is predicated upon proactive and effective leadership that starts long before the project begins.

Capacity-driven pricing mechanism in special service industries	JOURNAL OF REVENUE AND PRICING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pricing model; revenue management; demand curve; special service industry		We propose a capacity-driven pricing mechanism for a class of service industries in which the customer behavior, the price-demand relationship, and the competition are distinct from other industries. The customers, in these industries, typically do not plan in advance and make a strategic decision to purchase the service. Our observations also revealed that the price-demand relationship in these industries could not be defined by fitted curves and the competition is largely local. We analyze both 'risk-neutral' and 'risk-aversion' based pricing models and conclude that the proposed capacity-driven model could define an 'optimal' solution, under mild assumptions. The resulting pricing mechanism has yielded positive results at our industrial partner, since its implementation in 2005.

J	Chmielewski, DA				Chmielewski, Danielle A.			A conceptual exploration of the strategic factors driving new brand entry decisions and their success	AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL			English	Article						New brands; RBV; Strategic orientation; Environment; Innovation		New brand entry strategies, such as brand extensions and new-name brands, are increasingly being used by firms to facilitate strategic growth. Whilst the issue of new brand entry is of great strategic importance, particularly to marketing practitioners, most new brand entry research has taken a strong consumer behavior stance, with much less research being directed towards the strategic, firm-specific and market-specific drivers of new brand entry decisions and their performance. This paper takes an exploratory first step in providing a strategic management view of new brand entry by developing and introducing a conceptual framework of firm-and market-specific antecedents and moderators of two key new brand entry strategies, brand extensions and new-name brands. Specifically, this paper first explores the direct effect of a firm's resources and strategic orientation on the choice of a brand extension or a new-name brand strategy, before going onto investigate the effect of the two new brand entry strategies on performance under different environmental conditions, namely dynamism, complexity, and hostility. The paper puts forth a number of propositions and finishes off with a discussion of future research avenues. (C) 2010 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chan, A; Chan, C				Chan, Andrew; Chan, Carlson			Entry Strategies into the P.r.c. for Post recession Wealth Management Service	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bank Strategic Management; Global Recession and Financial Tsunami; Market Entry Tactics; The People's Republic of China (P.R.C.); Theory of Planned Behavior; Wealth Management Services		Trillions of dollars were evaporated worldwide as a result of the financial tsunami that shocked the world in 2007 (Soros, 2008). This paper argues that in a time of global recession, banks seeking to expand wealth management service in the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) need to evaluate their entry strategies thoroughly to gain a competitive edge. Through applying the theory of planned behavior, a sequential mixed methods study was conducted post recession with the aim to identify wealth management service entry strategies into the P.R.C. A sample of 227 Taiwanese nationals based in the P.R.C. indicated three managerial implications consisting of the bank entry identity, deployment of expatriates, and brand-image position.

Its main purpose is the study of the intensity of IT use in the sector; focusing on IT-related management of its organizations. Two different goals related to actual IT use have been identified. Information Technologies have indeed been used as a tool to provide information, both to prospective clients and with a more general scope. Furthermore, improvements on management due to IT use have also been encountered, such as on-line direct support to would-be entrepreneurs through specific software. The paper also considers whether IT use adds effective value to the performance of some or all Spanish Micrt?finance Institutions (MFIs). It is found that such strategic use of IT is less widespread, related primarily to financial transparency issues, more clearly shown by MFIs linked to the social economy.

Temporal Aspects of Information Technology use: Increasing Shift Work Effectiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR			English	Article						Police Organization; Shift Work; Task-Technology Fit; Technology Acceptance Model; User Satisfaction		The dynamic nature of organizations and technologies require a comprehensive understanding of how organizational forms and information technology interact. While previous research and theories of information technology have investigated aspects such as organizational structure, individual and group behavior, and inter-organizational relationships, shift work, an important temporal aspect often found in service organizations, is surprisingly absent in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect that shift work has on employee use and satisfaction with information technology. The results of a field study of a police organization indicate that information technology systems are valued differently by workers on different shifts. The authors discuss how this research helps advance theories of technology use and effectiveness (such as task-technology fit and technology acceptance model) and present important practical implications of this study for strategic alignment of technology in the areas of systems design, implementation, addressing the needs of peripheral workers, and resource management.

J	Galderisi, A; Ceudech, A				Galderisi, Adriana; Ceudech, Andrea			Mobility Network and Safet y	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mobility Networks; Natural and Technological Risks; Safety		Mobility network is crucial for ensuring territorial safety with respect to natural and technological hazards. They represent a basic support to community's everyday life although being exposed elements often characterized by high vulnerability to different hazards and, in the meanwhile, strategic equipments for emergency management. Physical damages or the lack in functioning of those networks may greatly increase the loss of human lives caused by hazardous events as well as produce relevant economic damages at medium and long term. Although the relevance of the mobility networks in assuring territorial safety is at present largely recognized, risk analyses have been long focused on buildings' vulnerability or, even where they have paid attention to mobility network, they have been mainly focused on the physical damages that a given hazard could may induce on individual elements of such network. It is recent the awareness that mobility network represents a system, characterized by relevant interdependences both among its elements and among network infrastructures and urban systems. Based on these assumptions, this paper points out the heterogeneous aspects of the mobility network vulnerability and their relevance in increasing the overall territorial or urban vulnerability to hazardous events. Therefore, an in-depth investigation of the concept of mobility network vulnerability is provided, in order to highlight the aspects mostly investigated and more recent research perspectives. Finally, a case study in the Campania Region is presented in order to point out how traditional risk analyses, generally referred to individual hazards, can sometimes led to invest in the mobility network improvement or development which, targeted to increase the security of a territory result, on the opposite, in an increase of the territorial vulnerability.

CONCEPTUAL APPROACH AND TERRITORY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY: UNIVERSALITY AND INDIVIDUALITY CONNECTION	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						strategic target; model; the allocated approach		The article describes an approach to working out a strategy of development of a territory on the basis of modelling representation of a strategic target. The necessity and possibility of spatial representation of the model of strategic target is proved. The face approach to the model was used. Major factors of the model are singled out, including the psychological and business ones. The given model of the strategic target allows using its various configurations depending on the specificity of a situation. The given approach allows to formulate a universal strategic target and to provide its individuality. The offered model of the strategic target allows to visually show the possibility of reaching coordination of management and self-management in the course of strategic target reaching as a system consisting of private aims of different levels.										0	1	1	0	0	TOMSK STATE UNIV	TOMSK	LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA	1561-7793	1561-803X		TOMSK STATE UNIV J	Tomsk State Univ.

J	Le Roux, L; Oosthuizen, H				Le Roux, L.; Oosthuizen, H.			The development of an instructional design model as a strategic enabler for sustainable competitive advantage	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; MANAGEMENT; COMPETENCE; FIRM; PERFORMANCE	In a business environment of continuous change and in light of a defined need to fast track skills improvement and development in South Africa and Africa, training strategies and practices are under increasing pressure to develop a more productive and skilled workforce. Demands on training and the practices it employs increasingly focus on the alignment with strategic imperatives of organisations and the country. This research presented an instructional design (ID) model positioned in intersection between the positioning-based and resource-based theories and used a multi-disciplinary approach to extend the literature on ID models with the aim to offer measurable improvements in job-specific knowledge and productive behaviour as proxies for sustainable competitive advantage. The research confirmed the contribution of the ID model in this regard and described and substantiated the pivotal link between training and ID models and the application thereof in practice to aid organisations and, by extension, countries, in the achievement and sustainability of competitive advantage. This, the first of two articles, presents not only the theoretical and practical context of the research, but also the development of a revised and advanced ID model. In the second article the ID model will be subjected to empirical investigation and evaluated through the application thereof in a case organisation and a grounded conclusion provided.

J	Mauboussin, MJ				Mauboussin, Michael J.			Surge in the Urge to Merge: M&A Trends and Analysis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								If history is any guide, we may be at the front end of another mergers and acquisition (M& A) wave. M&A activity tends to follow the stock market with a modest lag. The strong rally in equities off the March 2009 lows, combined with improved credit conditions, solid nonfinancial corporate balance sheets, and the presence of companies seeking to enhance their strategic positions, all point to more deals. Notably, research shows that companies making acquisitions in the early part of the cycle deliver better returns to their shareholders, on average, than those that act toward the end of the cycle. This is largely because early in the cycle there are more companies to choose from and the targets are cheap. As the cycle matures, options dissolve and valuations rise. Despite the importance of M&A, many companies and investors do not have a firm grasp of how M&A deals create or destroy shareholder value. In fact, research shows that roughly two-thirds of M&A transactions destroy shareholder value for the acquiring companies. Executives appear to miss the mark because they focus on accounting-based measures instead of considering the extent to which the value of synergies can exceed the premium. This paper provides a sound approach to evaluating M&A deals based on expected returns on invested capital and economic value added.

J	Adebanjo, D				Adebanjo, Dotun			E-procurement in digitally clustered organisations: an analysis of sustainability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Business models; e-clusters; e-procurement; UK; supply chains; food industry	SECTOR	This paper examines the sustainability of e-cluster applications used within the context of e-procurement in order to analyse business models and identify factors important for viability of 'digital proximity' e-marketplaces. Survey-based functionality value analysis was used to examine development and operational costs, while workshops identified preferences of potential e-cluster members. The study identified two business models - subscription and pay-per-use. Analysis indicated that the pay-per-use model had more variable cashflow but had the potential for higher cost benefit particularly when aggregated procurement is adopted. The findings suggest that e-cluster management organisations have to be strategic in their deployment. The findings also suggested that e-cluster members preferred to pay for e-cluster sustainability through subscriptions rather than through advertising. In addition, the study indicated a lack of consensus with regards to the value attached to various functionalities of e-clusters and the sourcing of initial funding for the development of the e-cluster application.

The analysis is compromised of 28 institutional buildings covering civil and structural work, electrical and mechanical systems, and safety access. It evaluates maintenance effectiveness, benchmarks the facility management, compares it to well known international institutions, and recommends measures required to improve its performance. Four perspectives of the balanced scorecard were utilized in this research; financial; internal business; growth; and customer satisfaction. Results show that the facility management lacks an effective strategic plan. The rating of the facility according to the balanced score card against average facility condition is Good to Fair in all areas but one rating Poor. It also showed a gap between APPA "The Association of Higher Education Facilities Officers" guidelines and the current facility on the deferred maintenance.

S	Anderson, E		Sanchez, R; Heene, A		Anderson, Evelyn			TOYOTA'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: PATH DEPENDENCY, DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES, AND SOURCES OF INIMITABILITY - A CONTRASTIVE STUDY WITH NISSAN	ENHANCING COMPETENCES FOR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE	Advances in Applied Business Strategy		English	Article; Book Chapter							MANAGEMENT	Journal articles and books on Toyota's competitive advantage abound. More recent analyses tended to focus on Toyota alone (Coriat, 2000; Liker, 2004) while earlier literature examined the competitive advantage of the Japanese automobile industry as a whole (Asanuma, 1989; Womack, Jones, & Roos, 1990; Fruin, 1992; Dyer, 1994, 1996a, 1996b). Intensive analysis on the Toyota Production System (TPS) notwithstanding, what exactly constitutes the system's inimitability remains elusive. This paper contributes to existing literature by examining how a post-war industrial policy might have given rise to Toyota and Nissan adopting two different strategic logics (or governance structures) as each had a unique set of resources and competences. Different governance structures however, did not appear to contribute to inter-firm performance variance between the two competitors for at least 15 years. What then could be the source of Toyota's competitive advantage and its inimitability? This paper unravels how causal ambiguity might have confounded Nissan, Toyota's only significant domestic rival for the second half of the last century.

Design/methodology/approach - A descriptive approach was taken which looks at the strategic management that has guided the evolution of Federation Square from initial inception to its realisation as a key public space in Melbourne. Findings - Federation Square has become a place for residents and visitors alike. It is now a place where community gathers, and enormous attention is given to staying in touch with the sentiment of the community. This has been achieved through effective strategic management, which has encouraged the community to play the part of creative leaders through the use of a number of key tactics. Originality/value - Federation Square has become a successful place thanks to the involvement of the community - the management of the square presents a model which other similar schemes could replicate/take pointers from.

J	Campbell, A; Renshaw, P; Engstrom, S				Campbell, Andrew; Renshaw, Phil; Engstrom, Staffan			The black and white and grey of strategy	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Strategic planning; Employee involvement; Organizations		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the process of strategy execution when strategy is changing. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents studies of two companies - Unilever and Carillion - which appear to have found a solution to the generic problem - to understand the process of strategy execution when strategy is changing. The broader research involved examining the strategic planning processes of more than 20 large companies. Findings - The paper gives two example solutions to a common strategy problem. The gap that often emerges between the desired strategy and the enacted strategy. The general message is that planners need to design a process that enables top managers to give strategic guidance about "grey areas" at a level of detail that matches the complexity of the products and markets in which the company competes. For many companies, this is a much lower level of detail than they are used to handling in their strategic planning processes. Research limitations/implications - A drawback is the limited number of case studies. However, the main conclusions are tautological. Practical implications - Top managers need to be much more involved in executing new strategies. By predicting where lower level managers are likely to lose focus, top managers can intervene to ensure that the strategy is followed through. Social implications - There are implications for decentralisation and empowerment. Leaders need to recognise that they should intervene in some decisions some of the time in order to correct natural biases that may derail their strategic ambitions. Originality/value - This lies in a focus on strategy execution and the role of top executives in execution.

MARKET COMPETITION FOR HIGH-DENSITY RESIDENTIAL LAND	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						High-density residential land; Condominium development; Apartment development; Construction market; Undeveloped land	REAL-ESTATE; SPACE	We investigate the potential competition between multifamily and condominium developers for raw land throughout the U. S. When considering the entire sample period, we find evidence that condominium developers paid, on average, more for land than their multifamily counterparts. Alternatively, when we separate the sample into low versus high-growth locations and two time subperiods, we observe that the premium is not entirely consistent. The average premiums appear to be largely a result of the high-growth locations from 2004 to mid-2008. Indeed, the results demonstrate that condominium developers paid over 60 percent more for land in high-growth states during the later subperiod. This extraordinary premium calls into question the price formation process in these locations.

J	Farina, V				Farina, Vincenzo			Strategizing in investment banking network	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Investments; Banking; Information networks; Strategic management; Business performance		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how network position can influence performance of firms and how firm-specific characteristics can mediate this relation by asking: "Does network position influence performance of its members?" and "How could specialization choices influence this network position-performance relation?" Design/methodology/approach - These aspects are examined by studying network position and specialization of actors operating in the investment banking industry in the Euro area, using data on all 279 underwriting syndicates formed during the years 2003-2005. Data were pooled across actors and across these three years and the resulting sample had a total of 534 observations. Findings - Results highlight that actors operating in the investment banking industry enhance performance by having a central position in their network and that specialization reduces the benefits of having a central position in the network. Practical implications - The findings suggest that managers need to assess a firm's ability to get knowledge and information from its external environment in order to make adjustments based on firm alliance portfolios. Originality/value - This paper uniquely contributes to the strategic management literature showing that the effect of a particular network position on performance depends on firm-level characteristics.

J	Frisanco, T				Frisanco, Thomas			Modelling telecommunications network cost reductions by resource sharing-infrastructure sharing, regionalization, centralization, out-tasking, outsourcing, and managed services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						network operation; network infrastructure sharing; managed services; out-tasking; outsourcing		Currently, a trend of emerging market "regional champion" telecommunications network operators to spread operations across multiple countries can be observed. Consolidation of such operations becomes mission-critical in order to provide consistently high service levels in a cost-efficient manner. This leads to an increased demand for innovative, cross-country delivery platforms for network operations. Apart from the obvious technical issues, also strategic and economic aspects need to be taken into account when determining the optimal, resource-sharing re-design of network operations processes. Both in-house and outsourcing alternatives should be included in such an evaluation. This paper presents the technical approaches and the strategic and economic impacts of regionalization, centralization and outsourcing of mobile network operations processes. It introduces a quantitative model for assessing economic impacts using both a top-down and a bottom-up approach, applied to a real-world case of a MEA cross-country operator.

J	Haase, H; Franco, M				Haase, Heiko; Franco, Mario			Learning alliances, corporate entrepreneurship and business performance: is there really a linkage?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						corporate entrepreneurship; learning alliances; business performance; small and medium-sized enterprises; knowledge acquisition; absorptive capacity; Portugal		In this study, we investigate how learning alliances affect corporate entrepreneurship. Then, we also analyse the influence of both learning alliances and corporate entrepreneurship on business performance. In order to achieve this objective, we adopt a quantitative research approach in a cross-sectional study of 80 Portuguese small and medium-sized enterprises. For the influence of learning alliances on business performance, the impact of knowledge acquisition and absorptive capacity is mixed. When including corporate entrepreneurship, proactiveness is the decisive variable in all performance measures. Taken together, we must question that strategic learning alliances perse create value in corporate entrepreneurship and performance. In addition, we conclude that the regional economic environment matters. Several implications are presented.

J	Hai, HL; Sung, WL				Hai, Hui-Lin; Sung, Wen-Lung			Assessing the green competitive strategy of enterprises in Taiwan under the Gore effect	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES			English	Article						SWOT; Gore effect; DEA		SWOT analysis is an established strategic planning methodology for identifying an organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats before formulating the enterprise strategy. This paper proposes a new quantified SWOT analytic method incorporated with the vote-ranking method. The indices of SWOT will be voted, weighted and quantified to rank competitive strategies, using the total weighted scores method for obtaining the best strategy alternatives. In this research, the competitive strategies adopted by enterprises in Taiwan under the "Gore Effect" are taken as a case study, in which 25 senior managers are selected to form a decision task force. The proposed quantified SWOT analytic method is then employed to evaluate the competitive strategies in the case study, and to suggest a feasible policy to be adopted.

The research will present approach of objectives and environmental management metrics involvement (proposed by literature review) in conventional BSC in "Ad Barska plovidba" organisation. Further we will test creation of ECO-BSC model based on business activities of non-profit organisations in order to improve environmental management system in parallel with other systems of management. Using this approach we may obtain 4 models of BSC that includes elements of environmental management system for AD "Barska plovidba". Taking into account that implementation and evaluation need long period of time in AD "Barska plovidba", the final choice will be based on 14598 (Information technology - Software product evaluation) and ISO 9126 (Software engineering - Product quality) using AHP method. Those standards are usually used for evaluation of quality software product and computer programs that serve in organisation as support and factors for development. So, AHP model will be based on evolution criteria based on suggestion of ISO 9126 standards and types of evaluation from two evaluation teams. Members of team & will be experts in BSC and environmental management system that are not employed in AD "Barska Plovidba" organisation. The members of team 2 will be managers of AD "Barska Plovidba" organisation (including managers from environmental department). Merging results based on previously created two AHP models, one can obtain the most appropriate BSC that includes elements of environmental management system. The chosen model will present at the same time suggestion for approach choice including ecological metrics in conventional BSC model for firm that has at least one ECO strategic orientation.

Then it sets up the "analysis framework of negotiation strategies" between the manufacturer and the distributor based on an analysis of the respective conditions, advantages, and disadvantages of the manufacturer and distributor. Thirdly, this study sets up a reward matrix of the strategy action game between the manufacturer and the distributor. Then establishes a set of feasible "negotiation models" based on the reward matrix of the strategy game between the both parties to observe how the manufacturer and the distributor make their own bargaining decisions in the situation of information asymmetry or exterior opportunity/threat. Finally, this study establishes a "multi-agent strategy game protocol system model" to solve the conflict resulting from the self-strategizing of both parties for their own interests, and to achieve the utmost efficiency in the negotiation.

And application methods include decision tree and artificial neural network, etc. Nevertheless, instead of relying on methods in the past, this research adopts genetic programming planning to conduct domestic stock market investment strategy researches. This thesis takes three approaches in strategic sense respectively: Call, put and hold. First of all, it collects daily information and relevant factors which could influence the stock price one day ahead of the actual trading for China Steel stocks. These factors include aspects in the stock's fundamental, share volume, technical performance in addition to Dow Jones average plus processing these information and subsequent normalization. Lastly, genetic programming planning is applied to construct investment model accordingly, in addition to conducting comparison analyses regarding the investment strategy classification capabilities for the decision tree modelling. From the end results of validity in classification accuracy for these two models, the findings of this research indicate that genetic programming planning is the better and preferred model in the sense of classification capability when comparing to that of decision tree model.

Specifically, the objective of this paper is to examine the extent to which organizations are adopting financial and non-financial measures and to determine the effect of SPMS design on organisational competitive advantage. The main research question of this study is - Does the adoption of SPMS that consists of financial and non-financial measures lead to enhanced organisation competitive advantage? This paper reports on the results of SPMS design and competitive advantage. The data was collected using a mail survey to top management of listed companies in Malaysia. The results indicate that the Malaysian companies in the sample adopted both financial and non-financial measures. The study also found that the relationship between SPMS design and competitive advantage was positive and significant. However, for the relationship of each dimension of SPMS and competitive advantage, only non-financial measures had a significant association with competitive advantage, while financial measures had an insignificant positive contribution to competitive advantage.

An Experimental Study of Executive Decision-Making With Implications for Decision Support	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						adaptive thinking; bounded rationality; business intelligence; cognitive modeling; decision-making; decision support systems; innovativeness; policy-capturing; risk-taking propensity	POLICY-CAPTURING APPROACH; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; COGNITIVE FEEDBACK; FUZZY MEASURES; RISK-TAKING; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; MODEL; PERFORMANCE	Past research in the field of information systems has explored factors and conditions that are relevant to decision-making in many contexts. However, very little is known about how executives consider, weigh, and integrate these factors. One current school of thought holds that intuition and instincts can play a significant role and that when decision-makers use their instincts, they rely on only a relatively small subset of the cues available to them. This has implications for designing and improving decision support systems, which form a major and widespread element of modern organizational computing. We examine the decision-making policies of professional decision-makers. High-level information technology executives were asked to evaluate the likelihood of making a strategic investment in the face of varying environmental scenarios. Using policy-capturing methodology, we find differences between what the executives thought was important to their decision-making and what is revealed as actually being important. In addition, we find that personal characteristics of risk-taking propensity and innovativeness affect the way the decision-makers integrate information. We argue that the idiosyncratic nature of the executive-environment relationship calls for increased emphasis on developing suitably adapted decision support systems (e.g., business intelligence systems) for executive decision-making.

J	Paprika, ZZ				Paprika, Zita Zoltay			Rational and Intuitive Patterns in Different Management Cultures	JOURNAL OF DECISION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Analytical Thinking; Intuition; Management Skills; Decision Making		Strategic decision making is usually conducted by a firm's top management, led by the CEO or the President of the company. In keeping with this, 40 top level managers from two continents (North America and Europe) were targeted in a comparative research study. In the two countries (California US and Hungary), twelve of the managers were CEOs, Presidents, Vice Presidents or Chief Officers (hereafter referred to as Executives) while eight were founders and majority owners of their own enterprises (hereafter referred to as Entrepreneurs). The research focused on the following 3 areas: 1) How top level managers really make strategic decisions in these two different parts of the world; 2) How Entrepreneurs and Executives differ, if at all, in their approach to strategic decision making when they combine analytical thinking with their intuition; 3) The similarities and differences in management skills and decision making practices between Entrepreneurs and Executives within the investigated management cultures.

J	Robards, B				Robards, Brady			Negotiating identity and integrity on social network sites for educators	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY			English	Article						audience segregation; identity; integrity; social network sites; youth		Discussion around the use of social network sites, especially amongst young people, is pervaded by sentiments heralding the decline of privacy. In this context, it is important for scholarship in this area to attend to the array of ways in which individuals are managing their information and identity-projects in these spaces in highly strategic ways, such as audience segregation. Drawing in part on empirical data collected through an ethnography of young Australian users of MySpace and Facebook, this article seeks to draw out the tension between authenticity and integrity that operates in these spaces. In doing so, I suggest that educators must be especially cognisant of the complexity occurring in the strategic management of these spaces, given the ongoing push for universities and agents within the university to engage with these spaces, along with the tension such engagement can bring to the teacher-student relationship.

J	Safon, V				Safon, Vicente			Promotion of service industries by means of entry restriction: the case of operators in the slot machine industry	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						market regulation; entry restriction; gaming industry; firm performance; Spain	RISK-RETURN PARADOX; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; ECONOMIC REGULATION; TAXI INDUSTRY; COMPETITION; DEREGULATION; EARNINGS	This article examines the effects of government policy on entry restriction for firms within a specific market of the Spanish gambling industry. Spain is an ideal economic region for studying this topic, as it allows for the analysis of quasi-identical populations exposed to different regulatory regimes. In Spain, gaming legislation is determined at the autonomous community level (state level), where differences across states within a single country are of particular interest. This paper analyses the performance of slot machine operators in three autonomous communities, each with different policies with regard to entry restriction. Fifty-eight firms were analysed using multiple regression, and we have concluded that, if prices are controlled, entry restriction may also have positive effects on its incumbents. The results are particularly interesting for countries or states within nations that are considering an increase or reduction in market regulation and who wish to predict the outcomes of these markets for operators.

RESISTANCE TO ORGANISATIONAL CHANGE: A CASE STUDY IN SRI LANKAN CONSTRUCTION ORGANISATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Organisational Change; Resistance to Change; Case study research		Organisations frequently need to introduce changes in anticipation of future problems. Though a change process may be vital there often will be resistance to change processes from the individuals and organisations. Even though resistance to change is common, change initiators generally do not consider managing it effectively in order to make their efforts a success. Poorly managed resistance can wreck an organisation. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the nature of resistance when implementing a strategic level change in construction organisations of Sri Lanka. Case study approach was used to investigate the research question. A construction organisation that recently implemented change at strategic level was selected to study the nature of resistance. Data collection techniques were semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant-observation. The primary data were analysed by using content analysis and cognitive mapping techniques. The case study findings revealed significant reasons for the resistance to change in construction organisations and how these were handled in the case study organisation. The results and findings reported from this study will enable construction organisations to understand the nature of resistance and manage it effectively for successful strategic change implementation.

Intelligence-led mitigation is a management philosophy and business process to proactively guide strategic, operational, and tactical decisions for mitigating the effects of intentional, accidental, and natural incidents. There is currently a gap in the intelligence products needed by public safety and emergency service organizations to support their resource decisions, and the quantity and quality of intelligence products they are receiving. This breach between producer and consumer exists across the country and at all levels of government. The intelligence-led mitigation model was designed to demonstrate how the existing principles and processes of intelligence-led policing can be applied to a broader set of incidents, incident phases, and stakeholders in order to effectively and efficiently fill this critical intelligence gap.

Technopreneurial competence and its relationship with social and environmental factors: an empirical study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						technopreneur competence; social factors; external environmental factors; technopreneur background; population ecology approach; strategic choice approach; business environment; India		In this work, we find a synergy between two highly acclaimed approaches of entrepreneurship theory, i.e., population ecology approach and strategic choice approach, and thus its focus is on 'situation-person context' of the entrepreneurial process. With the help of empirical research on a sample ICT technopreneur of India, the relationship between various 'social and environmental factors' as perceived by the technopreneur to their `technopreneurial competence' measured with the help of a self rating questionnaire (SRQ) propounded by McClelland (1973) have been explored. The findings suggest that there is a statistically significant difference between perceptions of technopreneurs towards the role of a few of the social factors, as their level of technopreneurial competence differs. However, the same do not show any significant difference towards the role of external environmental factors such as technological factors, political factors and so on. This paper with unique 'situation-person context' dimension will provide key insights for entrepreneurship educator to deal with these factors, especially while dealing with the emerging technopreneur.

J	Trombetta, B				Trombetta, Bill			Category captain management: an idea whose time has come in the pharmaceutical industry?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND HEALTHCARE MARKETING			English	Article						Pharmaceuticals industry; Relationship marketing; Health services sector; Marketing strategy; Regulation		Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to explore the degree to which the drug industry is changing from a product orientation to a more strategic category captain management (CCM) approach. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on secondary research sources. Findings - The paper shows that the drug industry is starting to move toward a more strategic approach to partner with downstream customers as opposed to a sales-oriented approach. Practical implications - The paper suggests that there is another fundamental way to compete for the drug industry, more as partners than just suppliers. Social implications - There are significant social implications. The drug industry has been battered for serious faults regarding regulatory issues. The industry has come under scrutiny for questionable marketing conduct. By providing more than just physical product and hard sell tactics, CCM can serve as an alternative model for the drug industry to compete. Originality/value - The paper is unique in that timing is ripe for this kind of analysis. To the best of the author's knowledge, there is no research to date on the issue of substantial ways that the pharmaceutical industry can change its business model.

J	Urban, B				Urban, Boris			TECHNOLOGY AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION AT THE ORGANISATIONAL LEVEL IN THE JOHANNESBURG AREA	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Entrepreneurship; technology; environment; hostility; dynamism	FIRM PERFORMANCE; DEVELOPING-COUNTRY; INNOVATION; STRATEGY; GROWTH; INTRAPRENEURSHIP; CAPABILITIES; DIMENSIONS; MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCT	Orientation: The 21st century is tilting towards an economy that is primarily driven by technology and knowledge, where entrepreneurs have to recognise and anticipate high-technology opportunities so as to join the ranks of future entrepreneurial leaders. Research purpose: This study examines entrepreneurship and its relation with technology, which is often conceptualised as entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and technology orientation (TO). The study is further contextualised by measuring environmental dynamism and hostility. Motivation for the study: Despite the weight of positive empirical findings and observations that EO and TO are strategic imperatives, there is a danger that firms in Africa are lagging behind and subsequently a study of this nature aids in understanding these imperatives. Research design, approach and method: A survey is used to collect data from a population of diverse businesses in the Johannesburg area (n = 1600), yielding a sample of 236 firms. Instruments were subjected to principal component factor analysis and descriptive statistics were calculated. The hypotheses were tested using correlational analysis, with their significance reported in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients. Main finding: Findings reveal significant correlations between EO and environment hostility and dynamism, but not between EO and TO. Practical and managerial implications: The study offers some solutions towards understanding how TO and EO may promote firm innovation, which encourages the diffusion, adoption and application of the very latest technologies. This is particularly relevant in cases where a lot of potential exists in developing countries to 'import and adapt' technologies developed in industrialised countries. Contribution of study: Research on firm innovation in the African context may be considered valuable, as very few empirical studies that have been conducted previously focus on innovation and technology in the context of an emerging country.

Design/methodology/approach-A discourse approach is employed within the contextualization of the role of the South African higher education institution (HEI) in addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Findings-The focus of wellness is rapidly becoming part of any corporate landscape and institutions of HE are an integral part of this landscape. Significant gains have been made in the implementation of creative and innovative HIV/AIDS workplace programmes in South Africa's HEI's at the individual, group, family, and at local community level. Research limitations/implications-All HEIs are currently aligning their HIV/AIDS policies with the National HIV/AIDS sector policy framework. Further research is thus needed on HIV/AIDS where this aspect forms part of a strategic and holistic approach to employee wellness. Practical implications-Mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS within the institution and the realignment of other allied institutional HIV/AIDS policies together with the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation tool with relevant indicators to gauge the level of responsiveness of institutions. dOriginality/value-This study is the first that seeks to ascertain the level of importance of employee wellness in South Africa's HE sector. Therefore, this study sets an important benchmark for further research in the area.

J	Ting, Z; Ling, GJ; Leng, BJ				Zhou Ting; Ling Guijun; Leng Bojun			Important export skills comparison in different export stage An empirical study of Chinese firms	JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN TRADE STUDIES			English	Article						International business; International marketing; China; Exports; Organizational skills	INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS; BUSINESS EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to build a theoretical framework that identifies the important skills for successful export from different business areas and make an empirical ranking of their importance. Design/methodology/approach - A survey containing 88 practical export skills, selected from the existing literature, was sent to 800 Chinese exporting companies in major Eastern regions of China. With the factor analysis, eight skill categories were identified and 56 skills were found more important. Findings - The results of the study show that in the higher export stage, skills in international marketing and international trade logistics were viewed as being more important. However, a firm in an early export stage showed more concerns on international trade policy and regulations, international finance and international trade research. Firms with rich export experience viewed strategic management in international trade as being more important than those with less export experience. International payment terms were considered to be very important by firms across all export stages. However, only these firms which were exploring the availability of export business viewed international trade practice as being somewhat important. Research limitations/implications - First, the export skills pool should be extended and examined according to the firms' characteristics. Second, the study is cross-sectional and there should be specific analysis of different exporting firms. Third, supplement of the study with more samples from other regions should provide more generalizable implications. Finally, another future work should be to examine how export skills affect financial performance of those Chinese exporting firms. Practical implications - This paper can serve as useful information for the exporting firms to improve their existing skill training programs. The skills importance rankings can also be used to guide the resource allocations. Originality/value - This study builds a theoretical framework that identifies the important skills for successful export from different business areas and makes an empirical ranking of their importance based on the data of Chinese exporting firms.

LEGAL CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES FOR COMPARISON SHOPPING AND DATA REUSE	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH			English	Article						comparison shopping; data strategy; data reuse; database protection; innovation	PRICE DISPERSION; INFORMATION; WEB; PROTECTION	New technologies have been continuously emerging to enable effective reuse of an ever-growing amount of data on the Web. Innovative firms can leverage the available technologies and data to provide useful services. Comparison-shopping services are an example of reusing existing data to make bargain-finding easier. Certain reuses have caused conflicts with the firms whose data has been reused. Countries in the European Union have implemented the Database Directive to provide legal protection for database creators, but the impact and the interpretation of the new law are unclear and still evolving. Lawmakers in the U. S. have not decided on a policy concerning database protection and data reuse. Both data creating and data reusing firms need to develop strategies to operate effectively in this uncertain environment. Comparison-shopping and other data reuse services face similar legal and strategic challenges. Thus we address these challenges in the broader data reuse context. We use economic reasoning to formulate strategies in anticipation of the likely policy choices and interpretations of existing legislation. Both data creating firms and data reusing firms should focus on innovative ways of using or reusing data to create differentiated products and services. For firms that gather data from multiple sources, they can also use the insights gained from integrated data to provide other value-added services.

Solutions for conflicts between variant product strategies and their performance evaluation	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product strategies; project management; critical success factors (CSFs); performance evaluation	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; NETWORK COMPETENCE; DETERMINANTS; COMPANIES; FIRMS	Although lots of recent publications address customer management and supply chain management within production networks, critical success factors (CSFs) of new product development (NPD) still have no one solution. In addition, most firms also suffer from the inconsistency between strategic objectives (newly emerging strategies) and final performance (implementing the current strategy). In order to solve the aforementioned problems, the paper first discusses CSFs of NPD within production network, and then finds that CSFs are different between strategic objectives and performance indicators. Basically, the difference is larger in radical product strategies because their composite are more complicated and dynamic, but smaller in incremental product strategies. Accordingly, in order to solve the inconsistency for all product strategies, firms are suggested to adopt the model consisting of two sets of casual analysis to timely cascade strategic formation process with extracted CSFs, and then extracted CSFs with performance evaluation indices.

Maintaining the Competitiveness of the American Fisheries Society Journals: An Assessment Based on Influence and Cost-Effectiveness	FISHERIES			English	Article							OPEN-ACCESS; MARINE; SCIENCE	Recent changes in the landscape of scientific publishing prompted the Publications Overview Committee of the American Fisheries Society (AFS) to review the Society's portfolio of scientific journals. We evaluated journals based on metrics in two categories: (1) citation-based measures of the influence of a journal on the scientific literature, and (2) measures of the cost-effectiveness of a journal (citation rate adjusted for subscription cost). Over the long-term, we found that ecology journals had far stronger citation-based influence than fisheries and aquatic sciences journals, and that journals publishing primarily basic research had stronger influence than journals publishing applied research (including four AFS journals and Fisheries magazine). In evaluating the current status of fisheries and aquatic sciences journals, we found that metrics of influence and cost-effectiveness provided considerably different portrayals of journals relative to their peers. In terms of citation-based influence, we found that the AFS journal Transactions of the American Fisheries Society (TAFS) and Fisheries magazine were competitive with highly regarded peer fisheries journals, but that North American Journal of Aquaculture (NAJA) and Journal of Aquatic Animal Health (JAAH) were less influential than their peers. The citation-based influence of North American Journal of Fisheries Management (NAJFM) was intermediate between TAFS/Fisheries and NAJA/JAAH. For journals like NAJFM and NAJA, we expect that much of the scientific influence on policy and management is not captured by citations in the primary literature, and alternative methods of evaluation may be needed. All of the AFS journals ranked highly with regard to cost-effectiveness because their subscription costs are low, and these rankings are in accordance with membership needs and the strategic mission of AFS to provide broad and timely dissemination of scientific information. We conclude by suggesting ways to increase the influence of AFS journals without compromising their accessibility and affordability, and offer advice about methods and frequency for future journal evaluations.

J	Kennedy, ML; Stergiosy, M				Kennedy, Mary; Stergiosy, Malgorzata			How to Tie Everyday Work to Strategy	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Collective intelligence; strategy management; opportunity management; prediction markets; information professionals		The paper describes how Harvard Business School's Knowledge and Library Services (KLS) leveraged the collective knowledge of its employees in formulating, implementing, and evaluating strategy. The organisation was faced with major, disruptive changes in its environment and needed the diverse knowledge and full engagement of all employees to make a series of strategic shifts. The shifts included integrating KLS products and services with the Harvard Business School research and course development process, developing global scope in information resources and expertise, and trading its role as the guardian of books and buildings for the organiser of the School's priority information assets. In order to achieve that, KLS launched the Environmental Scan Program, relying on employees' insights aggregated through social tagging, trend analysis and internal prediction markets tracking emerging trends. KLS also created processes for the collective assessment of strategy and a faster way of turning ideas into new products and services. The paper concludes with an assessment of the approach, pointing to a difficult balance between emergent and collective dimensions of strategy process with its formal, structured facets.

J	Li, JY; Liu, YM; Tian, GQ				Li, Jingyuan; Liu, Yongming; Tian, Guoqiang			A reputation strategic model of monetary policy in continuous-time	JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS			English	Article						Monetary policy; Time consistency problem; Reputation; Continuous model	RULES	This paper develops a reputation strategic model of monetary policy with a continuous finite or infinite time horizon. By using the optimal stopping theory and introducing the notions of sequentially weak and strong rational expectation equilibria, we show that the time inconsistency problem may be solved with trigger reputation strategies not only for stochastic but also for non-stochastic settings even with a finite horizon. We show the existence of stationary sequentially strong rational expectation equilibrium under some condition, and there always exists a stationary sequentially weak rational expectation equilibrium. Moreover, we investigate the robustness of the sequentially strong rational expectation equilibrium behavior solution by showing that the imposed assumption is reasonable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

J	Delgado, RI; Langabeer, JR				Delgado, Rigoberto I.; Langabeer, James R., II			Strategic Performance Evaluation in Cancer Centers	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							HOSPITAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE	Most research in healthcare strategy has focused on formulating or implementing organizational plans and strategies, and little attention has been dedicated to the post-implementation control and evaluation of strategy, which we contend is the most critical aspect of achieving organizational goals. The objective of this study was to identify strategic control approaches used by major cancer centers in the country and to relate these practices to financial performance. Our intent was to expand the theory and practice of healthcare strategy to focused services, such as oncology. We designed a 17-question survey to capture elements of strategy and performance from our study sample, which comprised major cancer hospitals in the United States and shared similar mandates and resource constraints. The results suggest that high-performing cancer centers use more sophisticated analytical approaches, invest greater financial resources in performance analysis, and conduct more frequent performance reviews than do low-performing organizations. Our conclusions point to the need for a more robust approach to strategic assessment. In this article, we offer a number of recommendations for management to achieve strategic plans and goals on the basis of our research. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to concentrate on the area of strategic control.

J	Frost, N				Frost, Nick			Leading children's services: some contemporary issues and challenges	JOURNAL OF CHILDRENS SERVICES			English	Article						children; children's services; leadership; management; policy		This article explores some of the contemporary challenges facing leaders of children's services. Using the theoretical framework of the 'incomplete leader' developed by Ancona and colleagues (2007), the article reflects on the many challenges facing children's service leaders. It argues that a distributed and connected model of leadership is the best available in the current climate of change and challenge. This model contradicts the current one of embodied, individualised leadership contained in the England and Wales Children Act 2004. The article argues that the key leadership skills are about making sense of change, relating to people, creating a vision and developing new ways of working. The article utilises Government policy documents such as the Children's Plan and Care Matters, workforce issues and strategic planning to illustrate the nature of the leadership challenge. It concludes by suggesting a way forward for children's services leadership in integrated settings, in the current climate of audit and managerialisnn.

J	Rosique, R				Rosique, Ricard			Do we need electronic support for pathways: the Spanish experience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARE COORDINATION			English	Article								Care pathways are excellent tools for quality management in health care concerning the standardization of care processes, as they promote organized and efficient patient care established on evidence-based practice. The implementation of a care pathway project at any health-care setting means a change of the organizational culture. E-pathways (electronic pathways) are strategic resources in order to get the successful implementation of a care pathway project. The concept of e-pathway is recent enough and there are some different experiences worldwide. In 2000, the first electronic pathways were implemented at Hospital de Mataro, in Barcelona, Spain. The benefits of using e-pathways (Eira Healthcare Server) are very clear at Hospital de Mataro: immediate records with no transcriptions, information in the palm of your hand, no prints, and rigour and reliability. Another recent and interesting experience is the development and introduction of e-pathways at Hospital General de l'Hospitalet, in Barcelona, Spain, using an SAP integrated health-care solution. The strategy planning of hospital managers should take into account the need and priority of any pathway project linked to e-pathways. Some experiences in Spain have proven that we do really need electronic support for pathways. Electronic pathways are a basic support and should not be postponed when implementing care pathways.

J	Yang, L; Song, ML				Yang, Li; Song, Malin			Formation Mechanism of Green Strategic Alliances and Its Cooperative System for CoalMining Eco-Industrial Parks Based on Synthetic Decision Support System	JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS			English	Article						coal-mining eco-industrial park; green effect; strategic alliance; synthetic decision support system		Green effect is a phenomenon by which manufacturers apply themselves to environmental protection to obtain comparative advantages compared to their counterparts. Modern enterprises can form profitable green effect by greening of infrastructures, brands, marketing and culture, which contribute its development trend. Manufacturers of coal-mining eco-industrial parks should be in line with the government to strengthen propaganda about environmental protection, to advocate green and civilized consumption and to enhance the proportion of environmentalists in consumers; to increase their own propaganda; national authorities should also set up and implement green label system to allow manufacturers of coal-mining eco-industrial parks use these labels in their own products to facilitate the effective recognition of consumers. It is an effective way to access to their green effect and to achieve stability after the formation of green union by making green alliance parties gain the largest rents from the alliances which they are all likely to participate in. then it sets out from discussion on appraisive system, monitoring system and examinatorial system of green strategic alliances, presenting a new settlement including the step-up close design of green strategic alliances based on 5E ideology. It establishes a cooperative system of green strategic alliances deducing from appraisive system founded on three-dimensional combinatorial model, monitoring system grounded on SDSS and examinatorial system fixed on BP Neural Network, which provides necessary system info for green strategic alliances. The improvement of efficiency, sustainable economic development mode, environmental improvement involved with ecological civilization, regional equilibrium of harmoniously developmental manner and continuously reformative educational system (5E) are the inherent system which promote green strategic alliances jointly.

J	Cejudo, GM; Solis, DZ				Cejudo, Guillermo M.; Zabaleta Solis, Dionisio			Quality of Government: a Definition Based on Attributes of the Exercise of Power	REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA			Spanish	Article						Governance; Quality; Political Power; Democracy; Political Analysis	ACCOUNTABILITY; GOVERNANCE	Scholarly research on the quality of government has created its own space in academic journals and in discussions within international organizations. In old and new democracies it has been clear that it is not enough to have mechanisms for access to power that are fair and effective; the way in which power is exercised mattersas well. Old debates on the size of State have given ground to discussion on the quality of government instruments. There are now multiple indicators to measure it, and based on them, there are studies that look into its components and its evolution over time, and that look for its causes and consequences. Yet, despite being at the center of multiple discussions, both theoretical and practical, the conceptual debate on the quality of government is scarce. This article puts forward a conceptual definition of the quality of government based on attributes of the exercise of power. in terms of institutional architecture-constitutional checks and balances and restrictions on the Executive's authority over the public bureaucracy-and management practices-financial, personnel, information and strategic management-that control the discretionary authority of governmental bureaus and agents. This definition is not only conceptually sounder that its alternatives, but also allows for more precise analyses and opens the door for practical implications that will not be generic recommendations derived from abstract principles, but specific interventions based on informed diagnoses.

J	Rashid, AQMB; Johnson, H; Clark, N				Rashid, A. Q. M. Bazlur; Johnson, Hazel; Clark, Norman			ODEL CAN ADDRESS THE REALITY-PROBLEMS OF AGRICULTURISTS' POST GRADUATION IN BANGLADESH	TURKISH ONLINE JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION			English	Article						ODEL; Post graduation; Agriculture; Bangladesh		A research project was carried out during 2007-08 at the Open University, UK to explore the suitable strategic policy & practices, and partnership possibilities for open, distance and e-learning (ODEL) programme for the postgraduate agricultural education in Bangladesh. The methodology followed was based on the searches on Internet, Journal articles, books, periodicals, brochures, proceedings, reports, attending lectures workshops, seminars, symposia, conferences, contacts, and visits to other Universities/Instition/ Organisations for case studies. Under the new millennium context resurgence of global interest in web-based Open, distance and e-learning (ODEL) has been proved to be potentially useful strategy for human development issues, particularly due to the evolution of fast-growing as well as net-working new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The study reveals that though ODEL has been found widely used in many reputed and world leading universities in UK for higher studies leading to degrees, diploma and certificates on arts, general & environmental sciences as well the commerce subjects, and trainings for professional developments etc. The application ODEL especially in higher agricultural education and training leading to MScs and PhDs is almost scanty except a few cases of Fisheries and Livestock, the two sections of Agriculture in the Universities like the University of Sterling, University of Edinburgh and the University of London (Royal Veterinary College) etc. But in cases of other major areas of Agricultural subjects such as the crop sciences including Agronomy, Soil science, Crop botany, Horticulture, Plant Pathology, Entomology, Genetics & PI. Breeding, Agric. Extension Education, Agric. Chemistry, Biochemistry, Agro forestry, Biotechnology, Seed Sci. & Techno. Farm Structure, Farm Power & Machinery, Irrigation & Water Management, Food Tech. & Rural Farm Industry, Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Finance, Agricultural Statistics, Ag. Cooperation & Ag. Marketing, Rural Development etc. the application of ODEL has not yet been found employed in anywhere except, a few recent endeavours under a limited scope in the Asian countries like India (IGNOU). ODEL extends the learning and self-development opportunities to those beyond the access to the conventional system due to professional, familial, economic, geographical etc. restrictions. The scenario is more acute especially in case of the applied science like Agriculture in Agriculture-dependent developing country like Bangladesh where the tool may be potential alternative to address the postgraduate agricultural education, the acute problem of a vast number of target group seeking higher studies. Bangladesh is one of the most thickly populated and agriculture dependent developing countries of the work), and Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) established in 1962 is only the premier seat of higher agricultural education and research in the country offering Masters and Doctoral degrees through the conventional face to face class room system. Since its establishment out of the total passed out bachelors (BSc Ag.) so far till July 2007 only 31.29% Masters and 0.64% PhDs have been produced. Bangladesh has recently been connected to the information super-highway through submarine cables. As a result, along with BTTB private companies already could ramify their ICT-based business orientations in different sectors like banking, transportation, administration etc. The use of computer and the long-ranged, portable electronic device with the telephone and the cell phone networks are widely used now a day. Under the circumstances, for better and progressive existence in the competitive global context it should be concentrated on its special attention to the ICT-based ODEL as a pragmatic focal issue with a view to transforming the ever increasing vast population potential into more productive force, so as to solve the higher agricultural education problems and ultimately towards greater awareness and appreciation leading to sustainable agricultural development and alleviating poverty in the country.The study evidences that there is an ample paradigm shift towards ODEL system in providing accessible postgraduate agricultural education in Bangladesh. On the basis of study on ODEL ongoing programmes at different Universities the following policy and practices have been recognised to be recommended to the concerned BAU authority. The course materials for the students must be bespoke, having been developed for the ODEL mode, and are not simply a course that provides material on the web. It ensures that the students enjoy the same high quality teaching environment and exposure to innovation as the students on campus-based courses. Development of adequate students' supports and facilities along with valid accreditation of their degrees. Development of highly skilled special academic as well as administrative expertise for the ODEL-based postgraduate in agricultural education programme. For high technology and innovation as well as need-based action researches, global partnership development programme should be initiated. Thus BAU can go even beyond the boundary of the country with its high quality ODEL, especially Asian countries and the South Asian neighbourhood in particular but requires a strong need for an international intervention in planting the 'ODEL seed' into the conventional system in Bangladesh.

J	Han, BS				Han, Byoung-Sop			Liabilities, Strategies and the Survival of Foreign Subsidiaries in an Emerging Market	JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE			English	Article						subsidiary; survival; exit; liability; strategy; China	INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES; CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; UNITED-STATES; ORGANIZATIONAL MORTALITY; PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS; EQUITY OWNERSHIP; BARGAINING POWER; ENTRY; FIRM; KNOWLEDGE	This article integrates liability theory and strategic management perspective and examines the effects of organizational characteristics and strategies on the survival of overseas subsidiaries in an emerging market. A relationship between liabilities, strategies and the survival of subsidiaries is theorized and an appropriate methodology, Cox regression, is presented as a means of examining the determinants of subsidiaries survival. Using a sample of 789 Korean manufacturing subsidiaries established in China over 1989-2003 (3,987 observations), the article finds the important main effects on subsidiary survival to be the liability of size and age, entry mode, and diversification. The findings demonstrate that wholly owned subsidiaries are more likely to survive than international joint ventures. Further, subsidiaries which remain in core product lines show a higher likelihood of survival than those diversifying into different product lines from parent firms. Concerning liabilities, the results suggest that subsidiaries of larger size and younger age are more likely to survive than those of smaller size and older age.

This management is not only necessary to organize the actual research efforts but also to identify communalities and necessities for the strategic planning of future research projects and development activities. The results of the research projects are usually new technologies that ought to be employed in the development of the Launcher Program. The proposed knowledge management system will not only enable assessing these new technologies but also help in defining and planning the research topics in each important area of this multidisciplinary program, according to the Institute's strategic goals and space mission.

J	Reina, D; Ensslin, SR; Gallon, AV; Reina, DRM				Reina, Donizete; Ensslin, Sandra Rolim; Gallon, Alessandra Vasconcelos; Reina, Diane Rossi Maximiano			An Investigation of scientific production on Intellectual Capital (IC) between 1996 and 2006 in Accounting forums and journals	REVISTA GESTAO ORGANIZACIONAL			Portuguese	Article						Intellectual Capital; Scientific Production; Bibliometrical Study; Mapping		The aim of this paper is to explore the scientific production on Intellectual Capital (IC) published by professionals in the Accounting field in the period between 1996 and 2006. To this end, the study - of a descriptive nature - carried out a bibliometrical investigation and a mapping of those publications selected in four different Brazilian journals and two forums. The study reviewed 57 (fifty-seven) papers obtaining as main results from the bibliometrical analysis: publication on IC started to grow from 2001; the greater part of the publications are concentrated in two forums - EnANPAD and Congresso USP de Controladoria e Contabilidade - and are predominantly empirical. As regards the main results obtained from the mapping, the following emerges: information is mainly addressed to internal users; the most discussed issues are: mensuration, evaluation, strategic alignment and IC management and accounting classification of IC; the most used models are those by Edvinsson & Malone, Nonaka & Takeuchi, Sveiby, Stewart and Brooking; suggestions for further research concentrates mainly on: inclusion of intangible assets in the mensuration, evaluation, accounting and disclosure of managerial reports; new avenues for discussion of IC issues; among other results.

J	Steyn, B; Everett, T				Steyn, B.; Everett, T.			Two managerial public relations roles in the South African context: findings of stage 3 of an international comparative study	COMMUNICARE-JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION SCIENCES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article								This article reports the findings of Stage 3 of an international collaborative research programme, its point of departure being that public relations (PR) roles researchers have largely ignored research in the management domain in their conceptualisation of the PR manager role. (The first qualitative stage was conducted in the US and UK, and the second, quantitative stage in the UK). In the third stage, the UK study was replicated in South Africa (SA) to map and compare the main elements of management performed by PR managers working globally in a range of organisational settings and in different cultural contexts (with a view to reconceptualising the PR manager role). While the UK research found five empirical PR roles, the final parsimonious 2-factor solution accepted in the SA study was labelled the strategic public relations manager (a strategic role at the macro or societal level), and the operational public relations manager (a functional role at the middle-management level).

J	Dogan, P				Dogan, Pinar			Vertical Networks, Integration, and Connectivity	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							COMPATIBILITY; COMPETITION	This paper studies competition in a network industry with a stylized two layered network structure, and examines: (i) price and connectivity incentives of the upstream networks, and (ii) incentives for vertical integration between an upstream network provider and a downstream firm. The main result of this paper is that vertical integration occurs only if the initial installed-base difference between the upstream networks is sufficiently small, and in that case, industry is configured with two vertically integrated networks, which yields highest incentives to invest in quality of interconnection. When the installed-base difference is sufficiently large, there is no integration in the industry, and neither of the firms have an incentive to invest in quality of interconnection. An industry configuration in which only the large network integrates and excludes (or raises cost of) its downstream rival does not appear as an equilibrium outcome: in the presence of a large asymmetry between the networks, when quality of interconnection is a strategic variable, the large network can exercise a substantial market power without vertical integration. Therefore, a vertically separated industry structure does not necessarily yield procompetitive outcomes.

TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL			English	Article								Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. (KKL), once a nonprofit government monopoly, was corporatized in 1998. Cost reduction and profit maximization became the new corporation's main goal. Located on an island off the main island of Taiwan, KKL sells over 90 percent of its produced liquor domestically. In order to restructure its distribution system, KKL is planning to establish the distribution centers (DCs) on the main island of Taiwan. This study aimed to provide the decision support from a quantitative aspect for KKL's strategic plan. The classic fixed-charge model was modified to take into consideration the inbound and outbound transportation costs of the DCs as well as the variable and fixed components of the DC facility costs. This study collected and estimated the relevant parameters in the model, and obtained the optimized solution. The results indicated that three DCs need to be established with a total system cost of NTD 110,786,400 per year.

We show that employers' associations and unions may exploit this legal framework to stabilize product market cartels. This new view on the institution of collective wage agreements provides an interesting insight for strategic management: A self-commitment on the labor market may greatly improve the product market situation. Moreover, it has an important implication for economic policy: Competition authorities should observe collective wage agreements for their potentially collusive effect on product markets.

We first study the formation and the performance of a JV when the partners' contribution has a different impact on the JV profits. Then, we check whether the JV is more likely as well as the welfare level improves when the decision on JV profit sharing among partners is delegated to an independent JV management (Management sharing) rather than jointly taken by partners (Coordinated sharing). We find that the firm whose effort has a higher impact on the JV's profits should have a larger profit share. Moreover, at least in some cases, Management sharing increases both welfare and the probability that the JV is formed.

J	Raich, M; Crepaz, MP				Raich, Margit; Crepaz, Marc-Philipp			Fitting new brand principles: First encounter at bank branches	JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						brand strategy; customer relationships; service quality; mystery shopping; retail banking		Market developments in the financial industries have forced banks to rethink their strategic positioning. One possibility for achieving uniqueness in the retail banking market is to develop an explicit brand strategy. If service quality and customer relationships, which have been identified as essential elements for the enduring success of retail banks, are the key characteristics of brand strategy, a customer-oriented culture is needed to transfer the brand principles. If the experiences concerning the services are insufficiently rewarding, the customers can be expected to break their relationships with the bank. To guarantee an optimal service quality, it will be helpful to measure the services offered by identifying the strengths and the weaknesses in the performances concerning the brand strategy. For this reason, mystery shopping can be used to analyse the perceived quality of the delivery of services. The paper uses a short literature review about brands linked with service quality and presents a case study with the objective of emphasising the importance of measuring service quality. In the end the authors discuss the significance of developing a coherent concept for the implementation of the communicated and intended contents of a brand by the employees.

This paper describes the results of a recent field study using extractive and optical remote sensing (ORS) techniques to measure emissions from six F-15 fighter aircraft. Testing was performed between November 14 and 16, 2006 on the trim-pad facility at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, FL. Measurements were made on eight different F100 engines, and the engines were tested on-wing of in-use aircraft. A total of 39 test runs were performed at engine power levels that ranged from idle to military power. The approach adopted for these tests involved extractive sampling with collocated ORS measurements at a distance of approximately 20-25 nozzle diameters downstream of the engine exit plane. The emission indices calculated for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and several volatile organic compounds showed very good agreement when comparing the extractive and ORS sampling methods.

J	Matichich, M				Matichich, Mike			Minimizing financial risk in today's turbulent economy	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								These days, utility managers face tougher financial decisions than ever. Faced with the need to move forward with capital programs in a period where revenues are less certain because of reduced development and declining use by customers, utility managers can turn to proactive financial management to identify a sound financial path forward. Using the strategies of enhanced prioritization, strategic financial planning, cost of service and rate studies, optimization of operation and maintenance expenses, and exploring outside funding, managers can reduce their financial uncertainties and manage risk. This article helps utility managers figure out what their most critical activities are and presents strategies that help identify reliable funding streams so those endeavors can proceed. In this article utility managers will find help coping with the more complex financial climate most find themselves in as well as case studies that show the benefits of the strategies that are presented.

J	de Lima, FGSN; Campos, LA				Santos Nobrega de Lima, Flavia Gonet; Nascimento Campos Filho, Luiz Alberto			Mapping the Contemporary Studies on Alliances and Strategic Networks	RBGN-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GESTAO DE NEGOCIOS			Portuguese	Article						Strategic alliance; Strategic network; Collaboration	INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS; JOINT VENTURE; PERFORMANCE; EMBEDDEDNESS; COOPERATION; COORDINATION; PERSPECTIVES; INNOVATION; IMPACT	The competition among the companies depends on the velocity and efficience they can create and commercialize knowledge in a timely and cost-efficient manner. In this context, collaboration emerges as a reaction to the environmental changes. Although strategic alliances and networks have been exploited in the strategic literature for decades, the complexity and continuous usage of these cooperation structures, in a world of growing competition, justify the continuous interest in both themes. This article presents a scanning of the contemporary academic production in strategic alliances and networks, covering the period from January 1997 to august 2007, based on the top five journals accordingly to the journal of Citation Report 2006 in the business and management categories simultaneously. The results point to a retraction in publications about strategic alliances and a significant growth in the area of strategic. networks. The joint view of strategic alliances and networks, cited by some authors a the evolutionary path of study, still did not appear salient. The most cited topics found in the alliance literature are the governance structure, cooperation, knowledge transfer, culture, control, trust, alliance formation,,previous experience, resources, competition and partner selection. The theme network focuses mainly on structure, knowledge transfer and social network, while the joint vision is highly concentrated in: the subjects of alliance formation and the governance choice.

J	Carnero, MC				Carnero, M. C.			Selection of condition monitoring techniques using discrete probability distributions: a case study	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART O-JOURNAL OF RISK AND RELIABILITY			English	Article						condition monitoring; analytic hierarchy process; discrete probability distributions; Monte Carlo	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; MODEL; SYSTEM; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; PROJECTS; AHP	The setting up of a condition monitoring program is considered a strategic decision owing to its influence on cost, safety, quality, and availability in an industrial plant. However, no previous structured analysis of the selection of condition monitoring techniques and their characteristics has been made, so further analysis is needed. This paper proposes a model for the selection of the most suitable condition monitoring technique to be set up in a subsidiary of a petrochemical plant. For this purpose, different criteria, indicators, and utility functions are defined; nine alternatives are proposed depending on the technological level of the condition monitoring program. The model applies the analytic hierarchy process to obtain a ranking of alternatives. Owing to the special characteristics of the decision, discrete probability distributions are defined. The final ranking is computed by applying the Monte Carlo method considering 2000 simulation trials. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is applied.

J	Chun, L				Chun, Lin			Challenging Privatization: A Conceptual and Theoretical Argument	JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Ownership and Property Rights; Privatization; Socialization; Political-Legal-Cultural Framework; State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)		This is the second of a three-part polemic against the destruction of state owned enterprises in China (the first, "Against Privatization: A Historical and Empirical Argument", is published in JCPS 13:1, 2008). It critically examines the ideology of privatization and argues for alternative guidelines of reform. The central contention is that a healthy market economy does not require domination of private property; rather it relies on apposite political-legal-ideological power and regulatory-monitoring regimes of accumulation and distribution socially legitimated within a given public culture. Rejecting the fallacies of ownership determinism and precision requirement on property rights for morality and efficiency, this essay clarifies distinction between the notion of exclusive properties and the vision of their socialized utility and management. Justifications for reforming state and private sectors alike in accordance with a unifying commons of social defense and feasibilities of innovative reform measures and policy proposals in that direction, will be elaborated in a third essay titled "Overcoming Privatization: A Strategic and Institutional Argument".

Fibre and shive measurement for pulp grading and branding	APPITA JOURNAL			English	Article	63rd Appita Annual Conference and Exhibition	APR 21-22, 2009	Appita Asia, Environm & Bioresource Proc Grp, Melbourne, AUSTRALIA		Appita Asia, Environm & Bioresource Proc Grp			Traditionally, online fibre property measurements of kraft pulp have not been performed until the end of the fibreline, before the finished product is fed to the pulp dryer or paper machine. At this point there is no opportunity to correct for fibre quality damage earlier in the process. This problem has been overcome by the newest development of an online Kappa analyser which includes also an online fibre-shive module. This development provides new possibilities to measure fibre properties and shive content online in the early stages of the fibreline where process conditions are harshest to fibres. The new measurement capability, anywhere from the digester blow to finished pulp, allows a deeper understanding of fibre delignification process dynamics and the impact on fibre properties. This gives new and unique opportunities to manage the fibreline for better pulp and fibre quality. Online fibre and shive measurements in early fibreline process stages are introduced in this study. Fibre degradation is more obvious in these early stages. The accuracy of the measurements is confirmed by comparing the results to older technology and laboratory measurements. This paper demonstrates practical experiences and observations of online fibre and shive measurements at several important and strategic points in a fibreline. The potential of the new process information for more efficient process management, diagnostics and pulp quality control is discussed. New ideas and solutions for process management applications in pulp and paper mills are presented.	[Koskinen, Jarmo J.; Kalkaja, Tuomo L.

As much as, people are viewed among the most important resources to firms, HR strategy would be central to achieve competitive advantages .Firms should view HR strategy as an important tool for integrating competencies inside organization and for matching employment capabilities with organizational strategy, and investigate how various combinations of capabilities can lead to competitive advantage. So, it is believed to be important that the management of the human resources should be in perfect fit with the management of the organization as a whole and its strategic plans. The purpose of this paper is to examine the matching of HR strategy with organizational strategy and HR capabilities in a sample of Iranian firms. In this paper at first by reviewing of related approaches in selecting HR strategy , the characteristics of human capital that affect organizational strategy and the relationship betwwen HR stratrgy and organizational strategy recognized. Then with adopting the Lepak and Snell (1999; 2002) in their model of HR architecture, and using the typology model of four organizational strategies developed Miles and Snow' (1978). The accordance of HR strategy with HR capabilities and organizational strategy in a sample of Iranian firms has examined.

Nitrogen uptake of a perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture following strategic nitrogen fertiliser application during the cool seasons in the Western Cape province, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						herbage nitrogen yields; nitrogen recovery rate	AUTUMN; SWARDS	The effect of four fertiliser nitrogen (N) levels (0, 50, 100 or 150 kg N ha(-1)) applied as a single dressing in either autumn ( late April), early winter (early June), late winter (mid July), early spring (late August) or late spring (early October) on fertiliser N recovery by a perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture five weeks after fertiliser N application was investigated. Herbage N yield (kg N ha(-1) uptake) was determined for the pasture from herbage N yield of the perennial ryegrass fraction and the clover fraction. Increased fertiliser N rate resulted in increased perennial ryegrass N yields. Perennial ryegrass N yields tend to be lowest during winter (early as well as late winter). Pasture N yield responses were similar to the perennial ryegrass N yields. Except in 2001, higher clover N yields (kg N ha(-1)) were recorded when no fertiliser N was applied compared to treatments that received fertiliser N. Clover N yields did not differ in the 50-150 kg N ha(-1) range and would therefore not influence pasture N yield in that range. Although season of application influenced N yields the response pattern was not consistent among the years covered by the study. Calculating the apparent N recovery rate (difference between N removed in fertilised plots and control plots) can serve as an important tool to evaluate the efficiency achieved with fertiliser N application. More research is needed to develop N removal as a management tool to be used in strategic N fertilisation programmes.	[Labuschagne, J.; Hardy, M.

Inconsistency of food security information in Sudan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Knowledge Management Regional Conference 2007	JUN 11-13, 2007	Cairo, EGYPT			information; foot security; Sudan; statistics; strategy; policy		Agriculture is the backbone of economic and social development in Sudan, with 80% of the population depending on agriculture and all other sectors being largely dependent on it. Food security information is the key to food security and its timely availability, reliability and usability not only averts disaster, but also leads to developments that improve people's livelihoods (Mati, 2005). Food security information is Sudan is generated by many governmental institutions, UN agencies (WFP, FAO, IFAD, UNDP, etc.) and NGOs. This paper aims to assess the strength and weaknesses of information and data collection on food security and the existing market information system, identify gaps in the early warning system of impending food security disasters, and analyse the capacity to forecast yield and crop production and identify the gaps. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of strategic and policy implications of these findings for achieving food security in Africa.

Tolga; Oezdemir, Zafer D.; Altinkemer, Kemal			Privacy, Customization, and Cross-Selling of Information	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						customization; cross-selling; electronic commerce; personalization; privacy	PRODUCT CUSTOMIZATION; COMPETITION; INTERNET; MODEL; PERSONALIZATION; STRATEGY; ONLINE; MARKET	An unavoidable aspect of electronic commerce is the collection of personal information. Although personal information is paramount to improving services and designing personalized offerings, its collection and use also generates privacy concerns. This study analytically examines the optimal information collection and usage practices in the presence of privacy costs. We use an analytical model in which a firm makes decisions on pricing, level of information collection and customization, and the extent of cross-selling. We find that cross-selling opportunities create value for consumers and sellers since consumer surplus and total profits may both increase with cross-selling. Advances in information technology motivate cross-selling and provide more incentives for the firms to engage in cross-selling. Consequently, firms are better off when cross-selling while offering customized products even in the presence of privacy costs. We find that serving a niche market and limiting the demand is a winning strategy when consumers' value for customization increases. On the other hand, an increase in the profitability of cross-selling favors a mass market strategy in which a firm serves a broader range of customers. Interestingly, cross-selling strategies may lower prices and provide significant strategic advantages with increased customer satisfaction while reaching a broader market. Total surplus increases at a decreasing rate as the amount of information collection and the extent of cross-selling increase. A niche marketing strategy facilitated by improvements in customization technology increases both consumer and total surplus.

He was previously Head of Race and Minority Policy at New Scotland Yard and Assistant Chief Constable (Crime and Operations) at Hertfordshire Constabulary. Within ACPO, Mr Beckley had policy responsibility for faith issues and led the National Community Tensions Team in its work on community cohesion and public disorder. Julian Birkinshaw is Professor of Strategic and International Management at the London Business School. Professor Birkinshaw writes, consults and teaches on how organizations can become more effective at dealing with changes in their external environment and how they can operate more efficiently on an internal basis. In this article, the authors explain the concept of critical incident management and examine how its introduction into policing has served to foster a set of behaviours that encourage accountability and timely judgement. They argue that despite some high-profile failures, such as in the case of the Soham murders, there have been many more examples where critical incident responses have been successfully applied and managed, so that they never became as prominent or as damaging as the failures.

The recent booming on some models such as Software Application as Service (SaaS) and On-Demand in 2008, has led to emergence of ASP model in core business functions. The traditional IS outsourcing covers the non-core business functions that are not critical to business performance and competitive advantages. Comparing with traditional IS outsourcing, ASP is a new phenomenon that can be considered as an emerging innovation as it covers both core and non-core business functions. Most of the executives do not comprehend the difference and similarity between traditional IS outsourcing and ASP mode. Hence, we propose to conduct a research so as to identify the determinants (cost benefit, gap in IS capability complementing the company's strategic goal, and trust to ASP's service and security level) and moderating factors (management's attitude in ownership & control, and company aggressiveness) of ASP adoption decision in both core and non-core business functions.

J	Chang, CH				Chang, Chang-Hsing			A study of global logistics management strategies: based on the bicycle manufacturing	JOURNAL OF STATISTICS & MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Global logistics management; logistics strategy; logistics service		This study is grounded on the fact that manufacturing has always been the power for the economic development in Taiwan. From this light, the researcher based this study on the strategic viewpoint of global logistics management and the case study of Fiege Goth Logistics Services Ltd. The researcher also investigated on how Taiwan can speed up the development of becoming the Global Logistics Center and strive for the market space in the international arena, after its accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO). For the aforementioned purposes, the researcher used the method of literature review to divide the research into four parts. In the first place, a systematic analysis was made on the global industry. For a better understanding of the background of global logistic management, the analysis made focused mainly on the status of bicycle manufacturing and global sea freight development in comparison with that of Taiwan. Secondly, the researcher analyzed the trends of global supply network and the factors of global bicycle logistics management. Thirdly, the researcher conducted a case research study with stress on the history of Fiege Goth Logistics Services and its current strategy in logistics management. Finally, a research on the strategy for logistics management of Taiwan in sea freight after its entry into the WTO for the reference of government in developing Taiwan as the global logistics management center was made.

J	Chang, CY; Wang, FH; Fu, HP				Chang, Ching-Yi; Wang, Fanghua; Fu, Hsin-Pin			A strategic analysis of the mobile telephone industry in Mainland China	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mobile communication systems; Telephone; Competitive strategy; Telecommunications; China		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose some competitive strategies as a reference for domestic mobile phone corporations (DMCs) so that dominant mobile phone corporations can develop advantageous business strategies to effectively compete with international corporations within the China market. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes case studies and the analysis hierarchical process to analyze the competitiveness of the domestic mobile phone industry (DMI) within the China market from a value chain perspective. Findings - The study finds that the competitive strengths of the domestic mobile phone players lie in manufacturing and customer service, while the weaknesses are in research and development (R&D), distribution (DIST) and marketing and sales (MS) in terms of competing with international brands already within the Chinese market. Research limitations/implications - The paper samples experts familiar with the mobile phone market in the Shanghai area, and therefore may not be applicable to the entire Chinese market. A wider study is suggested, with samples sourced from the entire market, to fill in the remaining gaps. Practical implications - The surveyed experts emphasize that R&D, DIST and MS capabilities need to be addressed immediately. In turn, some competitive strategies are proposed for the DMI to employ, taking into account their individual features and strengths. Originality/value - The study assists the dominant corporations in the DMI to better understand their competitive weaknesses through the comments provided by the surveyed experts. Some competitive strategies are proposed as a reference for DMCs.

We consider this entity as a complex adaptive system, in which technological cognition and innovation are emergent phenomena. In order to substantiate this hypothesis we examine the link between industrial organisation and knowledge generation and diffusion at the meso level, and we took at cognition as ail evolutionary process and, more specifically, the generation of new technological knowledge and its intersubjective systemisation through competitive and mutualistic co-adaptation respectively.

A qualitative method, based on casing, was adopted as the research strategy. Data were collected from members of the human-resource forum of an organisation through a semi-structured focus group, individual interviews and solicited document reviews. The collected data were analysed through open coding or thematic analyses. Findings indicated that the organisation's human-resource function was moving from operational human-resource service provision to a more strategic focus.

J	Foo, CT; McKiernan, P; Wong, J				Foo, Check Teck; McKiernan, Peter; Wong, James			Cognitive mapping of chief executive officers' minds: confronting Chinese global competitiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						art of war; CEO; chief executive officer; Chinese global competitiveness; cognitive mapping; Indian management; spider-web methodology; strategy		In Western philosophy on epistemology, there has long been the traditional divide between what is a priori vs. a posteriori. This is taken as the starting point for a conceptual framing of an empirically grounded inquiry into the minds of Indian chief executive officer (CEOs*) about Chinese strategic thinking. The objective of this a posteriori experimentation is to cross culturally map Indian CEOs' knowledge - broadly defined as understandings, doubts, responses, surprises, concerns, beliefs and values, when they are put face-to-face with rapidly rising Chinese competitive pressures. To provide the focus of inquiry, the author uses the precepts of the 2,500 years old Art of War by Sun Tzu as experimental parameterisation of knowledge concerning Chinese competitive, strategic thinking. From the results of experimentation, the first and main author then produces a cognitive map that yields intriguing insights to the mental state of CEOs' knowing and concerning about Chinese strategy.

The core competence of cooperative banks in Germany is the membership that ensures dependability in precarious relationships. The suitable strategy is member-oriented relationship-management. A structure in line with this strategy can be a strategic network. The institutional devices of the cooperative banking group have to be adapted to the changing general settings.

J	Khalifa, AS				Khalifa, Azaddin			Drawing on students' evaluation to draw a strategy canvas for a business school	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive advantage; Project evaluation; Students; Management strategy; Business studies	MANAGEMENT; COMMITMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how to construct a strategy canvas for a business school based on students' perceptions of the importance of critical value dimensions of its undergraduate offering(s) and its comparable performance on each. This can be used in evaluating the school's extant strategy and in developing a new innovative one. Design/methodology/approach - A survey research is used to solicit and measure students' perception. This is then subjected to proper statistical analysis to draw conclusions, which are then used to construct the strategy canvas. Findings - The findings show the strengths and weaknesses of the school's current strategy profile. They suggest how to use resources to improve performance on critical value dimensions and trigger thinking on new innovative dimensions. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the focus on one constituent (students) of the business school, and the choice and size of the sample. Practical implications - The use of students' perception to construct a strategy canvas proved to be useful and revealing. It shows how the strategy profiles of competitors compare and where to look for further information. This process helps create, evaluate, and develop new strategic insights. Originality/value - The paper endeavors to use the rigor of survey analysis to provide valid and reliable information on the basis of which to construct a strategy canvas. This, perhaps, represents the first attempt to bring this combination to the context of higher education management.

J	Kim, E; Lee, B				Kim, Eunjin; Lee, Byungtae			STRATEGIC USE OF ANALYTICAL CRM IN A MARKET WITH NETWORK EFFECTS AND SWITCHING COSTS: TERMINATING UNPROFITABLE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						analytical CRM; customer profitability; network effects; switching costs; unprofitable customers	EXTERNALITIES; PERSONALIZATION; DESIGN	Analytical customer relationship management (CRM) systems make firms more informed than ever about their customers. This further gives firms the ability to serve customers selectively in a way that ensures retaining profitable customers and eliminating unprofitable ones. However, when firms of products/services with network effects decide to eliminate unprofitable customers, they may face the risk associated with firing them, which is user-based shrinkage. This risk incurred as a result of network effects has been widely neglected in CRM literature. In this study, considering this risk, we investigate when firms can eliminate unprofitable customers in the competitive market with network effects and consumer switching costs, which often co-exist with network effects, using a game-theoretic model of a duopoly. Our results show that it is not desirable for firms to fire unprofitable customers in the presence of strong network effects or sufficiently low consumer-switching costs. Otherwise, firms can fire unprofitable customers and benefit from the ability to eliminate them. An interesting point is that competing firms can be better off when both have the ability to eliminate unprofitable customers in the presence of moderate switching costs and small network effects.

J	Lee, WO				Lee, Won Ok			The Effect of the Gap between College Students' Perception of the Importance of Coffee Shops and Their Satisfaction after Patronizing Coffee Shops on Their Purchasing Behavior	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			Korean	Article						Selection attributes; Purchasing behavior; Gap between importance and satisfaction; Ordered Probit Model (OPM); Satisfaction		The purpose of this study was to categorize the gap between coffee shop 'importance' (as perceived by customers before patronizing the coffee shop) and 'satisfaction' (perception of customers after patronizing the coffee shop) as positive or negative and to analyze the effect of these gaps on purchasing behavior. To do this, I used the gap between importance and satisfaction regarding the choice of a coffee shop as the explanatory variable and performed an empirical analysis of the direction and size of the effect of the gap on purchasing behavior (overall satisfaction, willingness-to-revisit) by applying the Ordered Probit Model (OPM). A previous study that used IPA to evaluate the effects of gaps estimated the direction and size of a quadrant but failed to analyze the effect of gaps on customers. In this study, I evaluated the effects of positive and negative gaps on customer satisfaction and willingness-to-revisit. Using OPM, I quantified the effect of positive and negative gaps on overall customer satisfaction and willingness-to-revisit. Per-head expenditure, frequency of visits, and coffee-purchasing place had the most positive effects on overall customer satisfaction. Frequency of visits, followed by per-head expenditure and then coffee-purchasing place, had the most positive impact on willingness-to-visit. Thus per-head expenditure and frequency of visits had the greatest positive effects on overall satisfaction and willingness-to-revisit. This finding implies that the higher the actual satisfaction (gap) of customers who spend KRW5,000 or more once or more per week at coffee shops is, the higher their overall satisfaction and willingness-to-revisit are. Despite the fact that economical efficiency had a significant effect on overall satisfaction and willingness-to-revisit, college and university students still use coffee shops and are willing to spend KRW5,000 because they do not only purchase coffee as a product itself, but use the coffee shop for other activities, such as working, meeting friends, or relaxing. College and university students also access the Internet in coffee shops via personal laptops, watch movies, and study; thus, coffee shops should provide their customers with the appropriate facilities and services. The fact that a positive gap for coffee shop brand had a positive effect on willingness-to-revisit implies that the higher the level of customer satisfaction, the greater the willingness-to-revisit. A negative gap for this factor, on the other hand, implies that the lower the level of customer satisfaction, the lower the willingness-to-revisit. Thus, the brand factor has a comparatively greater effect on satisfaction than the other factors evaluated in this study. Given that the domestic coffee culture is becoming more upscale and college/university students are sensitive to this trend, students are attentive to brands. In most upscale coffee shops in Korea, the outer wall is built out of glass that can be opened, the interiors are exotic with an open kitchen. These upscale coffee shops function as landmarks and match the taste of college/university students. Coffee shops in Korea have become a cultural brand. To make customers feel that coffee shops are upscale, good quality establishments and measures to provide better services in terms of brand factor should be instituted. The intensified competition among coffee shop brands in Korea as a result of the booming industry indicates that provision of additional services is needed to differentiate competitors. These customers can also use a scanner free of charge. Another strategy that can be used to boost brands could be to provide and operate a seminar room for seminars and group study. If coffee shops adopt these types of strategies, college/university students would be more likely to consider the expenses they incur worthwhile and, subsequently, they would be more likely to be satisfied with the brands of these coffee shops, with an associated increase in their willingness-to-revisit. Gender and study year had the most negative effects on overall satisfaction and willingness-to-revisit. Female students were more likely to be satisfied and be willing to return than male students, and third and fourth-year students were more likely to be satisfied and willing-to-return than first or second-year students. Students who drink coffee, read books, and use laptops alone at coffee shops are easily noticeable. High-grade students tend to visit coffee shops alone in order to use their time efficiently for self-development and to find jobs. The economical efficiency factor had the greatest effect on overall satisfaction and willingness-to-revisit in terms of a positive gap. The higher the actual satisfaction (gap) of students with the price of the coffee, the greater their overall satisfaction and willingness-to-revisit. Economical efficiency with a negative gap had a negative effect on willingness-to-revisit, which implies that a less negative gap will result in a greater willingness-to-revisit. Amid worsening market conditions, coffee shops located around colleges/universities are using strategies, such as a point or membership card, strategic alliances with credit-card companies, development of a set menu or seasonal menu, and free coffee-shot services to increase their competitive edge. Product power also had a negative effect in terms of a negative gap, which indicates that a higher negative gap will result in a lower willingness-to-revisit. Because there are many more customers that enjoy coffee in this decade, as compared to previous decades, the new generation of customers, namely college/university students, want various menu items in addition to coffee, and coffee shops should, therefore, add side menu items, such as waffles, rice cakes, cakes, sandwiches, and salads. For example, Starbucks Korea is making efforts to enhance product power by selling rice cakes flavored in strawberry, wormwood, and pumpkin, and providing coffee or cream free of charge. In summary, coffee shops should focus on increasing their economical efficiency, brand, and product power to enhance the satisfaction of college/university students. Because shops adjacent to colleges or universities enjoy a locational advantage, providing differentiated services in terms of economical efficiency, brand, and product power, is likely to increase customer satisfaction and return visits. Coffee shop brands should, therefore, be innovative and embrace change to meet their customers' desires. Because this study only targeted college/university students in Seoul, comparative studies targeting diverse regions and age groups are required to generalize the findings and recommendations of this study.

J	Matipa, WM; Kelliher, D; Keane, M				Matipa, Wilfred M.; Kelliher, Denis; Keane, Marcus			A strategic view of ICT supported cost management for green buildings in the quantity surveying practice	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Communication technologies; Budgetary control; Construction industry; Sustainable development; Quantity surveying; Ireland		Purpose - This paper aims to highlight the availability and use of software systems in the Irish construction professional cost consultancy process. Also to gather the views from practising quantity surveying professionals as to how available systems could assist total cost management of green buildings throughout their lifespan. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was given to a number of senior quantity surveyors throughout Ireland to ascertain the extent to which IT systems were being used as part of a total life cycle cost analysis and control procedure. Particular focus of questions related to the extent to which use of IT systems encouraged information sharing. Statistical analyses of results of same are given. Findings - Quantity surveying practice must adapt and integrate cost management systems within the life cycle cost plan of a building. Use of well-designed IT systems should complement the existing knowledge base of traditional cost models. Originality/value - The extent to which life cycle costs become an accepted and integral part of the total cost management package may be determined more by government legislation than client desire for the cost management system. Nevertheless, the quantity surveying profession with its well-established cost control and planning techniques should consider the use of well-designed IT systems as part of the future development of the profession.

Impact of the Changing Economic Models in the Development of Societal and Environmental Structures of Coastal Natural Parks	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas		Coastal management; protected areas; sustainability; governance; Andalusia	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES	Proposals for the design of behavioural socio-economic models are provided in this contribution building on the results of analyses of research in which various Natural Parks (and their area of influence) along the coast of Andalusia in Spain have been investigated. The overall backdrop is the evidence that the existing development model applied elsewhere along the coast is unsustainable from the environmental and socio-economic stand point in sensitive areas such as these Parks, where not only natural but also cultural and social heritage must be preserved and underlined. The method is based on the implementation of qualitative and quantitative techniques among which the main thrust is placed on the analyses of information gathered in Strategic Participatory Workshops carried out in the area of influence of the Parks within the framework of the building of Sustainable Development Plans from the Regional Government. Stakeholders participated in the identification of problems and developed new proposals to solve them. Among the main issues that were raised a desire was identified to aim at an Integrated Coastal Zone Management strategy given a highly criticised inefficiency of the institutional framework, which affects gravely in these sensitive areas subject to many regulatory bodies and policies. The main proposals introduced in this contribution highlighted the necessity to further develop local branding and exploitation (sustainable) of cultural and social resources and avoid post-fordism trends which lead to the standardisation of territorial resources.

We find that firms elicit higher returns from their global product development when they compete in strategic complements than when they compete in strategic substitutes. These firms are most likely to compete in strategic complements if they have higher free cash flows, but are most likely to compete in strategic substitutes if they are more dominant in their industry. Importantly, global product development reduces cost largely via variable cost reduction. Moreover, we find that global product development contributes to the firm's growth potential when pursued in conjunction with high multinationalism, aggressive competitive strategy, and high cost saving.

J	Narayanan, VK; Zane, LJ				Narayanan, V. K.; Zane, Lee J.			Inventing a future for strategic leadership: phenomenal variety and epistemic opportunities	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Strategic leadership; Epistemology		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to offer an epistemological vantage point for theory development in the case of strategic leadership, an emerging focus of scholarly attention in strategic management. Design/methodology/approach - The authors invoke Rescher's epistemological platform for making the case, Rescher being one of the most influential philosophers in the USA. Findings - The analysis suggests that since strategic leadership differs from supervisory leadership, both on organizational reach and incorporation of external elements, defining the strategic leadership problem exclusively as a difference in context - what Weick referred to as a strategy of knowledge growth by extension - is likely to prove unproductive. Rescher's platform can be put to use for specifying the two critical though inter-related epistemological challenges in the beginning of the theory development project: the choice of concepts, and the type of relations among the concepts. These epistemological challenges may be reframed as opportunities to capture the phenomenal variety embedded in these concepts, and to deploy a diversity of approaches to examine their correspondence. Research limitations/implications - Contending and complementary views on strategic leadership, and hence concepts representing alternate views should be allowed. Bridges should be built between islands of scholarship, but these bridges are likely to be found in special issues of journals (devoted deliberately to nurture multiple perspectives), edited books and invited conferences. Practical implications - Engagement with "strategic" leaders is an epistemological necessity for both theoretical and pragmatic reasons. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates how epistemology can strengthen theory building in the case of strategic leadership. Given the signal importance of this phenomenon, good theories and, therefore, epistemological challenges should occupy a central stage of discussions in this early stage.	[Narayanan, V.

J	Paxson, DA; Melmane, A				Paxson, Dean A.; Melmane, Arun			Multi-factor competitive internet strategy evaluation: search expansion, portal synergies	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Search engines; Competitive strategy; Market share	OPTIONS; MODEL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the use of a multi-factor competitive real option model. Design/methodology/approach - The model is described, context of Google-Yahoo! is developed, market share and other parameter values are estimated, sensitivities and alternative model specifications are shown, and model results are compared with accounting and also stock market valuations and conclusion emphasizes the need for further empirical and theoretical research. Findings - It was found that applications are feasible, but estimated parameter values are likely to be very approximate compared with internal company information. Hence it points to use as managerial decision tool. Research limitations/implications - Some limitations are the assumed duopoly model, and that historical data are adequate proxies for expected revenue, investment cost, volatilities and market share. The basic model assumes geometric Brownian motion, but the possible consequences of other stochastic processes are illustrated. Practical implications - Internal market share information should be compared with public data in making strategic investment decisions. Originality/value - Model adaptation and empirical application are unique, and of value to future empirical researchers, including stock market analysts as well as corporate decision makers.

Beyond matrices and black-box algorithms: setting marketing priorities with Marketing Strategy Conferences	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Resource allocation; Prioritisation; Decision conference; Multiple-attribute Utility theory; Marketing mix		With this paper, we introduce Marketing Strategy Conferences to set strategic marketing priorities effectively and allocate marketing-related resources accordingly. The system is based on managerial preference modelling with a decision model (analytical side) and communication-enhancing strategy conferencing (interactive side). After a review of alternative resource allocation frameworks, as rule-of-thumb approaches, matrix-based analyses, statistical analyses and management science models, we analyse existing analytical, behavioural and organisational impediments to effective marketing resource allocation. Addressing some of these impediments, this paper outlines two Marketing Strategy Conference cases, which we carried out for a pharmaceutical company, Schering Argentina.

TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF PAIN IN PHYSIOTHERAPY PRACTICES IN HONG KONG AND THE UNITED KINGDOM-A SURVEY OF USAGE AND PERCEIVED EFFECTIVENESS COMPARED WITH OTHER PAIN RELIEVING MODALITIES	HONG KONG PHYSIOTHERAPY JOURNAL			English	Article						electrophysical modalities; pain; perceived effectiveness; survey; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation		This study compared the use and perceived effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with other electrophysical modalities for pain management by physiotherapists (PTs) in Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK). Two random samples (n = 600 each) of HK and UK PTs were mailed questionnaires. Four hundred and sixteen out of 1,200 respondents (34.7%) returned fully completed questionnaires (HK,34.2%; UK, 35.2%). A significant difference was found in the type of electrodes used (p<0.001); self-adhesive electrodes were used more commonly in the UK (UK, 73.0%; HK, 18.4%), compared with carbon rubber electrodes and gel in HK (HK, 75.6%; UK, 15.7%). A significantly higher percentage of HK PTs reported receiving an undergraduate education in TENS (84.4% vs. 43.1%; p<0.001). Acupuncture was used more in the UK (67.7%) than in HK (48.8%; p<0.001), but it was rated equally effective, especially for chronic pain. There were significant differences in perceived effectiveness of TENS for chronic pain (p<0.001); TENS was rated second most effective for the management of chronic pain by UK PTs and fourth by HK PTs. This survey has highlighted differences in the patterns of use and perceived effectiveness of TENS and other modalities in the UK and HK.

J	Sinfield, S; Holley, D; Burns, T				Sinfield, Sandra; Holley, Debbie; Burns, Tom			A journey into silence: students, stakeholders and the impact of a strategic governmental policy document in the UK	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						E-learning; Stakeholder analysis; Students; Government policy; United Kingdom; Globalization		Purpose - In the UK, higher education (HE) is being positioned as the new global business, and the power relations between its various stakeholders - society, the business community, management, staff, students - makes this not only uncharted, but also contested ground. This paper aims to map the new terrain with a focus on, and analysis of, one key government policy document: The Harnessing Technology (2005). Design/methodology/approach - Critical theory and textual analysis are used to research and analyse power relationsasinscribedinpolicydiscourse - thestructures, thelanguage, andthevoices. Thedocument is exploredparticularly in relation to its impact on prime stakeholderswithin the newcontextsof today'sHE; a HE that is embracing information communications technology (e-learning) - "for business''. Findings - Harnessing Technology boasts a heteroglossia and the capturing of many authentic voices in its composition which should open up a dialogic between its stakeholders; in fact power is revealed as refined, unified - deferring to centralised authority. Textual analysis reveals HE as a journey into silence for the student as stakeholder, where the voices that are not repressed are those with economic and institutional power. This analysis shows the student is constructed as either silent or deficit and the conclusions suggest that rather than a discourse of transformation, "regulation not education'', is the real goal of the dominant educational stakeholders. Originality/value - The critical approach to policy analysis in the paper can be adapted by others seeking to critique policy in a variety of different policy contexts. This is particularly significant where policy is not interrogated, but where nevertheless it influences institutional mission statements and the seepage pollutes practice.

J	Srikaew, A; Baron, S				Srikaew, Anuwat; Baron, Steve			Marketing strategies supporting national plans: contributions of universities	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						marketing strategy; Thailand; universities; knowledge transfer; qualitative research		The paper explores the potential for university knowledge transfer in the development of marketing strategies of rural community businesses as part of a nation's plan that aims to make the community businesses self-reliant within a given timeframe. It reports on findings from reactive participant research with community businesses in the Chiang Mai province of northern Thailand. Using a co-operative marketing strategy framework, facts, perceptions and potential conflicts are identified from a study of the dynamics of community businesses which produce and sell cotton and silk fabrics and clothing. It is concluded that the university role should be that of co-producer, rather than catalyst, and that sustainable marketing strategies require a bottom-up approach that is dependent on the abilities of community business leaders to become rounded managers with a global view of the marketplace. The findings are relevant to all situations where marketing strategies are required to fit with multiple measures of performance that are laid down by a super-ordinate strategy.

J	Suckling, S; Ryan, P; Dent, M				Suckling, Steve; Ryan, Paul; Dent, Mike			Beliefs, barriers and control: a model for research into social exclusion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Individual perception; Youth; Sports; Modelling; Qualitative methods; United Kingdom		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce an innovative qualitative methodology, the beliefs, barriers and control (BBaC) model. The BBaC model facilitates the understanding of how perceptions are formed through actors' interactions with their environments and each other, enabling targeted solutions for social and organisational questions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a case study of a sports-based intervention that addresses the physical activity levels of at risk youths in Stoke-on-Trent. It is an account of how the BBaC model was used to provide an understanding of barriers to participation in sport and active recreation amongst the target population. The study involved youth workers utilising the BBaC approach in focus groups with young people (YP) and staff. Moreover, the model was used in this case study in conjunction with the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) framework, which demonstrated how this qualitative methodology can be used with "harder" focused management tools to produce strategies for social and organisational improvement. Findings - The BBaC model was used to collect rich qualitative data from the target YP. This was translated into action points using the EFQM model which were used in strategic and policy decision making; delivering improved results for the target YP. Originality/value - The paper introduces an innovative and original methodology, the BBaC model, and demonstrates how it can be used to deliver strategies that have positive impacts.

We find that IT tools have long offered management capacities that have not been fully utilised. Through an in-depth study of IP management practice in collaborative defence projects we analyse the slow diffusion of available technological solutions and identify two contrasting models to set up inter-organisational networks for the exchange of large amounts of technical data.

Some alliance results into structures that attract costs associated with uncertainty, poor stability, and performance. This study attempts to bring together these variables with a view to gaining insight into the implications of cost of structuring in an alliance. Data from 20 firms that have gone into alliances were used for analysis and findings supported the hypotheses suggesting the need to ascertain the difference between voluntary and involuntary inter-firm alliance.

J	Chau, VS; Witcher, BJ				Vinh Sum Chau; Witcher, Barry J.			The uses and usefulness of reflexive accounts in strategic performance management research The case of UK regulated public utilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tracer methods; Research methods; Qualitative research; Public sector organizations; United Kingdom	THEORY CONSTRUCTION; ORGANIZATION; METHODOLOGY; SCIENCE; REFLECTIONS; WORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the role of reflexivity in ensuring quality in the conduct of qualitative organizational and management (especially case study based) strategic performance management research. It argues the importance of research reports to include a reflexive account of the comings and goings about the circumstances that may have impacted upon the research to justify its validity. A project on UK-regulated public utilities is used to illustrate the benefit of such an account and how it may be presented. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a two-year longitudinal research project, which used longitudinal case studies to examine the impact of regulatory policy incentives on the strategic management of UK monopoly network utilities, to present a developed approach for presenting reflexive accounts in qualitative research. It focuses on the longitudinal tracer methodology that allows a close examination of detailed yet holistic operational activities, which is particularly good for strategic performance management research. Findings - The paper suggests that the more explicit the reflexive appreciation during the conduct of the research, the better it satisfies the conditions of reliability and validity which are themselves well-known prerequisites for ensuring quality in qualitative research. Practical implications - Strategic performance management research is characterised by a need to examine closely detailed internal decision-making processes. Such an approach is supported by the emerging activity-based view of management, known as strategy-as-practice, that concerns understanding micro-activities of the organization. The provision of a reflexive account in research reports alerts the reader to these equivocal conditions under which the findings were derived. Originality/value - The paper concludes that an appreciation of the epistemological and ontological positions of the tracer methodology has an impact upon the way in which a reflexive account of organizational research should appropriately be presented. It suggests some potential issues to include in the presentation of reflexive accounts.

Research and technological competences are key indicators for the absorptive capacity of sustainability technologies and for the ability to export them. These issues are analyzed empirically for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). Sustainability related research in BRICS is mostly carried out within broader, more sector oriented programmes. Specialization patterns of international patents and in foreign trade indicate various strengths and weaknesses of the BRICS countries. The differences within the countries imply that the analysis must proceed at a technology specific level. China has considerable capabilities in technologies such as photovoltaics, solar thermal or buildings. There is a strong need for strategic positioning of the countries and for coordination of the various policy fields involved.

Furthermore, bancassurance has enjoyed considerable success in Europe. Thus the aim of this paper is searching for the preferable bancassurance alliance model to customers. First, we define three criteria and nine sub-criteria for use in evaluating six forms of bancassurance alliance. Next, we establish a framework for the criteria and sub-criteria using a modified Delphi method. As a decision support system. we incorporate the opinions of industry experts and apply the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA).

J	Yoo, WS				Yoo, Weon Sang			The Impact of the Intemet Channel Introduction Depending on the O.ersh. of the Intemet Channel	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			Chinese	Article						Distribution channel; Internet channel; Mixed; channel; Game theory; Spatial model	ONLINE	The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce announced in May 2008 that U.S. retail e-commerce sales for 2006 reached $ 107 billion, up from $ 87 billion in 2005 - an increase of 22 percent. From 2001 to 2006, retail e-sales increased at an average annual growth rate of 25.4 percent. The explosive growth of E-Commerce has caused profound changes in marketing channel relationships and structures in many industries. Despite the great potential implications for both academicians and practitioners, there still exists a great deal of uncertainty about the impact of the Internet channel introduction on distribution channel management. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the ownership of the new Internet channel affects the existing channel members and consumers. To explore the above research questions, this study conducts well-controlled mathematical experiments to isolate the impact of the Internet channel by comparing before and after the Internet channel entry. The model consists of a monopolist manufacturer selling its product through a channel system including one independent physical store before the entry of an Internet store. The addition of the Internet store to this channel system results in a mixed channel comprised of two different types of channels. The new Internet store can be launched by the independent physical store such as Bestbuy. In this case, the physical retailer coordinates the two types of stores to maximize the joint profits from the two stores. The Internet store also can be introduced by an independent Internet retailer such as Amazon. In this case, a retail level competition occurs between the two types of stores. Although the manufacturer sells only one product, consumers view each product-outlet pair as a unique offering. Thus, the introduction of the Internet channel provides two product offerings for consumers. The channel structures analyzed in this study are illustrated in Fig. l. It is assumed that the manufacturer plays as a Stackelberg leader maximizing its own profits with the foresight of the independent retailer's optimal responses as typically assumed in previous analytical channel studies. As a Stackelberg follower, the independent physical retailer or independent Internet retailer maximizes its own profits, conditional on the manufacturer's wholesale price. The price competition between two the independent retailers is assumed to be a Bertrand Nash game. For simplicity, the marginal cost is set at zero, as typically assumed in this type of study. In order to explore the research questions above, this study develops a game theoretic model that possesses the following three key characteristics. First, the model explicitly captures the fact that an Internet channel and a physical store exist in two independent dimensions (one in physical space and the other in cyber space). This enables this model to demonstrate that the effect of adding an Internet store is different from that of adding another physical store. Second, the model reflects the fact that consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for using a physical store and for using an Internet channel. Third, the model captures the vertical strategic interactions between an upstream manufacturer and a downstream retailer, making it possible to analyze the channel structure issues discussed in this paper. Although numerous previous models capture this vertical dimension of marketing channels, none simultaneously incorporates the three characteristics ref1ected in this model. The analysis results are summarized in Table 1. When the new Internet channels introduced by the existing physical retailer and the retailer coordinates both types of stores to maximize the joint profits from the both stores, retail prices increase due to a combination of the coordination of the retail prices and the wider market coverage. The quantity sold does not significantly increase despite the wider market coverage, because the excessively high retail prices alleviate the market coverage effect to a degree. Interestingly, the coordinated total retail profits are lower than the combined retail profits of two competing independent retailers. This implies that when a physical retailer opens an Internet channel, the retailers could be better off managing the two channels separately rather than coordinating them, unless they have the foresight of the manufacturer's pricing behavior. It is also found that the introduction of an Internet channel affects the power balance of the channel. The retail competition is strong when an independent Internet store joins a channel with an independent physical retailer. This implies that each retailer in this structure has weak channel power. Due to intense retail competition, the manufacturer uses its channel power to increase its wholesale price to extract more profits from the total channel profit. However, the retailers cannot increase retail prices accordingly because of the intense retail level competition, leading to lower channel power. In this case, consumer welfare increases due to the wider market coverage and lower retail prices caused by the retail competition. The model employed for this study is not designed to capture all the characteristics of the Internet channel. The theoretical model in this study can also be applied for any stores that are not geographically constrained such as TV home shopping or catalog sales via mail. The reasons the model in this study is names as Internet are as follows: first, the most representative example of the stores that are not geographically constrained is the Internet. Second, catalog sales usually determine the target markets using the pre-specified mailing lists. In this aspect, the model used in this study is closer to the Internet than catalog sales. However, it would be a desirable future research direction to mathematically and theoretically distinguish the core differences among the stores that are not geographically constrained. The model is simplified by a set of assumptions to obtain mathematical traceability. First, this study assumes the price is the only strategic tool for competition. In the real world, however, various marketing variables can be used for competition. Therefore, a more realistic model can be designed if a model incorporates other various marketing variables such as service levels or operation costs. Second, this study assumes the market with one monopoly manufacturer. Therefore, the results from this study should be carefully interpreted considering this limitation. Future research could extend this limitation by introducing manufacturer level competition. Finally, some of the results are drawn from the assumption that the monopoly manufacturer is the Stackelberg leader. Although this is a standard assumption among game theoretic studies of this kind, we could gain deeper understanding and generalize our findings beyond this assumption if the model is analyzed by different game rules.

They believe that they will be able to meet the needs of their internal and external surroundings for which they were initially founded. In order to gain quality in achieving strategic goals they set i.e. in order to quickly implement their strategy which is a prerequisite for survival on the global market, they must be acquainted with project issues. For this reason the authors of this paper elaborate the project issues in a systematic and concise manner, with particular emphasis to: project, project types, investment projects and their lifetime, shipping investment projects from investor's - shipping company - point of view, investment decision. Special attention is paid to shipping investment projects with direct effects since these projects generate income or gains during the exploitation phase which guarantees investment return as well as further growth and development of shipping company.

ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES: THE EMIDE APPROACHES TO MEET THE NEW CHALLENGES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Developing economies; engineering management; EMIDE model; strategic differentiation; operational excellence		The pace of globalization is accelerating. It has been forecast that the Gross Domestic Products of the BRIC nations are expected to surpass those of the G6 countries by 2038. Regional economies will change rapidly, suggesting that engineering managers in the East will need to take different approaches to achieve success in the marketplace. This paper outlines five specific approaches, which constitute the EMIDE model, for engineering managers in the East to customize their engineering management practices, in order to capture these new growth opportunities, to expand beyond their local regions and to meet the challenges ahead.

Discovering Your Personality: A Group Exercise In Personal Sensemaking	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						personality; group exercise; sensemaking; perceptual biases; experiential exercise; experiential learning		Personality affects a wide variety of issues in organizational behavior, human resource management, and strategic management. Instructors teaching personality often have students take personality tests and then give them their scores. This passive approach to giving test feedback suffers from several weaknesses dealing with distinct perceptual biases. The author presents an experiential group exercise that helps overcome these problems and that has a broad range of applications in management and social science courses that discuss personality.

A number of competing hypotheses are formulated and tested empirically using a sample of South African firms in manufacturing and services by applying Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses. Results show that having an innovation partnership, particularly an international partnership, is beneficial to innovation outcomes. However, it also emerges that too diverse a set of international partnerships is detrimental to innovation outcomes.

J	Denner, M; Oosthuizen, H				Denner, M.; Oosthuizen, H.			The strategic positioning and configuration of national mapping organisations as enablers of economic and social growth in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper explores the transferability and application of business-driven strategic thinking to that of a public sector context, namely national mapping organisations. These organisations exist throughout the world because the economies of the world require geospatial information to support economic and social growth. As such their strategic positioning within government is of prime importance. In South Africa, however, there is a paucity of knowledge in this regard and consequently triggered the research which forms the basis of this paper. A macro-environmental analysis suggests significant growth opportunities for the South African geospatial industry, fuelled by a micro-industry borne out of the 2010 Soccer World Cup event. A profile description of the characteristics of consequence, boundaries between the private and public the industry and expected changes reflect a large industry which is expanding at a rapid rate but is fragmented and displays a complex network-system of inter and intra-industry relationships. As such it is attracting increasing numbers of competitors but, as an industry, appears to be slow to adjust to technological advancement. An internal analysis of the value chain of the National Mapping Organisation (NMO), the single most important player in the local public sector geospatial industry, reveals significant value creation in its in-house activities. However, the external deconstructed operations, outbound logistics and procurement processes are not allowing the organisation to realise any benefits from efficiencies it may introduce. Key to achieving efficiencies lies in the human capital, which by all accounts, it is failing to retain. Future strategic thrusts for the NMO have been identified by constructing a SWOT model and by analysing its relative competitive strength. These thrusts were found to concentrate on actions and themes related to staff, communication, marketing, general management, production (cost and capacity) and product (quality and innovation). Interpreting and applying those themes on an interorganisational basis will enable the NMO to best position itself in the industry. In this regard sufficient related strategic fit is evident between the value chains of the NMO, The Satellite Application Centre (SAC) and Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), enabling the NMO to leverage on the sales, marketing and distribution activities of SAC and the financial leveraging capabilities of Stats SA. This paper has presented an example of how delivering an efficient and effective service delivery may be hampered through the inappropriate strategic configuration of South African public sector activities. It is therefore suggested that the government revisits the strategic positioning of public sector organisations engaged in the provision of geospatial information.

High-pass, two-dimensional (2-D) intra-Inversion filtering (IIF) is introduced as a partial Solution to the vexing problem of overlapping fields of UXO, clutter, and geologic Sources. I IF call severely distort target fields while ameliorating effects of overlapping fields. The filter applied to the input data is also applied to unit dipole fields that are used I'll the inversion algorithm to extract the position, strength, and orientation of the best-fit magnetic dipole. A least-squares converging grid-search inversion, with successive P passes using smaller dipole search volumes, Is more efficient than an exhaustive search. Between passes, a polynomial is Fit to objective function values and the next search volume is centered oil the node nearest the minimum of the polynomial. Intra-Inversion gradient estimation improves some inversions relative to standard procedures of intra-inversion dc bias estimation of background fields. A flag-node option uses field values at only those nodes nearest to magnetometer stations. To accommodate flag-node data, filter input data windows, data gaps, and/or survey edges, a spatially variable edge-adaptive. gapped, gradient-nulling (EAGGN) filter derived from a progenitor symmetric, zero-dc filter. It shares with its progenitor the property of nulling any constant-gradient field. EAGGN Filter coefficients depend oil the distribution of flagged nodes in a filter application window centered on each output location. To overcome problems of swath-overlap noise, single-swath EAGGN filters are applied separately to data from individual swaths of magnetometer arrays. Effectiveness of IIF is demonstrated for anomalies in a magnetic survey of the Blind Test Area of the UXO Standardized Test Site at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers emplaced UXO simulants and clutter.

J	Sun, H; Chow, A; Lo, C				Sun, Hongyi; Chow, Augustine; Lo, Choitung			RAPID COMMERCIALIZATION OF ACQUIRED INNOVATIONS - A COLLABORATIVE MODEL BASED ON CASE STUDIES IN CHINESE COMPANIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Rapid commercialization; acquired innovation; collaboration; Chinese companies		Many Chinese companies rely on externally acquired innovations rather than developing their own. The best way to rapidly commercialize externally acquired innovations in a Chinese company, however, is still a rather new research topic. This paper reports research towards development of an integrated model for commercialization of acquired innovations. Development of the preliminary model was based upon a review of the literature. The preliminary model covers four main factors, namely, technological collaboration, organizational collaboration, customer collaboration and resource collaboration. Managers from four entrepreneurial Chinese companies evaluated the model. Each of the four case companies had acquired innovations from external sources. Our empirical results indicate that the factors of partner matches/relationships, product champions, pioneer users and financial alliances tend to be more important than other factors. The managers also added two more factors, namely, government regulations and university support. This paper provides initial empirical evidence that demonstrates the multifaceted determinants of rapid commercialization of acquired innovations in the context of Chinese manufacturing. Our findings suggest that the innovative firms operating in China integrate technological collaboration, government policies and university research activities in order to facilitate commercialization of their acquired innovations. In summary, collaborations both inside and outside of companies are critical for successful commercialization.

J	Lee, JW				Lee, Jungwoo			From pouch to networks: KIPONet's growth and evolution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						systems development; critical success factors; growing systems; evolution; strategic decisions; business and IT alignment	E-GOVERNMENT	This study examines how an information system is being developed and subsequently nurtured in an organizational context. The focus is on revealing how the systems are being evolved from the initiation, through development, toward implementation and nurtured into more advanced stages of growth. The case covers developmental stages of the KIPONet system for the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), which is still growing and evolving. Extensive document review, and interviews of stakeholders followed by close observations revealed that critical success factors for systems development project are: (I) active user participation with executive support, (2) constant auditing and assessment, (3) flexible budget, (4) constant communication, and (5) intensive user training, and the source of these critical success factors is traceable back to the strategic decisions made at the initial stages of the project: (1) extensive benchmarking, (2) growing systems approach, and (3) open systems philosophy.

J	Tebboune, DES				Tebboune, D. E. Sofiane			The Rationale Behind Strategic Alliances in Application Service Provision	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						application service provision; case study research; strategic alliances		Application service provision, which consists of deploying, managing, and remotely hosting software applications through centrally located servers, is emerging as a new form of application outsourcing that is attractive to many sectors. Partnering in this context has gained major importance among practitioners and researchers. Although this article demonstrates the importance of strategic alliances for the development of the ASP model, the included cases display relatively contradicting ideas, where in one of the two illustrated cases strategic alliances were not part of the business model. This article establishes a discussion on the pre-formation phase of strategic alliances, focusing on the rationale behind entering strategic alliances, and offers a set of guidelines for ASPs to consider when entering the partnering arena.

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Yue			Strategic Management of International Subcontracting: A Transaction Cost Perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						corporate strategy; international subcontracting; multinational corporations; strategic planning; transaction cost		Research on international subcontracting has been policy-oriented and industry-focused. There is a lack of understanding of the phenomenon from strategic management and international business perspectives. This article conceptualizes international subcontracting as a type of relational contract formed by buyers and suppliers from different countries, aiming to facilitate the sourcing of products or components with buyer-specific requirements. It builds a transaction cost model for studying the strategic choice of international subcontracting as an intermediate governance structure, sitting between arm's length outsourcing arrangement and vertically integrated multinational enterprises (MNEs). A set of propositions are developed to aid future empirical research and to provide managers with some guidelines for organizing supply chain across borders. The model also allows managers to examine the complex nature of a range of subcontracting relationships and identify the specific mechanisms that can be used to preserve and manage the dyadic principal-subcontractor exchanges.

This knowledge-based approach to species management in Namibia focuses on anthologies and management strategies for high-value mammal species. To manage wildlife resources sustainably access to an appropriate knowledge base is essential. The strategic species management approach promotes planning on local, national, and international levels. A hypermedia Information System for Rare Species Management (IRAs) and a decision support system (Wildlife Introduction Advisor) are described. Unlike print media, which become dated, hypermedia is easily updated. The non-sequential nature of hypermedia allows information extraction according to the readers needs. Due to this flexibility hypermedia supports adaptive management and information sharing. Usability evaluation of the IRAs system disproved our assumption that established wildlife conservation categories such as habitat, distribution, and numbers are appropriate and sufficient to structure species information. This result led to a restructuring of the information according to management objectives. Evaluation of the Wildlife Introduction Advisor indicates that the model performs reliably and is robust towards input error. Human experts seem to be susceptible to bias.

J	Shiferaw, B; Bantilan, C; Wani, S				Shiferaw, Bekele; Bantilan, Cynthia; Wani, Suhas			Rethinking policy and institutional imperatives for integrated watershed management: Lessons and experiences from semi-arid India	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						institutional and policy issues; community watershed programs; environmental resources; investments	COLLECTIVE ACTION; COMMON PROPERTY; RESOURCE DEPLETION; EXTERNALITIES; POVERTY	This study investigates the institutional and policy issues that limit effective participation of resource users in community watershed programs and identifies key lessons for harnessing collective action and its effectiveness in achieving economic and environmental outcomes. It shows that spatial and temporal attributes of watersheds and the associated market failures that accelerate degradation of agricultural and environmental resources require innovative policy and institutional arrangements for coordinating use and management of resources. Under enabling policies, IWM can effectively contribute towards diversification of production into high-value products, reversal of resource degradation, growth in the incomes of the poor and enhance the ability to mitigate the effect of drought. However, the degree of biophysical and social complexity within watershed communities could often undermine incentives for collective action, thwart distribution of benefits against the landless and resource-poor households and even lead to depletion of groundwater resources. Governments and other stakeholders have a unique role to play in kick-starting the process of transformation through strategic natural resource and productivity-enhancing investments that strengthen local capacity for collective action and generate local public goods. Such collective investments could serve as building blocks for private productivity-enhancing and risk-mitigating investments as they boost profitability of productive assets (land and labor) and encourage farmer adoption of beneficial conservation practices. The lessons and experiences also show that integrating interventions along watershed frontiers would require a flexible learning alliance of institutions and cross-disciplinary teams with complementary skills and competencies.

Pointing to the IL situation in both academic and corporate context as well as in the context of business and management education, it emphasises that without a push of external help through financial aid and professional expertise. India would not be able to properly address, both the IL issue and the prerequisite issues of upgrading and developing their information and information systems infrastructure. It proposes strategy for addressing the IL issues which would help individual institutions to intensify and broaden their existing activities in the field of IL promotion and implementation and start new ones wherever necessary.

J	Natale, FP				Natale, Francesco Paolo			Optimisation in the presence of tail-dependence and tail risk: A heuristic approach for strategic asset allocation	JOURNAL OF ASSET MANAGEMENT			English	Article						asset allocation; copula; tail index; tail dependence; Monte Carlo methods		This paper presents a method to overcome the classical drawbacks of the Monte Carlo methods for the asset allocation, that is, resampling, deeply dependent on the multinormal assumption. This approach allows to set a derivative-free barrier against joint extreme negative returns (tail-dependence or contagion) and extreme (negative) returns (univariate tail risk) not considered in the multinormal framework. This barrier is set through an extensive use of copulas and Extreme Value Theory. The model has been applied on a sample of 11 euro-denominated asset classes with historical inputs. The weights have been tested on simulated (multivariate Student's t) returns and with real out-of-the sample returns. A comparison has been performed with the asset allocation given by the resampling method. The results provide evidence of a barrier against extreme negative returns occurring simultaneously. Furthermore, the model is totally distribution-free and therefore it does not involve any a priori decision on the marginal distributions for asset returns. The cost of this approach (loss of Sharpe ratio), in our example, is negligible.

J	Adham, KA				Adham, Khairul Akmaliah			INCUBATORS WITHIN UNIVERSITY AND CLUSTERED CONTEXTS: CASES OF NATIONAL CHIAO TUNG UNIVERSITY (NCTU) AND NATIONAL TSING HUA UNIVERSITY (NTHU) INCUBATORS IN HSINCHU, TAIWAN	ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						business incubator; university-based incubator; business cluster; NCTU Innovation Incubator; NTHU Innovation Incubator; Hsinchu; Taiwan		Research literature on business incubators has highlighted the significance of clustered locational contexts and networking as key to an incubator's success. Using the case study approach, this study aimed to test the validity of this framework for explaining the level of success of the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) and National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) Incubators in Hsinchu, Taiwan-both of which are highly-networked, cluster-centric and university-based. In-depth interviews were conducted with the managers of both incubators, and these were followed by information gathering on university patents and knowledge transfers from the research and development (R& D) office at each university. Analysis found that the incubators' locational contexts determined the degree and manner of their networking, but their profitability and growth potential were influenced by many other factors working in combination. Satisfying their sponsors' requirements and serving their core functions through sound management and strategic planning appeared to be the key to achieving profitability and sustainability, with benefits for all stakeholders. These constructs provide directions for more research on the performance of incubators and other business entities that are located within university and clustered contexts.

J	Bulley, C; Donaghy, M; Dow, C				Bulley, Catherine; Donaghy, Marie; Dow, Clare			Are physiotherapy guidelines for the management of osteoporosis being implemented? A UK-wide survey	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOTHERAPY			English	Article						Evaluation; guideline; osteoporosis; physiotherapy		The availability of increasing amounts of research has led to the development of clinical guidelines to facilitate evidence-based decisions. However, effective implementation must be evaluated. A survey was carried out to evaluate a clinical guideline for osteoporosis, endorsed by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP). A stratified proportional sample of 588 relevant National Health Service providers was selected from Strategic Health Authorities/Health Boards throughout the UK. Random samples of 31 independent hospitals and 102 private practitioners were obtained from lists of seven UKbased service providers and the CSP website. One hundred and twenty further surveys were sent through the clinical interest group, AGILE. The survey was developed to investigate awareness and use of the clinical guideline, current implementation strategies and barriers to implementation. Of the clinical sites sampled, 25% responded, giving 243 usable surveys. While guidelines were available in 62% of responding sites, only 35% reported its use - although this was higher in services with a primary osteoporosis caseload (45%). Only 6% reported formal implementation. Barriers to guideline use frequently highlighted a lack of resources and training. Survey responses indicate a lack of guideline use; this should be facilitated through formal implementation strategies, requiring training and resources.

Because agricultural biotechnology is closely connected with food, health, and resource technology industries, many countries are investing heavily in terms of both funding and talent to enhance their international competitiveness in this field. This research study was designed using the fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (FMCDM) model combining analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy theory and holding a specialists' conference to decide promising AgBio products with international competitiveness for use in guiding industrial development strategies and the allocation of R&D resources. The results show that the FMCDM model can effectively summarize the views of AgBio specialists for the purpose of selecting promising target industries. The research process was also used to explore the various target industries and assess key issues such as the causal relationship between criteria and industries' degree of development. Beyond helping decision-makers formulate policies and allocate resources, this information is also provided as a research reference in connection with market surveys and industrial development trends, etc.	[Chang, Yen-Ni; Hung, Chih-Young; Hsu, Chen-Ping] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Li, Ming-Teng] Natl Taiwan Univ, EMBA, Taipei, Taiwan		Chang, YN (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, Hsinchu, Taiwan.	yenni.mt92g@nctu.edu.tw			NSCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 93-2317-B-301-001]; Council of Agriculture (NSC) [93210117 C 040201a225000]	This study is deeply indebted to Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).

In this study we explore the relationships between IT application, strategic partnership and firm performance for a logistic service provider (LSP). The research model developed based on the literature results and the special characteristics of the LSP and validated using the structural equation modeling method. The data for model validation are collected by questionnaire survey from LSPs operating in Taiwan. Empirical analysis of the stratified sample results show that the application of IT has a positive influence on both strategic partnerships and firm performance. The mediating effect of strategic partnership on the relationship between IT application and firm performance is positive and partially supported. The reciprocal causal hypothesis, where only strategic partnership exerts a positive influence on firm performance, is partially supported. Finally, theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

This article studies the strategic approaches taken by Chinese lighter manufacturers when they were confronted with EU's barriers from its lighter standardization. After a brief survey on shortcomings of WTO/TBT agreement and the manifestation of proliferation of TBT worldwide, this article studies the approaches taken by different Chinese lighter manufacturers, borrowing the terms voice, compliance and exit from World Bank chief economist Jaffe and his team. Finally, a model of approaches is generalized for relative exporters' reference.

J	Dealtry, R				Dealtry, Richard			Interim reflections on the corporate university and SME academy business development innovation and its diffusion	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING			English	Article						Corporate universities; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Human resource management; Lifelong learning		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reflect on and inform about learning points from ECUANET, a two-year duration best practice action research and transnational networking project as it approaches its final stage. Design/methodology/approach - The paper explicates the key positive and obfuscating dynamics that the project team have had to, and will have to conjure with, in reaching its recommendations about the evolution of best practice in corporate university and enterprise academy design and management. The project partners have operated a voluntary or self selection process in their recruitment of corporate partner organisations to participate in the project action research case study work. The research methodology was based upon the corporate university blueprint architecture and browser toolkit to provide depth in practice evidence and a searchable database for comparative case to case practice evaluation of the key performance indicators (KPIs) Findings - It was found that the corporate university organisation and business development concept is a subject area which is either well understood by company management and education institutions or there is considerable confusion about its role and purpose. This comment does not apply comfortably and consistently universally as there are very different states of maturity, adoption and interpretation in the concept's development and practice across the world region by region. From a wide and diverse portfolio of companies and organisations who where invited to participate in the action research case studies those who accepted have one very important characteristic in common: they are all intensively engaged in managing a major innovation, i.e. they already have the commitment and fortitude to making new ideas work in practice. The experience of this project confirms that to be successful in this turbulent era of intensive new learning management, there needs to be continuous commitment to engendering innovation diffusion in both strategic and tactically inspired new learning process management. In addition it also demands serious reflection about the creative nature of the learning leadership role and also the style of its management. Originality/value - The a priori browser based corporate university blueprint model architecture employed in the empirical case study research mode proved to have both the depth and flexibility to provide a high quality evaluative framework and capture all the dynamics relating to the key variables in good corporate university design and management. The data base of case foundation information, KPIs and best practice outcomes will be one of the most comprehensive and world class quality reference sources published to date.

Maximising performance gains from cooperative marketing: understanding the role of environmental contexts	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cooperative marketing; Contingency theory; Internal and external environments; Performance		Understanding the situational relevance of strategy is vital given that strategies have varying utilities under different environmental settings which result in performance variations. Research remains silent regarding the situational relevance of cooperative marketing strategy implementation whereby performance outcomes are maximised. Through quantitative survey results, we explore the relationship between cooperative marketing and performance outcomes across varying environmental contexts (internal and external environments). While past studies acknowledge the importance of an open systems' perspective and the influence of the environment on strategic outcomes, they fall prey to key shortcomings such as a reductionist perspective and inadequate measurement. We provide an insight into the environment-strategy-performance relationship by using a holistic environmental approach and detailing the environments conducive to co-marketing strategy implementation. Managerial implications and future directions for research are also provided in the paper.

A MCDM APPROACH FOR MIDDLEMEN EVALUATION AND SELECTION IN MARKETING	SERBIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Middlemen selection; Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM); Fuzzy TOPSIS		Our aim is to present a MCDM approach to deal with the middlemen selection problem in marketing (distribution channel). During recent years evaluating and selecting appropriate middlemen for the firm has become a strategic issue in marketing. How to select middlemen is a typical multi criteria decision-making problem. To deal with this type of complex and unstructured problems various qualitative and quantitative factors must be taken into consideration. To evaluate these factors a multi criteria decision-making approach will be proposed and shown with an example to highlight the procedure of the proposed method.	[Dikmen, F.

A tale of two technologies: the financial chapter	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						disruptive technology; value chain analysis; life cycle costing; financing; corporate venturing; R&D partnership	VALUE CHAIN; INDUSTRY	Disruptive technology upsets the status quo by revolutionising the way customer needs are met. An intriguing aspect of this type of technology is that it is often developed and marketed by relative 'newcomers' to an industry and not by its leading firms. Researchers have proposed many strategic and marketing reasons for this pattern of innovation. In this paper, we explore how accounting standards and their consequent financial effects influence firms' decisions to invest internally in 'sustaining technology' and through joint ventures or research partnerships in 'disruptive technologies'. We illustrate that hi-tech companies use a combination of strategies for R&D investments.

J	Elenurm, T; Terk, E; Andresoo, J				Elenurm, Tiit; Terk, Erik; Andresoo, Jan			Cooperation patterns between capital owners and managers in the strategic management process: Case Estonia	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Strategic management; Capital; Corporate governance		Purpose - The purpose of this research is to empirically describe the division of strategic roles between owners and managers and its change when moving from the post-privatisation transition stage of 1995-1999 to the European integration stage of 2000-2004. Design/methodology/approach - The design takes the form of interviews with owners and top managers, questionnaire on managers' risk aversion, discussions in focus groups. A peculiarity of the study was a broad approach to owners-managers interplay in strategy building and strategic decision making. Findings - At least three patterns of role distribution could be observed in the owners' and managers' strategy development cooperation. Corporate governance (CG) culture in enterprises has improved, but the managers' freedom of action in strategy forming, especially in foreign-owned companies, has not increased with the improvement and stabilisation of business environment, contrary to what could be presumed. Research limitations/implications - Any limitations are due to predominantly qualitative nature of the research. Practical implications - The paper enables one to better understand limitations to firms' behaviour caused by CG and to better target respective consulting and training programmes. Originality/value - The paper presents joint treatment of CG and strategy issues. It is one of the first attempts in post-socialist countries to determine dynamics of CG beyond publicly traded companies.

J	Emanatian, M; Delaney, D				Emanatian, Michele; Delaney, David			What message does 'send a message' send?	JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND POLITICS			English	Article						metonymy; metaphor; war; propaganda; political discourse; rhetorical displacement; euphemism; rationality	METAPHOR	The violent acts of post-modern war are sometimes represented as long-distance communication. This paper examines the phrase send a message and others like it when used to refer to bombings, firing missiles, shooting civilians, etc. The metonymic reduction of killing and destroying to communication promotes message-sending as the single goal of a military enterprise. We provide relevant historical, cultural and political contexts that account for this increasingly prevalent framing: the imperatives of justifying aggressive war in a Post-Nuremburg international legal order; the emergence and intensification of "message culture"; and the increased strategic importance of "perception management" and "information warfare". The paper includes a richly illustrated analysis of the metonymic structure of send a message and its relationship to the common, well-studied metaphor for communication, "the conduit". We argue that the use of send a message to describe acts of violence does more than simply euphemize: it positions the message-senders as rational agents engaged in communicative action; and it displaces responsibility for suffering onto those who "fail to get the message".

J	Greasley, A				Greasley, Andrew			Using simulation to assess the introduction of technology in a continuous operations process	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Production processes; Simulation; Automation		Purpose - To investigate the role of simulation in the introduction of technology in a continuous operations process. Design/methodology/approach - A case-based research method was chosen with the aim to provide an exemplar of practice and test the proposition that the use of simulation can improve the implementation and running of conveyor systems in continuous process facilities. Findings - The research determines the optimum rate of re-introduction of inventory to a conveyor system generated during a breakdown event. Research limitations/implications - More case studies are required demonstrating the operational and strategic benefits that can be gained by using simulation to assess technology in organisations. Practical implications - A practical outcome of the study was the implementation of a policy for the manual re-introduction of inventory on a conveyor line after a breakdown event had occurred. Originality/value - The paper presents a novel example of the use of simulation to estimate the re-introduction rate of inventory after a breakdown event on a conveyor line. The paper highlights how by addressing this operational issue, ahead of implementation, the likelihood of the success of the strategic decision to acquire the technology can be improved.

J	Gutl, C				Guetl, Christian			Enhancements of meeting information management and application for knowledge access and learning activities	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						meeting information system; electron meeting system; multimodal information extraction; meeting information retrieval and visualization		Communication processes have become increasingly important in modern working life. Organizations invest a surprisingly high amount of financial resources and employee work time in both face-to-face and virtual meetings, yet this investment often produces poor results. To overcome this problem, research on technology-based support over a meeting's life-cycle has been increasingly conducted in recent decades. As a result of this research, particular interest has emerged in meeting information systems, which may include technology-enhanced meeting rooms as well as tools for multi-modal meeting recording, automatic meeting information extraction and annotation, in-meeting support, meeting information archiving, indexing, retrieval and visualization. Despite this great interest in and research activity on meeting information systems, insufficient focus has been paid into flexible architectures, interchangeability of meeting information as well as the integration into business processes and applications. This situation has motivated our research consortium to direct the research activity within the MISTRAL project towards a flexible and extendable system that can be easily integrated into daily working environments for knowledge access and learning activities. In this paper, we give an overview about electronic meeting systems, introduce related work on meeting information systems, outline the MISTRAL concept and its implementation, and based on that we discuss findings and problems with our research.

J	Hibbert, P; McInnes, P; Huxham, C; Beech, N				Hibbert, Paul; McInnes, Peter; Huxham, Chris; Beech, Nic			Characters in stories of collaboration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article						Narratives; Storytelling; Partnership; Strategic alliances; Joint ventures; United Kingdom	STORYTELLING ORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; PARTNERSHIPS; NARRATIVES; COMMUNITY; CONSTRUCT; NETWORKS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the ways in which narratives of collaborations tagged as successful may be constructed around common characterizations of participants, in order to provide insights to the ways in which stories may be constructed as vehicles for the adoption or adaptation of good or promising practices. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative interview data from three collaborative situations are analysed through a narrative-centred procedure with a particular focus on micro-stories. Findings - The paper provides a set of recurring characterizations observed within narratives of successful collaboration and their employment within the stories offered by collaborating partners. It also suggests the relationship that these characterizations might have to the stimulation or retardation of good collaborative practices. Research limitations/implications - The paper is derived from interviews in the UK context and extrapolation to other contexts seems plausible but should be conducted cautiously and with reflection. Originality/value - The particular style of narrative analysis conducted in this work has not been employed to the consideration of collaborative accounts and the characterizations derived may have utility as anchoring elements in stories of collaboration, helpful in both the elicitation and interpretation of such accounts.

Interestingly, greater attention is paid to assessing the development of policies and projects as well as to capacity building. Within this context in May 1999 the Global Environment Facility (GEF) approved a partnership between the GEF Secretariat and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in order to determine the strategic position for capacity building as new ecological issues appear. Currently projects for Capacity Assessment for Global Environment Management are being implemented in 21 European countries including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In Kyrgyzstan such projects began when the National Executive Agency of the Ministry of Ecology and Emergencies of the Kyrgyz Republic was appointed. The aim of self-assessment is to identify and analyse national priorities and needs for capacity increase at the individual, institutional and system levels which are necessary for the implementation of three global ecological conventions. Project main goals: (1) Assessment of priority, needs and identification of common problems within the framework of all the conventions; (2) Assessment of national country capacity in the area of implementation of the three conventions, (3) Preparation of the National Strategic Action Plan and (4) Strengthening of dialogue and cooperation among stakeholders.

Practices of Hong Kong building contractors in strategic asset allocation process: longitudinal approach	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Assets management; Functional analysis; Capital budgeting; Construction industry; Hong Kong		Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to report the investigation results of current practices of strategic asset allocation process, which consists of capital budget planning, monitoring, and control of Hong Kong building contractors. The changes of the said practices are compared with the results of the two similar surveys undertaken in the past longitudinally. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 157 questionnaires were sent to about 1,000 approved Hong Kong building contractors (classified as group A, B, C in accordance with their maximum capacities). The total response rate was 30.7 per cent. Statistical techniques, a two-dimensional contingency table, and discriminant function analysis (DA) were deployed to analyze the survey data via SPSS. Findings - Only the practice of a regular review of the minimum rate of return of major projects was popular. For monitoring aspect, 100 per cent of surveyed contractors monitor project performance once operational. The result of post-completion audits on major projects was 63 per cent. For the results of the longitudinal study, 66.7 per cent of group C firms employed the practices of intermediate and long-term capital budgets and 71.4 per cent of large firms had a formal body for screening investment proposals compared with 54.8 per cent and 63.3 per cent of the same group's practices in 1994 respectively. DA results showed that the patterns within the three different groups (A, B, and C) were very similar, and group A and group B were active in capital budgeting monitoring and control. Practical implications - Planning was the weakest and data showed that Hong Kong building contractors had tight control of the projects. Originality/value - This paper reports the investigation results of current practices of strategic asset allocation process, which consists of capital budget planning, monitoring, and control of Hong Kong building contractors.

This paper proposes a synthetic approach, which combines the strategic and operational planning tasks of the SC management. In this synchronized planning approach, the centralized coordination framework can consider the production and marketing preferences as well as customer service requirements, and make optimal strategic suggestions of the SC configuration and material flows with the minimal total SC cost. Moreover, the corresponding operational planning decisions for raw material management, production control, finished products stockpile control, and distribution control are also generated. Sensitivity analyses are performed to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the synchronized model under a wide range of SC planning scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed planning approach can assist the SC planner in designing the optimal SC system.

J	Lundin, RA				Lundin, Rolf A.			The beauty and the beast - on the creativity/project management encounter	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Television; Project management; Creative thinking		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on the creativity/project management (PM) encounter in TV production. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is prompted by several questions. Does the project work form constitute a threat to creativity, inventiveness or innovation in problem solving? Is it also indirectly a threat to development? Is PM the beast killing off much of the creativity, the beauty that exists in the world? Is it the other way around? Or what is the character of the encounter? Is there even an encounter? An ongoing study of TV production companies provides empirical illustrations to our reasoning. Findings - First, the PM focus on time performance in TV production can trigger innovative and creative responses to challenging targets because deadlines are good inspirations for creativity when time has to be compressed. Second, developing formats for TV production programs and series requires different PM creativity skills. Third, strategic development might be helped by a more strictly formulated PM procedure in order to activate attention to strategic issues in the turbulent industry. Originality/value - It is rare to obtain deep insights of the lived experience of PM in the TV industry in general and more recently evolving TV cases such as in Sweden. This case study adds to our knowledge base in a PM sector viewing itself as highly creative. It also introduces readers to the idea of developing TV formats as a project product and contrasts creativity in design or TV shows with creativity in producing them. Considering the ongoing "projectification" and the commonly held views on the needs for creativity in project work, the questions are more than relevant and need to be explored further and beyond mere lip service.

In the ICT age the introduction of a shopping/price comparison facility (Froogle) by a company with a search reputation as pre-eminent as Google leads to the expectation that it will allow comparison of products in terms not only of price but also of other aspects to an extent that appears to approach perfect information. Telecommunications and media companies and even retailers such as Wal-Mart increasingly see such initiatives as a competitive and strategic threat. This paper proposes a conceptual framework within which to analyse the strategic impact of consumer information channelled through global market search. In this we distinguish between information signals and knowledge indices arguing that the specific properties of information signals as distinct from knowledge indices and the critical role of intangibles place limits on the ability of purely fact-based search to eliminate 'friction' in markets.

J	Mrowka, M				Mrowka, Miroslaw			Historical cultural conditions of far eastern martial arts in the context of strategic management in modern industry of Japan and Korea	IDO MOVEMENT FOR CULTURE-JOURNAL OF MARTIAL ARTS ANTHROPOLOGY			Polish	Article						Concept Kaizen; Concept 5S; Kansai; Bushido Philosophy		In the face of progressing globalization and internationalization of economy various philosophies of enterprise management influence one another in a clearer and clearer way. Many managers try to adapt or implement at any cost an innovative system of management. Among many various strategic concepts it is difficult to anticipate which one is the best because it depends not only on economic but also political and social development. Nevertheless obeying strict rules, continuation and social bonds among the participants of economic development may indicate the way of development as well as direction and rules which should be assimilated. According to the author this is the aim of this article. Its objective is also to draw attention to the fact that new innovative methods of management do not have to be better and more efficient than the earlier ones with many centuries of cultural and philosophical tradition. That is why the value of enterprise culture as well as the relations between workers should be considered for the sake of understanding relations occurring within this structure on the example of historical conditions of the philosophy and the current of far eastern martial arts. For this purpose the author has accepted the method of elaboration based on wholesome approaches to the subject by particular authors and not on partial quotations of ideas.

Stakeholders' perception of the desired Master's program for Kenya in community health nursing: Areas of competency	JAPAN JOURNAL OF NURSING SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Council of Nursing Conference	2007	Yokohama, JAPAN			community health nursing; curriculum; education; graduate; Kenya	INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION; EDUCATION	Introduction: After the World Health Assembly approved the WHA 45.5 in 1992, which addressed the nursing shortage by refocusing nurses and midwives to meet community health needs, community demands for educated nurses and the needs of higher nursing education in developing countries increased. However, in developing countries that suffering from multiple resource deficiencies, such as Kenya, the strategic direction of higher education in nursing was unclear. Therefore, in Kenya, a major university school of nursing initiated a collaborative study with a well-established Japanese nursing college to determine the service-providers' perspective about upgrading the Master's community nursing curriculum. Purpose: The aim of the study was to describe the Kenyan stakeholders' perspective and the expected roles and abilities of Master's graduates in community nursing. Methods: This qualitative, cross-sectional study used convenience sampling to obtain 21 participants. The content analysis of the data was based on 19 semistructured interviews. Results: Sixteen categories and 42 subcategories were derived from the five key questions that related to the expectations of the Master's program. The Master's graduates were expected to acquire knowledge and skills relating to administration, management, epidemiology, research, and education. The participants recognized that epidemiology, important for preventive care, was minimal among the current community health nurses. Also, Master's graduates must be prepared to manage health programs. Conclusion: The stakeholders expected that Master's graduates would become leaders in community health nursing, with a broad range of knowledge and skills, most notably in the areas of management and administration, epidemiology, and research. Those abilities should be reflected in the curriculum content.

Strategic framework for IT education and research at Sofia University	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						higher education reforms; challenges for researchers and organizations; collaboration with stakeholders		Purpose: The paper focuses on the challenges for Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (FMI) of Sofia University. It tries to provide an answer to the main questions - how to use the best practice of a leading universities in order to link the main research and academic faculty goals to specific problems to be planed and implemented; how to support the faculty executives for making better decisions, and resource allocation choices. The purpose of the paper is to present the FMI approach and the FMI strategy maps for research and education. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined several scientific methods and techniques used in strategic management, and created their own approach for modeling, design and implementation in education and research environment, which is presented in the paper. Findings: The main findings of a SWOT analysis, modeling and environmental survey are given in the paper. It presents the strategic priorities and the challenges for FMI to keep its position as a leading research and education centre in ICT in Bulgaria and to compete in the global educational environment. Practical implications: The authors believe that the described model and strategy will support FMI and its staff to take strategic management decisions, to focus their efforts on the most relevant topics, and to create competitive educational and research environment. Originality/value: The paper shows how to develop the faculty strategy. It demonstrates clearly that academic research and education processes can achieve significant improvements in cost, quality and service using a strategic management approach. The added value of the FMI strategy is in integrating knowledge, experience, best practices and tools within one new master program design. The FMI approach described in the paper can be used for strategic management in universities and research organisations.

The chess master's game A model for incorporating local police agencies in the fight against global terrorism	POLICING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICE STRATEGIES & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Indoor games; Police; Terrorism; Strategic planning	COUNTER-TERRORISM	Purpose - The aim of this paper is to review chess as a model for incorporating local police agencies in the fight against global terrorism. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the literature concerning the nature of terrorist organizations, as well as recent literature that suggests that new methods are required to design a broad protective network with a common purpose. Findings - The paper suggests that, rather than merely relying upon the development of new technologies, greater emphasis should be placed on overcoming the social and structural barriers to complete interoperability. Practical implications - Practitioners should thoughtfully consider this paper and work to alleviate or minimize those barriers and impediments to complete interoperability. Originality/value - This paper will benefit both students and practitioners of counter terrorism, insofar as it defines the proper role of local police agencies and reinforces the need for a common understanding and a united effort to protect society.

LEASING AS A STRATEGIC FINANCING OPTION: THE NAVY'S MARITIME PREPOSITIONED SHIPS EXPERIENCE	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT			English	Article								Recently, leasing has been prominent in the press due to the Air Force's recent ill-fated attempt to obtain the use of Boeing re-fueling tankers. Forgotten is that, in the early 1980's, a highly controversial Navy long-term leasing program of Maritime Prepositioned Ships had a different result. However, an unintended consequence of the Navy's success was that future government leases were practically eliminated. This research examines the issues and parties involved in this unprecedented creative and innovative leasing program for ships used by the Navy's Military Sealift Command. While the analysis concludes that the Navy's leasing program was successful and cost effective, laws and policies were changed so that long-term leasing is no longer viable for the strategic financing of military requirements. The case is presented here that existing laws and regulations should be reconsidered so that leased military resources can once again be used to provide and maintain national security.

This paper first analyzes the measurement model of modern credit risk, and then it proposes the selection model of collaborative credit-granting guaranty techniques grounded on capital property pricing, and some important conclusions are further reached on the basis of the empirical studies. Meanwhile, n-tier expansion is constructed for the collaborative credit-granting monitoring mechanism grounded on AVE. Under this mechanism, the credit risk in the AVE enterprises can be optimized; and the AVE chain matches the working mechanisms in their capacities of real-time resource sharing, n-tier resource allocation, mission assignment, control and supervision. In the end, the distance management and risk blockage could be accomplished on the supply chains in all the AVE enterprises by forming a strong self-organized and self-control working chain, and the research orientation is indicated by integrating this mechanism with AVE-based Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) working system.

J	Wang, LFS; Wang, C				Wang, Leonard Fong-Sheng; Wang, Chin			Brand proliferation and inter-brand competition The strategic role of transfer pricing	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						Transfer pricing; Brands; Brand management; International business; International trade	PRODUCT PROLIFERATION; DIVISIONALIZATION; INCENTIVES; RULES	Purpose - This paper first attempts to analyze the issue of brand proliferation by a monopolist allowing transfer pricing as a channel to bridge headquarters and brand divisions, and then to view how the headquarters uses transfer pricing as a strategic device to encounter intra-brand competition, inter-brand competition and cross-border profit-shifting under an oligopolistic market. Design/methodology/approach - This paper models cross-country interactions in a Cournot-Nash framework, and characterizes equilibrium that involves both transfer pricing and output decision. MNE's behavior is based on a two-stage process in which the centralized headquarters' prior action on setting transfer pricing is to backup the decentralized subsidiaries in their output decision-making. Findings - It is demonstrated that MNEs have the incentive to manipulate their transfer prices in order to shift profit cross-border. Higher transfer pricing enables brand divisions to collude easier in the intra-brand competition model, and the level of transfer price hinges upon the strength of intra-brand competition and inter-brand competition. In addition, transfer pricing is affected by tax differences between two countries. Originality/value - This paper provides the theoretical underpinning to see how headquarters may use transfer pricing as a strategic device to face intra-and inter-brand competition that is visibly evident in many diverse industries.

J	Wu, CR; Lin, CT; Lin, YF				Wu, Cheng-Ru; Lin, Chin-Tsai; Lin, Yu-Fan			What forms of the bancassurance alliance model is customers' preference?	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Banks; Insurance companies; Strategic alliances; Decision making; Supply chain management; Taiwan		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and evaluate the relationships among the flexibility enablers and to prepare a hierarchy of these enablers to know their influences over each other in global supply chain. The framework suggests that the priority of enablers in supply chain should be determined on the basis of their driving power and dependency. Design/methodology/approach - Various enablers used by researchers and practitioners for flexibility management of global supply chain have been identified. These enablers have been classified as strategic, operational and performance-based enablers. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) is used to establish mutual relationships among the flexibility enablers and to prepare a hierarchy-based model. Findings - It has been observed that some enablers having high-driving power and low dependency are of strategic importance. These enablers require more attention while other enablers based on operations and performances are dependents of strategic enablers. Practical implications - The index of enablers based on driving power and dependency provide an insight for supply chain managers to make the entire supply chain highly flexible, that would help them to respond to global uncertainties. Originality/value - Presentation of enablers in the form of hierarchy using ISM and ranking them into various driving power and dependent categories is a good effort to make flexible global supply chain.

Balanced scorecard (BSC) within IQM model becomes a catalyst of business success for a modern organization by focusing on organizational variables - business strategy, organization structure and corporate culture. BSC is the leading system of performance tracking and strategy implementation, consistent with other management concepts and methods for managing process improvement. Through BSC, IQM processes' activities correlate with organisation business results. BSC management processes enable integration of all decision-making levels, from institutional via strategic to operative, in the process starting from planing, i.e. formulating and implementation of strategy, to feedback by performance measurement and control.

Over the first decade of Welch's leadership, there was no improvement in GE's real ROE. However, there was market value increase, and later there were improvements in both measures due to declining competition. Over 90% of variances in real profitability and comparative market value were explained using measures often considered in strategy-changes in competitive environment, leadership and corporate culture, labor relations and plant closings, and economic and financial environments. It appears that systematic appraisal of corporations can aid understanding of factors that determine profitability and market value.

Real-value accounting for profitability and regressions over the 25 year history of the company led to QCA studies of further US companies with students at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Loyola College and to QCA studies of German companies with students at the University of Greifswald, Technical University of Braunschweig, and University of Bremen. In the early 1970s, Professors Martin J. Bailey, Stanley Engerman, and Robert W. Fogel at the University of Rochester had provided necessary econometric and cliometric procedures. Since the late 1980s at Loyola, collaboration with Dr. Timothy Edlund formalized QCA for strategic management. Over 1996-1997, studies of German companies were supported in part by a Fulbright Teaching/Research grant at Greifswald. Later at Brauschweig Dr. Klaus Lindert helped develop comparable accounting information for German firms, and corporate archivists at Hoechst and Volkswagen provided historical and financial information back to the origins of their firms. Data for the German economy over time were obtained from the Statistisches Bundesamt in Wiesbaden. In the early 2000s, work with financial expert Steven Prumo led to methods to fully volume-weight and otherwise adjust yearly stock prices, allowing year-by-year time-series evaluation of market value and relative market value.

It combines affordability with an active and engaging pedagogical model. The self-management of the groups is a key point as it make possibile to reduce the tutor's workload: in this way one tutor could monitor more groups and/or engage in longer courses. But how to evaluate the collaborative work in online groups? Stated that a typical tool for online collaborative work is the threaded web forum, in this paper we propose a quantitative methodology for evaluating effective collaborative interactions. This work is applied to the Moodle add-on module Forum Plus, but it is partially suitable for every threaded web forum.

J	Ciptono, WS				Ciptono, Wakhid Slamet			HIERARCHICAL LEVEL OF MANAGERS' ABILITIES A Moderator between Quality Management Practices and Company Financial Performance	GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						company performance; critical factors of quality management practices; hierarchical level of managers' abilities; operational excellence practices; world-class company practices		This study investigates the moderating impacts of hierarchical level of managers' abilities on the form and strength of all structural relationships between quality management practices and company financial performance. This study describes the structural relation- ships among the research constructs six critical factors of quality management practices (quality improvement program, supervisory leadership, supplier involvement, management commitment, training to improve products/services, cross functional relationships); the contextual factors of oil and gas companies world-class performance in operations (world-class company practices, operational excellence practices, company non-financial performance); and company financial performance. It uses a sample of 1,332 managers in 140 strategic business units (SBUs) within 49 oil and gas companies operating in Indonesia. The empirical results indicate that the goodness-of-fit of the unconstrained model is much better than that of the constrained model, and this is an indicator that hierarchical level of managers' abilities moderates all structural relationships among the research constructs. Hence, the hierarchical level of managers' abilities acts as a moderating variable of the whole model (i.e. , among critical factors of quality management practices, world-class company practices, operational excellence practices, company non-financial performance, and company financial performance). It means that the major contribution of the hierarchical level of managers' abilities is how to make changes in the organizational system. Top level managers' abilities are deemed the most capable of making significant changes because of their broad sources of power and influence. Conversely, lower level managers' abilities find it more difficult making significant changes in the system because of bureaucratic control processes that limit their actions powerlessness or a chronic lack of autonomy. Compared to the hierarchical level of managers' abilities, the degree of autonomy may be a more comprehensive contribution in reference to managers ' abilities to influence an organizational system. Autonomy may not only act as a person enhancer to increase internal work motivation, but it may also serve to moderate the extent to which individuals are able to significantly influence a system. In addition, involvement and empowerment of all organizational members (including managers) in cooperative and collaborative (interactive) efforts to achieve quality improvements appear to be a key element to TQM. Results further reveal that world-class performance in operations (world-class company practices, operational excellence practices, and company non-financial performance) positively mediates the impact of critical factors of quality management practices on company financial performance. Results also point out that three out of six critical factors of quality management practices are positively associated with world-class company practices and operational excellence practices under the moderating of hierarchical level of managers' abilities. World-class company practices and operational excellence practices have direct and significant effects on company non-financial performance. Furthermore, empirical results suggest that there is a positive and significant relationship between company non-financial performance and company financial performance.

J	FitzPatrick, RC; Chu, H				FitzPatrick, Richard C.; Chu, Hung			The Rise and Demise of Defined Benefit Pension Plans	EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND RIGHTS JOURNAL			English	Article						competition; labor-management relations; pension analysis; pension plans; power		The Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DBPP), once regarded as the gold standard of traditional corporate pension plans, has fallen upon hard times. Corporate sponsors regard the plans as financial drains, fountains of bad publicity, and targets for heavy-handed government regulation. Employees covered by the plans fear they will not deliver on the promises employers made to provide financial security after retirement. Legislative fixes for the system have hastened, not slowed down, the exodus of employers from DBPP. The authors of this paper agree that DBPP is, indeed, an endangered species in the private sector, but concur with the criticism that the conventional explanations for it - particularly in the trade literature - tend be self-serving, superficial and not convincing and often incomplete in their analysis. Using Porter's model of competition to identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of competing influences we endorse the conclusion that the failure of DBPP is one of strategic choice by employers whose power and influence in the global economy is not effectively counter-balanced by labor, or by forces sympathetic to labor. The growing trend towards the Defined Contribution Pension Plan (DCPP) is consonant with employers' interests but a setback for employees who had to give up the "gold standard" (DBPP). Even the paradoxical effect of ERISA hastening the demise of the pension system it was created to reform is less puzzling when examined in the context of who had influence in drafting the legislation, writing regulations and enforcing the law.

J	Haas, C; Waugh, L; Froese, T				Haas, Carl; Waugh, Lloyd; Froese, Thomas			History and renaissance of construction engineering and management in Canada	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article								Understanding the history of the construction engineering and management discipline in Canada can perhaps shed light on where the future of the discipline may lay and on external perceptions of the discipline. In its current state, the discipline in Canada is a unique model. Examining its positive and negative attributes will help inform strategic planning for construction research and education programs in Canada and in other countries as they adapt to rapid changes in their environments. The objective of this paper is to present sufficient information to make that examination possible. Its scope is limited to the last 200 years. Early pioneers in the discipline are described. Their careers are reflected in the developments that are summarized in the following discussion of the emergence of professional societies, and the educational and research infrastructure of the discipline in Canada. Recent developments in education and research are examined in more detail. Some final observations are then made based on this brief history.

J	Hinson, R; Boateng, R				Hinson, Robert; Boateng, Richard			PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND MANAGEMENT COMMITMENT TO E-BUSINESS USAGE IN SELECTED GHANAIAN TOURISM FIRMS	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						Tourism; E-business; Ghana		We set out in this article to generate a preliminary understanding of the benefits of e-business to tourism firm players in Ghana. We also sought to ascertain the commitment of top management to e-business development in Ghanaian tourist firms. We investigate our research issues by surveying 60 tourism firms. Of the 60 questionnaires we administered, 43 were deemed usable and we report our findings by means of descriptive statistics. We find that in conformance with the theory of planned behaviour, top management commitment, perceived strategic value of e-business and organizational readiness are critical to e-business adoption. In spite of the fact that e-business holds the promise of delivering benefits to Ghana tourism firms, their understanding of e-business/ICT still remains at an operational level. The value of this study lies in the fact that it is one of the few studies focussing on e-business adoption in the West African tourism sector, in spite of the growing importance of this sector.

Assessing uncertainty in outsourcing clinical services at tertiary health centers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						organizational change; decision making; strategic planning; tertiary health center; outsourcing	CARE	When tertiary health centers face capacity constraint, one feasible strategy to meet service demand is outsourcing clinical services to qualified community providers. Clinical outsourcing enables tertiary health centers to meet the expectations of service timeliness and provides good opportunities to collaborate with other health care providers. However, outsourcing may result in dependence and loss of control for the tertiary health centers. Other parties involved in clinical outsourcing such as local partners, patients, and payers may also encounter potential risks as well as enjoy benefits in an outsourcing arrangement. Recommendations on selecting potential outsourcing partners are given to minimize the risks associated with an outsourcing contract. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF EXECUTIVE SKILLS IN AN EU COUNTRY	JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP STUDIES			English	Article							JOB-PERFORMANCE; COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTIONS; PERSONALITY; ATTITUDES	Corporate executives constitute the highest echelon of the managerial hierarchy, responsible for implementing the strategic plans and policies established by the board of directors on an operational basis. Often the inquiry about executive skills evolves around the search for managerial skills. Executive skills form a distinct category of skills; however, they are often conceived as a set of managerial skills. This article presents the results of an extended survey concerning executive skills based in empirical measurements among executives in Greece. International literature suggests a wide range of executive skills. Based on this, a list of 42 skills, divided into six categories, was created. This list was evaluated by 110 executives of the larger corporations in Greece. Using a structured assessment methodology, skills and categories were assessed and validated. Then, factor analysis was applied to these results and a set of 11 executive skills synthesized from this work. Findings are discussed and compared with those of other surveys, and topics for further research are set out.

The goal of the article is to assess the impact of the information technology, policies and procedures, collaboration, funding, management, human resources development, preservation, marketing and information service delivery strategies on the modernization of its library and information services (LIS). It is argued that UNISWA has effected considerable staff re-skilling and made some progress towards widening access to quality subscription based electronic resources and optimizing the utilization of open access materials. Implementation was negatively influenced by low funding, limited local content on the web, inadequate information and communication technology infrastructure, scarce professional skills, and restrictive policies and procedures. It concludes that further work revolving around the above factors, taking into account user needs for independent life long learning, is the key to deepening the modernization of LIS at UNISWA.

J	Venter, WDF				Venter, W. D. Francois			The South African National Strategic Plan: What does it mean for our health system?	SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIV MEDICINE			English	Article								South Africa has a new and highly ambitious guiding document to comprehensively deal with HIV over the next 5 years, the National Strategic Plan (NSP)(1) (Table 1). The country has an HIV problem resulting in huge mortality and morbidity, with an associated tuberculosis crisis, a growing orphan population, and a range of well-clocurricrited adverse social and economic impacts.(2) In 2000 the South African government, under siege internationally for its denialist President and combative Health Minister, hurriedly unveiled its 5-year programme for HIV. The plan was vague and committed the government to very little of substance, and its soft wording contrasted with the strong and clearly defined advocacy campaigns around prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision, nutrition and unscientific supplements. In 2003, the release of the ART component of the Operational Plan for Comprehensive HIV and AIDS Care, Management, and Treatment resulted in 3 the provision of antiretroviral treatment throughout the country over the next 4 years.(3) The original Plan expired in 2005, but it was only when the absence of an updated version was highlighted in the media, that the Department of Health began responding by drawing up a new Plan. An initial very rough draft, released after some consultation with special interest groups in the middle of 2006, rapidly attracted civil society interest and mobilisation, as well as strong media interest.

Strategic planning of preparedness budgets for wildland fire management	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							PROTECTION	As part of the prototyping effort for the preparedness module (PM) of the Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system that IBM developed for five U.S. federal agencies, we designed and implemented an optimization model for determining budgets necessary,for managing wildland fires during the initial response period. For a given budget, the model uses a mixed-integer linear optimization approach to maximize the number of acres managed (i.e., land protected from fire damage as a result of the initial response). The model is solved iteratively to establish a function that maps best achievable effectiveness, in terms of acres managed, at different budget levels. To handle the computationally prohibitive size of the resulting model instances we devised a heuristic-based solution approach, and we reformulated the client's original model by switching to a continuous time domain and introducing piecewise-linearized functions. As a result, we not only built a tractable model, but also succeeded in delivering a performance speedup of more than 150 fold. We also conducted validation experiments for certain assumptions in the model to assess their impact on the solution quality.

J	Spennemann, DHR				Spennemann, Dirk			A Line in the Sand? Explorations of the Cultural Heritage Value of Hominid, Pongid, and Robotid Artifacts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL PROPERTY			English	Article							STONE TOOL-MAKING; PAN-PANISCUS; GREAT APES; EVOLUTION; TRANSMISSION; CAPABILITIES; ORANGUTANS; CHIMPANZEE; PRIMATES; CHIMPS	Although cultural heritage management is an inherently retrospective discipline, there is a need for strategic forward thinking. Too many valuable heritage places have been lost because they are not recognized and assessed in time. As cultural heritage management begins to examine modern structures and sites, this paper takes strategic thinking in cultural heritage management one step further and addresses the management of artifactual material created by our closest relatives, the great apes. Given the increasing understanding that chimpanzees have cultures and traditions in tool use, there is a need to recognize their heritage value in reference to human evolution. Expanding the concept of nonhuman heritage into the future, it is now also time to explore how to deal with the artifacts that the first artificial intelligence (AI)-imbued, self-reflecting robots will create. By extension, which artifacts will be kept along the way? The contemplation of the role of nonhuman heritage will ultimately foster a reappraisal of human heritage. The article outlines some of the conceptual issues that must be addressed if our heritage is to have an ethical future.

J	Ben Letaifa, S; Perrien, J				Ben Letaifa, Soumaya; Perrien, Jean			The Impact of E-CRM on Organisational and Individual Behavior: The Effect of the Remuneration and Reward System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						customer; behavior; e-CRM; relationship; remuneration	KNOWLEDGE COMPETENCE; IMPLEMENTATION; PERSPECTIVE; BANKING	This article examines how electronic customer relationship management (e-CRM) has affected both organizational and individual behavior in a leading Canadian bank. The innovative and customer-driven culture of this bank pushed it toward early adoption of e-CRM technology. The findings emphasize the role played by many strategic and organizational dimensions in the success of e-CRM implementation. In fact, to make e-CRM efforts pay off, new business processes are required to achieve more effective and closer interactions with customers. The shift toward customer orientation needs to be supported by a shift in organizational objectives and processes. The results indicate that employees' individual behavior successfully changed from a transactional to a relational perspective and that training and coaching ensured a successful integration of e-CRM technology. Nevertheless, the employee reward and evaluation system, which should have been changed to leverage CRM impact, has surprisingly been forgotten. This deficiency is addressed by proposing a new framework for enhancing e-CRM effectiveness.

J	Symonds, J				Symonds, Judith			Palming the Future: E-Government Strategy Development for a Tertiary Education Organisation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						case study; e-commerce in SMEs; e-commerce strategy; electronic commerce; governmental IS; management issues; strategic planning		Trans Training(1) is a tertiary education organisation concerned with the provision of quality driving training for the commercial road transport, logistics, distribution, warehousing, ports and stevedoring industry sectors. At present much of their service delivery to agents, clients and trainees is administered manually. This process is slow, inefficient and allows many opportunities for errors to creep into the enrolment process. eGovernment offers the Industry Training Organisation the potential for improved service delivery and client and trainee satisfaction as well as several interesting value-adding opportunities. However, there are several challenges to adopting an eGovernment strategy including security concerns, privacy concerns and acceptance of coordination of technological investments. Many of the challenges for eGovernment strategy occur at the point where theory is applied by individual organisations and this is not covered by the literature. Readers are given the opportunity to explore some of the realities of eGoverment strategy in this case study.

ADDING ETHICAL CONSIDERATION TO THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS: A Leadership Challenge	JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP STUDIES			English	Article								Stakeholder analysis offers a well-established framework for understanding organizational context and environment. Stakeholder analysis also offers a lens through which ethical considerations can be consciously evaluated and included in organizational decision making. In this article, the author offers a brief overview of the ethics literature and then examines the decision-making process to identify how and when opportunities arise to include ethical considerations into the decision-making process. He concludes by offering suggestions on how leaders might improve their ethical decision-making by using a more macro and strategic stakeholder lens.

J	Peffer, G; Llacay, B				Peffer, Gilbert; Llacay, Barbara			Higher-Order Simulations: Strategic Investment Under Model-Induced Price Patterns	JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION			English	Article						Financial Markets; Multi-Agent Simulation; Performativity; Higher-Order Strategies		The trading and investment decision processes in financial markets become ever more dependent on the use of valuation and risk models. In the case of risk management for instance, modelling practice has become quite homogeneous and the question arises as to the effect this has on the price formation process. Furthermore, sophisticated investors who have private information about the use and characteristics of these models might be able to make superior gains in such an environment. The aim of this article is to test this hypothesis in a stylised market, where a strategic investor trades on information about the valuation and risk management models used by other market participants. Simulation results show that under certain market conditions, such a 'higher-order' strategy generates higher profits than standard fundamental and momentum strategies that do not draw on information about model use.

Cyber extension communication : A strategic model for agricultural and rural transformation in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						cyber extension communication; model; transformation; information technology; farmers; rural development		The cyber extension system focuses the overall development of the farms including production, management, marketing and other rural developmental activities, thus conceptualizing an extension communication model and defining anything that can be fit into this model, as cyber communication was felt necessary to explain the framework for the study of internet communication. The Cyber Extension Communication model centers around information received by farm owners from different sources and the same can also be simplified by easy to follow text and audio-visual illustrations in local languages and can be displayed on bulletin board at kiosks. In Cyber Extension Communication model, the information transmission from the source to community information centers will be under public domain, while from community information centers to farmers the information is available under private domain. The potential advantages of Cyber Extension Communication are continuously available, information rich, instant international reach, receiver-oriented approach, individualism and saves money, time and efforts.

Landscaping services adoption by organisations in Malaysia: a strategic response to sustainable development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovation diffusion theory; landscaping adoption; Malaysia; organisational buying behaviour; organisations; societal marketing concept		The societal marketing concept advocates the conduct of marketing activities at the societal (or environmental) well-being. Among the waysapproached by firms, this concept includes landscaping. Adopting the theory of organisational buying behaviour and the innovation diffusion theory, this paper examines the factors that discriminate between organisational adopters and non-adopters of this societal marketing strategy. About 94 organisations provided the data for the study. The results show that environmental factors such as economic outlook, government influence, competitive development and public scrutiny are important dimensions. In addition, organisational factors namely, organisation's size, organisation's people, environmental sensitivity, cost implication and management factors such as attitude and intention are sufficient for discriminating between adopters and non-adopters. Lastly, relative advantage, compatibility and complexity are significant dimensions from the innovation diffusion theory.	[Chukwunonso, N. C.; Ndu, N. N.

J	Cummings, S				Cummings, Stephen			Shifting foundations: redrawing strategic management's military heritage	CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS			English	Article						Strategic management; History; Deconstruction; Heritage		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the limitations of what the field of strategic management sees as its military foundations. Design/methodology/approach - Categorizes and synthesizes the critical historical approach of Michel Foucault and uses this to interrogate assumptions made about military approaches to strategy in the strategic management literature. Findings - Suggests that there is a much broader range of military approaches to strategy than that which has been seen as a foundation stone of strategic management, and that drawing on this broader range of perspectives can encourage new thinking about strategic management. Research implications/limitations - While the historical survey upon which this hypothesis is developed is by no means exhaustive, it should encourage further investigation of different approaches to military strategy and how these might be applied to think differently in business settings. Practical implications - This paper should encourage practitioners to question their often overly simplistic views of military strategy and to see this arena as a potentially rich seam of ideas that could be applied in business. Originality/value - This is the first journal article to develop a clear method that draws on the many strands of Foucault's historical approach and apply this to fruitfully deconstruct a particular aspect of the field of management's assumed heritage.

J	Tommaso, MR; Rubini, L				Di Tommaso, Marco R.; Rubini, Lauretta			Industrial policy for 'new' industries in 'old' Europe: virtual cluster in genetics in Italy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cluster; genetics; industrial policy; industry; manufacturing		Many European countries are facing new competitive pressures by countries such as China or India. In this context, Italy seems to be squeezed between these new competitors specialised on traditional sectors and the difficulties of entering new high tech industries. This paper focuses on the strategic industrial policy options that Italy may have to guarantee its future capacity of producing wealth by participating in the transnational value chain, without being progressively marginalised. With this premise, we present the case of the genetic research sector in the Emilia Romagna region (Italy). We focus on this sector firstly because of the great potentialities it has recently been showing; secondly because its development could be an example of how to encourage the structural adjustment of an 'Old Europe' region looking for answers to new international challenges; thirdly because the region has a latent knowledge pool in genetics that does not seem to be properly exploited.

J	Essa, AH				Essa, Alfred H.			Innovation and strategic advantage: lessons from open source	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTINUING ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND LIFE-LONG LEARNING			English	Article						open source; innovation; strategy; open innovation; sustainability		In a dynamic and global market, innovation will increasingly become the core determinant of the success and failure of firms. As useful knowledge becomes more pervasive, the logic that supported manufacturer-centric and centralised approaches to innovation has begun to break down and is being replaced or supplemented by user-centric and decentralised approaches to innovation. Open source development provides important management lessons regarding the most effective ways to structure and implement innovation. When viewed through the lens of innovation processes, open source development is representative of a broader and more fundamental shift in how firms can generate new ideas and bring them to market.

J	Faria, A				Faria, Alex			Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility in Latin America: A Critical Standpoint	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; Latin America; CSR; SCSR	SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACH; CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES; ORGANIZATION THEORY; MANAGEMENT; CONSEQUENCES; SUGGESTIONS; DISCONNECTS; HISTORY; HININGS	Strategic management researchers in Europe challenged the historical concern of the field with economic performance. As a result corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been transformed into a key strategic issue. Given the large amount of social problems in Latin America, much of them related to the large amount of foreign direct investments inflows over the last decade, the growing literature on strategic corporate social responsibility (SCSR) produced in the US has been reproduced in the region by consulting firms, big corporations firms and strategic management researchers. Drawing upon critical arguments of Latin American scholars on the dominance of the US literature in the region and on problematic outcomes of the large amount of foreign direct investments inflows this paper develops a critical analysis on the so-called SCSR. The vantage point construed by big corporations within the fields of strategic management and organization studies, the increasing dependence of the field of strategic management on corporate resources, and the decreasing power of the state and civil society in relation to big corporations are pointed out as key issues for the development of a critical approach on SCSR in Latin America. In the end the author argues that the responsibilities of big corporations, especially in Latin America, are too important to be addressed only by the field of strategic management.

In July 2001, South Africa took up this challenge with the hosting of a Multi-stakeholder Symposium on the WCD. At this Symposium, South African stakeholders accepted the core values and approaches and declared themselves to be broadly supportive of the strategic priorities outlined in the WCD report, but believed that the guidelines needed to be contextualised in the South African situation. This resulted in the three-year South African Multi-stakeholder Initiative on the WCD Report, and culminated in the Final Report entitled: Applying the WCD Report in South Africa. This paper will share with the reader both the content of the South African Report as well as the remarkable process that enabled polarised perspectives to reach consensus on a broad range of controversial issues. It is this process which has been internationally recognised as a model for multi-stakeholder participation in policy formulation.

There are interconnected processes of forming and developing the market legislative base for a real estate market, corporative structures, and real estate management. It illustrates the strategic and operational interaction between the corporation management system and its real estate subsystem, and the functions of the corporate real estate department and managers in the top management of corporations, showing the importance of good quality information about real estate assets. Imbalance between the three results in serious problems and these have been a feature of the corporative development during this period.

J	Kloyer, M; Helm, R; Burr, W				Kloyer, Martin; Helm, Roland; Burr, Wolfgang			Compensation preferences of R&D-suppliers: some empirical results	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						R&D; contract R&D; opportunism; compensation preferences; negotiation power; resource dependence theory	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; CONTRACTS; ORGANIZATION; COSTS; BIOTECHNOLOGY; OPPORTUNISM; NETWORKS; INDUSTRY; MARKET; FIRM	R&D suppliers who are not compensated according to their preferences are motivated to behave opportunistically. The paper presents empirical findings about these preferences. The investigation is based on the assumption that the probability of a continuous compensation, instead of a final payment, increases when the negotiation power of the supplier rises. The results confirm this presumption with regard to the power determinants of effective intellectual property rights and the number of cooperation alternatives.

J	Kumar, S				Kumar, Sameer			An explorative study of established software leaders and their key outsourcing partners	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Infosys; Wipro; Satyam; Oracle; Microsoft; strategic software alliances; IT outsourcing		This study reviews global operations of leading Information Technology (IT) and software development companies from the USA and India. These companies over the years have become key IT players in software outsourcing in the world. As the industry evolves, India is endorsing Software Technology Parks throughout the country. Established software leaders in the USA benefit from cost savings and increased flexibility derived from such outsourcing partnerships enabling them to stay competitive in the global market. Low-cost technology destinations like India are benefiting from the increase in disposable income supporting expansion of the global economy. The analyses using Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT), financial performance data and Porter's five-forces indicate a common business strategy of Indian IT and software companies. They do not compete head on with the US counterparts and instead focus on acquiring niche outsourcing markets that are still open and growing rapidly due to worldwide slowdown in IT spending budgets.

Accuracy of human action is not merely acquired by avoiding erroneous behaviours, rather it is ascertained by evaluating the relationship between cognitive reliability and action. The focus of this paper is to identify the relationship between cognitive reliability and action. The incidence rate and pattern, and also perceptual differences on working conditions were analysed by applying the questionnaires of the Common Performance Conditions (CPC), the Team Member Exchange (TMX) and some other questionnaires newly prepared. The results suggested that cognitive reliability on working environments played critical roles in determining efficiency and effectiveness of organisational performance. The importance to improve organisational performance is to keep perceptual level of organisational environment higher and to improve team coherence.

Market competition and cooperation: identifying competitive/cooperative interaction groups	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						airline industry; classification; competition; cooperation; group identification; interaction patterns; mobility barrier; and strategic group		Intra-industry group formation has largely focused on strategic group formation, and has been based on similarity of strategic resource and scope commitments, and on the basis of mobility barriers. In this paper we present a study where competitive/cooperative interaction group identification is based on the patterns of tactical and strategic interactions as found in market competition and cooperation. We posit that patterns of competitive and cooperative interactions among firms provide in-depth information on the configuration of the inter-dependence interaction patterns in an industry. The interaction patterns are mapped onto competitive/cooperative interaction groups using a strategic interaction (action-response) matrix. Clustering techniques are used to partition the firms in the industry into groups, which maximally interact with each other. The partitioning technique was applied to the airline industry resulting in four competitive/cooperative interaction groups. The largest of the four competitive/cooperative interaction group was sub-divided into four clusters of firms exhibiting similar interaction patterns.	[Pegels, C.

J	Podger, AS				Podger, A. S.			A Model Health System for Australia - Part 3: How could this systemic change be introduced and what is the role of private health insurance?	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						patient-oriented care; allocational efficiency; incentive framework; single funder; competition; systemic reform		This paper is the final in a three-part series about the Australian health system in which I propose that Australia should move toward a (single) Commonwealth funded health system. Part 1: The first article described the main strengths and weaknesses of the current health system and briefly canvassed four systemic change options that could deliver more appropriate care and improve efficiency. I concluded that the only realistic systemic change option in the medium-term was one in which the Commonwealth has full financial responsibility, as both funder and purchaser. Part 2: The second article described my preferred option in detail with reference to how it may work at four levels, viz, national, regional, provider and patient. In so doing, my purpose was to spell out the key design principles I believe are required to ensure the realisation of potential gains from a single (Commonwealth) funder. Part 3: The third article outlines how my proposed model may be implemented over a three to five year period, analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the private health insurance system and suggests improvements that could be made to existing arrangements that would lead to a sustainable role for private health insurance in Australia. Conclusions: The (single) Commonwealth funded health model I have outlined in these three articles would facilitate a more patient-focused health system than the one we now have and, at the same time, it would have in-built incentives to improve efficiency and to better control costs. In my view, it would also more effectively address equity by giving more resources to regions and communities (including Indigenous communities) that most need additional support. And, it would allow a more coherent approach to private health insurance offering choice and efficiency without adversely affecting equity. I do not see an either-or choice for government between theoretical system changes and practical incremental solutions to immediate problems. If a more incremental approach is pursued, it is important also to have a clear strategic direction to avoid adhocracy. If government is willing to consider systemic change, it must include measures that deliver tangible improvements along the way as well as lead to structures with better inbuilt incentives for improved performance. Clearly my preference is for the latter.	[Podger, A. S.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Podger, A. S.] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Podger, A.

We mention the risks that are specific to SC and show how to measure the performances of an SC at both the strategic and the tactical levels. We also present real-time assignment approaches that are central to control production cycle and Work-In-Process (WIP) level. These methods establish the link between production cycle and WIP level and may be the starting point of a simple evaluation approach of the SC.

J	Soukakos, PI; Georgopoulos, NB; Pekka-Economou, V				Soukakos, Panagiotis I.; Georgopoulos, Nikolaos B.; Pekka-Economou, Victoria			Two interrelated frameworks proposed for mapping and performance measurement of customer relationship management strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						customer relationship management; CRM; CRM strategy; strategic management; strategy performance measurement.		One of the major developments within today's business practice is the increasing interest in Customer Relationship Management (CRM). The strategy known as CRM optimises values as profitability, revenue and customer satisfaction (what and why) by organising around customer segments, fostering customer-satisfying behaviours and implementing customer-centric business models (how). CRM technologies should enable greater customer insight, increased customer access and more effective customer interactions (outcomes). In the last years, however, scepticism has replaced the initial enthusiasm about CRM. Many of the CRM initiatives fail for a number of reasons; three of the most significant ones are the following: (a) the board has little customer/CRM understanding or involvement, (b) lack of specifically designed strategy and (c) no measures or monitoring of benefits derived from CRM. To date, the body of research on CRM has ignored these strategic implementation issues. This paper exhibits a methodology for the development, mapping and performance measurement of CRM strategies. In the context of this methodology, two frameworks are introduced.

Planning the implementation is defined by the capabilities of management to visualize the market position of the company and to evaluate the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Serving to the company's purposes, planning the implementation of quality must be integrated into the company's strategic objectives and then transferred to other parts of the organization utilizing the corporate governance system. Planning the implementation, as a part of strategy formulation, should be reflected in: 1) company's vision and mission development, 2) goals setting, 3) strategy development aimed at achieving goals, 4) implementation and execution of the strategy, and 4) monitoring, evaluation, control, and readjustment of the strategy. Finally, planning must account for all possible implementation barriers.

An integrated policy of multi-echelon supply chain with dual source for deteriorating items	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Supply chain; multi-echelon inventory system; dual source; joint total cost		The different facilities in the supply chain develop their partnership through information sharing and strategic alliances, in order to achieve long-term benefits and global optimum of the system. This study develops a two-supplier three- echelon inventory model that integrates the upper, middle and lower levels of the supply chain. The mathematical model describes how the integrated approach to decision making can achieve global optimum as compared to independent decision by the supplier, the distributor and the retailer. A computer code is developed to derive the optimal solution. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are given to validate the results of the system.	[Yu, Jonas C.

J	Zatsepin, V				Zatsepin, Vasily			Russian military expenditure: What's behind the curtain?	ECONOMICS OF PEACE AND SECURITY JOURNAL			English	Article								The article views the Russian defense budget as a representation of national strategic interests, priorities, and policies. Although Russia conforms to the United Nations' statistical standard for reporting military expenditure, several budget categories are hidden in other parts of the federal budget. Transparency in defense spending has been decreasing steadily. The budgeting process itself is cumbersome and opaque. Parliamentary control over the budget process and control over the execution of defense appropriations are limited. Importantly, frequent changes in the system of national accounting impede historical comparisons. The study finds that the low quality of defense management, dominated by members of the military-industrial complex, is a major problem locking Russian defense policy in an institutional trap.

J	Lin, CWR; Hung, OL; Chen, C				Lin, Chun-Wei R.; Hung, Oliver L.; Chen, Chelun			A strategic quick response approach for dynamic supply chain management of perishable goods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						quick response system; supply chain management; perishable goods; genetic algorithm; linear programming	LARGE COMBINATORIAL PROBLEMS; GLOBAL OPTIMUM; INVENTORY; SHORTAGES; POLICIES; DEMAND; MODEL	Enterprises are facing crucial challenges from both competitors and consumers nowadays. To get survived, forming strategic supply chain (SC) alliances and utilizing the internet technology to establish a quick response (QR) system (or efficient customer response (ECR) system) become as the common practice for enterprises in terms. of cost reduction and efficiency improvement. This paper presents an internet-based QR framework for a perishable goods SC alliance. To optimize the expected QR SC alliance profit, a (d) double under bar ynamic (f) double under bar requency-based (s) double under bar upply and (d) double under bar istribution (DF-SD) algorithm is developed under the constraints of short food freshness period, limited DC capacity, penalty of breach of contract, and uncertain supply rate. The DF-SD algorithm is composed of two linear programming models and an extended genetic algorithm to generate the optimal supply and distribution strategy for all SC members. Simulation results show that the proposed QR approach successfully outperforms the traditional approach in solution quality and computation efficiency. Significance: The performance of perishable goods SC highly depends on the dynamic supply/distribution quantities and frequency. An application of applying composed algorithm in searching of optimal supply and distribution strategies is studied in this paper.

J	Malone, TC; Hemsley, JM				Malone, Thomas C.; Hemsley, J. Michael			Developing the IOOS for improved management and mitigation of coastal inundation	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL			English	Article								Ocean.US was established by the National Ocean Research Leadership Council in 2000 to (1) design and prepare strategic plans for implementing and improving an integrated ocean observing system (IOOS) for the United States, (2) promote coordinated implementation of these plans, and (3) promote research and development needed to improve operational capabilities. Among the highest priorities for phased development of the IOOS is improving capabilities to predict, manage, and mitigate effects of coastal inundation caused by hurricanes, tropical storms, extra-tropical cyclones, nor'easters, and tsunamis. Based on the needs of three categories of users (real-time responders, post event re-builders, and long-term planners), high priorities for IOOS development are to (1) improve the accuracy and timeliness of forecast maps of the time-space extent of coastal inundation and (2) periodically provide accurate, high resolution, timely assessments of changes in susceptibility (vulnerability and risk) to and impacts of coastal inundation, Data requirements and advances in operational modeling capabilities to address these objectives and actions needed to achieve them are described. A key action for meeting these requirements is the development of community modeling approaches to enable more effective collaboration among research and operational communities to improve and expand operational modeling capabilities in support of decision making by all three categories of users. Community modeling activities should include coordinated development of observational and modeling capabilities and the development of test beds, ensemble modeling capabilities, and experiments to validate models and improve predictive skills (e.g., Observing System Simulation Experiments).

J	Tomas, V; Margeta, A				Tomas, Vinko; Margeta, Alan			NEXT GENERATION CONTROL ARCHITECTURES	POMORSTVO-SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL OF MARITIME RESEARCH			English	Article						Integrated control and monitoring system; ships computerized systems; three - tiered control architecture		Current generation control systems, including those aboard the "Smart Ships", place an ever-increasing amount of sensory information in front of the operator; and generally require sharply increased manning in case of control system malfunctions. Furthermore, there is a growing demand for reduction of the number of crewmembers on board a ship. The control system designer faces the challenge of designing a robust and increasingly autonomous automation system that is scalable and affordable. Research suggests these challenges will be met by three - tiered control architecture - a strategic layer that focuses on setting resource goals and priorities for machinery systems based on the ship's current mission. This will enhance the features of currently available systems by allowing direct addressing of any system component, sensor or actuator from anywhere in a vessel. This permits a system self-reconfiguration on failure or in case of damages to the segments of the system. Future full integrated control and monitoring systems (FICMS) will be distributed systems that combine control and information functions under the umbrella of one overall management system. An open architecture with backward and forward compatibility provides improved through life support and reduces the risk of obsolescence. Generally, the technology to achieve the vision of an advanced FICMS is available today.

For more than 20 years, Hunzinger Construction Company conducts an annual strategic planning process whereby we take a hard look at our industry and develop tactical initiatives designed to challenge the status quo and be responsive to the ever-changing environment in which we conduct our business. Significant outcomes from this process have been (a) the development of a Total Quality Management process and commitment (Q(3)) where we engage our clients, specialty subcontractors/vendors/suppliers, and employees in the culture of quality awareness in every aspect of our project delivery systems, (b) the development and funding of Hunzinger Construction University (HCU) with the goal of providing continuous improvement of the skills of our people to make us a better company, and (c) researching emerging markets that we believe are key to the success and growth of our company. Additionally, we participate in a national PEER Review Group that provides quarterly sessions with eight similar non-competing firms from every corner of the nation. Given the breadth of the participating firms and the depth to which the process delves into bow each firm conducts itself in its respective marketplace, this PEER group activity stands out as one of the strongest drivers of our continued success and growth. This prestigious group, made up of the President/CEOs of each of the participating firms, spends a great deal of time discussing trends in the industry and looks for meaningful ways that each can react to changing trends and remain on the leading edge of new developments. It was from this forum that the subject of green building came to light and Hunzinger Construction Company embarked on a commitment to internally challenging our culture to be true to the precepts of sustainable design and construction as we moved into our second century. We saw this as yet another success driver and an ability to continue to differentiate ourselves in a very competitive marketplace, while responding to the ever-growing trend of green building. We began our journey by becoming a corporate member of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the Wisconsin Green Building Alliance. Once these were in place, we hosted a USGBC Workshop in September 2004 to introduce the concept not only to staff members, but also extended the invitation to our Q3 partners, as well as the design and engineering community. The workshop was sponsored by HCU and was conducted by a USGBC trainer. Our goal was to provide a proper kick-off to our commitment, position us favorably in the marketplace, and begin to educate our team on the importance of sustainable design and construction. As a follow-up to the initial HCU event, President John C Hunzinger and Executive Vice President James R. Hunzinger challenged all of our professional staff to obtain LEED Accredited Professional status. To achieve this goal, HCU sponsored company-wide training activities and study groups to insure that our people were well versed and prepared to pass the professional examination. To date, more than 65% of our professional staff has achieved LEED AP credentials, and we have over 20 additional LEED trained professionals among our ranks that are available to our clients for consultation in the early stages of project development.				kotoole@hunzinger.com; ddavies@hunzinger.com; ddellagnese@hunzinger.com; pvetterkind@hunzinger.com; ffalsetti@hunzinger.com						0	1	1	0	7	COLL PUBL	GLEN ALLEN	12309 LYNWOOD DR, GLEN ALLEN, VA 23059 USA	1552-6100			J GREEN BUILD	J.

J	Rivera, M; Heady, F				Rivera, Mario; Heady, Ferrel			Comparative Program-Performance Evaluation and Government Accountability in New MexicoSome Applied Lessons for Intergovernmental Relations	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS EDUCATION			English	Article								In Strategies for Using State Information: Measuring and Improving Program Performance (2003), Shelley Metzenbaum poses a series of "key questions" about the federal-state performance reporting relationship. Metzenbaum asks whether there should be a uniform accountability system across the American states and whether it should be required of the states by the federal government. Ancillary questions include what uses should be made of state performance information and whether federal agencies should publicy report such information. These questions are important in light of the burgeoning performancemanagement movement in contemporary public administration. The extension of performance measurement and reporting systems to state governments is largely due to the impact on states of the federal Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), and generally to the ascendancy of new public management perspectives in governmental practice. The experience of the State of New Mexico with regard to intergovernmental performance reporting in recent years, under both Republican and Democratic gubernatorial administrations, suggests that closer integration of federal and state performance reporting is necessary, that more comprehensive performancebased systems (that include comparative performance measurement and strategic planning frameworks) are essential, and that new evaluative models are needed to address the sometimes cooperative and sometimes adversarial nature of intergovernmental relations. Lessons from the MPA classroom arising from these interrelated concerns and from the authors' applied research with state government are addressed at the conclusion of this study.

Framework for the strategic and business planning of the Centre - School of Public Health, Belgrade	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-HEIDELBERG			English	Article						School of Public Health; Serbia Training and research		The science and practice of the New Public Health have a key role in the promotion of people's health and in the reform of the health system. Serbia experienced many social and economic threats to public health during the 1990s when the health infrastructure both for curative and preventive services gradually deteriorated. Existing skills and knowledge of public health professionals are insufficient in virtually all fields of public health activities. The foundation of the Centre - School of Public Health, within the Medical School of Belgrade University has been a precondition for the improvement of professional training in public health. The objectives are described as (1) education of capable experts in the field of public health, (2) improvement of knowledge in the health sciences, (3) health promotion in cooperation with local communities, (4) training of competent researchers in the field of public health and (5) improvement of the process of decision making and policy formulation. The training programme covers five key areas of education in the domain of public health: (1) public health in Europe, (2) epidemiology and biostatistics, (3) health policy and management, (4) health promotion, health education and social sciences and (5) environment and health. In the first year, 27 students were admitted for the Master of Public Health programme and more than 350 participants attended various short courses for continuing education in public health and health management based on applied learning approach. The next developmental steps focus on sustainability of the pro-grammes for continuing education and research and a wider national and international partnership.

Objective: presenting a college management model, the school organization and the participation strategies in the school pedagogical project. Methods: historical analysis of institutional documents: rules, teaching map, organon schedule and college organs. Results and Discussion: the new education paradigm required a change in the organization and attitude of all the actors involved. The extinction of departments decentralized power and therefore decisions on the academy and school were made by college organs after a wide discussion with the community. Teachers participation in the academic and assistencial activities was organized by creating a year map of the school activities in which everybody chooses where they will act during the academic year. This document is analysed and a period of negotiation and readaptation is opened. After that all the maps are published to the community.

J	Christenson, R				Christenson, Robert			Scientific charge master rate optimisation, knowing things that can go wrong and how to avoid them	JOURNAL OF REVENUE AND PRICING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						T-2 control chart; economic design; genetic algorithms variable parameters		Optimisation of the charge master prices is an effective way to improve the net revenues of a hospital and is a fundamental part of strategic pricing. Today, scientific charge master optimisation (also known as a rate-opt) must be considered a mandatory activity, not only for maximising net revenues (typically at least 20 per cent greater than other techniques) but also to ensure government compliance, managed care contract compliance, and fair treatment of the uninsured, while providing transparency into the pricing process. Unfortunately, when improperly done, a rate-opt will not only fail to achieve the desired goals, but it will frustrate department directors and the finance group. This article discusses best practices for performing a successful science-based rate-opt, a highly leveraged tool in a hospital's financial inventory.

We use economic theory, design theory, complex systems theory and business process modeling concepts to analyze deregulation and business to business interaction in the UK electricity industry, and the strategic business and IT response of Electric Co, a large electricity supply company. The relevance of this study comes from its investigation of a novel example of the shaping of a whole sector's e-business through regulatory law and thus we are concerned with enterprise and inter-enterprise systems not purely with ERP systems. We focus on model-based business interaction and its effect upon the business and consumer behaviors of a whole country's electricity sector. This sector is a socio-technical system; so business processes and consumer behaviors are not only shaped by the regulator's legally enforced business to business process interaction model, but the opinions of businesses and the public also influence how the regulator updates its model. Thus business behaviors, consumer behaviors and the model interact to shape each other. By moving from intra to inter-organizational business processes we seek to demonstrate and explain the value of models in e-business where the complexity of interacting business systems involves many thousands of parameters. We show how developments in technical standards and business process management are related to inter-organizational interaction and coordination.

Economic instability and the unfortunate, and unavoidable, consequences of acting ethically	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Annual International Conference Promoting Business Ethics	OCT 21-23, 2004	DePaul Univ, Chicago, IL	Niagara Univ, St Johns Univ	DePaul Univ	management decision-making; utilitarian; harm; stakeholders; micro/macro economic systems; strategic; Kantian; promise keeping; responsibility; systemic		In this paper I describe and analyze an economic situation involving two competitive organizations. I put forth the argument that because of the systemic nature of decision making relative to managing the requirements of utilizing a descriptive equation that determines how many people an economic system can support, that even if all the players in the situation act ethically, the results will still be harmful, and necessarily so, to the system and to many innocent people. I will demonstrate that harming innocent people is required and morally defensible given the choices available. The best one can do is slow down the increase in disutilities and possibly operate the system within a range of acceptable behavior that minimizes the resulting harm to innocent people, even if we cannot entirely remove this harm. In this context ethics becomes the study of the acceptable as opposed to the preferable.

J	Aitchison, DR; Shaw, AI				Aitchison, D. R.; Shaw, A. I.			Data management in small and medium-sized enterprises using metadata acquired by 'spyware'	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE			English	Article						small and medium-sized enterprise; SME; data; spyware; metadata; process		Data generated during a product development process are increasingly created and communicated using a digital format. Management of these data can be a key enabler of the design process; strategic, tactical, and operational management of the data can lead to shorter product development timeframes and hence competitive advantage in the marketplace. While larger companies have both the infrastructure and resources to implement sophisticated software to manage the myriad of data created, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), owing to their inherent characteristics, lag in the adoption of data management tools. This paper describes research using so-called 'Spyware' software and reports how this software is used in a novel methodology to develop information management functions for SMEs.

J	Berdot, JP; Goyeau, D; Leonard, J				Berdot, Jean-Pierre; Goyeau, Daniel; Leonard, Jacques			The Dynamics of Portfolio Management: Exchange Rate Effects and Multisector Allocation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						Portfolio choice; Business cycle; Exchange rate risk		The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact that recent changes in companies strategies (they refocused on their basic activities and they internationalized them) can have on their market value. Through that analysis, we intend to establish a suitable logic that could be adapted to portfolio management. This logic has to do with the first level of the top-down approach: it confronts multisector allocation to the exchange rate effects affecting company's market value. In the first part, we detail the basis of this three dimensional logic. In the second part, we provide an empirical analysis of the French stock market behaviour between 1994 and 2004. Our analysis highlights the three-dimensional aspects of the pricing of French equities: (1) by confronting the position of the different French economic sectors to the US business cycle; in other words, we will determine if these sectors are lagging or early compared to the leading US cycle; (2) by taking into account their offensive, neutral or defensive behavior against the US market; (3) by taking into account the favorable or unfavorable fluctuations of the exchange rate and their influence on these sectors. The resulting taxonomy that we confront to the different phases of the US business cycle allows us to define the basic principles of a multisector allocation, which governs the strategic choices to be made for investment portfolio.

J	Jennings, D; Disney, J				Jennings, David; Disney, John			The Strategic Planning Process and its Context: The Role of Psychological Type	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This article reviews the literature concerning contextual factors affecting configuration of the strategic planning process. The potential role of managers' psychological type (MBTI) as a determinant of preferences towards design of the planning process is examined. From a study based upon 187 managers it is concluded that managers' planning preferences primarily reflect the imperatives presented by specific strategic situations rather than psychological type. Managers appear to vary their planning response to strategic situations according to the characteristics each situation presents. Conclusions are provided for managers engaged in strategic planning, recruitment, management training and for academic strategy research.

J	Abetti, PA				Abetti, Pier A.			The acquisition by Steria of Bull's service companies: motivations, negotiations, integration and strategic implications (2000-2004)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Steria; Bull; negotiations; acquisition; integration; IT systems; IT services		The objective of this case study is to analyse in detail the acquisition by Steria, a French IT systems and services company, of the European service companies of its major competitor, Bull. This successful acquisition transformed Steria from a French company to European leader and doubled revenues from euro (sic) 500 million to over (sic)1 billion, while always maintaining profitability in spite of the collapse of the 'internet bubble'. We present first the view from the field: the effect on the personnel of the acquired and acquiring companies. Then we present the view from the headquarters of both companies: the motivations of the CEOs, the often contentious negotiations, and the successful integration. We develop the strategic implications of the acquisition for the new 'European' Steria and discuss possible alternatives for achieving the goal of doubling sales by 2006, as set by Steria's CEO. We conclude with 'lessons learned' that may be useful to companies considering major international acquisitions.

J	Brown, WA; Pritchard, M				Brown, William; Pritchard, Mark			Trust in the Board: A Strategic Imperative in Times of Uncertainty	JOURNAL OF NONPROFIT & PUBLIC SECTOR MARKETING			English	Article						Nonprofit boards; trust; perceived risk; key-mediating variable; relationship marketing	MARKET-RESEARCH; COOPERATION; MANUFACTURER; SATISFACTION; PERSPECTIVES; DYNAMICS; MODEL; RISK	In turbulent environments, investors seek to minimize risk. Many public/nonprofit organizations evoke a sense of trust in their members by maintaining boards of directors. This study examined faculty member attitudes about the public/nonprofit institutions and boards who manage their retirement funds (n = 240). A structural model revealed that investors developed trust in the board when they view the organization positively through reliable communication, a sense of shared values and retirement funds that perform soundly. As a mediator of attitude toward the organization trust in the board also diminished investor perceptions of risk, and partially explained whether members cooperated and continued with the organization. The findings support trust as a key intervening factor in member-organization relationships and suggest building trust in board governance as an effective way to reduce uncertainty.

The company has to maintain a stable supply of containers to meet spontaneous shipment demand. The regional maintenance and repair (M&R) team is responsible for the control of technical requirements and repair standards of the containers. The regional M&R office will use a contract survey service if it has a query on a repair request. The traditional way of approving repair request by using fax and telephone results in a large amount of paper work. Information lag has an adverse effect on container readiness. We use a case study of a container shipping company to illustrate that a knowledge-based work order system can enhance the maintenance capability of inventory management. Through the example of building a communication platform, the company can gain knowledge of different trading parties, making better forecasts and strategic plans.

J	Clark, S; Scott, N				Clark, Stephen; Scott, Noel			Managing Knowledge in Tourism Planning: And How to Assess Your Capability	JOURNAL OF QUALITY ASSURANCE IN HOSPITALITY & TOURISM			English	Article						China; Australia; knowledge; market intelligence; inbound tourism	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; MANAGEMENT	This paper explores the theme of strategic planning in a State Tourism Organization (STO) from a knowledge management perspective. It highlights the value of knowledge in strategy making and the importance of an organisation's knowledge management agenda in facilitating a strategic planning process. In particular, it considers the capability of an STO to implement knowledge management as the key to a successful strategic planning exercise. In order to develop greater insight into the factors that impact on planning competence, the key aim of this paper is to develop a framework on which the capability of a STO to implement a knowledge-based agenda in strategic planning can be assessed. Research on knowledge management in the field of tourism is limited and there is little practical account of the application of knowledge management principles in tourism planning. Further, there is no apparent tool or instrument that allows for the assessment of an STO's capability to implement knowledge management in planning initiatives. Based on a literature review, a three-point framework of assessment is developed. The three elements of the framework are identified as: 1. Integration of knowledge management objectives with strategic imperatives; 2. A planning approach that balances top-down (outcome focused) with bottom-up (process focused) planning processes; and 3. Organisational capacity, including leadership, people and culture, process, technology, content and continuous improvement. The framework is tested through application to a practical case study-a planning initiative undertaken by a leading tourism STO in Australia. The results demonstrate that the framework is a useful means to evaluate organisational capability in knowledge-led strategic planning exercises and would be of practical value as a point of reference for future knowledge-based strategic planning projects.

J	Dey, PK				Dey, Prasanta Kumar			Reengineering helps improve materials procurement in Indian oil refinery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						process reengineering; procurement management; integration; information technology tools; strategic sourcing		The materials management function is always a major concern to the management of any organisation as high inventory and inefficient procurement processes have a significant effect on profitability. The problems multiply in the face of a very dynamic business environment, as is the present case in India. Hence, the existing system of materials planning, procurement processes and inventory management require reviewing with respect to the changed business environment. This study shows a radical improvement in materials procurement function of an Indian petroleum refinery through Business Process Reengineering (BPR) by analysing current process, identifying key issues, deriving paradigm shifts and developing reengineered processes through customer value analysis. BPR has been carried out on existing processes of 'material planning and procurement' and 'warehousing and surplus disposal'. The reengineered processes for the materials management function triggered several improvement projects that were identified by the group of executives who took part in the reengineering exercise. Those projects were implemented in an integrated framework, with the application of state of the art information technology tools and building partnership alliance among all stakeholders. Considerable improvements in overall functions of the organisation are observed, along with financial benefits.

J	Freeman, I				Freeman, Ina			Performance management: is it enough?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						studies; management theory; competitive advantage; strategic management; small business		Performance management literature often presents a 'how-to', discussing solitary concepts and practices that are labelled as keys to optimisation. When coupled with lay literature and performance management software, these solitary concepts incorporate a cookbook approach that nullifies the complexity of those humans who are being managed. This article examines management from a different perspective in exploring management's many facets using the example of one practitioner (AM) to highlight the need to recognise the complexities found in a holistic approach to effective and efficient management. These complexities require the recognition of multiple aspects of the personality of the management as well as the actions of the manager and the organisation.

J	Grecevicius, P; Marcius, R				Grecevicius, Petras; Marcius, Romas			OBJECTIVES OF DEVELOPING OLD PARK RECREATIONAL RESOURCES IN SEACOAST LANDSCAPE FORMATION	JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBANISM			Lithuanian	Article						landscape; park; tourism; sustainable development; identity		During the last 15 years disagreements between the process of urbanization and environmental (historic, cultural) heritage have clearly increased. Klaipeda old parks and their fragments are disappearing fast, and hard efforts for protection of parks in Palanga, Kretinga, Plunge, Rietavas are needed. The density of construction in park surroundings is increased, and approaches to the parks and their environmental quality are reduced. The formation of settlement greenery systems in which old parks are the basic components of their spatial structure becomes more complicated. In accordance with modern European requirements and the Lithuanian Master Plan, priority should be given to greenery in the spatial settlement structure. To preserve the individuality of Lithuanian landscapes it is necessary to apply measures of planning that would help to combine natural and cultural components providing for a high quality of landscape not only in a short run but also in the remote future. One of such measures is understanding of an important role of historic parks in the spatial structure of coastal settlements and their management. The provision of sustainable development declared by world community commits to analysing particular regional and settlement possibilities, resources for significant improvement of peoples life quality. Resorts are distinguished by their singularity. They have an influence on the national attraction of Lithuania and facilitate state image formation.

The program is a post-experience education focusing mainly on engineers with more than three years of practical experience. The idea underlying the division of the MMT program into four terms is primarily to create an understanding of strategy and strategic challenges (first term) and to relate these to organizational options and challenges (second term). Subsequently, the program strives to ensure a basis for holistic planning of corporate development. During the third term, focus is on planning of corporate development, and during the fourth term managerial aspects in connection with implementation are addressed. As apart of the curriculum at Aalborg University the program is designed as a problem-based and project-based learning initiative.

The paper first addresses the roles of the pharmacist in American society, i.e., as professional, employee, and business owner, and the pharmacists's identity and belief system; second, the paper reviews the status of state law and proposed legislation concerning patient/consumer access to emergency contraceptives; third, it offers an in-depth stakeholder analysis of the ethical and legal responsibilities of pharmacies to stakeholders; and fourth, the paper provides overview of the salient ethical and legal issues concerning patient/customer access to emergency contraceptives relevant to management. The conclusions discuss questions for further research as well as strategic/human resource management policy recommendations that balances the economic, legal, and ethical concerns of all primary stakeholders of the company/business, such as designing a management system which refers customers in a timely fashion; recognizing "conscience clauses," while ensuring that pharmacists "do no harm" to the consumer; and disseminating management "best practices" on "conscience clauses" through joint professional/ industry sponsorship.

J	Hillbrand, C				Hillbrand, Christian			STRATEGY PLANNING FOR HIGHGROWTH FIRMS: A COMPLEXITY-THEORETIC FRAMEWORK	EUROMED JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						High-growth enterprise; strategy planning; entrepreneurial complexity; growth transitions; complex strategic integration		Many entrepreneurial theories suggest that corporate growth is not taking place in a continuous manner but in a rather disruptive way. Since many strategy planning frameworks implicitly assume that their underlying assumptions are not changing over time this stands in some contradictory relation to growth transitions in rapidly growing firms. Hence, this paper proposes an approach called "Growth Scorecards" which is based on the Balanced Scorecard methodology and enables decision makers of high-growth enterprises to identify the necessity and approximate scope of strategic revisions associated with a growth transition. The described approach therefore employs complexity-theoretic concepts in order to classify the management's propensity for growth measures as the internal likelihood of a growth transition. As a prerequisite for this the paper starts with a disquisition of the theoretic framework underlying this approach.

CNS GERMINOMA WITH SYNCHRONOUSLESIONS IN THE SUPRASELLAR AND PINEALREGIONS: CLINICAL, CT AND IMMUNOLOGICAL FOLLOW-UP	JOURNAL OF IMAB			English	Article						germinoma; synchronous location; clinical presentation; CT imaging; immunological monitoring		Germinomas are the most frequent type of germ cell-tumors that constitute only 2-5% of all central nervous system malignancies. Most of them arise in the pineal and suprasellar regions but in about 5% to 10% the simultaneous location is found. Although their strategic location, they respond well to surgery, radiation and chemotherapy and the prognosis is very good. We report a case of 23-years young male presented with gait disturbance, weakness in lower extremities, visual impairment and moderate-fatigue. His medical history revealed that he was symptomatic by DI (polyuria, polydypsia and weight loss) and received treatment with adiuretin for a period of 3 years. Computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated well circumscribed tumor lesions with a homogeneous contrast-enhancement in the suprasellar and pineal regions. A germinoma was verified histologically. A good treatment response to surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and management of endocrine insufficiency was achieved. The postoperative neurological, CT and immunological follow-up corresponded with the clinical course of the disease and the results of therapeutic procedures.

J	Kendall, JE				Kendall, Julie			Theatres, Metaphors, and E-Collaboration: An Examination of Web-Based Cooperation of Regional Nonprofit Theatres	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-COLLABORATION			English	Article						e-collaboration; electronic commerce; management issues; metaphors; nonprofit organizations; online community; theatres; virtual alliance		A metaphor methodology was used to understand and interpret the Web presences of 15 nonprofit theatres that comprise the regional theatre of Southern New Jersey that is present on the Web. In addition, findings from our earlier studies of off-Broadway and regional theatre festivals were extended to analyze the Web presence of the theatres in Southern New Jersey. The contribution of the work resides in its systematic and intense consideration of the strategic importance of the Web for nonprofit theatre arts groups in the Southern New Jersey region and in its use of the metaphor methodology in order to facilitate a fully developed picture of the Web and nonprofit organizations. This is intended to help administrators become aware of the need for strategic use of e-collaboration via creation of a regional theatre Web presence for South Jersey that enacts a more evolutionary metaphor, perhaps that of the organism. Theatres are encouraged to practice collaborating on the Web by creating reciprocal links and thus cooperating as a region.

J	Konig, A; Enders, A; Hungenberg, H; Rohrig, M				Koenig, Andreas; Enders, Albrecht; Hungenberg, Harald; Roehrig, Markus			How Can Music Majors Increase Their Success in the Market for Over-the-Air Downloads?-The Case of Germany	JMM-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MEDIA MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Music majors, who have been suffering from dwindling revenues in their core business, are placing extraordinary hopes on the new market of over-the-air (OTA) downloads. However, until now there has been no broad academic discussion about this market. In particular, two central questions have not yet been addressed: (a) Which factors influence the success of music majors in the OTA-download market?, and (b) How can music majors increase their success in this market? To answer these questions, this study used a holistic research approach, which combines an economical and a sociological perspective. This study first identified the drivers for the success in the OTA-download market and analyzed these factors in 1 large-scale survey (n=1,780)in Germany and a series of expert interviews. Subsequently, a mathematical Excel-based tool was constructed and data optimization techniques from operations research were applied to derive the optimal mix of strategic measures that maximizes the success of music majors in the German OTA-download market. Finally, recommendations for implementing these strategic measures are presented.

Organizations are making use of emerging technologies as they switch to a more strategic, less tactical approach. The objective of this study is to reveal usage pattern by identifying ICT clusters for a sales force in a large telecommunication firm in Canada. Cross-regional comparison reveals usage patterns composed of different mixes of 32 mature and emerging ICT. The findings provide a useful mechanism enabling strategic management to better allocate resources and identify training needs.

In project planning, the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is one of the fundamental tools, but the terms "product" and "activity" are frequently confused and results in inefficiency in the support of project management tasks. By clarifying the nature of project planning and execution, an integrated method for WBS planning has been developed in this research. It includes the product-oriented WBS (P-WBS), the activity-oriented WBS (A-WBS), and the contract-out WBS (C-WBS). The technology roadmap is used to transform the P-WBS into the A-WBS. Using the proposed integrated WBS planning model as the basis, a Project Management Strategic Alignment Model (PMSAM) has been constructed to align strategic management to project management. Finally, the successful application of this methodology to develop a project for the re-host of a full scope training simulator of a nuclear power plant in Taiwan is illustrated.

To help fill this gap, the Awwa Research Foundation sponsored the study summarized in this article. The full study forms a "casebook" of comparative asset management options. Eleven utilities of diverse sizes, asset ages, availability of automated information, and engagement in asset management worked with the project team to test and evaluate three levels of asset management planning: basic, high-end, and strategic. The study results showed that even a basic asset management option has considerable value for a water utility. More advanced and strategic options require significant additional investment, but 80% of the utilities that participated in this project found the benefits to outweigh the costs and plan to implement programs that emulate these options.

J	Mawson-Lee, K				Mawson-Lee, Kym			The Online Effect: Transitioning from the Legacy Help Desk to the Online Task Management System	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						action research; business process planning; case study; computer-mediated communication; human-computer interaction; information systems; knowledge artefacts; public sector; SMEs; strategic IT management; Web-based database		This case centres on a request management system that was developed and implemented in response to the growing requests to the Information Technology (IT) unit for assistance. Primarily, this assistance was with a core corporate application called WorkDesk, a back office processing system. The request management system, an IT unit initiative, was designed in collaboration with representatives of the organisation's business units. The initial development project lasted for approximately two months and upon implementation was well received by the organisation. This first implementation turned out to be a proof of concept for a much larger system called the Request System that has been developed and implemented as a single online channel to manage all requests made of the IT unit. The Request System has greatly increased the ability of the IT unit to strategically manage IT and its support across the organisation. The core benefit of this case is the discussion of the successful development of an online task management system and its 10 key functions. This system effectively manages all requests made to the IT unit and introduced accountability for its completion. The system described can be easily repurposed based upon the knowledge demonstrated in this case study for a wide range of task management purposes. The situation described in this case resulted in the organisation's maturing in terms of IT understanding, an issue with which many organisations are struggling and one that, if understood, will assist students to have a positive impact on similar organisations.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies continuous-time real options techniques and game theoretic concepts. Managerial overconfidence and strategic interaction between the bidder and the target are incorporated into the model. Findings - This model implies that: abnormal returns to bidding shareholders will be negative with a high degree of managerial overconfidence; combined returns to shareholders are usually positive; and both the bidder's and the target's abnormal returns are related to industry characteristics, the degree of managerial overconfidence, and the way merger synergies are divided. Originality/value - This paper, for the first time, reconciles theoretically the following stylized facts: combined returns to shareholders are usually positive; and returns to the acquirer are, on average, not positive. In addition, the model generates new predictions relating these returns to industry characteristics and the degree of managerial overconfidence.

J	Revilla, E; Acosta, J; Sarkis, J				Revilla, E; Acosta, J; Sarkis, J			An empirical assessment of a learning and knowledge management typology for research joint ventures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Research Joint Ventures (RJV); Knowledge Management (KM); learning	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; ENVIRONMENTS; INTEGRATION; CULTURE; DIALOG	As innovation and technology management grow in complexity, the need for inter-organisational cooperation increases. A part of this cooperation requires the understanding of how Knowledge Management (KM) and learning processes may function to support a successful research and development collaboration. To further this understanding, we use a contingency theory to examine the influence of the locus of a Research Joint Venture (RJV) on KM. To do this, we introduce a typology for RJVs to help categorise different KM efforts within a RJV environment. The typology is based on two dimensions: the locus of the RJV knowledge and the KM approach. Using a broad European database, 98 RJV projects are used to evaluate the typology and test two hypotheses related to these relationships. Implications for research and management of these types of projects are also introduced.

J	Sawyer, K; Gammack, J				Sawyer, Keith; Gammack, John			Developing and Analysing Core Competencies for Alignment with Strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						alignment; core competencies; practical methods; StratAchieve; strategy planning		Although it is widely accepted that alignment of knowledge with corporate strategy is necessary, to date there have been few clear statements on what a knowledge strategy looks like and how it may be practically implemented. We argue that current methods and techniques to accomplish this alignment are severely limited, showing no clear description on how the alignment can be achieved. Core competencies, embodying an organisation's practical know-how, are also rarely linked explicitly to actionable knowledge strategy. Viewing knowledge embedded in core competencies as a strategic asset, the paper uses a case study to show how a company's core competencies were articulated and verified for either inclusion or exclusion in the strategy. The study is representative of similar studies carried out across a range of organisations using a novel and practically proven method. This method, StratAchieve, was used here in a client situation to show how the core competencies were identified and tested for incorporation or not in the strategy. The paper concludes by considering the value of the approach for managing knowledge.

J	Williams, RM				Williams, Robin M., Jr.			The long twentieth century in American sociology: A semiautobiographical survey	ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY	Annual Review of Sociology		English	Article; Book Chapter						controversies; ethnicity; institutions; military; values	SOLDIER	In this essay, I draw on a professional life history to suggest how sociological knowledge is generated by encounters with changing research opportunities, here called targets of opportunity. In my case, a study of rural communities led to unanticipated conclusions concerning buffering mechanisms that protected authorities by absorbing dissatisfactions and rebellions. Wartime research in a military setting identified sources of group solidarity and effective performance under stress. Major societal changes in racial/ethnic relations provided opportunities to develop new concepts and empirical findings. Synoptic studies of post-World War II American society led to extensive research on values and institutions. These macrosociological analyses of ethnicity and social systems, in turn, led me to a new sociology of war and interstate relations. I also offer here some critical reflections on recurrent issues and chronic controversies in American sociology. Final sections of the review deal with the continuing search for conceptual clarity and cumulative knowledge. I note the obstacles of disciplinary fragmentation, but my closing judgment is that sociology now has the base of substantial scientific knowledge and methodological expertise necessary for investigating crucial twenty-first century problems.

Results indicate that the index of configuration of HRM practices (complementarity) generally causes an increase of the prediction of organizational performance beyond the one predicted by the index of contingency (organizational teaming). The latter in turn, partially brings about an increase of the prediction of organizational performance beyond the one predicted by the former.

Communicating affirmative action in three South African organisations: a comparative case study perspective	COMMUNICARE-JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION SCIENCES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article							STAKEHOLDERS	Problems associated with the management of communication (in the broadest sense of the word) are a recurring theme in both Corporate Communication Management and Human Resource Management literature and in research on the implementation of affirmative action1 as part of the Employment Equity Act2 in the South African context. Therefore, the following research question was formulated: " How do South African organisations manage communication about affirmative action (against the backdrop of employment equity3)?". This article provides an overview of some dimensions of an exploratory qualitative study that investigated this research question. The ever- increasing strategic importance of organisational performance regarding the EEA highlights the need for research in this area. This study is one of only a few empirical studies in the field of Corporate Communication with the emphasis on topics related to the management of communication in this specific transformational context. Since this study focused on aspects that had not been researched previously (or verified empirically), an exploratory approach had to be followed, with the purpose of gauging possible current trends related to the management of communication about AA in a selection of South African organisations. A case study comparison of three organisations yielded the following results on four sub- questions derived from the overarching research question. The organisations researched (1) comply with their legal duty to inform and consult with stakeholders about the process of EE as stipulated in the Code of Good Practice for the EEA (Department of Labour, 1999); (2) the management of EE is viewed as a transformational change process, as opposed to a once- off incident; (3) the management of communication in this context is viewed as a critical success factor, but a disparity exists between the emphasis placed on strategic external and internal communication efforts; and (4) leaders at all hierarchical levels have different communication responsibilities in relation to this transformational process. Based on the results of this study, the major recommendation for the management of affirmative action communication pertains to the need to address the perceived gap between internal and external communication efforts. Since strategic internal communication is not only viewed as critical for the dissemination of information, but also as the vehicle through which transformation is facilitated, the value thereof should not be underestimated.

J	McDougall, C; Ibanez, A; White, S				McDougall, C; Ibanez, A; White, S			Achieving environmental literacy with NOAA's observing systems data	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL			English	Article								The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has significantly increased its commitment to promoting environmental literacy by adopting this effort as a strategic cross-cuffing priority, forming an Office of Education and establishing an Education Council. Another of NOAA!s strategic cross-cutting priorities is integrating global environmental observations and data management. NOAA possesses avast array of observing systems that monitor oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial parameters. The streaming data from these systems offers broad opportunities to create real-time visualizations of dynamic Earth processes and to capture rare and spectacular events that occur on regional or global geographic scales. Making these visualizations available to and understandable by the general public is not an easy task. The potential return on investment however, is large. NOAA's Education Council realizes the educational potential that observing system data offer and has adopted Earth Observing Systems Education as a top priority. An effort is currently underway in NOAA to assess existing observing system education activities within and outside the Agency and to pilot education programs using the available streaming data. We will report on the process of assessment and on some of the pilot projects we have begun with a focus on a case study provided by the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS), a program that provides a fully operational network of integrated observing systems focused on the nation's estuaries.

J	Jamdar, S; Siriwardena, AK				Jamdar, S; Siriwardena, AK			Strategic management of severe acute pancreatitis in the Jehovah's witness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						anaemia; erythropoietin; treatment	RECOMBINANT-HUMAN-ERYTHROPOIETIN; BLOOD	Haemorrhage can be a lethal complication of severe acute pancreatitis. Management includes identification and control of the source of bleeding and supportive therapy such as blood transfusion. Individuals who refuse transfusion on the grounds of religious belief can provide a further major challenge. The management in these individuals can be focused from the outset with a strategy that aims to avert anaemia and transfusion. This article reports a case of severe acute pancreatitis in a woman of the Jehovah's Witness faith. The episode was complicated by infected pancreatic necrosis requiring surgical intervention. Careful strategic planning is critical to the management of severe acute pancreatitis in patients of the Jehovah's Witness faith. In this case, acute pancreatitis complicated by infected necrosis was successfully managed by the use of preoperative erythropoietin, venesection using paediatric blood vials, meticulous intraoperative attention to haemostasis and the use of adjunctive intraoperative techniques such as argon diathermy.
