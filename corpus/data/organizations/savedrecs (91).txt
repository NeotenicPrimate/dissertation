J	Soderholm, P; Karim, R				Soderholm, Peter; Karim, Ramin			An enterprise risk management framework for evaluation of eMaintenance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Enterprise risk management (ERM); eMaintenance; Information logistics; Information security; ISO 31000; ISO/IEC 27000; IEC 60300-3-14; Railway		Maintenance is one approach to managing risk by a reduction of the probability of failure of technical systems and/or the consequences of their failure. However, history has shown that erroneous maintenance also can lead to reduced quality, incidents and accidents with extensive losses. Today, eMaintenance promises great opportunities for a paradigm shift from a rather narrow, condition-based maintenance approach with focus on a technical system's health to a true risk-based maintenance approach that also considers organizational excellence. This is achieved by proper information logistic solutions that address the needs of all stakeholders of the maintenance process, which are possible due to new and innovative information and communication technology (ICT). However, all opportunities are also linked with some threats, which are seldom highlighted in the case of eMaintenance. In this article, a risk management framework for evaluation of eMaintenance solutions is proposed. The framework is based on a combination of international standards (e.g. ISO 31000, ISO/IEC 27000, and IEC (2004) 60300-3-14) to achieve integrated Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and enable a linkage of eMaintenance to the strategic goals of an organization. The framework is illustrated in the railway context of Trafikverket (2010b) (the Swedish Transport Administration).

J	Lee, YC; Lee, JW				Lee, Yao-Chou; Lee, Jing-Wei			Innovative treatment for huge nuchal desmoid tumour: A case report with a 2-year follow-up	JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY			English	Article						Aggressive fibromatosis; Desmoid tumour; Embolisation; Nuchal tumour; Tourniquet	PERFUSION; NECK; HEAD	Background: The desmoid tumour is a monoclonal neoplasm originating from musculoaponeurotic tissues. It is benign in histological presentations and yet its locally invasive behaviour could lead to dire consequences such as disfigurement, functional impairment or even mortality. Surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and even a wait-and-see policy, either alone or in combination, were advocated as treatment modalities. We experienced an extremely difficult case who had a huge nuchal desmoid tumour measuring 45 x 35 x 20 cm in dimension with extension to the anterior neck and thoracic para-spinal area. Its intimacy with the carotid artery, jugular vein and brachial plexus made margin-free resection infeasible. Moreover, the tumour burden was so immense that the patient was plunged into profound hypoproteinaemic, septic and anaemic status, with severe pain, bleeding and odour that mandated prompt and daring management. Methods: In an effort to prevent uncontrollable tumour bleeding, we embarked on a series of strategic measures, including pre-surgical embolisation, innovative tourniquet technique, a novel method of ligature deployment, staged tumour excision and adjunct methods, such as ethanol injection and irradiation therapy. Results: The huge nuchal desmoid tumour was successfully excised under the planned strategies. The patient went through a number of complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress and renal failure. Fortunately, she eventually survived and exhibited no evidences of tumour relapse at 2 years' follow-up. She has resumed daily activity independently without noticeable functional deficit. Conclusion: We believe that multimodality strategies and innovative surgical techniques are the key to success in managing such a difficult case.

J	Lorenzoni, G				Lorenzoni, Gianni			Genesis of a research field: district, network, strategic network	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Network; Cluster; Interfirm connections; Relational capabilities		This article summarizes the changes since the beginning of the 1980s in the scholarly approach to organizational and economic research on Italian firms. Beginning with the study of industrial districts, which sparked a major reconsideration of the conventional wisdom, most scholars focused primarily on the significance of firm geographical proximity while marginalizing issues related to firm structure and strategy. Nevertheless, industrial district research eventually led to the question of firm networks, in particular how to manage relational capabilities and cooperation, both of which affect a firm's competitive position. This new analytical framework no longer dependent on either the single firm or an industrial sector has opened up new research perspectives that promise rich insights into socio-economic studies.

Vegetation Nutrient Dynamics Associated with Sedimentation in Headwater Riparian Forests	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							ROOT PRODUCTION; PRODUCTIVITY; FLOODPLAIN; WETLAND; RESORPTION; RETENTION; NITROGEN; DECOMPOSITION; CIRCULATION; LIMITATION	Sedimentation associated with flooding has long been considered a nutrient subsidy, making floodplain forests some of the most productive forests on earth. Little is known, however, regarding how sediment deposits from upland erosion may affect nutrient processes within riparian forests. Consequently, we studied the impacts of sedimentation on vegetation nutrient dynamics in riparian forests at Ft. Benning, GA. We measured the concentration and content of N, C, and P in foliar litterfall and fine roots, internal recycling rates, and nutrient use efficiencies in 17 riparian forests along a gradient of sedimentation rates. Plots with the highest sedimentation rates (highly disturbed and moderately disturbed) had higher nutrient use efficiencies (N and P use efficiencies), suggesting that these nutrients may be limited in these forest systems. Litterfall and root nutrient contents also decreased in highly impacted plots, indicating a decline in nutrient turnover. Internal N recycling also appears to be more efficient in highly disturbed plots, which also suggests a deficiency. The results of this study indicate that increased rates of sandy, primarily inorganic sediment may impact vegetation nutrient dynamics in headwater riparian forests.

CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICERS: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF COMPETENCE, ORGANISATIONAL, POSITIONING AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PERFORMANCE	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article						Information systems management; chief information officer; competence; top management; upper echelons; performance	TOP-MANAGEMENT-TEAM; STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; CONTEXTUAL DETERMINANTS; INFLUENCE BEHAVIORS; UPPER ECHELONS; TECHNOLOGY; PROFESSIONALS; BUSINESS; ANTECEDENTS; INVOLVEMENT	The role and contribution of the firm's Chief Information Officer has been the subject of much debate and uncertainty. Yet, too few empirical studies have examined the implications of the CIO role. This study examined the effects of CIO demography, CIO competencies as well as CIO organisational positioning on the contribution of information systems (IS&T) to business performance. Data were collected from 111 South African companies and results revealed that CIO business, interpersonal/political and technology management competence have significant direct effects on the dependent variable. The effect of CIO organisational position, including structural power and political relationship, was found to be mediated by CIO competence. CIO work experience also impacted the contribution of IS&T. Results have important implications for our understanding of the competencies and organisational positioning required of executives charged with the responsibility for information systems and technology management.

J	Surjandari, I; Sudarto, S; Anggarini, S				Surjandari, Isti; Sudarto, Sumarsono; Anggarini, Santi			Supplier Selection in JIT Automotive Industry: A Multivariate Approach	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						supplier selection; automotive; Just-In-Time; supply chain; multivariate analysis		In this globalization era, manufacturing industries have experienced many significant changes, indicated by highly-innovated and short-aged product emerging today. This condition has forced manufacturing industries to put more consideration to their core capability, thus consequently has made outsourcing activities become an important and strategic decision. A company's efforts in achieving competitive benefits begin with managing its suppliers. In real conditions, selecting suppliers is not an easy thing to decide, yet it needs a correct strategic way in order to get potential suppliers. Furthermore in Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturer, supplier selection is an important strategic issue for the company, because it is a long-term investment and success key to the JIT philosophy implementation. The objective of this paper is to design a framework for supplier selection in JIT manufacturing based on multivariate approach. This paper is based on a study in the largest JIT automotive manufacturer in Indonesia. The design begins by applying factor analysis to settle attributes used in the supplier selection process. Afterward, a conjoint analysis is used to find out the company's preferences of its suppliers through the assessment of profiles, which are the combinations of attributes and levels used in the selection process. Selecting potential supplier can be established using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) method. This method would specify company's preferences visually in a multidimensional space, and in the end it would set the Euclidean distance for each supplier compared to the ideal point. Eventually, this perception map would help the company in choosing suppliers which are located within their ideal point.

Analysis model of air quality control management strategies in Tabriz	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Air pollution; EFE; IFE; QSPM; SWOT; strategic management	MORTALITY	The management of the quality of air pollution in Tabriz, Iran, is a major environmental problem in this city. The local authorities have dispersedly executed some projects to address the problem of air pollution so far, while controlling the air pollution requires a strategic planning and management. This paper intends to address the requirements needed for the environment management in Tabriz. In the first part of this paper briefly surveys the air pollution in Tabriz, and then the participating body to carry out the research in the process of planning the strategic management is introduced. To determine the basic information and to provide the necessary matrixes, the Delphi method, a questionnaire and interviews are employed. In this research, the External Factor Evaluation Matrix (EFE), Internal Factor Evaluation Matrix (IFE), Strengths - Weakness - Opportunities - Threats Matrix (SWOT), and Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM) are provided to plan the quantitative planning of the strategic management of the air in Tabriz. Finally doing the tests of Kolmogorov-Smirnov with an analysis of variance, mean comparison and using the software SPSS and Mtb, the priority of the strategies were determined through summing up and analysis. It was found that the high quantity of the degree of attractiveness of a strategy does not imply its priority. This paper offers a model for the assessment and management strategies to determine the air quality control in Tabriz. This model can be used to determine the proper strategy for the other cities with the air pollution and urban management.	[Moharamnejad, Naser; Ramazani, M.

R&D COLLABORATION IN THE LIFE SCIENCES: FINDING PARTNERS AND THE ROLE OF RESOURCE-BASED INDUCEMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRATEGIC ALLIANCE FORMATION; SMALL BUSINESS; HIGH-TECH; VIEW; COOPERATION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; PATTERNS; MODES	This paper addresses interorganisational collaboration by science-based firms active in the Dutch life sciences. More specifically, we focus on two aspects (1) processes of finding partners; and (2) resource-based inducements and opportunities guiding these processes. Overall, there appears to be an evolution from untargeted to targeted search as the firms become more established within the technological field. Unestablished firms largely depend on accepting invitations for collaboration offered to them by partners while more established firms are able to successfully initiate partnerships themselves. Considering more than one potential partner, e.g. actual partner selection, does not occur regularly, especially not in the case of partnerships initiated by the partner instead of the focal organisation. The use of a standardised list of preconditions to be considered in partner selection could be relevant here.

J	Brown, M; Paewai, S; Suddaby, G				Brown, Mark; Paewai, Shelley; Suddaby, Gordon			The VLE as a Trojan Mouse: Policy, Politics and Pragmatism	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING			English	Article						Moodle; learning management system; policy; leadership; institutional culture		This paper argues that selecting a new Learning Management System (LMS) is a strategic decision about the future direction of your institution. However, the development of a robust methodology for the selection of a new LMS is particularly challenging given the fluidity of the elearning environment. This is especially so when both quantitative and qualitative factors are overlaid by institutional requirements involving political considerations. Selecting the technology is only part of the process and the least problematic aspect. The real challenges are embedded in institutional culture. The paper reflects on the tactics, strategies and approval process involved in the decision to adopt Moodle to replace a proprietary system for the delivery of learning in New Zealand's largest university-level distance education provider. Critical to the process was the explication of guiding principles, pedagogical criteria and identification of institutional requirements, along with politically astute alliances and allegiances to inform and endorse the selection process. Those centrally involved in the decision process draw on their experiences and reflect on the type of questions that senior managers need to ask when considering new strategic initiatives in open and distance learning.

J	Ali, SS; Ahmad, F				Ali, Sadia Samar; Ahmad, Faizan			Flexible approach to satisfaction index: an Indian case study of health drink sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						quantitative tool; qualitative research; flexible approach; Indian; health drink; factor analysis; ACSI model; American Customer Satisfaction Index model; RSI; retailer satisfaction index; SPSS 16.0; AMOS		Globalisation and profit making led companies to adopt measures for satisfaction of their retailers and customers. Strategic decisions of a company for retailer's and customer satisfaction are considered to be multidimensional, interdisciplinary, complex and unstructured regarding time, quantity and quality. In this paper, a multiple decision making criteria has been proposed, based on American Customer Satisfaction Index and being named as Flexible Approach to Retailer's Satisfaction Index. The designed model requires quantitative and qualitative evaluation based on information such as anticipated and perceived service quality. This tool helps marketing planners in evaluating satisfaction. Here, the case of Glaxo SmithKline, India has been considered. Preliminary study was conducted for 96 retailers in Western Uttar Pradesh of India for checking the overall satisfaction of retailers and its impact on the market. The analysis suggests an acceptable and generic model that can be used by managers and researchers to evaluate satisfaction level. This paper concludes with a bright outlook for future.

J	Andreu, L; Ferruz, L; Vicente, L				Andreu, Laura; Ferruz, Luis; Vicente, Luis			The importance of asset allocation in Spanish equity pension plans	JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE			English	Article								Following the methodological approach taken by Ibbotson and Kaplan (2000), we provide evidence of a major contribution of strategic asset allocation to Spanish equity personal pension plan Performance, finding that oil average more than 90% of variability of returns over time, and about 70% of the variation of returns among plans, are explained by strategic policy. Furthermore, we also have evidence that survivor and look-ahead bias detected in previous research have very little impact oil the conclusions about the importance of asset allocation oil the variability of returns over time. The importance of asset allocation to explain the variability of returns over time is quite similar for the different investment vocations considered in our study, Euro zone and global equity. Very similar results are also found when we consider the size of the Spanish plans as an explanatory factor for the contribution of asset allocation to performance. Finally. the value that active management adds to the mere passive tracking of the strategic policy is not statistically different to the management costs of the plans.

This paper asks how we might think about learning appropriate for groups of young Yolnu Aboriginal men training to work as rangers on their traditional clan lands in North-East Arnhem Land(2) in the Northern Territory of Australia. These young men are committed to living and learning under the guidance of clan elders following the cognitive and moral dictates of traditional Yolnu Aboriginal knowledge. Yet as trainee rangers they are equally committed to engaging with the cognitive and economic aspects of contemporary land and sea management. We argue that the learning of such groups should be characterised by accepting possibilities of non- coherence between these metaphysically incommensurable domains. Learning here is working tensions that are both ontic and epistemic. This recognition should be combined with explicit induction into the workings of a strategic knowledge domain that, recognising the possibility of alternative methods, can connect enough with both scientific and Aboriginal knowledge.

J	Chinda, T				Chinda, Thanwadee			STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING OF PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENT	SURANAREE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Exploratory factor analysis; productivity enhancement; structural equation modelling		Productivity has often been cited as a key factor in industrial performance, and actions to increase it are said to improve profitability and the wage earning capacity of employees. Improving productivity is seen as a key issue for survival and success in the long term. This paper focuses on examining key factors of productivity enhancement, and investigating the causal relationships among those key factors to better understand and plan for productivity improvement. The results prove 5 key productivity factors, including 'leadership', 'strategic quality planning', 'people', 'data and information', and 'process management', leading to a conceptual model. 'Leadership' is found to be the main driver to productivity enhancement. The strong commitment of a leader is thus crucial in improving productivity. 'Leadership' strongly influences 'strategic quality planning' and 'process management', and indirectly influences 'people' through 'data and information' and 'strategic quality planning'. 'People' also plays a key role in the success of productivity enhancement. Additionally, there are direct and indirect relationships between 'data and information' and 'people' and between 'data and information' and 'process management', respectively.

J	Cline, K				Cline, Kurt			Negotiating the Superfund: Are Environmental Protection Agency regional officials willing to bargain with states?	SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Negotiation; Working relationships; Intergovernmental management	POLICY	Negotiation and bargaining are important activities in the Implementation of intergovernmental public policies Given the design of environmental policy, intergovernmental negotiations are in essential part of the interaction of environmental program managers. This study examines the willingness of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regional officials to bargain with their state counterparts In the national superfund program A model of working relationships is developed to analyze the negotiation, behavior of regional EPA officials The findings of this study indicate that both strategic (trust, involvement) and structural (relations with EPA headquarters, state program capacity. and state political context) factors are associated with whether or not regional officials are willing to negotiate with state-level administrators. The Implications of these findings for the national superfund program, the larger context of intergovernmental management, and larger themes in public administration are discussed in the conclusion of this paper.

J	Collins, MK; Winrow, B				Collins, Marianne; Winrow, Brian			Porter's generic strategies as applied toward e-tailers post-Leegin	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pricing; Anti-trust law; Cost accounting; Electronic commerce		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the applicability of Porter's model of generic strategies as applied toward online retailers following the United States Supreme Court's decision in Leegin, which appears to signal greater tolerance for minimum vertical price maintenance agreements. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a review of the literature and examines cases relating to minimum resale price maintenance agreements. Relying heavily on Porter's framework, it explores the strategic implications of the recent decision in Leegin for on-line retailers, many of whom rely on a cost leadership competitive advantage. Findings - Since the increased likelihood that vertical minimum price maintenance agreements will be permitted, thereby lowering the barriers to entry, online retailers may be deterred from utilizing low costs to under-price traditional retailers. As a result, the Leegin holding has devalued the feasibility of pursuing a cost leadership strategy, and e-tailers may need to adopt alternative or integrative strategies for securing a competitive advantage. Originality/value - The paper incorporates literature pertaining to Porter's model of generic strategies, online pricing strategies, as well as recent court cases.

J	Granados, AC; Gamez, GG				Corral Granados, Anabel; Granados Gamez, Genoveva			Sustainability and triple bottom line: key issues for successful Spanish school principals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Spain; Schools; Environmental management; Principals; Social responsibility	EDUCATION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss how an organizational triple bottom line approach can be adapted to increase organizational sustainability in a Spanish school setting and assist school directors, who hold the primary role, in the process of adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - Through synthesising different conceptual approaches, a system model was created based on design models, such as the "Design of results" and the "Cogniscope", and thereafter managerial triple bottom line theory was adapted to Spanish head teacher practices. Findings - The model shows that although there is no regulated training in school management in Spain, sustainability in schools can be managed by following this or similar strategic models, as long as adequate resources and managerial tools are provided. Practical implications - The paper discusses how sustainability can be achieved through the organization, management and implementation of already available resources in a school setting. This unique model informs, enables and empowers Spanish head teachers to lead and manage sustainable performances by following triple bottom line approaches. Originality/value - Terms such as triple bottom line and sustainability are fairly new and have received little attention in the field of education, even though research on organizational sustainability shows positive implications for future generations.

J	Fenies, P; Lagrange, S; Tchernev, N				Fenies, Pierre; Lagrange, Samuel; Tchernev, Nikolay			A decisional modelling for supply chain management in franchised networks: application in franchise bakery networks	PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL			English	Article						SCM; financial flows evaluation; franchise network; optimisation; mix rate	FLOWS	This article proposes a modelling process to evaluate/optimise supply chain flows in a franchise network. We will study bakery networks composed of a supply chain producer and a retail outlet that sells the products made by the operator of the network in his own factories. Our modelling is a combination of two modelling processes: a first modelling reproduces the running supply chain through simulation and/or optimisation (Comelli, M., Fenies, P., and Tchernev, N., 2008. A combined financial and physical flows evaluation for logistic process and tactical production planning: application in a company supply chain. International Journal of Production Economics, 112 (1), 77-95); then data given by this model are used by a model (B) which reproduces the consequences of model (A) on the mixed franchise network thanks to a mixed integer linear programming optimisation based on the four management challenges. Then, for the opening of a new outlet, generated cash flow is analysed to choose between a company owned and a franchise. We show that the plural form is more efficient in generating cash flow for the operator. This form is, in fact, the best choice for an operator who wants to develop his network while balancing challenges such as growth, uniformity, local responsiveness and global adaptation. This kind of approach links together two research fields: a strategic one with the choice of the statutory form of the outlet in a mixed franchised network, and a tactical and operational one that optimises the cash flow in supply chains.

J	Hickey, GM; Brunet, N; Allan, N				Hickey, Gordon M.; Brunet, Nicolas; Allan, Nadege			A Constant Comparison of the Environmental Assessment Legislation in Canada	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article						Sustainable development; harmonization; federalism; method; impact assessment	SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT; FEDERALISM; FISHERIES; POLLUTION; REGIME	Environmental assessment (EA) has long been recognized as one of Canada's most important regulatory tools for protecting the environment while meeting the public's expectations for economic growth. The value of this process resides in its ability to provide useful information to decision-makers in an efficient and effective manner. In Canada, the federal government is responsible for implementing the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 1995, while provincial governments are responsible for administering their own EA legislation. Importantly, such a multi-tiered approach to regulation can have a major impact on the collective outcomes of the decisions being made. This paper presents the results of a constant comparison of provincial, territorial, and federal Environmental Assessment Acts to clarify the extent to which requirements vary between jurisdictions in Canada. It then discusses these results in the context of the challenges facing multi-jurisdictional regulation of EA in Canada. Our study also demonstrates that constant comparison is an effective method for determining the common ground between the requirements of different environmental legislation, providing a grounded starting point from which strategic discussions on co-ordination between governments might proceed.

J	Juntunen, J				Juntunen, Jouni			Functional spin-offs in logistics service markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						outsourcing; vertical integration; structural equation modelling; horizontal modulation; vertical modulation	INTEGRATION; OWNERSHIP	The aim of this paper is to increase the understanding of logistics outsourcing decisions in a network context. The concepts influencing the decision to outsource logistics activities are first identified, using theories in organisational economics, marketing and strategic management. A tentative model showing the key concepts and their assumed relationships is developed and tested with empirical survey data from industrial companies in northern Finland. The estimations are made using structural equation modelling. Based on empirical analysis, a modified model is suggested which identifies two separate dimensions, or modes, of the outsourcing concept. These outsourcing modes offer a useful tool for defining the classic concept of functional spin-offs in logistics service markets. Moreover, the development paths of outsourcing relationships between the shipper and service provider can be examined on the basis of the horizontal and vertical outsourcing modes proposed in the paper.

IDENTIFICATION OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESSES OF INDIAN MANUFACTURING SMES USING AHP APPROACH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Total quality management; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Vidharbha; Analytical hierarchy process		This paper empirically determines the extent to which the criteria of total quality management (TQM) are achieved in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vidharbha region of state Maharashtra in India. These criteria represent the attributes of TQM and as such one can equate these to the benefits of TQM that are achieved in SME. In addition, weaknesses are highlighted to which scarce resources could be parsimoniously allocated. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methodology is used to determine the percent weightings of five categories of performance criteria that were identified via a review of quality management literature. An empirical analysis of the criteria of each stage using the AHP methodology and the expert opinion of the top management of SMEs operating in Vidharbha region are used to evaluate the percent weightings of the criteria that are synonymous with TQM implementation The findings of this study suggest that the SMEs were focused on UCN, but were least able to effectively determine their strategic direction. In addition, the potential benefits that could be derived from TQM criteria were lacking in the areas of EUD. Having compliance requirements that deal directly with these areas would help SMEs align their quality management practices with quality culture and strategic process changes towards TQM.

J	Kalra, A; Soberman, D				Kalra, Ajay; Soberman, David			The forgotten side of marketing	JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						marketing effectiveness; marketing research; marketing implementation; time pressure; planning process; learning		In this article, we provide a new explanation for the poor return on marketing that seems to be a problem in many industries. The literature on errors in strategic decision making is focussed on the leaders of organizations. Yet most tactical decisions regarding marketing allocation and effort are made by brand managers, and not leaders. In this article, we explore how the context in which brand managers make decisions (time pressure, colleagues with similar skill sets and the desire to advance) can cause poor marketing performance. In particular, we show how training, the exchange of advice and the management of market research lead to decisions that are not profi t-maximizing. In the corporate environment, insufficient attention is allocated to understanding how these activities affect marketing decisions; hence, our description of these activities as the 'Forgotten Side of Marketing'. We conclude by proposing a number of straightforward practices that firms can implement to better manage these activities and improve the return from marketing.

Decision model and analysis for investment interest expense deduction and allocation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						OR in strategic planning; Nonlinear programming; Income tax; Investment interest expense; Linear programming	RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; OPTIMAL CONSUMPTION; BOUNDED VARIABLES; KNAPSACK-PROBLEMS; ALGORITHM; CORPORATE; TAXATION; SUBJECT	Investment income tax planning requires informed, strategic choices. One must determine the amount of qualified dividends and net long-term capital gain to be included in investment income (against which investment interest expense can be deducted). This choice also determines the residual qualified dividends and net long-term capital gain which enjoy a reduced tax rate. Another important decision is whether all or some of this interest expense should be deducted in the current year or carried forward. This paper puts forward a new approach to formulate these questions as a generalized resource allocation problem which permits analysis of the interdependence between, and the tax consequences of, the above decisions. The commonly used approach - deducting investment interest expense sooner rather than later - we consider myopic since the benefit of deferring some of the deduction is not leveraged. Presented here is a tax planning guideline (a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality) to realize a more forward-looking strategy. We also show that, for certain income structures, the tax savings by deducting a one-dollar investment interest expense may be more than the tax rate on the dollar of investment income that is offset.

J	Mahapatra, S; Mahapatra, SS				Mahapatra, Sabita; Mahapatra, S. S.			Customer experience management through emotional connection: an Indian perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						emotion; customer decision making; customer experience; customer satisfaction		The marketing power of emotion traces the manner in which companies rely on emoting to connect with consumers, develop new products, improve their strategic position and increase brand recognition. Emotion is not the only element in making buying decisions, but a necessary condition if decisions are not to be continually postponed. It has been debated in the literature that consumers while making purchase, decisions are purely driven by cognitions. Recent studies, while examining how consumers actually make decisions in various shopping contexts, establish the fact that consumers are more often mindless rather than mindful decision makers. For many reasons, market research communities have been giving too much emphasis to consider rationally driven behaviours, thereby largely ignoring the influence of emotions. The present study makes an attempt to integrate these two broad themes with the propositions that it will infuse more life and realism into an understanding of consumer purchase process and theory of consumer satisfaction.

Nowadays, a commercial leisure property has gained an important role within the total spectrum of world economies. Despite these developments in the leisure sector, the valuation of property for the purpose of commercial leisure is still regarded as an Achilles' heel. The accepted approach to the property valuation in UK is to perform an open market valuation for the existing use. However, for the specialized properties including leisure assets, the distinctive valuation methodology has to be applied. This paper outlines the principles of methodology that are commonly used for the valuation of leisure property in the UK, Lithuania and other countries. Factors affecting the valuation process with respect to the property development and investment decision are discussed. The study is accompanied with examples of valuation method applications and analyses of individual case studies of golf course valuation.

J	Marion, TJ; Sipahi, R				Marion, Tucker J.; Sipahi, Rifat			Early-stage firms and delay-based inventory control using decision-making tableaux	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						supply chain; delays; entrepreneurship; decision modelling; start-ups	SUPPLY CHAIN; MANAGERIAL BEHAVIOR; INFORMATION; BUSINESS; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; MODEL	A resource constrained early-stage firm commercialising assembled products faces supply chain (SC) problems that could ultimately cause the company to fail. Delays, complexity, and associated cost overruns throughout the SC can quickly drain cash flow, putting a new firm in a disadvantaged position. This is exacerbated by the increased use of outsourced global suppliers, demands of resellers, and pressure for rapid growth. A decision-making tableau over a conceptual delay-based SC model is proposed, which identifies qualitative behaviour of inventories with respect to delays inherently present in the SC. The method can foster improved strategic decisions in new venture SC set-up and management that can reduce costly variations. A real-world case scenario is given illustrating a current state and substantially improved future state with the help of the proposed approach. The paper concludes with a discussion on the results, limitations, and direction of future research.

J	Monavari, SM; Farshchi, P; Ohadi, S				Monavari, Seyed Masoud; Farshchi, Parvin; Ohadi, Sara			Evaluation of strategic factors in environmental management of nature-based tourism in coastal areas: the case of Gorgan Bay, Iran	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Strategic planning; environmental management; AHP; SWOT; nature-based tourism (NBT); Gorgan Bay; Caspian Sea	SWOT ANALYSIS	Identification of strategic factors plays an important role in the process of environmental planning of nature-based tourism. Analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) is a common approach in strategic planning, but it does not define the importance of each strategic factor. Thus, we used the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a decision analysis method based on pair-wise comparisons, along with SWOT to determine priorities of the factors and their contribution in strategy formulation in Gorgan Bay, in the south east of the Caspian Sea, Iran. This region is a complex tourist destination, which consists of many sensitive habitats and has different management structures. Based on the interviews with many experts at environmental management and tourism, the results show that the highest priorities of strategic factors are the members of weakness and threats group. This presents the role and importance of these factors in the process of formulating new strategies or review of them. After identification of strategic factors and their priorities, decision-makers can define new strategies in the next phase of the planning process. In addition, a few examples of new strategies for the Study area are proposed in this paper. Our research indicates this method is a useful approach in environmental management of nature-based tourism goals and activities, because decision-makers can easily identify strategic factors. The method can prevent misjudgments and provide an analytical approach for formulating strategies in future, especially in a mix of popular destinations and important environments. The paper concludes that strategic factors affecting internal and external environment of nature-based tourism are very different and complicated. This emphasize on using helpful methods such as combination of SWOT and AHP, which is presented in this paper.

Contingency Factors of Management Accounting Practices in Thailand: A Selection Approach	ASIAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Management accounting practices (MAPs); perceived environmental uncertainty (PEU); competitive strategy; strategic mission		This paper aims to investigate the certain types of management accounting practices (MAPs) that are appropriate to the specific characteristics of Thai companies. The study uses survey method to obtain 135 responses from accounting managers of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries listed on Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). Perceived environmental uncertainty (PEU), competitive strategy, and size were found to have impact on MAPs. Firms operating in higher PEU obtain higher benefit from both contemporary and traditional MAPs. In line with expectations, firms pursuing prospector strategies perceive higher benefit from contemporary MAPs than those pursuing defender strategies. No relationship has been found between competitive strategy and traditional MAPs. Larger firms also obtain higher benefit from both contemporary and traditional MAPs than smaller firms. The findings confirm the premise that firms' characteristics reflected in exogenous, strategy, and endogenous variables have influence on the design of management accounting systems in organizations. In particular, prospector firms and those facing high levels of environmental uncertainty should consider increased use of contemporary MAPs. Academics and practitioners should note the continuing benefit perceived from traditional MAPs, a feature confirmed in many pieces of international research.

We derive and compare the equilibrium investment strategies in three types of duopoly: (i) two symmetric firms, both of which can issue debt, (ii) two symmetric firms, only one of which (the leader) can issue debt, and (iii) a levered firm versus an unlevered firm. We show that in (iii) and in equilibrium, the levered firm always invests prior to the unlevered firm. Further, we derive the equilibrium in the competitive situation of n levered firms, and show that social loss increases as the number of the firms, n, becomes larger.

J	Nogeste, K				Nogeste, Kersti			Understanding mergers and acquisitions (M&As) from a program management perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Transition management; Integration; Acquisitions and mergers; Project management	LESSONS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how the practice of program management can be used to manage strategically-oriented initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Design/methodology/approach - The methodology applied is high-level reflective retrospective qualitative field research conducted by a practitioner-scholar in response to the research question: How does the program management approach applied to a small-scale acquisition compare to the current joint bodies of program management and M&A theory and practice? Findings - The practice of program management provides a means for managing strategically oriented initiatives such as small-scale acquisitions. Research limitations/implications - This paper is constrained by a high-level literature review of English language publications only, and high-level reflective retrospective qualitative field research conducted by a single practitioner-scholar upon a single relatively small-scale acquisition, which cannot necessarily be scaled up to be representative of a larger-scale acquisition, nor given the differences between M&As be used as a direct template for other M&As. Also, as a purely qualitative field research study into an area of intermediate maturity, the response to the research question lacks statistical support. Practical implications - M&As are increasing in frequency and yet continue to have relatively high-failure rates. Based on the findings of this paper, the practice of program management provides a means of managing strategic initiatives such as acquisitions. Originality/value - This paper adds to the bodies of program management and M&A literature, from the dual perspectives of practice and research, particularly with reference to small acquisitions and acquisitions in the small and medium enterprise sector.

J	Pophaley, M; Vyas, RK				Pophaley, Mahesh; Vyas, R. K.			Choice criteria for maintenance strategy in automotive industries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						maintenance cost; corrective maintenance; regular preventive maintenance; predictive maintenance	SELECTION; POLICY	In the automotive industry, it is thought that effective maintenance management will permit fast, cost-effective responses to unpredictable and ever-changing product demand and support rapid product launches. Continued pressure on companies to reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction has resulted in increasingly detailed examinations of maintenance strategies. A judiciously selected maintenance program can provide significant advantages in relation to quality, safety, availability and cost reduction in these plants. A wrong decision can lead to the failure of the maintenance program and consequent economic losses, as the setting up of these programs is a strategic decision. Therefore justification of any given maintenance strategy within an organisation must consider cost criteria. The purpose of this study is to select the apposite maintenance strategy based on the maintenance cost choice criteria to improve the availability of production equipments. Corrective maintenance, regular preventive maintenance and predictive maintenance costs are compared and the exponential law is used to represent reliability and evaluate maintenance costs. Further simple mathematical cost models are developed and presented to carry out the decision making in relation to the selection of the maintenance strategy. The conclusion that can be drawn from the study indicates that maintenance cost ratio is the governing factor in this aspect. The proposed method can be adapted to an industrial situation in a mass production factory like an automotive industry.

J	Razouk, AA; Bayad, M				Razouk, Abdelwahab Ait; Bayad, Mohamed			Evolution of the practices of human resource management in France towards a strategic model: rhetoric or reality?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						France context; human resource management; reality; rhetoric; strategic human resource management	MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE; FIRM; DETERMINANTS; SYSTEMS; VIEW; FIT	This article analyses the evolution of the human resources management in France. The study attempts to understand the transformation of administrative practices of HRM towards strategic practices of HRM (SHRM) in the French context. It also shows the factors responsible for this change. The results of this study support the development in France of SHRM and the regression of administrative practices of HRM, although a third hybrid model of HRM seems to appear between both practices. This tendency towards SHRM is accentuated in large firms, quoted on the stock exchange, in services and finance sectors with international activities. This study confirms that the SHRM in France is reality rather than rhetoric.

J	Ross, PK; Buchner, LM				Ross, Peter K.; Buechner, Lutz Michael			Global Consistency Versus Local Responsiveness: Deutsche Telekom's Human Resource Management Strategies in Central and Eastern Europe	JOURNAL OF EAST-WEST BUSINESS			English	Article						Eastern Europe; institutional path dependency; international industrial relations; strategic international employment relations; strategic international human resource management; telecommunications	PRIVATIZATION; ENTERPRISES; POLITICS	This article analyses the competing demands faced by Deutsche Telekom for global consistency and local responsiveness as it attempted to coordinate its human resource management strategies across its Eastern European subsidiaries. It considers the degree to which the former economic and political histories of Eastern Europe continue to influence and/or constrain multinational corporation strategies and practices in the post-2000 era. Institutional path dependency, strategic international human resource management, and international industrial relations theories are used to assist in analyzing the data. The study concludes that managerial constraints associated with the historical and economic legacies of these former socialist countries are rapidly declining, thereby allowing multinational firms to implement ''Western-style'' human resource management strategies. It further suggests that industrial relations institutions at the European Union level, rather than individual country level, have the greatest potential to impact on international human resource management strategies in the region. Multinational corporations should therefore engage in more-integrated strategic international human resource management and international industrial relations approaches.

J	Rymesova, P; Kolman, L				Rymesova, Pavla; Kolman, Ludek			A REFLECTION ON UNIVERSITY STUDIES AND FURTHER CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF CHOSEN CULS FACULTIES' GRADUATES	JOURNAL ON EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIBILITY IN EDUCATION AND SCIENCE			English	Article						Career; career development; career maturity; career orientation; choice of profession		The article is focused on professional orientation and direction of the careers of graduates of Faculty of Economics and Management (FEM) and Faculty of Agrobiology, Food and Natural Resources (FAFNR) at Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CULS). The general information and theoretical part is devoted to the topic of career, its concept and definition, and it deals with chosen determinants of career orientation and career development. The concept of career is considered within the sphere of specialized terminology mainly used in humanities disciplines, it defines subjective and objective career. Moreover, the concepts of life developmental tasks and career maturity are being mapped. The existence of typical stages of development is also discussed, for which there are typical qualitative differences on the level of information, in relation to a given profession and in motivation towards the profession (with regard to the stage that includes university studies). Significant influence of objective and situational factors, which interfere with career orientation and the choice of a profession, is further included. A look at a person's personality with respect to the determinants of career orientation and career development also forms a part of the general information part. In its first part of the empirical section, the article is focused on the concept and definition of career from the beginning of the 1990s. This includes the views of Czech as well as foreign authors. In the second part, the article tries to present practical consequences of students' career orientation and it deals with processing an estimate whether the observed faculties' graduates remain working in the field related to what they studied within five years from graduation. A part of the study is also formed by a description of the main motives leading to choosing a profession during university studies. The chosen attributes were monitored among a selected group of students, which was formed by graduates of the daily Masters programmes at Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, specifically at Faculty of Economics and Management - Operations and Economics programme and Business and Administration programme, and at the Faculty of Agrobiology, Food and Natural Resources regardless of studied programmes. The students graduated at least a year and maximum five years prior to the conducted research. The data were collected with the help of a survey. The survey included 17 items and was sent out electronically. The respondents marked which facts and to what extent distinctly influenced their professional direction given by the studied programme during their studies at the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. They also answered an inquiry whether they remain working in the profession that they prepared for during their studies, or (if applicable) the survey tried to find out why their career took a different direction.

J	Shi, H				Shi, Hong			Framework Suitability for Strategic Management in the Hospitality Industry: A Comparative Study	JOURNAL OF CHINA TOURISM RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategic management; strategic framework; suitability		In recent years strategic management has become a basic concept and a mainstream part of management education, but its application needs to be explored. This article questions whether there is a strategic management framework (model) that could he of universal use in countries with markedly different economic systems, political views and cultural identities. A number of four-star hotels were selected in two countries for this research, China and the UK, for the reason of being good examples of having two widely different economic and political environments. A framework for strategic management contains four key areas: scanning, planning, analysis, and evaluation.

Since multi-commodity delivery is popular in practice, we can make a more reliable and operational decision by simultaneously taking into accounts dynamic circumstances. In this study, therefore, we have extended the previous method to cope with this aspect that has scarcely considered so far, i.e., dynamic integrated capacitated multi-commodity. Numerical experiments revealed the role of inventory management over planning horizon and the validity of the proposed method through comparison with the results from commercial software.

J	Small, MW; Minkes, L				Small, Michael W.; Minkes, Leonard			On the nature of learning communities: a study of four organisations	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Higher education; Learning; Communities; Australia		Purpose - The purpose of this investigation is to look at four organisations to see whether they meet the criteria of learning communities. Two are involved with higher education, one is an army unit, and the fourth is an organisation responsible for aviation safety. Design/methodology/approach - The research was based on qualitative analyses of what made the four organisations learning communities. This comprised interviews with key personnel and responding to a 15-item questionnaire. Findings - In the Australian example, specialised areas of responsibility were established to facilitate change. In the Indonesian example, a colonial past, a political/cultural divide, a feudalistic approach to modern day problems and a rich tradition presented a challenge to innovation. In the army unit, highly specialised knowledge had to be acquired, adapted and applied. In the aviation safety organisation, technological issues specifying flight operations were the main focus. This organisation was akin to both a learning organisation and an innovative knowledge community, although working within a bureaucratic structure. Research limitations/implications - One limitation was access to personnel such as CEOs. Another was translating the questionnaire into Indonesian. A third was related to confidentiality, i.e. should participants reveal the identity of their parent organisation, and their own? Practical implications - The study identified the need to re-define strategic objectives. Organisations must undertake this task when faced with changing circumstances. Originality/value - The paper has value because it looks at effective, learning communities and the formal and the informal learning process.

Besides conceptual considerations, we base our arguments on a detailed case study from an auto financing company. Findings of this paper are that quantitative modelling can be helpful for service quality strategy implementation in a dynamic environment.

J	Tavana, M; O'Connor, A				Tavana, Madjid; O'Connor, Aidan			An integrated strategic benchmarking model for assessing international alliances with application to NATO membership enlargement	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Benchmarking; Analytic hierarchy process; International organizations; Decision making; Strategic alliances		Purpose - Promoting security, stability and cooperation is the raison d'etre of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and these are the aims of its strategy of membership enlargement. The incentive of NATO membership has led some former Warsaw Pact applicant countries to reform their political systems, transform their economies, deal with corruption and improve social justice and human rights. However, controversy has surrounded NATO's enlargement because of the current ambiguous and subjective decision-making process and the effect that it could have on the organization. This paper aims to present the results of a study to develop a benchmarking model as a means to assist NATO evaluate and screen potential applicant countries. Design/methodology/approach - A novel and structured multiple-criteria decision analysis model that considers specific NATO applicant evaluation criteria and environmental forces is offered and a template for a membership evaluation process is proposed. A total of 120 researchers in France, Germany, Switzerland and the USA provided the necessary data on the 23 countries that are analyzed in order to develop the benchmarking model. Four distinct categories were established to categorize these countries. The ranking of the countries based on Euclidean distance from the ideal state is illustrated with a classification schema outlining four typologies as beneficial believers, detrimental disadvantaged, perilous partners and apathetic acquaintances. Findings - Among the potential applicant countries considered as "beneficial believers" are Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Finland and Ireland while other countries, such as, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, Montenegro, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are considered as " detrimental disadvantaged". Furthermore, Russia and Ukraine were identified as "perilous partners" and Malta, FYR Macedonia, Cyprus, Serbia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Armenia and Moldova were identified as "apathetic acquaintances". Practical implications - This model could be applied to other supranational organizations and multinational firms when assessing international strategic alliances. Originality/value - The paper presents the results of a study to develop a benchmarking model as an aid in evaluating and screening potential NATO applicant countries.

J	Therin, F				Therin, Francois			Learning for innovation in high-technology small firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovation; learning; high-tech small firms	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; PRODUCT INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; MARKET; DETERMINANTS; STRATEGY	Most literature pertaining to organisational learning and performance remains conceptual. On the basis of theoretical findings reported in the previous strategic and knowledge management literature, the proposed model offers an empirical means to study the links among organisational learning, innovation and company performance. The derived constructs, applied to a sample of 110 high-tech small firms and used to test the model, indicate a positive relationship among the three factors; moreover, company age moderates these results. The paper concludes with recommendations regarding how to capture and share knowledge for small firm managers.

J	Timmor, Y; Zif, J				Timmor, Yaron; Zif, Jehiel			Change readiness: an alternative conceptualization and an exploratory investigation	EUROMED JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						Management strategy; Interviews	STRATEGIC CHANGE; ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; MARKET ORIENTATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MODEL; IMPACT; FLEXIBILITY; ANTECEDENTS; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - Change readiness (CR) is viewed as a multidimensional behavior that reflects the firm's competencies to do three things in response to environmental opportunities and threats in its industry: trigger identification; gearing up to take action (preparation); and the action's degree of novelty. The main purpose of this study is to propose and test an alternative conceptualization for CR. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 217 organizations in 14 countries. All respondents were in charge of, or involved with, their firms' strategic decisions and implementations thereof and filled out a structured questionnaire. Findings - It was found that CR is influenced by both internal and external variables, including management orientation (entrepreneurial, centralization), environmental barriers, and technology and innovation roles in firms' business strategies. In addition, a higher degree of CR was correlated with better performance and with higher management evaluation of success in coping with environmental triggers. Research limitations/implications - The size and selection of the sample may pose limits in generalizing the study findings. Future studies may increase the number of interviews per firm, use objective assessments of performance and provide more specific information about threats and opportunities, as well as the type of industry. Originality/value - The proposed CR concept is based on specific behavior rather than on attitude. CR is perceived as a strategy-oriented construct that demonstrates the capacity of an organization to respond effectively to new developments in its environment.

J	Uusitalo, O; Mikkola, T				Uusitalo, Olavi; Mikkola, Toni			Revisiting the case of float glass Understanding the industrial revolution through the design envelope	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Design; Manufacturing industries; Entrepreneurialism; Ceramics and glass technology; Industrial revolution		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is twofold. First and most importantly, the paper aims to explain how Pilkington is able to revolutionize the flat glass industry. The modified design envelope model is applied to demonstrate the technological competence and especially strategic thinking concerning to understanding of the markets and positioning the product. Second, the paper demonstrates the entrepreneurship within a large-scale manufacturing firm. Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies a longitudinal, historical, and contextual approach. The paper uses multiple case study method and multiple data sources. This is done because creation of an innovation does not take place in vacuum, it is context bound. Findings - The float glass fulfills the requirements of two industries: the plate and sheet glasses. Within both industries, short-sighted competitors concentrate on technologies applicable only in other industry. Pilkington positions the float glass first clearly in the plate glass industry and after further development introduces the technology to sheet glass industry as a total surprise. Based on the case, the paper argues that positioning should be part of the corporate strategy. Practical implications - In addition to complex systematic technologies, the example shows that the design envelope model is applicable also for simple non-assembled products like flat glass. The model is useful for companies to build scenarios for responses if new unexpected innovations will be introduced in its own or related industries. Originality/value - This paper offers a novel insight to the old but still viable case of dominant design. In addition, the thorough case description allows reader to go deeply into a classic example of process innovation.

J	Valos, MJ; Polonsky, M; Geursen, G; Zutshi, A				Valos, Michael; Polonsky, Michael; Geursen, Gus; Zutshi, Ambika			Marketers' perceptions of the implementation difficulties of multichannel marketing	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						strategy implementation; multichannel marketing; challenges; qualitative; research; strategic typologies	CHANNEL MIX; STRATEGY; OPPORTUNITIES; MANAGERS; ONLINE	This paper identifies implementation difficulties associated with multichannel marketing as perceived by senior marketers. While, multichannel marketing is being increasingly used because of its revenue enhancing and cost reduction opportunities, it appears more difficult to implement than `traditional' single channel marketing. Traditional strategy implementation frameworks as typified by Miles and Snow and Porter, do not appear to address the implementation complexities of multichannel strategies especially when considering the dynamism of contemporary external environments. Using the methodology of thematic analysis, three implementation difficulty themes were identified: (1) understanding multichannel customer behaviour; (2) delivering sales, service and pre-purchase information; and (3) dealing with organisational politics and conflict caused by emerging channels. We propose that dynamic strategic frameworks can better address complexity and uncertainty, and overcome implementation difficulties. The paper concludes with general and specific research propositions to test the effectiveness of dynamic strategic frameworks in terms of the three themes.

The Influence of Culture on B2B in Thailand	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Business to business; Cultural fit; Cultural influence; IT adoption; Task-Technology fit; Thai culture	E-COMMERCE; ADOPTION; MARKETPLACES; INTERNET; STRATEGY	This study investigates how Thai culture affects the use of internet-based business-to-business (B2B) technology in the Thai tourism industry. Extending Goodhue and Thompson's Task-Technology-Fit (TTF) model (1995), we develop the Task-Technology-Culture-Fit (TTCF) to consider, through the lens of strategic fit, how cultural fit impacts the adoption of B2B technology in the Thai tourism industry. The study explores, in particular, five dimensions of cultural fit and their implications for how the B2B technology is adopted. These dimensions are personal relationships, long-term relationships, inter-organisational trust, ability to communicate in the English language and western influence. Firms registered in the Thai tourism B2B e-marketplace were surveyed and the data was analysed via structural equation modelling with the partial least squares method. Results showed that more the B2B technology was perceived by the users to fit their culture, the more likely they were to use the technology. Nevertheless, task-technology fit still had a greater impact than culture on a firm's perceived performance.

J	Vu, DA; Shi, YJ; Gregory, M				Vu, Dung Anh; Shi, Yongjiang; Gregory, Mike			Brand and product integration in horizontal mergers and acquisitions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						brand; product; integration; M&As; value creation; competitiveness	VALUE CREATION; BUSINESS MARKETS; INDUSTRIAL; STRATEGY; DECISION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; TRACKING; LESSONS; EQUITY	This paper aims to understand integration of brands and products after Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As). The paper identifies four different strategies for integrating brands and products: 'Choice', 'Growth Maximisation', 'Harmonisation' and 'Foundation'. These strategies act as strategic directions for firms to follow and to integrate brands and products in post-horizontal M&As in order to create and deliver value and competitiveness. Each main integration strategy contains a set of different sub-strategies ( 18 in total) which aim to achieve the same objective set by its umbrella integration strategy. The paper also builds the linkage between the integration sub-strategies and the two currently-in-use views - positioning and resource-based - from the strategic management perspective. Through in-depth case studies and analyses, a broader view towards 'brand' is developed and discussed in which the successful management of brands requires paying close attention to both the external customer franchise and the internal organisational system and culture.

J	Xun, JY				Xun, Jiyao			Retail internationalisation through M&As: a study of the talent challenge in a British-acquired Taiwanese-retailer in mainland China	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMER RESEARCH			English	Article						retail internationalisation; China; Britain; Taiwan; mergers and acquisitions (M&As); talent challenge; intra-firm cliques; network		This study aims to add new knowledge to the emerging theme of retail internationalisation as a dynamic process rather than merely a market entry. Situated in the post World Trade Organization China where retail mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are permitted, this research explores via a case study, the talent challenges that emerged after an international acquisition in mainland China made by a leading British retailer of a previously Taiwanese-owned retail chain. By examining in depth the characteristics of a multinational expatriate-based management system as a product of M&A in this firm, the analysis identifies new strategic problems. This article shows that such talent challenges have been largely ignored as a strategic priority by this British retail firm in their post M&A transition. It opens up a promising perspective for researching other Western retail giants in their post M&As times in China, and thus for contributing further to the study of retail internationalisation as a process.

J	Yan, YN; Zhang, SH; Zeng, F				Yan, Yanni; Zhang, Sophie; Zeng, Fue			The exploitation of an international firm's relational capabilities: an empirical study	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						relational capabilities; market futurity; trust; networking	NETWORK; TRUST; GUANXI; CHINA; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; ADVANTAGE; MARKET; MODEL	The study focuses on an international firm's relational capabilities that mediate to effectively facilitate organizational collaborations. We assess how the influence that arises from an international firm's cooperative strategies including market futures, trust and business network may affect the exploitation of the firm's relational capabilities and its impact on performance, using survey data from 320 firms. This study empirically tests how the effects of an international firm's market futures, trust and business network influence the exploitation of the firm's relational capabilities. Results of structural equation modeling do indicate that trust and business network influence the exploitation of a firm's relational capabilities. This study confirms that the leveraging of an international firm's relational capability within its focal trust and business networking does achieve superior performance.

J	Ghosh, D; Willinger, GL; Ghosh, S				Ghosh, Dipankar; Willinger, G. Lee; Ghosh, Sucharita			A firm's external environment and the hiring of a non-standard workforce: implications for organisations	HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article								This article empirically investigates organisations' strategic decision to hire nonstandard employees. Using US firm-level data and a matched pair design, the study shows that firms operating in a more competitive environment and a less uncertain environment have a higher proportion of non-standard workers. Further, firms with a greater proportion of non-standard workers show higher financial growth. And finally, in a highly competitive environment, those firms that hire more nonstandard workers achieve significantly higher financial growth. Similar growth is experienced by those firms in the low uncertainty environment hiring more non-standard workers. These results are all consistent with the research hypotheses.

This article builds a case for strengthening science and education-based programs to address outdoor recreation management challenges and train the next generation of natural resource leaders. We describe a national-level effort to develop a 5-year strategic plan for outdoor recreation research and education. Outcomes from this strategic plan are elaborated and a call to action is issued. The forestry community needs to seize this political opportunity to bring about real change on the ground-change that builds a healthier and more prosperous America.

J	Harrison, JL				Harrison, Jennifer L.			Untangling the value of information scope: An investigation in retail pharmacies	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						information systems; environmental uncertainty; strategic orientation; pharmacies	PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY; ORGANIZATIONAL-EFFECTIVENESS; MANAGEMENT INFORMATION; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; BALANCED SCORECARD; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; IMPACT; LEVEL; FIT	This research investigates whether the importance of information scope for decision making mediates the relations between dimensions of strategic orientation, perceived environmental uncertainty (PEU) and organisational effectiveness in the retail pharmacy industry. Data from a survey of NSW pharmacies was analysed using structural equation modelling. Although two dimensions of strategic orientation - product-market development and market scope - were positively associated with information scope, the direct organisational benefits and mediating role of broad scope information were disconfirmed and no link between information scope and PEU was found. The results suggest the need for rethinking theoretical models of information scope. Implications for retail pharmacies and organisations interested in the effectiveness of those businesses are discussed.

J	Garcia-Merino, T; Santos-Alvarez, V				Garcia-Merino, Teresa; Santos-Alvarez, Valle			Characterizing the Top Journals in Strategic Management: Orientation, Style, Originality, and Readability	JOURNAL OF SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING			English	Article						strategic management; top journals; orientation; style; originality; readability	BUSINESS POLICY SCHOLARS; FORUM; RELEVANCE; QUALITY; FIELD	This paper characterizes the top journals in strategic management forum with respect to their orientation, style, originality, and readability. Data for the study were obtained from the Emerald Management Reviews database of Emerald Group Publishing Ltd. We analysed the period between 1996 and 2003. The main conclusions to be drawn from the analysis include the increasingly clear research orientation and academic style of the publications. Harvard Business Review figured prominently for its practical orientation, a predominantly professional/journalistic style, together with its readability. The journals that stand out for their originality are Strategic Management Journal and Academy of Management Journal. Although academic, Academy of Management Review also occasionally includes papers with a professional/journalistic style. Finally, we compare experts' views on the orientation and style of the journals with objective information gathered from the journals about their readership. We observed agreement in some of these, but noticed differences in Strategic Management Journal and in Administrative Science Quarterly.

J	Popoli, P; Popoli, A				Popoli, Paolo; Popoli, Arturo			Old and New Paradigms for IT Services Offshoring	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR			English	Article						Business IT Strategy; IT Offshoring; IT Outsourcing; Outsourcing Decision; Relational View; Strategic Sourcing; Transaction Cost Theory	STRATEGY	This article presents some new conceptual and interpretative paradigms concerning offshoring Information Technology services, in the light of the most recent market trends. In the current competitive scenario, IT structures are increasingly asked to "participate" in the development and innovation of business, rather than being merely a "support" for the value chain activities, managed merely on the basis of technical and economic efficiency. We start by confuting two traditional concepts: first, that only activities which are quite distinct from the core-business can be candidates for outsourcing, and secondly that the advantage to be derived from offshore outsourcing is above all a matter of costs. What is meant by "success" in this new perspective? We analyse the main critical factors in an offshoring contract enhancing value creation and business strategy. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the main drivers of solution design and ongoing management in IT offshoring strategies.

Production performance of Gohilwadi goats under range conditions	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Buck; Goat; Gohilwadi; Migration; Production; Range-grazing; Strategic inputs		A study on Gohilwadi goats belonging 56 flocks of 17 villages of Kathiawad region of Gujarat was carried out to evaluate the management and performance. Gohilwadi are medium to large sized (70-85 cm withers height) and dual-purpose goats mostly concentrated in Bhavnagar and Amreli and in some pockets of Rajkot, Ahmedabad and Junagarh districts. The coat colour of these goats is black, head is long (16-22 cm) with relatively bulged forehead and convex face profile. Horns move backward laterally, twisted (1-2 folds) and medium in length ( 12-17 cm). Ears are pendulous. folded, medium in length (15-19 cm) and black in colour. Udder is symmetrical, pendulous and capacious with cylindrical and outward teats with round tips. People of Rebari and Bharwad communities mostly rear these goats. Flock size varied from 10 to 78 with an average of 28 +/- 3. Goats were mostly (76%) kept in open corrals enclosed with fencing of bushes. These goats were maintained on range grazing without supplementary feeding. About 35-50% (medium to large size) flocks migrate for 6-8 months towards North and South Gujarat in summer and sizable flocks (10-15%) remains oil migration throughout the year. Goats (>87%) were bred during summer (April-June) due to better biomass availability with onset of rain in July. Males for breeding were mostly (67%) selected from their own flock, initially from high yielding (2.5-3 litre peak yield), tall and true to breed darn's and finally oil the basis of their libido and fertility. Bucks (1-2) were available with large flock and used excessively (80-100 goats/year). Major criterions of doe/female selection were breed characteristics and milk yield. The average age of first kidding, lactation length, kidding interval, and herd life were 19.07 +/- 0.73, 6.52 +/- 0.30, 10.78 +/- 0.57, 91 +/- 7 months, respectively. The twin and triplet recorded were 46.7 and 5.3%, respectively. The average body weight of males at birth, 3, 6, 9, 12 and > 18 months of age were 2.78 +/- 0.1, 10.1 +/- 0.4, 16.9 +/- 1.1, 21.8 +/- 1.6, 30.4 +/- 2.4 and 48.5 +/- 4.5 kg, respectively. Corresponding body weights of females were 2.64 +/- 0.01, 10.6 +/- 0.3, 15.6 +/- 0.5, 18.2 +/- 0.7, 21.07, 21.07 +/- 0.8 and 37.6 +/- 0.5 kg, respectively. The average milk yield recorded was ranged from 0.98 litre (I parity) to 1.42 litre (fourth parity) with an average of 1.29 litre/day. Infantile diarrhoea, pneumonia and coccidiosis were major diseases in kids accounted for 10% mortality. Whereas, diarrhoea, FMD foot-rot, PPR, pneumonia, blue tounge and mycoplasmal mastitis were common diseases in adult accounted for about 5% mortality of their strength. Grass root infrastructure available in the state for sheep development may be utilized for goat development by state government for motivating the goat keepers to adopt strategic management inputs, judicious utilization of bucks, prophylaxis and marketing of goat (males) for meat.

METHODS: A total of 2,028 surveys were sent electronically or by mail. A total of 136 optometrists reporting a special interest in low vision rehabilitation responded to an 18-item survey about practice mode, educational background, affiliations, and other demographic information. They were queried on methodology, frequency, and specific strategic content of rehabilitation training. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of the 136 respondents were private practitioners. Fifty-four percent of all respondents agreed that they train patients for 1 hour or less. Nine percent provided 3 or more training visits and were more likely to utilize an occupational therapist. Forty-six percent of respondents reported using various other personnel to perform the training. The majority of respondents spend 25% of their time examining low vision patients. Eighteen percent of all respondents were low vision residency trained. CONCLUSIONS: Descriptions of current practice patterns are difficult to ascertain without consensus on terminology and management criteria among low vision practitioners. This survey and accompanying literature review support the need for clinical research and education that will establish an efficacious and cost-effective model for private outpatient low vision rehabilitation for individuals with various levels of vision impairment to determine the true availability of low vision rehabilitation care in the United States.

Satisfaction/dissatisfaction as a construct has been subject to a wide range of measurement alternatives and applied in many different industry sectors. This paper examines customer satisfaction and its role in the credit union sector of the financial services industry. The study uses an Order Probit model of Reveals Customer Satisfaction and finds empirical support indicating that a higher probability of achieving excellent overall customer satisfaction ratings is directly affected by high satisfaction in courtesy, privacy and waiting indicators. These results are particularly relevant for strategic management design of credit union product/service strategy.

Corporate Assessment of Strategic Issues in Technology Management	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Technology Management; Interdisciplinary Teams; Employer Survey; Job Expectations; Leadership		Through a discussion of both current literature and the results of a new study described here, this article contributes to an understanding of the gap that exists between what employers in technology based industries expect of new hires and the skill sets those new hires actually possess. As the pace of technological change increases, current managers and new graduates must be comfortable with managing and interacting with new technologies and the people charged with their implementation. In the case of new graduates, current literature reveals that employers are particularly dissatisfied with their ability to Communicate technical topics, which is vitally important for effective business operations. A study focused on recent hires, managers, and executives familiar with Bucknell University's Institute for Leadership in Technology and Management (ILTM, 2003) corroborated these findings as well as identifying other areas of concern. A manager in a technology-based industry can use this article both to develop strategies for coping with existing problems and to identify ways that corporations can actively become involved in the education process to help close the gap between expectations and reality.

Relevant insights are generated through an integrated and dynamic analysis of interviews and secondary data from a sample of local organizations, based on a conceptual model of strategic transformation. The analysis concludes with propositions about how both adoption of and resistance to project management implementation in the region could be understood from a strategic point of view, taking into account complex and dissonant circumstances of transition, history, cultural tradition, embedded social values, and identities of individual organizational members.

J	Fong, J; Shiu, H; Wong, J				Fong, Joseph; Shiu, Herbert; Wong, Jenny			METHODOLOGY FOR DATA CONVERSION FROM XML DOCUMENTS TO RELATIONS USING EXTENSIBLE STYLESHEET LANGUAGE TRANSFORMATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data conversion; XML document; Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation; relations		Extensible Markup Language (XML) has been used for data-transport and data-transformation while the business sector continues to store critical business data in relational databases. Extracting relational data and formatting it into XML documents, and then converting XML documents back to relational structures, becomes a major daily activity. It is important to have an efficient methodology to handle this conversion between XML documents and relational data. This paper aims to perform data conversion from XML documents into relational databases. It proposes a prototype and algorithms for this conversion process. The pre-process is schema translation using an XML schema definition. The proposed approach is based on the needs of an Order Information System to suggest a methodology to gain the benefits provided by XML technology and relational database management systems. The methodology is a stepwise procedure using XML schema definition and Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) to ensure that the data constraints are not scarified after data conversion. The implementation of the data conversion is performed by decomposing the XML document of a hierarchical tree model into normalized relations interrelated with their artifact primary keys and foreign keys. The transformation process is performed by XSLT. This paper will also demonstrate the entire conversion process through a detailed case study.

Worm infections in high and low bodyweight Merino ewes during winter and spring	AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						bodyweight; ewes; gastrointestinal parasites; Merino; trichostrongylids; worm count	ANTHELMINTIC TREATMENT; TRICHOSTRONGYLID INFECTIONS; HELMINTH INFECTION; RAINFALL REGION; GRAZING SHEEP; CONTAMINATION; PASTURE; LAMBS; AVAILABILITY; POPULATIONS	To compare infections of gastrointestinal nematodes in 2-year-old ('maiden') spring-lambing Merino ewes in the upper and lower 25% of body weights (BW) at joining. An observational study over two consecutive years on two farms in western Victoria. On each farm, ewes were weighed at the end of mating. Ewes within the upper and lower quartile of BW formed two groups that grazed together for the remainder of the year. On each farm, 20 ewes from each group were also treated with controlled release capsules containing ivermectin to minimise the effects of parasitism. Measures of worm infections were worm egg counts, total worm counts and assessment of breech soiling ('dag score'). Measures of production were BW, numbers of deaths, pregnant ewes and weaned lambs in each group, and response to treatment with a capsule. No consistent difference was found in mean worm egg counts between ewes in the high and low BW groups and total worm counts of ewes before lambing were not significantly different in either year. Breech soiling of low BW ewes was consistently higher on both farms in both years. Those ewes also reared 7% to 14% fewer lambs. The difference in BW between the low and high groups remained highly significant on both farms throughout both years. A strategic approach to worm control is appropriate for ewes in both high and low BW categories. Management options for low BW ewes include culling, supplementary feeding to increase BW before mating, or delaying mating for 12 months. Aust Vet J 2009;87:102-109.	[Larsen, J. W.

How have governments in Africa, if at all, incorporated knowledge management in governance and how inclusive has this process been? This paper will attempt to answer these key questions by examining the experiences and lessons learned in efforts to build knowledge management capacity across Africa. In doing so, the paper will provide a summary of the key presentations of the latest two-day conference. Knowledge Management as an Enabler of Change and Innovation in Africa (Cairo, 2007). Central to discussions was the need to create an enabling environment encouraging the adoption of knowledge management practices in Africa and the utilisation of indigenous knowledge assets as an important input in poverty alleviation strategies. More importantly, the paper outlines the challenges that can be observed and what opportunities for building the Africa Knowledge System are available. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of strategic and policy implications of these finding for achieving sustainable development in Africa.

MARKET LIQUIDITY AND STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION: APPLICATIONS TO GCC STOCK EXCHANGES	MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Basel II; emerging markets; financial engineering; financial risk management; GCC financial markets; portfolio management; risk budgeting; liquidity-adjusted value at risk		This paper aims at investigating issues of asset allocation and equity trading risk in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stock markets. The intent of this work is to bridge the gap in current asset market liquidity risk management methodologies and to assist GCC financial institutions in developing proactive asset market liquidity risk management techniques to assess potential market risks in light of the upshots of the current financial crisis. Using daily data of main market indicators for the period 2004-2009 and the Liquidity-Adjusted Value at Risk (L-VaR) model, the author finds that the distribution of the equity returns in the GCC stock markets is far from being normal and thus justifies using the L-VaR model, combined with other methods such as stress-testing, to incorporate the other remaining risks. Furthermore, the author shows that although there is a clear departure from normality, the asset market liquidity risk can be estimated without the need of complex mathematical and analytical procedures. To this end, several financial modeling strategies are achieved with the objective of creating a realistic framework of equity trading risk measurement in addition to the instigation of a practical iterative optimization technique for the calculation of maximum authorized L-VaR limits, subject to meaningful real-word operational constraints. Our modeling technique and empirical analysis have important implications for the GCC financial markets and can aid local financial institutions in developing advanced internal risk models and in complying with the requirements of the Basel II committee on capital adequacy.

J	Bhaskaran, S; Gligorovska, E				Bhaskaran, Suku; Gligorovska, Emilija			Developing and sustaining joint enterprises in a transitional economy	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Joint ventures; Small-to-medium-sized enterprises; Demand; Productive capacity; Macedonia	DEMAND CHAIN MANAGEMENT; SUPPLY CHAIN; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; MARKET ORIENTATION; ISSUES; FOOD; COLLABORATION; ORGANIZATION; TRUST; SMES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss the role of the project champion and the project champion's experience in a business capacity building project in, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The project champion mentored and fostered joint enterprises between and across actors engaged in the production, processing, distribution, retailing and exporting of lamb meat and cheese derived from sheep milk. The article aims to analyse and compare the experiences and knowledge from this project with that of knowledge in extant studies on demand chain integration and inter-firm alliances. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was crafted from information accessed from the project champion, key informants and information about the project presented in the web sites of the United States Agency for International Development and the project champion, The experiences presented in the case study were critically examined and evaluated with the findings in extant studies on inter-firm alliances. Findings - Demand chain strategy based on customer orientation and seamless integration of all actors in the value chain through a joint enterprise fosters relationship bonding, structural cohesion and transaction efficiencies. The role of a third party project champion in facilitating and mentoring the value chain actors contributed to the success of the joint-enterprise. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on a single case study, the unique characteristics of the study context limits the scope of generalising the findings. Practical implications - Knowledge from this study is transferable to other industry sectors and can also be adapted in other environments in which individual small-to-medium-scale enterprises experience competency and capacity constraints in developing their business. Originality/value - Adopts a whole-of-chain capacity building approach. The dynamics of the study context (small-to-medium scale enterprises in all segments of the chain, niche high value products, transitional economy which recently adopted a free enterprise business model) are unique and this influenced project initiatives and outcomes. The study provides valuable insights into developing small-to-medium-scale food enterprise capacity building projects.

J	Clark, E; Soulsby, A				Clark, Ed; Soulsby, Anna			Perceptions of MNC management: Local parent sensemaking in international joint venture process	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Czech Republic; international joint ventures; sensemaking; venture dynamics; process theory; multi-national corporation	BARGAINING POWER; STRATEGIC DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; TRUST; TRANSFORMATION; ENTERPRISES; INSTABILITY; INTEGRATION; ALLIANCES; EVOLUTION	The article focuses on the way in which multinational corporations (MNCs) and local parent firms interact it? the construction and operation of international joint ventures (IJVs). It seeks to contribute to the theory of IJV process in two ways. First, it constructs a preliminary integrative theoretical framework, which draws attention to the roles of initial venture conditions, of political, learning and relationship processes and parental perceptions of efficiency and equity. Second, it infers theoretical lessons from a case study of a German-Czech IJV. The empirical findings highlight the role of critical events that stimulate sensemaking processes, which in turn politicise the IJV and create different dynamic patterns.

Organizational alignment and hospitality firm performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategic alignment; Hospitality services; Profit	SERVICE-PROFIT CHAIN; MISSION; MODEL	Purpose - Hospitality organizations, whether large or small, are complex entities requiring managers to work through frontline employees to manage every guest's moment of truth and meet their firms' goals and objectives. This study aims to test propositions that firms whose staffing policies and systems are aligned with their strategic goals and objectives to outperform those firms with poorer organizational alignment. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through a survey administered in winter of 2005 to 200 hourly wage employees from each of four matched hotels. Some 479 completed surveys were returned yielding a 59 percent response rate. Findings - Between-group differences in organizational alignment measures were statistically significant in the directions predicted. Specifically, subjects from the high organizational alignment hotels, on average, reported significantly higher organizational support, employee service commitment and employee satisfaction as compared to low organizational alignment properties. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study provide a strong indication that the workplace environment is a concept that employees are aware of which in turn influences their commitment and satisfaction. Practical implications - This research provides managers with an assessment tool useful for ensuring that a firm is being effectively managed.

J	Czakon, W				Czakon, Wojciech			The building blocks of a relational capability - evidence from the banking industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING			English	Article						relational capability; entrepreneurship; network governance; franchising; banking		Cooperation is an increasingly important strategic option for both large and entrepreneurial firms. Firms need to assess the potential for successful cooperation. Among other factors the relational capability of partners needs to be identified. Prior research provides little insights into what makes a firm relationally capable or how to build this capability. The bank's franchising network case study provides evidence that a set of dedicated resources, governance mechanisms and knowledge management together make a relational capability. It has been source of above average earnings. The durability of cooperation requires relationships adjustments, which brings in flexibility and the underlying knowledge articulation and sharing.

J	Diaz-Fernandez, M; Lopez-Cabrales, A; Valle-Cabrera, R				Diaz-Fernandez, Mirta; Lopez-Cabrales, Alvaro; Valle-Cabrera, Ramon			What companies pay for: the strategic role of employee competencies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						firm strategy; performance-based pay; personal competencies; skill-based pay	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; MANAGERIAL COMPENSATION; PERFORMANCE; MODELS; MILES	Individual competencies are defined as the set of knowledge, skills and abilities that the employees possess and apply in their jobs. The purpose of this paper is to analyse to what extent different strategies require a diverse set of individual competencies and which compensation systems may incentive employees to acquire the desirable competencies for each strategic option. We carried out ail analysis in a sample of manufacturing firms using structural equations models. Our findings suggested that prospectors make more emphasis than defenders on competencies as innovation, technical expertise, adaptability, customer orientation and results orientation and also that skill-based pay and performance-based pay are associated with different competencies. Therefore, the compensation systems strengthen the strategic option of a company by fostering the necessary competencies for its development.

J	Dufour, Y; Lamothe, L				Dufour, Yvon; Lamothe, Lise			Revisiting a classic case study Anita Roddick and the Body Shop International	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Configuration management; Entrepreneurialism; Organizational culture	STRATEGIC GROUPS; TOP MANAGEMENT; CONFIGURATIONS; PERFORMANCE	Purpose - On 10 September 2007 the world was stunned by the news that Anita Roddick - the founder of The Body Shop - was dead at the age of 64. Everyone recognizes the success of The Body Shop, but it is not easily explained using traditional strategic thinking. This paper aims to shed new light on Anita Roddick's entrepreneurial and managerial flair, as well as on her legacy to the field of management. Design/methodology/approach - Configuration as a quality is an intriguing and intuitively appealing new idea. The main innovation is the premise that organizational elements form common gestalts such that each can be best understood in relation to the other elements in the configuration. This paper probed the conceptual notion of configuration as a quality in an empirical sense by revisiting one of the classic Harvard Business School (HBS) case studies: The Body Shop International. Findings - The paper shows The Body Shop as a good example of a comprehensive configuration that allows immediate intuitive apprehension of the new idea of configuration as a quality. Research limitations/implications - The main issue is the limited depth of analysis that has been achieved through the single HBS case as the main source of evidence. As such, although the propositions put forward seem highly plausible, the supplementary explanation still remains incomplete, opening opportunities for further research. Originality/value - Re-visiting classic case studies such as the HBS Body Shop International can stimulate the debate and fuel the process of theory building through the amalgamation of diversified old and new perspectives of the same phenomenon.

J	French, S				French, Steven			Exploring the house built on sand!	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Critical management; Epistemology; Self-adjusting control systems	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; FIRM; SCHOOL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the strategy literature in order to identify scholars who have developed specific models of strategy. Design/methodology/approach - An extensive review of the literature was undertaken. Findings - The paper reveals Modernist ideas of several scholars who have developed methods or concepts for delineating the ideas of strategy. A body of economic theory is mentioned but is beyond the scope of this paper. Practical implications - The paper suggests that a move away from the eighteenth century economic concepts must happen, especially the equilibrium assumption, if the strategy discipline is to be developed. Originality/value - Very little work, especially in strategy has been done outside the Modernist paradigm. This paper explores the possibility of incorporating open system ideas into a strategic methodology.

J	French, S				French, Steven			The inductive frame	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Management research; Action research; Research methods		Purpose - This paper seeks to develop a coherent model for small business principals to understand their management behaviour, with the intent to move their focus from an operational to a strategic perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Action research (AR) was undertaken to develop the model. Findings - AR is utilised to develop a model that explains in conceptual terms how a business can be deconstructed such that the structure of any business can be explained. By deconstructing the business, small business principals are able to understand the nature of their managerial behaviour. This behaviour is almost entirely operational. They must also understand the nature of strategy and how they can think about their firms from a strategic perspective. Practical implications - Small business principals are provided with the opportunity to recognise their reliance on operational solutions to their business problems and opportunities, and accept the proposition that they must also think strategically. Originality/value - The paper discusses the AR development of a unique tool to support the needs of small business principals move from an operational to the strategic level of their business.

J	Hai, HL; Tsou, MC				Hai, Hui-Lin; Tsou, Ming-Cheng			Strategic development for the Department of Information Management of Shih Chien University Kaohsiung campus in Taiwan by a quantifiable SWOT analysis	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Vote-ranking method; SWOT; Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)		SWOT analysis is an established strategic planning methodology to identify the organizations' strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats before proceeding to the formulation of corporate strategy. The quantifiable SWOT method adopts the concept of Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), which uses a multi-hierarchy scheme to simplify complicated problems. The indices of SWOT will be voted and weighted to assess the competitive strategy meanwhile the total weighted scores method will be used to achieve the best strategy alternatives. The competitive strategies of Shih Chien University Kaohsiung Campus in Taiwan are taken as a case study in this particular paper. We propose a new quantifiable SWOT analytic method incorporated with the vote-ranking method, which uses the two stages six steps to assess the competitive strategies and followed by suggestion on an adoptable policy.

J	Hooks, J; Palakshappa, N				Hooks, Jill; Palakshappa, Nitha			Co-operation and collaboration: the case of the de-regulated New Zealand electricity industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive strategy; Electricity industry; New Zealand; Channel relationships; Strategic planning		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to use the New Zealand electricity industry as a case study to describe and understand the importance of collaborative relationships in coping with the changes faced by sectors of the industry over the last two decades. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-method qualitative approach is used to investigate the nature of industry relationships. Data were collected through two-phase in-depth interviews with key electricity employees. Secondary documents and archival records were used to support participant contributions. Findings - The research finds that the majority of the collaborative relationships in the New Zealand electricity industry are "forced". Nevertheless, and despite the preclusions of competition, relationships continue to support the strategic imperatives of firms and form an important component of firm-level operation. Originality/value - The study provides an understanding of collaboration within a new contextual setting-the New Zealand electricity industry. To the best of one's knowledge, no other study has attempted to assess the importance of collaboration on these industry players. The qualitative analysis undertaken made it possible to discover insights that would not have emerged from more commonly used quantitative methodologies.

J	Jantunen, A; Sandstrom, J; Kuittinen, H				Jantunen, Ari; Sandstrom, Jaana; Kuittinen, Hanna			Boundary choices in the pulp and paper industry	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Outsourcing; Transaction costs; Transactional analysis; Paper industry		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the boundary choices of firms operating in the pulp and paper industry. Design/methodology/approach - Explorative interviews were conducted with senior managers of pulp and paper companies, and comparative data on other industries were collected. The theoretical approach was based on extended transaction-cost economics (TCE). Findings - The results demonstrate that when company decision makers consider the governance choice for different activities, i.e. make or buy, the determinants implied in traditional TCE are not the only relevant factors. Transaction or management benefits are also important, and managers also take into account the long-term effects of boundary choices. The determinants of governance choices depend on the nature and strategic importance of the activity in question: when it is a question of outsourcing marginal activities, for example, management costs and dynamic transaction benefits seem to be of most significance. On the other hand, transaction costs and dynamic management benefits have a major role in the definition of boundary choices related to core activities. Research limitations/implications - This research paper is explorative. Further quantitative research would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - This paper demonstrates that the factors managers implicitly take into account when considering firm boundaries could be explicitly assessed through the application of extended transaction-cost logic. This would help to make the decision making more structured and would highlight the relevant factors affecting these boundaries. Originality/value - Traditional transaction- cost theory has been criticised for neglecting value-creation issues that may also be essential in terms of explaining the firm's boundary choices. This study brings not only transaction costs but also the benefits and dynamic aspects of these choices under scrutiny.

J	Kumar, S; Honkanen, EJ; Karl, CC				Kumar, Sameer; Honkanen, Erik J.; Karl, Chad C.			Developing a Global Health Diplomacy Supply ChainA Viable Option for the United States to Curb Extremism	JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS; FOREIGN-POLICY; PEACE	This study examines the idea of developing a global health diplomacy supply chain as an important foreign policy approach with the aim of improving the lives of vulnerable populations and serving the best interests of the United States. The study was based on the review of academic literature, news events, and military communiques, and historical writings were studied to determine the feasibility of the idea and the extent of costs and benefits of such an endeavor. An integrated strategic business model, supported by a medical care delivery process, was developed to create a framework for a feasible global health diplomacy supply chain. The findings indicate that extremism can be contained by creating and efficiently executing an effective supply chain to get medical care units to those that need them. The limitations are the potential exit strategies required, the tactical abilities, and diplomatic techniques needed in order to create positive diplomatic change in aid distribution. Managers must consider how supply chains will affect other organizations giving aid and the potential public response. Moreover, determining the level of care necessary to achieve the greatest positive health diplomacy continues to require vigilant scrutiny over the potential cost/benefit analysis. The analysis is valuable to policymakers considering the impacts of health diplomacy by utilizing supply chain management.

J	Margherita, A; Secundo, G				Margherita, Alessandro; Secundo, Giustina			Density, diversity, openness and speed: is management development aligned?	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Competences; Curriculum development; Management development		Purpose - This paper aims to present a framework supporting a new approach to designing curricula for the development of management competencies. Design/methodology/approach - The review of contributions in the strategic management and management development fields allows extrapolation of the relevant paradigm changes in the economic and business scenario and provides the background for investigating the emerging challenges in competence development processes. Findings - The increasing speed, openness, density and diversity of business raise new challenges related to five fundamental dimensions of management as a system: its actors, concept, context, processes and purpose. This requires developing in managers a set of competencies that specifically address those aspects and holistically cover an integrated perspective rather than focusing on separated management functions, processes or skills. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed in the effort of taxonomising paradigm changes and defining the management dimensions which are impacted. Practical implications - The analysis presented brings a different logic to structuring curricula. This could potentially have an impact on the design and implementation of learning initiatives in both higher education and corporate contexts. A framework useful for practitioners is provided. Originality/value - The value of the paper is in creating a direct conceptual link among the changing features of the economic and business landscape and the deriving requirements in terms of developing management competencies. A framework useful for practitioners is provided.

J	Noel, NM				Noel, Noel Mark			Benchmarking consumer perceptions of retail constructs for apparel merchandisers using magnitude estimation	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Benchmarking; Consumer behaviour; Shopping; Utilitarianism		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to establish a measurement process for consumer perceptions and judgments of strategic importance to apparel retailers like hedonic and utilitarian shopping behavior, as well as internal process benchmarks such as apparel brands' names, store signage, and textile preferences. The paper aims to provide a simple, flexible and easy to use measurement technique that can be applied to small samples of respondents in order to capture their overall perceptions and judgments of key interest to management. Design/methodology/approach - Magnitude estimation, along with a repeated measures design, was tested and evaluated based on the validation process put forth by Steven's power law. Data were collected from three focus groups whose respondents were selected based on their store loyalty and prior purchase of women's petit apparel in a discount outlet store. Their responses were benchmarked with those of other competitive discount retailers and with selected internal process measures. Findings - All applications of the measurement technique were validated. Loyal shoppers for apparel purchased in a value store were found to have a preference to a competitive set of value stores but perceived all other discount stores as higher in store shopping experience. Findings were presented to articulate the resolution and clarity of the magnitude-determined ratio scales versus those of typical interval scales and multi-attribute measures. Research limitations/implications - The comparisons provided here are for illustrative purposes only and are based on a selected group of one company's loyal customers during a defined shopping season. Originality/value - Consumer perceptions of key interest to retail management are shown to be measured and benchmarked in a practical setting using this technique.

B.; Ho, Chien-Ta Bruce; Wu, Desheng Dash			Natural disaster and financial risk management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						natural disaster; financial risk management; Wenchuan earthquake; China		This paper explores and discusses the financial issues faced by firms in a natural disaster. It introduces the disaster risk environment and the factors that affect the operations of a firm. The implications of a natural disaster in terms of unsystematic and systematic risks, investment evaluation, strategic investment, and risk and compliance are addressed. It provides a framework to analyse the disaster risk exposure of a firm and how it might be used in risk management. The discussions in this paper are relevant to the Wenchuan earthquake in China in May 2008.	[Oh, K.

J	Reuter, C; Pipek, V; Muller, C				Reuter, Christian; Pipek, Volkmar; Mueller, Claudia			Avoiding crisis in communication: a computer-supported training approach for emergency management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						crisis training; crisis communication; crisis management; crisis management systems; computer-supported collaborative learning; CSCL; computer-supported cooperative work; CSCW; emergency management; electricity provider		Crisis management requires stakeholders not only to show strategic, organisational preparedness for crisis events (e.g., by systematising and professionalising coping with work), but also to develop skills in dealing with unanticipated events and other stakeholders involved in the same crisis. They should not only rely on established information flows and behaviour patterns, but also be able to deal with situational aspects. This usually involves communication work within and between organisations involved in crisis management. We describe the practice of the crisis communication training of a German Electricity Provider (GEP) and the prototype we developed, implemented and evaluated. The collaborative training tool targets not only the local practice, but also interorganisational training that will allow improving the mutual understanding of communication practices and meeting the information needs of other stakeholders.

ELEPHANT ON A TREADMILL: AN EVALUATION OF THEMATIC NARROWNESS IN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE RESEARCH	RESEARCH IN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT, VOL 17	Research in Organizational Change and Development		English	Article; Book Chapter							STRATEGIC CHANGE; INERTIA; SCIENCE; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; DETERMINANTS; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; TRANSFORMATION; EQUILIBRIUM	This chapter assesses the accuracy of the assumption that organizational change research is too thematically narrow. The proposition is explored by assessing the nature of articles on change, published since 1947, in eight representative management and organization journals (n = 454). Results indicate that more research on change is being published but has not lead to significantly more developed knowledge, as it increasingly relies on refinement rather than idea overthrow, and is largely made up of themes that received most of their critical attention up to a decade ago. The critique concludes by highlighting further development and career challenges for change researchers.

J	Schwarz, M				Schwarz, Mirela			Strategy workshops facilitating and constraining strategy making	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Strategic planning	MIDDLE MANAGERS; VIEW	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new framework for exploring the key elements of strategy workshops and provide empirical evidence on how these can influence strategy making within a firm. Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on structuration theory and the "practice" view of strategy. The empirical data are based on a longitudinal case study, including ethnographic data, extensive observations and interviews. Findings - The findings show that strategy workshops are institutionalized as part of a firm's strategy-making process, and provide a forum for strategic discourse facilitated through knowledge-sharing and/or promotion of strategic consensus. Strategy workshops may, however, also constrain strategy making through opposition and rejection of participation which may lead to strategic paralysis. Practical implications - This research propose guidelines for managers on the effective preparation and management of strategy workshops. Originality/value - The paper provides a new framework to explore key elements of strategy workshops and evidence of how these influence strategy making. The research highlights the dualistic nature of strategy workshops in strategy making.

J	Stendahl, M				Stendahl, Matti			Management of product development projects in the wood industry	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH			English	Article						Innovation; interaction model; multiple regression analysis; sawmilling	MARKET ORIENTATION; INNOVATION PERFORMANCE; SERVICE DEVELOPMENT; SUCCESS FACTORS; DETERMINANTS; CAPABILITIES; CUSTOMERS; MODELS; IMPACT; FIT	This study used data on project management from 70 recent product development projects in the wood industry. The objective was to test the influence of some project management factors, known from cross-industry research to be keys to product development project success, on product development project success in the context of the wood industry. Through the use of hierarchical multiple regression analysis, it was found that both the sharpness of the product concept definition and the strength of the project leader had significant positive influences on the success of product development projects. Conversely, product advantage, team cross-functionality and customer involvement did not have a significant positive influence on the success of these projects. The latter even indicated a negative influence on product development project success. Project uncertainty, as manifested in the degree of newness of the technology and the marketing strategies of the product to the innovating strategic business unit, did not influence the relationship between project management factors and product development project success. Some of die findings were unexpected and may be explained by the industry's unaccustomedness to customer co-operation and the fact that product development in the wood industry takes place within conventional technology and market bounds.

J	Drew, G				Drew, Glenlys			An Artful Learning Framework for organisations	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						reflection; engagement; organisations; artful learning; management; change		This paper proposes an Artful Learning Framework as an organisational development initiative. The framework is designed to assist people in organisations seeking higher levels of engagement in their strategic and operational endeavours, such as navigating change. The Artful Learning Framework offers three strategies as potential artful learning events designed to help people in organisations engage with each other creatively to achieve their organisational and professional goals. The Artful Learning Wave Trajectory model (Kerr 2006) forms a conceptual antecedent for the Artful Learning Framework. The Framework strategies align with the relevant literature on organisational learning and, in particular, a proposition of Kerr (2006) who identifies a suite of skills, capacities and capabilities that are important in organisations. The notion of the wave, with the effect of causing and gathering' to consider amidst the inevitable ambiguity and turbulence of forward movement, is invoked as a metaphor for the elements of the Framework which support its strategies. The paper will be of interest to individuals and groups that are committed to profound learning and capability building for the benefit of themselves, their teams and the organisations in which they word.

The combination of complex processes, competing IT systems, and multiple dashboards often fails to provide the insight needed to bring change, so the metrics become irrelevant. Using a back-to-basics approach and employing two well-known processes-activity analysis and bal-anced scorecards-overcomes this irrelevance. Employing a simple, straightforward, and linked approach provides the information necessary to measure and improve performance from both an operational and strategic perspective. This article provides an overview of the linked concept and two case studies of implementations.

J	Saiani, L; Viviani, D; Lenzi, E; Chissale, A; Palese, A				Saiani, Luisa; Viviani, Debora; Lenzi, Elena; Chissale, Anna; Palese, Alvisa			Italian nurses' perception of the avoidability of problems affecting older people with multiple chronic diseases	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						avoidable; clinical judgment; patients' Problems; phenomenology; unavoidable	ELDERLY-PEOPLE; HOME VISITS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CARE; PHENOMENOLOGY; RESEARCHERS; COMMUNITY; QUALITY	Aims. The aim of this study was to discover whether problems experienced by older People With multiple chronic diseases,were considered to be avoidable from the perspective Of nurses. Background. The concept of avoidability is defined as 'that which can be avoided'; when something is perceived as avoidable, action is taken 'to prevent the occurrence'. It is possible that the nurses' perception on the avoidability of problems in chronically-ill older People, could have a role in the decisions they make about the most suitable type of care (e.g. therapeutic, preventive) while if they perceive a problem to be unavoidable they adopt palliative interventions. No literature is available on the factors that nurses take into account when judging whether a patient's problem could be avoided or not, and no nursing diagnosis title includes the concept of an 'unavoidable' problem (e.g. Unavoidable depression related to nursing home institutionalisation). Design. A phenomenological method Was used to identify and understand the meaning of a human being's experience by means of direct reporting and interviews. Method. Participants were forty 40 nurses working in homecare services and nursing homes in Northern Italy. Findings. Various factors were assumed to make certain problems inescapable, Such as the interaction of multiple diseases, older people refusing care and inadequate surveillance. Other problems were fudged to be completely or partially avoidable is aspects relating to families' reactions (the burden of providing care, family members' inability to provide adequate care), and to healthcare management dysfunctions (poor exchange of information, limited resources). Conclusion. The nurses perceived they could only marginally modify the older person's problems however, they could take action instead to improve the organisational processes, the involvement of family members, and their own skills and Sense Of purpose. Relevance to clinical practice. To reflect Oil Unavoidable nursing problems and related factors is important for the potential consequences Of Clinical judgment on patients and Oil nursing care and for ethical implications.

Strategic factors and a model of enterprise restructuring in the coal industry in Europe with emphasis on experiences in a Slovenia-Valenje coal mine case	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						restructuring; coalmining; Velenje Coal Mine; strategic factors; restructuring model		The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the main strategic restructuring aspects of companies that are directly (coalmines) or indirectly (companies that depend on coalmines) linked to coalmining. An attempt-is also made-to determine the principal factors required for the successful execution of a restructuring process in companies focused on the basic activities of coalmining, such as companies that provide supporting activities. The restructuring process exerts an influence on the whole area that relies on coalmining. So coordination of activities among the government, the local community, and the coalmine is very important. This is the major premise of this paper. The first section of the paper focuses on identifying and analysing the key factors in restructuring and a selection of key methods, drawing on past and present practice. The key factors to be considered in a model of enterprise restructuring in the coalmining sector are considered. The second section is dedicated to the actual design of the model of enterprise restructuring in the coal industry. The proposed model is based on positive-experiences in the restructuring of coalmining companies in Europe, with an emphasis on Slovenia, successful approaches to crisis management in corporations, and identifying key areas in bringing about a strategic turnarounds in company operation. To support the argument for the key business areas, a brief summary of empiric findings has been included to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and the restructuring process. The summary is based on the survey done in both Slovenian coalmining companies (especially in Velenje Coal Mine) and their subsidiaries. The conclusion integrates key findings and outlines issues for further consideration and discussion.

The paper explores how the public sector in Croatia has managed to come this far after the turbulent years of political and technocratic dislocation. Croatia is determined to reform its public sector to become eligible for joining the European Union (EU) in near future. This has posed a major challenge for top senior officials and consultants alike. Adopting 'action research' as both a methodology and a strategy, a programme of intervention for change was designed and implemented in the Ministry of Finance. The overall results suggest that for the successful implementation of public sector reforms in the 21st century, attention should focus on strategic issues including systems thinking, HRMD, behavioural and attitudinal change, skills and competencies development and, above all, honest and responsible transformational leadership.

Knowledge Sharing Tools and Technology: An Overview	DESIDOC JOURNAL OF LIBRARY & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Knowledge sharing tools; knowledge management; knowledge sharing; knowledge sharing culture; knowledge creation; knowledge dissemination		The study of knowledge sharing-the means by which an individual/organisation obtains access to any individual's own and other knowledge-has emerged as a key research area from a broad and deep field of study on technology transfer and innovation, and more recently from the field of strategic management. Increasingly, knowledge-sharing research has moved to an organisational learning perspective. Indeed, experience and research suggests that successful knowledge sharing involves extended learning processes rather than simple communication processes, as ideas related to development and innovation need. This paper provides basic concepts of knowledge sharing and its means of implementation.	[Babu, B.

J	Gottschalk, P				Gottschalk, Petter			Organizational structure as predictor of intelligence strategy implementation in policing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW CRIME AND JUSTICE			English	Article						National intelligence model; Strategic planning; Collaboration; Information systems; Communication		Barriers to strategy implementation are often found in the organizational structure in law enforcement. Strategy implementation is important because failure to carry out strategy can cause lost opportunities and leave police officers reluctant to do strategic planning. Lack of implementation creates problems in maintaining priorities and reaching organizational goals. Yet, strategy implementation suffers from a general lack of academic attention. This research paper makes a contribution to police strategy implementation literature by developing a research model to study the extent of intelligence strategy implementation caused by organizational structure in policing.

A description of these approaches is followed by a direct comparison of the two methodologies. The comparison shows that projects using the Faster, Better, Cheaper method do not deviate greatly from traditional systems engineering principles, but instead constitute a focusing of missions toward a new set of strategic goals for NASA.

Marc			A multiple criteria sequential sorting procedure	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; MODELS; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	A novel procedure having strategic flexibility is designed to handle multiple criteria sorting problems such that a decision maker (DM) can adjust the group count and fine-tune group numbers to improve sorting efficiency. Its unique features include interactive control, so that the DM can adjust the number of groups and other sorting characteristics; the capacity to aggregate cardinal and ordinal criteria using concepts from data envelopment analysis; and the integration of approximate information about criterion weights, which may help to ensure that the sorting results more closely reflect the DM's intrinsic preferences. A case study in inventory classification is carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

Most Swedish brands build in socially responsible conduct, the legacy of a political tradition that legislated these very practices. Today, Swedish organisations have returned to an emphasis on the value proposition, since sustainability is an expected brand attribute. The authors propose that Scandinavia is the ideal place to devise metrics that quantifies the real benefits of sustainable practice.

The paper is based on the analysis of a body of research that has cumulated over the last 5-6 years. These studies were focused on the status of information management operations in Kuwaiti corporate companies, manpower and organizational issues related to information technology ( IT) and information professionals, information management activities of finance companies, and information and knowledge management education. It has been noted that this corporate market is aggressive in pursuing strategic initiatives in employing latest technologies and management approaches. These organizations also appear to be in need of qualified human resources, equipped with befitting competencies, who can assume key managerial and professional roles for information and knowledge positions. There is also a need for creating meaningful partnerships between industry and trade and the higher education institutions, which might be instrumental in designing suitable programmes of education and training in information and knowledge management. Based on these findings, this paper analyses the needs of the corporate job market of Kuwaiti corporate sector for the areas of information and knowledge management. Strategies for developing appropriate competencies have also been outlined.

J	Heil, D				Heil, Dominik			Strategic innovation and organisations identity A hermeneutic phenomenological investigation	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper makes the case for an appropriate ontological inquiry into strategy and organisational issues in general and issues of organisational reputation, identity and innovation in particular. It does so by first responding to Powell's suggestion that strategy, and by implication all scholarly work on organisations, should do without ontology. While taking his concerns about ontology seriously, his approach is exposed as ontological itself and it is suggested that Heidegger's hermeneutic phenomenology is an appropriate path for an ontological inquiry with regards to strategic and organisational issues. In using this type of ontological inquiry, the paper develops an avenue to propose such an ontological understanding, and then suggests a means of comprehending the very nature of organisations. It proceeds to use this insight to develop an understanding of the concepts, reputation, organisational identity and strategic innovation in line with the hermeneutic phenomenology of Heidegger. This understanding demonstrates the intricate, profound and strategic relationship between these phenomena. Fundamental steps for assessing strategic innovation in relation to organisational identity are developed.

This paper presents an approach taken by Malaysian Nuclear Agency (Nuclear Malaysia) and authority to develop and implement safety culture for industries that uses radioactive material and radiation sources. Maintaining and improving safety culture is a continuous process. There is a need to establish a program to measure, review and audit health and safety performance against predetermined standards. Proper safety audit will help to identify the non-compliance of safety culture as well as the deviation of management, individual and policy level commitment; review of radiation protection program and activities should be preceded.

Product placement: exploring effects of product usage by principal actors	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prominent and subtle product placements; brand awareness; recognition; recall; aided/unaided recall; related selectivity		The use of product placements has evoked interest by marketers for many years. Yet, little research has been done on this medium within the South African context; therefore the purpose of this study is to investigate consumer attitudes towards prominent product placements and the principal actor using the brand in the film or broadcast programme. Product placements are seen as a subtle means of advertising that should be used in conjunction with the traditional mass media. It has been used for many years and can be defined as the compensated inclusion of a branded product or brand identifiers, through audio and/or visual means within mass media programming (films and broadcast programmes) for promotional purposes. The survey method entailed that respondents had to observe a series of scenes from a film clip containing product placements; thereafter they were required to complete a questionnaire. Two hundred respondents, between the ages of 18 to 24 participated in this survey. Results indicated that their ability to recall prominently placed products is greater than their ability to recall subtly placed products. It further indicates that a principal actor using a brand in a film or broadcast programmes does not necessarily influence consumers' affective behaviour. It is suggested that product placements will become a strategic and viable marketing option in the mobile environment for targeting specific groups. Advertising companies seek more venues for products. From these findings it can be concluded that if marketers and advertisers consider product placements as an integrated marketing communication vehicle, they must request that their brands are placed prominently in a film and broadcast programmes to ensure maximum exposure and greater awareness among consumers. The results also provide useful insight to media planners as to whether product placement is effective when the principal actor uses it.	[Van der Waldt, D. L.

Building the IT Workforce of the Future: The Demand for More Complex, Abstract, and Strategic Knowledge	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						future of IS; IS personnel; IS skill requirements		The software development process has undergone a considerable amount of change from the early days of spaghetti code to the present state of the art of development using strategic patterns. This has caused not only changes in the toolkits that developers use, but also a change in their mindset-the way that they approach and think about software development. This study uses revealed causal mapping techniques to examine the change in mindset that occurs across the procedural to OO development transition, and lays the foundation for future studies of the OO/pattern cognitive transition. The results indicate that there is not only increasing complexity in the cognitive maps of the OO developers, but also that there is a need for the developer to shift from routine, assembly line coding to more abstract thought processes.

CORPORATE BANCASSURANCE STRUCTURES: THE CASE OF GREECE	RISK MANAGEMENT-JOURNAL OF RISK CRISIS AND DISASTER			English	Article						Greek bancassurance; financial intermediaries; insurance markets; banking industry		The risk management arena engulfs a wide breadth of issues ranging from hedging instruments to risk strategies for multinational giants, and from natural to man-made disasters across the world. When newly developed economies with non-traditional corporate structures come on stage, then the risk management science has a role to play. Close monitoring of these markets becomes essential for future planning and avoids negative externalities for the financial system as a whole. Thus, the current study aims to provide a survey of the bank-insurance ventures in the Greek market. The review unveils the significant changes and rapid growth of the Greek financial services sector. Multi national financial intermediaries have been keen in making their presence felt in the region. This is translated into mergers and acquisitions between banks and insurers, as well as strategic alliances and joint ventures. In parallel with the involvement of international corporate giants, domestic cross-business alliances and corporate partnerships are also present to strengthen the bancassurance trend. The study further proposes a three-dimensional approach for the distribution platform. The three dynamics put forward embrace product complexity, distribution infrastructure and market segmentation.

J	Simmonds, S				Simmonds, Stephanie			Institutional factors and HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						institutional development; political analysis; diseases; business approach		This paper outlines the principal institutional factors affecting the slow progress in reaching agreed targets in Africa regarding the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. It focuses on three key factors: political analysis, strategic business approach and international inputs. Most of the analyses tend to look at the technical aspects of disease prevention and control, of political analysis there is a marked absence. Yet, we know that wider contextual or macro factors such as power and political decision making can make or break a programme. Many senior managers in public sector institutions are preoccupied with day-to-day work. Successful businesses in the private sector have some things in common with each other. Outstanding leadership, a strategic and action orientated culture, highly focused on comparative strengths on priorities and quality being some of the key ones. Adopting such successful business characteristics might make the difference to public institutions. The move to results based institutions by focussing on outputs and outcomes is for the better. However, we still need to rigorously examine the quality of inputs that the increasing availability of funds is being used on. This is especially so in relation to needing a better balance between aid for health services and that for institutional and health systems development. In addition, technical advisers from development partners need to work more across a ministry of health on institutional and management change to have a greater impact on achieving targets.

Developing veterinary colleges and leaders: A whole-system approach	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						leadership development; strategic management; strategic planning; balanced scorecard		The current environment in higher education calls for increasingly progressive leadership and management. This report describes the efforts of the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at Michigan State University (MSU) to strengthen its leadership using a whole-system approach. Developing a leadership culture is the responsibility of leaders, and the pursuit of such a culture requires considerable and justifiable investment of time, energy, and resources. The volatile and changing environment in which colleges of veterinary medicine exist makes creating such a culture imperative if society's needs are to be successfully met. Noteworthy cultural change has occurred within the MSU CVM because of the efforts described here.

J	Tullett, M; Neno, R				Tullett, Michael; Neno, Rebecca			Approaches to long-term conditions management and care for older people: similarities or differences?	JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ageing; governance; long-term conditions; older people; policy		Aim In the past few years, there has been an increased emphasis both on the care for older people and the management of long-term conditions within the United Kingdom. Currently, the Department of Health and the Scottish Executive identify and manage these two areas as separate entities. The aim of this article is to examine the current approaches to both of these areas of care and identify commonalities and articulate differences. Background The population across the world and particularly within the United Kingdom is ageing at an unprecedented rate. The numbers suffering long-term illness conditions has also risen sharply in recent years. As such, nurses need to be engaged at a strategic level in the design of robust and appropriate services for this increasing population group. Evaluation A comprehensive literature review on long-term conditions and the care of older people was undertaken in an attempt to identify commonalities and differences in strategic and organizational approaches. A policy analysis was conducted to support the paper and establish links that may inform local service development. Key issues Proposing service development based on identified needs rather than organizational boundaries after the establishment of clear links between health and social care for those with long-term conditions and the ageing population. Implications for nursing management Nurse Managers need to be aware of the similarities and differences in political and theoretical approaches to the care for older people and the management of long-term conditions. By adopting this view, creativity in the service redesign and service provision can be fostered and nurtured as well as achieving a renewed focus on partnership working across organizational boundaries. Conclusions With the current renewed political focus on health and social care, there is an opportunity in the UK to redefine the structure of care. This paper proposes similarities between caring for older people and for those with long-term conditions, and it is proposed these encapsulate the wider issues that need to be debated to achieve a truly joint approach to care.

MOBILISING FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR SUSTAINABLE TOURISM INDUSTRY ON THE BALKANS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						financial resources; tourism industry; sustainable development		The purpose of the tourism industry on the Balkans for the coming years will be the free movement of people among the countries. The countries try to adopt the rules so that the natural environment is protected. The competitive advantage of the rational use for the financial resources needs to be analysed by the effective investments of the hotels. Therefore, the tourism target should be divided into conference, rural, sport and cultural heritage. The support of these projects will come from the World Bank, the EU and other international project supporters. Thus, the investment incentives for green-field investments and other management possibilities such as BOT models should be encouraged. The optimal use of tourists spending is resulted from the cost effectiveness analysis among countries. The main tourism potential developments for the success of these policies are to remove price distortions, decrease subsidies and effective tourist trafficking. The strategic plan among the Balkan countries' tourism establishments should come to use for new investments and tourist spending. The environment will favour from this outcome through benefiting climate change, biodiversity loss, ozone depletion, and the degradation of international waters. The aim of the Study is to construct a strategic plan model for each tourism investment in order to protect the environment and have the tourists use their spending potential optimally.

J	Bailey, C; Clarke, M				Bailey, Catherine; Clarke, Martin			Aligning business leadership development with business needs: the value of discrimination	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Integration; Leadership; Organizational politics; Human resource development; Management strategy		Purpose - This paper is derived from a two-year study that sought to provide a critical understanding of the current state of business leadership development (BLD) and to identify directions for innovative future practice. The first of two companion papers, this contribution aims to examine the issue of achieving business relevance in BLD and the quality of HR/management development strategy formulation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses four organisation case studies of BLD strategy derived from interview data sourced from 103 senior line/HRD managers in 20 organisations. Findings - The findings highlight the need for HRD managers to take a discriminating approach to linking BLD strategy, development method, evaluation and the role of management development. In particular, the cases studied reflect the importance of informal activity and politics in the execution of BLD and the positive effect of individual leadership in moderating the effectiveness of the linkages between business context, BLD strategy and its implementation. Practical implications - The paper provides a conceptual framework to enable practitioners to discriminate between different bundles of development practices that can, over time, be translated into behaviours that suit the changing needs of an organisation. A list of useful starting points is provided for managers to review and improve BLD strategy and practice in their own organisation. Originality/value - The paper provides a framework that shows the importance of different development populations, different sponsors, interest groups and strategic timeframes in enabling more informed discussion about the strategic alignment of BLD.

State DOT Performance Programs: From Program Development to Strategic Planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						performance measurement; performance management; strategic planning; state DOT performance programs; transportation		This article presents evidence from selected state transportation departments across the United States that indicates that although many states have established performance measures programs, very few have acted to integrate across the board results into transportation decision-making processes. Transportation-related performance programs across the nation have reached a critical juncture between performance program creation and integration of results into decision-making processes. Only time will tell if the fundamental strength of performance programs, that of enhancing strategic planning, will be unleashed, thereby strengthening the management of transportation programs and the relationship with decision-makers and the public that government transportation providers desperately need.

J	Machado, VC; Tavares, J				Cruz Machado, V.; Tavares, Jose			Value streams based strategy: modeling for lean management performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						value stream management; lean manufacturing; performance management; management by processes		This paper seeks to present a methodology to assess performance and to provide management decision support. A "management by value streams" model was developed to assess company performance. It was implemented to support decision-making at an industrial company. The idea behind the model is that products or services should continually flow in the organization, as values streams. The model includes a set of metrics to measure the level of achievements versus previous established organization strategic objectives. The approach aims to promote the spirit of continuous improvement and collaboration, breaking the individual and segmented logic of the traditional distribution of work. The model leads to the definition of two integrated performance indicators: the Process Sustainability Index and the Organization Performance Index. These indicators provide an analysis on the level of performance of existing value streams, as well as on the organization, as a whole. This analysis will contribute to identify new improvement opportunities. The paper concludes that the model helps the implementation process of the organization strategy deployment: it works as an invaluable tool to act and to promote communication at the several organization levels.

J	De Montis, A; De Montis, V				De Montis, Andrea; De Montis, Vinicio			Planners in the face of mining cultural heritage: tourism development at L'Argentiera, Italy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cultural tourism; mining heritage tourism; tourist destination; tourism policy and planning; tourist monetary impacts		Contemporary planners are often confronted with the issue of recovering settlements which rose as a necessary complement of former productive activities and nowadays have lost their original functions. In particular, mining entrepreneurship throughout Europe has produced during the last century remarkable effects on the built and natural environment, by inducing typical changes in local landscape patterns. A correct interpretation of the latter today may reveal a strategic endowment of local societies, since mining heritage may constitute a factor of comparative advantage for a contemporary tourism destination. In this paper, the authors illustrate the proposal of Integrated Master Plan of L'Argentiera, a former mining settlement in north-western Sardinia, Italy. They describe the opportunities of this proposal, by referring to the tourist flows most likely attracted in a destination recovered according to mining heritage tourism led policies and planning, and to monetary beneficial impacts induced on regional development, in terms of extra revenues and employment directly and indirectly generated.

J	Dealtry, R; Howard, K				Dealtry, Richard; Howard, Keith			Moving towards optimising demand-led learning The 2005-2007 ECUANET Leonardo Da Vinci Project	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING			English	Article						Corporate universities; Human resource management; Lifelong learning		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the key project learning points and outcomes as a guideline for the future quality management of demand-led learning and development. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology was based upon a corporate university blueprint architecture and browser toolkit developed by a member of the team to provide depth in practice evidence and a searchable database for comparative case to case practice evaluation. Findings - It was found that the corporate university organisation and business development concept is a subject area which is either well understood by company management and education institutions or there is considerable confusion about its role and purpose. In large part this arises from the very different interpretation in the concept's development and practice across the world, region by region. From a wide and diverse portfolio of companies and organisations who where invited to participate in the action research case studies, those who accepted have one very important characteristic in common: they are all intensively engaged in managing a major innovation, i.e. they already have the commitment to making new ideas work in practice. In addition it also demands serious reflection about the creative nature of the learning leadership role and also the style of its management. Practical implications - The results of the project show that a successful corporate university intervention needs to be founded upon a sustainable commitment by top management who should promote, if not present already, a spirit of curiosity leading to better ways of doing business today and in the future. It requires an in-depth understanding of the organisation's strategic learning needs and good knowledge of the models of corporate university development that are available and reliable. Originality/value - The database of case foundation information, key performance indicators (KPIs) and best practice outcomes will be one of the most comprehensive and world class quality reference sources published to date. The variables that make up the portfolios of emergent best practices - process and management - have originality and value both individually and collectively. The impact of these best practice ways of working will have far reaching consequences for leadership and the future shape of lifelong interdependent learning between employers and employees and policy in government departments and education institutions.

J	Eng, TY				Eng, Teck-Yong			Customer portfolio planning in a business network context	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Customer portfolios; Network effects; Focal-firm performance	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; KNOWLEDGE; ASSETS; POWER; ORGANIZATION	In an increasingly globalised business environment, it is no longer adequate to analyse and develop supplier-customer relationship portfolios without consideration of a firm's network relationships. While research in business relationships has examined resource allocation and strategy development in the context of a dyadic relationship, portfolios and network relationships, little is known about the network effects of a focal firm's relationships on its performance particularly from both supplier and customer evaluations. The present study attempts to fill this gap by developing a customer portfolio framework that includes four levels of business relationships, and integrates a resource-based view and industry determinants of competitive advantage. The proposed framework is applied and analysed using data of UK-based food service companies. The main results show that a focal relationship performance is influenced by both industry and resource-based advantages in a business network context. The results also suggest that a focal firm can better enhance its competitive position with the knowledge of network effects and interdependence of strategic actions in a business network context.

J	Gay, B				Gay, Brigitte			Firm dynamic governance of global innovation by means of flexible networks of connections	JOURNAL OF INNOVATION ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovation; alliances; structural holes; centrality; complex networks; small world	INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; KNOWLEDGE; BIOTECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; GROWTH; COOPERATION; CENTRALITY; DYNAMICS	Today a plethora of inter-company alliances exists. Firms have networked value chains, disclosing consequently their strategy, which assets are internalized or externalized, and their ability to cope with fast change. The picture of all interfirm alliances in high tech sectors is that of an unstable complex network, or macrostructure, that evolves quickly and into which firms are differently entwined. Structural metrics borrowed from network research in sociology such as centrality and constraint (or lack of "structural holes") can be used to assess dynamically a firm's position in the macro structure and therefore the market: does the firm occupy a dominant or dominated position in an industry? How do its partners and competitors perform? Drawing also from recent theories on complex networks developed by statistical physicists, we show that firms are embedded in dynamic complex networks that have a 'scale-free' format, with only a few firms or "hubs" controlling the system, as well as a cohesive or 'small-world' structure. This small-world structure, which allows rapid diffusion of innovation along very short paths, also constrains firms continuously and can lead to a fast reversal of their position on the market. Taking as an example a major sector of the biopharmaceutical industry, this study offers insights for managers to assess effectively their environment and navigate under constant pressure within these ever-changing networks.

S	Huovinen, P		Sanchez, R		Huovinen, Pekka			PLATFORM FOR ADVANCING RESEARCH IN COMPETENCE-BASED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT: A POPULATION OF 84 CONCEPTS PUBLISHED BETWEEN THE YEARS 1990-2002	FOCUSED ISSUE ON FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES IN COMPETENCE THEORY DEVELOPMENT	Research in Competence-Based Management		English	Article; Book Chapter							RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; DYNAMIC THEORY; INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; FIRM; CAPABILITIES; ORGANIZATION; REPLICATION	This chapter is based on a four-year literature review process that focused on conceptual business management research. A new platform for advancing business management in competence-related ways is compiled using 66 references that contain a population of 84 competence-related business management concepts published in English between the years 1990 and 2002. For the purposes of this study, the home bases of focal firms are limited to the OECD countries. Ex ante, various research traditions were regrouped into eight schools of thought on business management based on resources, competences, knowledge, organizations, processes, business dynamism, evolution, and Porter's frameworks. The eligible concepts were identified via an analysis of 50 journals and books of 18 publishers. The findings reveal that 99 authors have assigned primary or secondary roles to a firm's competences within their 84 concepts across the eight schools of thought. The two schools with primary emphasis on a firm's competences, the dynamism-based school (18 concepts) and the competence-based school ( 16 concepts), have produced 34 (41%) concepts. The six other schools have generated 50 (60%) concepts: 14 knowledge-based, ten resource-based, ten evolutionary, seven Porterian, seven organization-based, and two process-based concepts. The platform developed in this chapter may help researchers to focus on the most promising areas and ways to produce highly applicable concepts for managing a firm's dynamic business. Some suggestions to this end are put forth: (i) increase future collaboration between scholars, business managers, and business consultants, (ii) advance competence-based concepts primarily along the international business dimension, and (iii) conduct future competence-related literature reviews. The rigorous conduct of future reviews involves the replicable ways of searching, browsing, including or excluding, retrieving, inferring, coding, and presenting the conceptual data.

Although research suggests that more than half of the alliances fail and that measures of outcomes lack consistency and comparability across the range of alliances. This study proposes a framework and measure that allows a diverse range of alliances, with a wide range of objectives and outcomes to be evaluated for success or failure.

J	Kanellopoulos, DN				Kanellopoulos, Dimitris N.			An ontology-based system for intelligent matching of travellers' needs for airline seats	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						airlines; ontologies; web portal	SEMANTIC WEB	In recent years, the airline industry has fostered a dependency on technology for its operational and strategic management. Existing tools for facilitating searches of airline seats availability lack in providing an intelligent matching between available airline seats and the personal requirements of the travellers. The objective of this research work was to design and develop an intelligent web portal to serve as a service provider in the airlines travelling tasks. This portal aims at helping people living in Europe to find airline seats that match their personal travelling preferences. For this purpose, the knowledge of the airlines travelling domain has been represented by means of ontology, which has been used to guide the design of the application and to supply the system with semantic capabilities. Additionally, the ontological component allows for defining an ontology-guided search engine, which provides more intelligent matches between airline seats offers and travelling preferences. Finally, this work covers the design of the ontology and the partial development of the web portal.

J	Kupka, B; Everett, AM				Kupka, Bernd; Everett, Andre M.			Moscow on the Hudson: assessing expatriates' affective fit in host cultures with the intercultural communication affinity scale	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						affective fit; expatriate selection; intercultural affinity; strategic international human resource management; training needs assessment	COPING STRATEGIES; PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIERS; JOB-PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; ADJUSTMENT; MANAGEMENT; WESTERN; PERSONALITY; PERSPECTIVE; FRAMEWORK	Increasing scale and scope of international activities, particularly by European companies, poses mounting challenges for strategic international human resource management. As the level of complexity of international assignments rises, so too does the cost of failure. Corporate representatives sent as expatriates are often ill-prepared to cope with the intercultural differences they encounter. One socially responsible solution to enhance expatriates' success rate, while meeting corporate objectives, is more adequately to prepare the envoys prior to and during their overseas mission. The authors argue that a key to this process is the evaluation of candidates' intercultural affinity, both as a selection criterion and for training needs assessment. This article first illustrates the importance of intercultural affinity, secondly describes its theoretical roots and forwards a definition and, thirdly, introduces a scale to measure intercultural affinity.

J	Larson, PD				Larson, Paul D.			Accreditation program design: a survey of supply chain professionals	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Accreditation of prior learning; Qualifications; Purchasing; Design; Supply chain management; Canada		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report results of a survey in support of re-designing the Purchasing Management Association of Canada (PMAC) professional accreditation program, the Certified Professional Purchaser (CPP). Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was developed, embedded in e-mail messages via hyperlink, and transmitted to the PMAC membership. The questionnaire included 54 topics, tools and techniques for supply chain management (SCM). Over 2,000 PMAC members commented on CPP program design, by returning the questionnaire electronically. Data analysis culminated with a principal components analysis of the 54 items, from which seven distinct components emerged. Findings - The paper finds that PMAC members lack a common view of SCM. While 63 percent have adopted a broad SCM perspective; 37 percent have a more narrow perspective. However, the most important topics for supply chain professionals are robust across the perspectives. These topics pertain to general managerial skills (e.g. communication, leadership and relationship building); rather than specific functional or analytical tools and techniques. Research limitations/implications - While the current study focuses exclusively on Canadian supply chain professionals, it would be very interesting and worthwhile to expand this research to other geographic locations. Practical implications - A renewed CPP program, taken out of the somewhat narrow and tactically-oriented purchasing area - and into the broader and more strategic SCM space, seems to be in order. The survey provides valuable information to support design and development of this new program. Originality/value - Based on electronic survey returns from more than 2,000 supply chain professionals, insights are gained into various perspectives on SCM, along with important knowledge (topics, tools and techniques) for effective SCM.

J	Leijon, S; Soderbom, A				Leijon, Svante; Soderbom, Ame			Builders and cleaners - A longitudinal study of strategic narratives	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						corporate strategy; narratives; senior management	DISCOURSE	Purpose - The purpose of this research paper is to contribute to strategy theory by differentiating different types of top management narratives and trying to understand the interplay between them as well as the dynamics over time. Design/methodology/approach - The study was designed from an interpretative narrative approach. Narratives were produced from deep interviews and organisational documents covering a period of more than 25 years. Findings - Two kinds of narratives were detected - builders and cleaners. The builders' narratives illustrate how personal life-stories are embedded in the strategic development processes but the cleaners' narratives are organisational stories without personal life-stories and cover no actual development. The concept meta-narrative helped to understand strategic changes over time and was embedded in the myth-periods involved. The meta-narrative identified was built on an idea of a going concern and on the role to produce physical large objects for long-term use. Research limitations/implications - Owing to the longitudinal design of the study a cyclical pattern with related managerial narratives were produced. The dichotomy builders and cleaners could be developed studying other longitudinal business strategies and also by connections to meta-narratives derived from more general economic theories. Practical implications - Builders and cleaners focus on either business or organisational/financial aspects but neither of both. Awareness of this, learning strategic management requires co-operation between different actors. Originality/value - The longitudinal design describes and analyzes a cyclical pattern of managerial patterns, while other studies based on narratives cover more limited organisational events in time and space.

J	Nwabueze, U; Mileski, JP				Nwabueze, Uche; Mileski, Joan P.			The Three Dimensions of Quality Service: The Case of Service Quality Gaps in the UK National Health Service?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						service quality; UK hospitals; health care quality perceptions; hospital quality strategy		United Kingdom hospitals have traditionally defined quality as the level of service provided whereas patients define quality as service that meets their expectations. These two definitions highlight a focus difference and result in "service quality gaps." This article develops a model of service quality gaps built on three dimensions: the focus of service organisation management, the perceiver of the service, and strategy implemented. The model is empirically tested using a 2001 survey of the chief executive of each of hospitals in England and Wales. We find where gaps exist, there is interconnectedness between them, and strategic focus change provides improved quality.

J	Oliveira, MD				Oliveira, Maria de Fatima			Fighting a smoky fire: an analysis of Philip Morris's CEO speeches according to image restoration strategies	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Corporate image; Corporate social responsibility; Critical management; Semantics; Strategic management	REPAIR DISCOURSE; REPUTATION; COMMUNICATION; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - This paper seeks to investigate Philip Morris's responses to a decade-long crisis through the analysis of its CEO's speeches. It also aims to reveal the rich potential of corporate speeches as examples of crisis management strategies. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 67 speeches of Philip Morris's CEO are analyzed using centering resonance analysis. The data are also cluster- and factor-analyzed. Combining quantitative and qualitative examination of the dataset provides a broader understanding of the organization's rhetoric strategies. Findings - Philip Morris's CEO crafted specific frames and image repair strategies to fit different stages of the crisis. The frames and restorations strategies used are, respectively: profitable multinational bolstering, minimization, and attack the accuser (1994-1996); litigation target, transcendence (1997-1998); and corporate good citizen, bolstering and transcendence (1999-2001). Research limitations/implications - The paper highlights the significance of corporate speeches as a fully controlled form of corporate discourse that reveals strategic frames and communication tactics. Future research should concentrate on comparing such messages with other important actors' discourse. Practical implications - The paper draws attention to the role of lawyers and other actors in defining crisis management strategies as well as emphasizing that corporate values may not be accepted by the entire society, yet may meet the expectations of specific stakeholders. Originality/value - This paper combines qualitative and quantitative analysis to investigate a rich source of corporate communication: top management speeches. The study underscores how rhetoric strategies can play for time during crisis, but are limited in changing inherently bad products into socially acceptable ones.

J	Peng, ZC				Peng, Zongchao			Preparing for the real storm during the calm: A comparison of the crisis preparation strategies for pandemic influenza in China and the US	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						crisis; crisis management; crisis preparation; pandemic influenza; strategic policy-making		Humanity is facing the rapid spread of avian flu and the potential severe threat of a future global pandemic flu. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the governments of various countries and regions have proposed plans for managing a pandemic flu. China and the U.S. also issued their own preparation plans in September and November, 2005, respectively. This article asks whether there are vulnerabilities or shortcomings inherent in either preparation plan, and if so, what measures should be taken to improve them. The article first provides a theoretical analysis of the issues of crisis preparation, chiefly from the perspective of a real crisis. Second, it does some crisis analysis of a pandemic flu and proposes preliminary preparation strategies to deal with it. More importantly, it compares the United States and China concerning their crisis preparation strategies, including the process of forming strategies, cognition of risks, choices of goals, basic principles, framework, and implementation.

J	Ribeiro, FL; Videira, SI				Ribeiro, Francisco Loforte; Videira, Sofia Isabel			Management of the built heritage in the Lisbon's central downtown	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS			English	Article						Heritage; Portugal; Urban areas; Building conservation; Regeneration		Purpose - Built heritage is one of the biggest assets that Lisbon's central downtown has accumulated since eighteenth century. The efficient use of these assets is a challenge for both the owners of individual buildings and society as a whole. Recently, a new regeneration initiative was announced for Lisbon's historic district. This paper aims to address the urban problems of old Lisbon's downtown, to discuss the existing public intervention framework and to present an integrated information management system aimed at providing technical and economic information needed to improve co-ordination between public sector and private agents. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology of the study is an interpretative case study method. The case study approach is one of the most commonly used research designs in qualitative research. The contents and conclusions from the research were obtained by means of: a review of publications and current practices related to urban regeneration; a review of data and information on urban regeneration studies; a survey conducted throughout the duration of the study; and a case study. Findings - The integrated information management system presented in this paper is a tool that allows the management agency of the Lisbon's historic district to the take full advantage of the potentialities of the area, namely the strategic location and the historic and architectonic heritage. Research limitations/implications - A great number of buildings in the historic district are classified as buildings of "public heritage". The findings suggest that property and economic activity can be the driving forces for revitalising Lisbon's historic district. Originality/value - This paper is aim to understand the key features of old Lisbon's downtown and to analyse existing practice in managing built heritage on the historic district. It also seek to identify how an information management system could improve the current intervention practices, in the area, that agency follows.

J	Roche, S				Roche, Sebastian			Performance Management in France: A Police or an Electoral Issue?	POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article								The issue of police performance in France has gained ground. However, its significance must be questioned. In this paper, four issues are considered. The first is related to recent changes in public finance rules in line with New Public Management practices. The second is related to the incremental changes in technical tools used to measure police activity and success at the operational level. The third issue is strategic performance management. Management of performance appears to be at best nascent and at worst a disguise for old structures and practices (sometimes favouring malpractice). The paper concludes that the reality of police performance management can be best explained with reference to its function in the political arena. The management of police performance became a weapon in the recent French elections because it emphasized the 'results' of the minister or government in charge. In the short run, the political dimension of police performance appears to be the key focus of the two last governments at the expense of real changes in police performance management as a means of increasing police efficiency, adaptation and police legitimacy generally.

J	de la Fuente, JR; Guillen, MJY				Romero de la Fuente, Jaime; Yaguee Guillen, Maria			Re-incorporating usage situation in choice models: a base for future developments	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Usage situation; Functionality; Consideration set; Choice model; Multinational logit		There is strong theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the idea that consumers seek functional features in products. These features are determined by the situations in which the consumer foresees the use of the products. Despite their influence, these situations have received little attention among marketing academics. Thus, we propose a choice model that takes into account these factors. In this model, two stages of consumer choice are affected by usage situations. First, the alternatives included within the consideration set are determined by foreseen usage contexts. Second, the evaluation of alternatives is performed using an ideal-value scheme, which depends directly on the intended consumption situations. This model is validated with survey data and scanner panel data. The results suggest the need to provide practitioners with new guidance on how to manage product functionality in strategic and tactic decisions, especially regarding product design and communication areas.

J	Ruffin, FA				Ruffin, Fayth A.			Professionalizing business district management for the twenty-first century	JOURNAL OF PLACE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Business administration; Governance; Globalization; Public sector organizations; Urban centres	IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS; PRIVATE GOVERNMENTS; URBAN GOVERNANCE; POLICY TRANSFER; PUBLIC SPACE; WORLD CITIES; GLOBAL CITY; REVITALIZATION; TRANSFORMATION; GLOBALIZATION	Purpose - This paper seeks to explore leading theories and concepts in professionalising the emerging field of business district management. Design/methodology/approach - In the context of globalization and localization, it discusses distinctive place-based elements of business improvement districts (BIDs), such as: law, nomenclature, assessment formulae, and branding; while suggesting and analyzing strategic international application of certain theories and concepts. Findings - As an outgrowth of a literature review of globalizing cities, public administration, urban management, and BIDs together with semi-structured interviews of respondents in connection with doctoral dissertation research and in view of co-designing curriculum for and teaching a business district management certification program; research reveals that public entrepreneurship, social capital, network governance, and performance management can transcend disciplines and cut across sectors to be key theories and concepts for education and training of business district managers worldwide. However, management training is to be contextually developed consistent with branding techniques for the business district. Practical implications - Future research and evaluation of BIDs in the globalizing metropolis can ground theory to inform best practices and professional standards that will enable similarly situated business districts across the globe.

J	Schilhaneck, M				Schilhaneck, Michael			Brand management in the professional sports club setting	EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR SPORT AND SOCIETY			English	Article						branding; brand management; professional sport clubs		Market studies regularly indicate that professional sports clubs lack appropriate branding practices. Consequently, it is the purpose of this paper to develop a conceptual framework which comprises strategic as well as operative brand management options for professional sports clubs. The principal idea is to choose a generally valid theoretic brand management approach which represents the present state of academic research and to modify it to the special requirements of the chosen field of analysis. The objectives of this procedure are first to identify club branding options and second to use those findings to design a special brand management model for the professional sports club setting which provides information about how to build and maintain strong club brands. To illustrate the model, examples from German league football will be used. Additionally, empirical evidence of the importance in practice of the club branding options will be provided.

J	Stanko, B				Stanko, Betsy			Managing Performance in the Policing of Domestic Violence	POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article								This paper presents an approach to strategic performance monitoring for domestic violence. The purpose of strategic performance management is to build in a mechanism to monitor and to improve police responses in order to diminish the overall harm of domestic violence, and ultimately to reduce domestic violence homicide. Three analytic elements-understanding the lessons from domestic homicide, the needs of repeat users of police services and the profile of requests for service for domestic violence-lay a foundation for thinking about victims' needs and policing. Laid alongside the information held by other agencies and non-government agencies, strategy and performance can be assessed in the context of victim safety and continuous improvement in filling the gaps in service delivery.

J	Tsai, SL; Ding, HB; Rice, MP				Tsai, Su-lee; Ding, Hung-bin; Rice, Mark P.			The effectiveness of learning from strategic alliances: a case study of the Taiwanese textile industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						interfirm alliances; learning effectiveness; communication activity; transparency; receptivity; Taiwan textile industry	INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; INFORMATION-TRANSFER; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; SOCIAL NETWORKS; TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE	Interfirm alliances provide a channel of communication between partnering firms. However, two notable communication barriers hinder the effectiveness of learning across firms. As the target knowledge is different from their existing knowledge base, the recipient firms' incumbent knowledge base may not be sufficient to identify target knowledge. In addition, inability to internalise and integrate acquired knowledge to the rest of organisation may handicap the effect of new knowledge. A growing number of recent studies have reported that the frequency of communication activities has positive contribution to the interaction quality between firms. However, we know relatively less about the role of transparency and receptivity in the relationships between communication activities and learning effectiveness. To address this issue, we designed a survey study based on the learning and knowledge transfer literature. The results of our analysis show that communication improves interfirm learning effectiveness, but such relationship is mediated by transparency and receptivity.

J	Walsh, PR; Sanderson, SM				Walsh, Philip R.; Sanderson, Stuart M.			Hybrid strategic thinking in deregulated retail energy markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Natural gas; Electricity; Competitive strategy; Market forces; Energy industry		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the results of research undertaken to test the use of traditional strategic approaches in developing competitive advantage through the assessment of the importance to small-andmedium-sized firms of cost and services available in a competitive retailmarket. Design/methodology/approach - A survey involving 181 small-and medium-enterprises provided responses to a questionnaire that measured the importance of key success factors to the customer when making a decision regarding their choice of natural gas supplier. Findings - The findings suggest that, the use of a low-cost strategy alone may not be sufficient to create a competitive advantage for suppliers and that a hybrid strategy of cost, service quality, enhanced communication and unbundled services will. Research limitations/implications - The sample was limited to natural gas customers in Ontario, Canada at a specific period of time in the deregulation process reducing the ability to generalize results across other regions and other energy types. This limitation is defended by the recognition that the importance of variables measured is consistent between regions and energy types. Practical implications - Energy suppliers can create a competitive advantage over their competition if they can differentiate themselves through the application of enhanced service quality and communications. Originality/value - Little, if any, empirical research exists that addresses the response of customers to strategic approaches of suppliers in deregulating energy markets.

J	Wang, CYP; Jaw, BS; Huang, CY				Wang, Christina Yu Ping; Jaw, Bih-Shiaw; Huang, Chuan-Yuan			Towards a cross-cultural framework of strategic international human resource control: the case of Taiwanese high-tech subsidiaries in the USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cultural adaptation; cultural integration; international human resource control; subsidiary's role	MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; ADAPTATION; JAPANESE; ORGANIZATIONS; COORDINATION; COMPETITION; PATTERNS; LESSONS	Due to the growing expansion of newly emerging multinational companies (MNCs) in the USA market, it seems pertinent to explore how to manage their Western industrialized subsidiaries in terms of human resource management. This study combines the institutionalism, resource dependence perspective, and control theory to provide an integrative framework in an attempt to investigate the cross-cultural determinants of strategic international human resource control over MNCs' subsidiaries. By a qualitative analysis of 10 Taiwanese top high-tech manufacturing companies operating in the USA, our findings are as follow: In order to perform subsidiary's value-added activities, multinationals need to identify the value and capabilities need for these activities. At the same time, subsidiaries also need to compare the cultural advantage of the home country in terms of these activities. In addition, from the perspective of cross-cultural influence, input control is designed to respond to high integration and high adaptation; output control is executed in the case of low integration and high cultural adaptation; while behavioural control is used to respond to high integration and low adaptation, simultaneously in the case of low value of subsidiary's activities.

Spatial strategic use as performance indicator in racket and wall sports	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN MOVEMENT			Spanish	Article						Spatial strategic use; performance indicators; racquet and wall sports		A computerized system of neuronal networks was used as a performance indicator to go deeply into the spatial strategic use within the racquet and wall sports. The aim of this investigation was: a) to determine the influence of the players' position in the court when finishing the point and b) to determine if there is any relation between the spaces where the ball is sent to, the game walls and its performance.. We recorded 1226 points in male category and analysed their final action. Specific software was designed for the two-dimensional analysis of the images and the management of the data. We carried out a period of training with four observers for four weeks keeping in mind aspects dealt with by several authors on the necessary and adequate training of the observers adapted to the management of the already described observation tool The final action that hit front wall number 3 always caused displacement, confirming us other data already mentioned. For level 1 we find that the most related spaces to efficacy are front wall 1, side wall 1 and 3, and court 1. We observed the tendency that shows the results where the final action is more efficient than the impact on the two extreme areas of the court and side wall.

J	Fontannaz, S; Oosthuizen, H				Fontannaz, S.; Oosthuizen, H.			The development of a conceptual framework to guide sustainable organisational performance	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The emergence of the networked economy implies that traditional management approaches no longer suffice in addressing the challenge of complexity. This is compounded by the existence of divergent approaches to determining organisational performance in both management practice and academia, resulting in an execution gap occurring between strategy formulation and results. This article contributes to an understanding of organisational performance by integrating the divergent approaches to determining organisational performance into the Performance 'ESP' framework. This provides a conceptual framework to guide organisational development. The research to validate the framework includes a grounded theory approach, comprising a meta-analytical study of existing research, in-depth qualitative interviews and the pilot testing of the Performance ESP Index, which provides a composite measure of the multi-faceted stakeholder view of organisational performance. The research concludes that organisational performance resides in an organisation's ability to integrate the divergent approaches, to create an execution culture with the necessary dynamic capabilities for sustainable organisational performance in addressing the challenge of complexity. There needs to be diversity in executive abilities at board level to ensure the integration of strategy and people to create the execution culture. Furthermore, leadership should focus on the strategic fusion of strategy and people, whilst management should focus on developing the strategic paradigm throughout the organisation to ensure an execution culture. The Performance ESP framework provides a diagnostic tool to assess the existence of an execution culture to address the challenge of complexity. The purpose of the assessment tool is to complement the financial metrics of profitability, to ensure a balance between short term profitability and growth for sustainable organisational performance. Further research is required to confirm the reliability of the Performance ESP index as the initial pilot Study, whilst indicative of the potential of the instrument, did not provide conclusive evidence of reliability.

J	Hamilton, J				Hamilton, John			Service value networks: Into practice	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						service value networks; alignment; structural equation modeling	CONSTRUCTS; CHAIN	Modeling a business to match its customer perceived (and customer desired) outcomes, remains an on-going task. This paper considers shows how a service value networks (SVNs) approach may be engaged to model, and deliver, understanding of the front-end business and its direct engagement with its immediate (or front-end) customers. These front-end customers may be either: (1) its off-line, in-store customers - engaging directly with the business sales staff (or representative), or- (2) its on-line, virtual customers - engaging with the business via internet or remote access. In this situation, both the business, and the customer draw upon their respective viewpoints, and both sides influence the interaction. External to these business and customer influences are additional factors that capture the immediate and broader global effects - termed environmental effects. These three business-customer engagement areas of influence are captured by a SVN SEM approach. Without a business-customer encounter of some kind the likelihood of a services business, and a prospecting customer, successfully engaging in an exchange process is reduced. This exchange may be a physical, and/or services exchange, and/or an information and/or ideas exchange. To the business, this encounter is, in effect, a trade, and as a result, the business targets acquiring an economic exchange that will ultimately deliver a net positive economic outcome. To the customer, external and internal information feeds, servicing, perceived value, and satisfaction, are key encounter drivers. SVNs offers a new way to understand the business-customer encounter, and to then utilize this acquired knowledge to either: (1) build a strategic management model, or (2) reengineer its business networks, and to then create a re-positioned, more customer-aligned business operation - one that is capable of delivering win - win, competitive business-customer solutions.

J	Michaels, D; Eley, B				Michaels, Desiree; Eley, Brian			The HIV & AIDS and STI National Strategic Plan 2007 - 2011: a paediatric perspective	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHILD HEALTH			English	Article								Objective. To analyse paediatric-specific goals and objectives in the HIV & AIDS and STI National Strategic Plan (NSP) for South Africa 2007 - 2011. Methods. This paper reviews key interventions described in the NSP regarding HIV prevention, management and treatment in children under 14 years of age. A general overview of the plan and its implications for the health system was previously published. Results. The NSP contains 4 priority areas, which were disaggregated into 19 goals. Each goal specifies several clearly worded objectives together with 5-year targets, and identifies lead agencies responsible for the achievement of these targets. Nine of the 19 goals (47%) address interventions which mention or affect children directly. Paediatric-specific objectives encompass HIV prevention and treatment, legislation, social security, education, mental health, and developmental monitoring. If implemented comprehensively, it will appreciably improve the country's chances of achieving Millennium Development Goal 4, i.e. the reduction by two-thirds of the mortality rate among children under 5 years of age by 2015. However, substantial resources are required to achieve the goals and objectives of the NSP, including legal and policy amendments. Conclusion. The NSP is an important framework document, which should provide the necessary direction for addressing the paediatric HIV epidemic in South Africa.

The Turning Point Initiative provided support for states to focus on large-scale system changes that resulted in increased funding for public health capacity and infrastructure development. Turning Point provides a test case for obtaining financial and institutional resources focused on systems change and infrastructure development-areas for which it has been historically difficult to obtain long-term support. The purpose of this exploratory, descriptive survey research was to enumerate the actual resources leveraged toward public health system improvement through the partnerships, planning, and implementation activities funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as a part of the Turning Point Initiative.

Confronting the inevitable: ISO 14001 implementation and the Durban automotive cluster	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The aim of the article is to explore the complexities of the ISO 14001 implementation process, with the objective of identifying the barriers to its implementation, the factors that influence these barriers, and finding possible solutions to address these barriers. The theoretical basis of ISO 14001, the implementation process, and its strategic implications were established by reviewing previous research. Based on this theoretical review, a self-administered questionnaire was designed to serve as a measuring instrument for the empirical research conducted among members of the Durban Automotive Cluster (DAC). The specific objectives of the empirical study were: to determine the reasons for seeking ISO 14001 certification, to determine the perceived and experienced barriers to its implementation, and to investigate the strategic implications of an Environmental Management System (EMS) such as ISO 14001. Finally, the findings, recommendations, caveats, and suggestions for further research are summarised.

J	Yim, JW; Weston, R				Yim, Julian W.; Weston, Rae			The characteristics of bioentrepreneurs in the Australian biotechnology industry: A pilot study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						biotechnology; entrepreneurship; Big Five factor model; psychological typology; university spin-offs; Australia	5 PERSONALITY DIMENSIONS; ADEQUATE TAXONOMY; JOB-PERFORMANCE; BIG; SUCCESS	In order to understand the characteristics of bioentrepreneurs, this paper seeks to identify the entrepreneurial types present in the Australian biotechnology industry by using the four-way psychological typology (Miner 2000) and identifying linkages between the four-way psychological typology and the Big Five model of personality traits. We believe this is a new approach to using psychological typology in the study of entrepreneurship by mapping with the Big Five model of personality traits. Miner four typological types are 'personal achievers'(PA), 'super sales people' (SS), 'expert idea generators'(EI) and 'real managers'(RM). The Big Five factors are extraversion (Ex), stability/emotion stability (Es), agreeableness (Ag), conscientiousness (Co), and openness to experience (Op). By combining the entrepreneurial types and the five-factor personality traits, we can map the linkage relationships as PA-ExEsCoOp; SS-ExAgCoOp; EI-ExEsOp and RM-ExEsCoOp. In this pilot study, we find there are more 'personal achiever' and 'expert idea generator' bioentrepreneurs in the biotech industry with the linkage relationships of PA-ExEsCoOp and EI-ExEsOp, which lead us to conclude there are strong demands for bioentrepreneurs with managerial skills, sales and marketing skills, skills in forming strategic alliance with partners and skills in securing the public and private capitals through finance channels such as public listing and venture capital. This implies that if PA entrepreneurs acquired more agreeableness personality traits and EI entrepreneurs also acquired more agreeableness and conscientiousness personality traits they would improve the ability of their businesses to attract more financial investments and form sustainable strategic alliance with partners in the Australian biotechnology industry.

Strategic planning for building research - A process oriented methodology	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH; RESEARCH NEEDS; TRENDS	This paper explains and discusses the development of a strategic plan for the management of research in building in a planning horizon of 8-10 years. The plan has three major elements: (1) a knowledge base with ranked long range research needs in each discipline; (2) a second base which defines the main objectives of the building sector and the major interdisciplinary problems that must be solved in order to attain them; and (3) the procedures to be followed in order to initiate and carry out an annual research program in view of the strategic plan and the current information maintained in the two bases. This paper dwells first on the special features of research as a knowledge building and problem solving tool, and then describes the process of the actual development of the strategic plan for building research in Israel, including the construction of the knowledge bases and the generation of the annual research programs. Special attention is given to the objectivity and accountability of the process.

Implementation of a Severity-adjusted Diagnosis-related Groups Payment System in a Large Health Plan Implications for Pay for Performance	JOURNAL OF AMBULATORY CARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						APR-DRG; hospital efficiency; hospital quality; pay for performance; performance improvement; severity adjusted inpatient payment		This article describes the implementation of the All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Group (APR-DRG) inpatient payment system in a large regional commercial payer. The APR-DRG system replaced the Plan's current All-Payer DRG (AP-DRG) payment methodology on December 1, 2006, and is part of a strategic hospital payment redesign that will enable the Plan to control costs, increase pricing transparency for customers and providers, and reward hospital quality and efficiency. On the basis of modeled results using 2005 data, we found that the APR-DRG payment system using cost-based weights will do a better job of linking inpatient severity and use of resources to payments. The transition to the cost-based APR-DRG methodology with enhanced clinical specificity will also support measurement of hospital quality and efficiency in the Plan's performance improvement programs.

J	Osler, R				Osler, Rob			The type-role-purpose brand taxonomy	JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						brand strategy; brand taxonomy; brand architecture; brand equity		As the appreciation for a brand's ability to enhance earnings has grown, so too has the sophistication with which two or more brands are combined to leverage synergies and create offerings with greater differentiation and relevance. When once there were only simple producer-product brand couplings, such as Kellogg's Corn Flakes and Ford Mustang, today's marketers and consumers must contend with more complex offerings, such as Microsoft Xbox 360 Elite and MazdaSpeed MX-5 Miata (owned by Ford) and Benjamin Moore Regal paint at Pottery Barn (owned by Williams-Sonoma, Inc). This paper introduces the concept of brand taxonomy, examines several brand structures in the literature and then builds upon one published brand taxonomy to facilitate assessment of brand type, role and strategic purpose. Such assessment will aid internal agreement on important decisions regarding a brand's required funding and staff support, its strategic objectives and marketplace aspirations, its relationships with other brands within the portfolio and its visual identity.

J	Stegmann, JP				Stegmann, Juan Pablo			An Integrated View of Strategic Management	JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY ECONOMICS			English	Article								Strategic management has produced an amazing number of theories and models in the last decades. However, so far it has not succeeded in producing a good integrative model that can synthesize all the existing models. In a previous paper I proposed such a model (from now on we will refer to it as the GEMK model, in relation to Growth-EVA-Market Power-Knowledge). It is based on the two drivers of stock value creation, Economic Value Added (EVA) and growth of capital, and proposes two new testable variables, market power and knowledge. This paper is the application of the GEMK model. It shows how most of existing strategic management models impact stock value creation. It produces a valuable simplification of the discipline, eliminates confrontations, shows that several different theories are complementary, provides a new powerful critical thinking, and shows that the different theories are contingent to these four variables. Most importantly, it shows that the different theories have different levels of impact on stock value creation.

J	Crawford, A				Crawford, Anthony			What impacts on quality assessment using OASys?	PROBATION JOURNAL			English	Article						OASys; public protection; quality management plan; risk assessment		This article outlines the findings of a small study based in one probation area which considered the factors that may impact on quality assessment when using OASys (Offender Assessment System). Following a brief outline of the organizational and broader context in which OASys is used, the study explores the findings of case studies, survey questionnaires and interviews undertaken with Probation Officers. Tentative conclusions are drawn about the factors which emerge as affecting quality in assessment and suggestions are offered for further study. The article concludes by welcoming the strategic initiatives currently being undertaken to improve assessment and management of risk but suggests that the use of top-down initiatives alone, combined with an emphasis on risk management and containment, may serve to undermine ownership of the aspiration to risk reduction and, in the long term, threatens the loss of skills necessary for effective assessment and management of risk.

In particular, we develop a matching model in which agents may decide to adopt exclusive contracts to reduce bilateral bargaining inefficiencies in the presence of private information. We show that it is optimal for agents to adopt exclusive contracts in thin markets but not in thick markets and that for intermediate levels of market thickness strategic complementarities lead to multiple equilibria. We study the welfare properties of market equilibria and discuss under what circumstances courts should enforce exclusive contracts.

Different types of flight operations in abnormal conditions are explained and the responsibilities of Network Control Centre (NCC) are identified for each condition. The paper explores the development of NCC information system in Emirates Airlines. It then conducts an environmental analysis and identifies the factors affecting flight operations. In particular, a political economical social technological (PEST) analysis is used to indicate the critical factors to the strategic flight operations management for the current and future macro-environmental circumstances. An information management strategy and a tactical approach are proposed to manage the interruptions caused by abnormal conditions within the current infrastructure of the company.

J	Hung, CL; Yeh, SY				Hung, Chia-Liang; Yeh, Shu-Yu			THE DIFFUSION OF I-MODE OVERSEAS: A PERSPECTIVE OF INSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Institution; mobile standard; diffusion strategy		The Japanese telecom giant DoCoMo launched promoted its proprietary i-mode mobile services in 1999 and overseas in 2002. Diffusion overseas was much slower than expected, however. This paper investigates the diffusion of Japanese i-mode mobile internet in Europe from an institutional perspective, focusing on five earlier i-mode overseas operators located in Taiwan, The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and France. We found four strategic institutional levers that stimulated i-mode domestic diffusion but failed to appear in overseas areas: operator leadership, subscriber scale, mobile penetration rate, and the ability of the firm to coordinate capability among complements. We propose strategies to internationalize a new standard by co-branding with local vendors and by using penetration pricing as an incentive for switching. Additionally, we recommend an industrial policy that drives cannibalization to facilitate mobile migration to a more advanced standard.

J	Lal, D; Strachan, PA				Lal, David; Strachan, Peter A.			Understanding strategising in the telecommunications industry: lessons for global telecoms firms	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This study considers the key determinants of environmental change and its associated consequences on strategic decision-making and strategising at the UK incumbent BT (British Telecommunications Plc), 1 since UK telecommunications privatisation in 1984. With this in mind, the issue of strategising has become an important theme in the strategic management literature but is an under-researched area, particularly within the telecommunications sector. A case study approach was adopted, with face-to-face interviews carried out with senior executives. Semi-structured questionnaire checklists were used and content analysis was applied to the data set. Results alluded to the nature of both strategic evolution and the processes involved in strategising occurring at the incumbent telecoms provider, through the presentation and analysis of empirical data that has been unexplored - until now. Findings further our understanding of corporate level managerial decision-making, which will be of interest to both academics and practitioners.

In a successive international Cournot oligopoly, we analyse incentives for using tax instruments strategically to shift rents vertically, between exporting and importing countries, and horizontally, between exporting countries. We show that the equilibrium outcome depends crucially on the relative degree of competitiveness in the upstream and downstream parts of the industry. With respect to national welfare, a more competitive upstream industry may benefit an exporting (upstream) country and harm an importing (downstream) country. On the other hand, a more competitive downstream industry may harm exporting countries.

Perceptions on the of use of a corporate business incubator to enhance knowledge management at ESKOM	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article								The knowledge economy impacts on the way enterprises should address their business requirements, forcing many of them to review the potential mechanisms they could employ to improve their competitive advantage. The business incubator approach is one such mechanism. This article explores the application of knowledge management, knowledge creation and innovation in a corporate incubator. It focuses on the process of knowledge management, to ensure that a culture and appropriate strategies conducive to enhancing knowledge creation are developed in an enterprise. Innovation as a strategic imperative is considered, as well as the challenge of driving it within an enterprise. The purpose of this empirical survey was to determine whether the corporate incubator model applied by Eskom conforms to the attributes of knowledge management, knowledge creation and innovation, and whether the synergies to be exploited amongst these disciplines can be harnessed to give Eskom a competitive advantage.

J	Agnolucci, P; Ekins, P				Agnolucci, Paolo; Ekins, Paul			Technological transitions and Strategic Niche Management: the case of the hydrogen economy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technological transition; strategic niche management; SNM; hydrogen technologies.		There is considerable interest in the prospects for a large-scale transition to hydrogen as an energy source. This paper assesses these prospects through consideration of technological transition theory and especially the likelihood of hydrogen use becoming widespread through Strategic Niche Management (SNM). The paper shows that current niches show few signs of the characteristics that are necessary for niche expansion to the extent required, and concludes that at present hydrogen technologies still need substantial R&D support resulting in a number of scientific breakthroughs before they will become viable in competitive markets.

J	Brito, C; Roseira, C				Brito, Carlos; Roseira, Catarina			Towards a multi-dimensional approach to supply management: a comparative case study	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article						supply chain management; buyer-seller relationships; networking	BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS; ORGANIZATION; NETWORKS	Purpose - The article aims at contributing to a better understanding of the interdependence between supply management and the strategic position of the buying firm. Design/methodology/approach - The research follows a qualitative analysis of two cases: Adira, a family-owned manufacturer of machinery to cut steel, and Vulcano, a manufacturer of instantaneous house gas water-heaters and boilers. Findings - The article finds that supply management decisions depend not only on the network position of the buying firm, but also on the network vision of its managers. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on two contrasting cases. Further research should develop and test the findings by using other cases and methodological approaches more quantitative in nature. Practical implications - The article has three major practical implications: supply management should integrate three levels of decisions: dyadic, portfolio and network decisions; supply management does not depend solely on firms' strategic positioning and strategies, but also on managers' network theory about the role and capabilities of suppliers; and "no strategy" can also be a strategy. Originality/value - The study was conducted on the basis of a multi-dimensional model that integrates three levels of analysis: dyadic, portfolio and network.

J	Dovey, K; Strydom, A; Penderis, B; Kemp, P				Dovey, Ken; Strydom, Amy; Penderis, Barbara; Kemp, Peter			Leading change in the South African district health service	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Leadership; Team working; Learning; Knowledge management; Social capital; Morale		Purpose - The paper sets out to explore the leadership processes and dynamics of change management in a fragmented, and resource-poor, health service in an impoverished rural region in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines an action research process aimed at assisting the stakeholders of two rural clinics to integrate psychiatric care into the Primary Health Care service that they offer their respective communities. This involved the transformation of existing practices through a form of praxis that involved learning from action and acting on learning. Findings - The findings of the paper relate to the role of leadership in the facilitation of transformational learning in team-based social action. Four areas of leadership responsibility are highlighted: the transformation of inappropriate mental models; the development of strategic resilience; the shifting of the locus of control of stakeholders to a more internal position; and the creation of a social environment in which intangible capital resources are generated and leveraged in the collective interest. Research limitations/implications - This paper is subject to the limitations of potential bias and distortion in action research. Although the "objective" evidence of the integration of psychiatric services at Pelsrus and Kwanomzamo clinics exists, the portrayal of the learning processes through which this was achieved could have been influenced unwittingly by the authors' own knowledge and other interests. Practical implications - The paper endorses the educational importance of work-based projects through which strong tacit leadership knowledge bases can be developed in health sector personnel. Originality/value - This paper has attempted to share the effectiveness of work-and project-based learning in district health teams in South Africa. In particular, it has outlined how the learning strategy of the module leverages the team structure of the district health management units in order to create and exploit the social and morale capital resources that are potentially available through such a structure and the covenantal culture that it spawns. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to show how these resources are leveraged in the generation of mission-pertinent tacit knowledge that is then converted by project stakeholders into explicit knowledge forms that can be used more effectively in framing subsequent strategic action.

J	Dror, S				Dror, Shuki			A process causality approach given a strategic frame	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Operations management; Performance measures; Data analysis		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a methodology for building a causality process to dynamically investigate system performance linkages, as implied by a strategic frame such as a quality management frame or the balance scorecard frame. Design/methodology/approach - The causality process develops aggregated process control tools in a data mining structure. The method identifies significant performance improvements by means of Cumulative Sum control charts, uses binary variables to mark them and time bounded search cycles as dictated by the causality constraints. Findings - The methodology was implemented in a manufacturing enterprise and thus enables to better understand causality at the operational (tactical) level as well as at the strategic level. Research limitations/implications - Additional research issues for further investigation are expressed by questions such as follows: what other data mining tools may be appropriate? How to methodically construct learning performance indicators? Practical implications - The causality process and its assisting process control techniques are suitable to a variety of managerial situations where techniques for monitoring and testing given frames of hypothesized performance linkages are needed. Originality/value - The methodology enables an individual organization to dynamically investigate its performance in order to improve the implementation of its strategy.

Health care performance and accountability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Health services; Quality assurance; Performance management; Management accountability		Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to examine health care performance and accountability. Design/methodology/approach - A strategic view of how quality assurance fits into other initiatives aimed at bringing about improvements in health care is offered in the paper. Findings - The paper finds that the task of defining the way in which health care can be most efficiently and effectively delivered is the concern of all health care staff. Aims, should be clarified, performance criteria and measures agreed on and, wherever possible and appropriate standards set up. Management also has the responsibility of ensuring the consistency and coherence of the many different activities that contribute to the aim of good health care.

The impact of resource-strategy correspondence on marketing performance-financial performance tradeoffs	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						Resource-based theory; strategy; coherence; performance; tradeoffs	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; CORPORATE VENTURES; SHAREHOLDER VALUE; FIRM RESOURCES; EMPIRICAL-TEST; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; VIEW; FRAMEWORK	We suggest that the relationships between strategy and financial performance and between strategy and marketing performance depend on the resource bundle and strategy of a firm. The better the correspondence between strategy and resource bundle, the better the performance. We empirically test and find support for this explanation. By building empirically calibrated models of the marketing and financial performance, we are able to show that, indeed, the optimum strategies for the two are not the same and more importantly that the difference varies depending on the resource bundle of a firm.

J	Grantham, S				Grantham, Susan			Risk assessment as a function of a successful merger: Merrill Lynch-Advest merger	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Acquisitions and mergers; Communication; Risk assessment		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the communication challenges Merrill Lynch encountered during the transition phase and post-merger with Advest and the subsequent problems that resulted in drastically fewer numbers of Advest advisors joining, or staying with, Merrill Lynch than was first anticipated. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on interviews with Advest employees at the time of the merger; this case study includes an overview of the anticipated outcomes, the communication strategies employed by Merrill Lynch during its transition phase, and the barriers that contributed to the less than desired results that occurred. Findings - The paper finds that Merrill Lynch determined that at least 65 percent of Advest's financial advisors would need to join Merrill Lynch by the closing date of the merger in December 2005 for the merger to be determined a financial success. Fifty percent of Advest financial advisors did not join Merrill Lynch by the closing date and, by July of 2006, approximately 80 percent of the advisors had left. Merrill Lynch failed to identify and address the primary concern to this key target audience; the anticipated change in the organizational culture. During the transition phase, Advest advisors gained much of their information from outside sources including competitors' recruiters who focused on the "Mother Merrill" reputation that was antithetical to Advest's organizational culture. The media also served as a primary source of information. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows that the pivotal issue affecting the success of this merger was the anticipated change by Advest's advisors to the organizational culture. Strategic communications that may have proven effective in addressing this issue during the merger between Merrill Lynch and Advest are not applicable for all mergers. Practical implications - Risk assessments identify key areas of interests to both internal and external stakeholders. This activity empowers an organization to adopt a proactive approach to effectively communicate with key stakeholders. When a risk assessment is not conducted, or fails to identify key issues, the potential for a crisis increases. Had Merrill Lynch conducted a risk assessment that identified the impending change in the organizational culture as the issue most relevant to Advest's financial advisors, on-point communication strategies could have been developed and delivered that would have reduced the risk of these employees leaving. Originality/value - This paper highlights the need for risk assessment during the pre-merger phase in order to develop and implement targeted communication plans.

J	Grigg, NS				Grigg, Neil S.			Water sector structure, size, and demographics	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article						hydraulic structures; water supply; water management		Although the water sector (or water industry) is vital to the United States, national reporting systems do not include its economic or employment statistics. These would help policy makers and the public understand the strategic importance of the industry in terms of employment, revenues, and impact. To bridge this gap, the paper explains the water sector's structure, size, and demographic characteristics. The water sector's revenues are about 1% of gross domestic product. The sector includes about 150,000 water, wastewater, and storm water organizations; federal water offices at the national, regional, and state levels belonging to several agencies; some 100 state water agency organizations; and many other local government water organizations. Adding support sector establishments to this list leads to an estimate that some 1,000,000 employees work in the water sector. In spite of trends experienced by the sector, its size will not change much; revenues will be level, although unit costs may rise. The employee count will not increase, but the sector's workforce demographics will shift, and the water industry must address erosion of its knowledge base with loss of employees.

J	Hagen, R; Liddle, J				Hagen, Roulla; Liddle, Joyce			Changing strategic direction for executive development in the public sector Opportunities for top business schools?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public sector organizations; Public administration; Globalization; Management development; Professional education		Purpose - The purpose of this research is to examine the largely ignored executive development needs of the reformed twenty-first century public sector by executive education providers in business schools. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is predominantly conceptual exploring the current debates on the effectiveness of public sector management and the requirements for more relevant management and executive education through a literature review. The antecedents of the current position are explored. Hypotheses are developed about the provision of executive education for the public sector within business schools. In the absence of previous investigations in this field, a preliminary survey is conducted employing the Financial Times top 60 ranked executive education, 2006, to test the hypothesis and underpin more in-depth research. Findings - The findings demonstrate that almost two-thirds of the sample did not provide any executive education to the public sector, and most of the provision on offer was for specialised silos within the sector, or borrowed from existing private sector programmes. There was no support found from the sample for public sector new network governance or leadership challenges discussed in the paper. Findings also supported the view that there is a shortage of evidence-based research for many of the executive programmes that are being offered. Research limitations/implications - This paper is the first to explore the status of the field under investigation and provide a conceptual framework; whilst the preliminary empirical research has been an initial surface fact-finding study to establish the level and size of the problem, this has been achieved. This paper will now underpin a rigorous empirical research programme to explore the subject matter in greater detail. Practical implications - The findings support the hypothesis that executive education providers within business schools are failing to address the management development needs of senior executives in the public sector. The paper concludes that there are huge opportunities being missed by business schools both by their management faculty, to investigate and understand the problems of the sector, and by their executive education centres to co-design and deliver programmes to assist the sector to transform and develop effectively to meet the challenges posed by a more globalized, complex, networked world. The paper invites them to engage. Originality/value - This paper investigates a subject that has been identified by the Academy of Management as important. It requires further research but has hitherto not received much attention from the research community.

A study was conducted to qualitatively explore the role of the Human Resource ( HR) function in the South African IT industry. Semi-structured individual and focus group interviews with professionals in this function highlighted many opportunities for HR to render a more strategic role in an environment where a skills shortage and many related problem areas exist. The implications of these findings are discussed and proposals for redefining the role of HR in the specific industry are offered.

J	Hannagan, T; Lawton, A; Mallory, G				Hannagan, Tim; Lawton, Alan; Mallory, Geoff			Responding to change: the management of further education colleges in England	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic change; Further education; Public administration; England		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine changes in the management of further education (FE) colleges in England following the Further and Higher Education Act (1992) and the removal of colleges from Local Education Authority control. These changes are mapped against developments in the management of public service organisations, more generally, labelled new public management (NPM), and the adoption of "business-like" tools to support management responses to a new environment for colleges. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws upon a national survey of general FE colleges and four case studies, researched in depth through semi-structured interviews and analysis of relevant documents. The research was carried out between 1997 and 2000. The case studies were revisited through recent Inspection reports. Findings - The paper finds that colleges reacted differently to the imperatives of change and that the extent to which the prescriptions of NPM were acted out depended upon a range of factors that were not included in many configurations of NPM. Research limitations/implications - The research was carried out in the 1990s and the original cases were revisited through Inspection reports post 2002. The inspectors had a different agenda than the original researchers and care needs to be taken in utilising the Inspectors' reports. Practical implications - The implementation of a uniform public policy across a diverse and complex sector is not guaranteed to succeed. Policy-makers need to be aware of the "one-size-fits-all" tendency of public policy making. Originality/value - The management of the FE sector is under researched. This paper researches key issues for practitioners following on from education reform and provides empirical evidence for academics of the extent to which NPM reforms take hold on the ground.

J	Hong, CF				Hong, Chao-Fu			Discovering the rare opportunity by strategy based interactive value-focused thinking model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND INTELLIGENT ENGINEERING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Value focused thinking; chance discovery; competitive strategy; business intelligence		In this study, opportunities based on the associative relationships, defined as Interactive Value- Focused Thinking Model (IVFT), were discovered. This system combined opportunities, defined by middle occurring frequency but with high link's entropy, with the associative relationships, which supplied the opportunity map to an analyst to create a meaningful scenario. Initially, the analyst thought that the short wavelength laser diode would be an important technology in the next generation DVD products, so he defined " blu- ray"as the strategic factor. Using KeyGraph and the strategic factor analysis, the IVFT system suggests that Toshiba has strong potential to be the leader in the next generation DVD industry. In addition, two kinds of rare opportunities, defined by low occurring frequency but with high link's entropy, were next discovered using entropy analysis of keywords links: 1. Investor's scenario, supported by the opportunity graph, under video and audio scenario "JVC"was emerged out, which was connected to the most important enterprises and technologies in the associative (opportunity) map. 2. Innovating scenario, constructed by the opportunity graph, in which only the special chemical technologies were connected to "Eternal" for emerging out the scenario of niche market. These experimental results indicate that this model could discover two kinds of opportunity, predictable and rare opportunities, based on both the data driving and the analyst's scenario recognizing the chance.

J	Huang, S; Chen, J; Wu, P				Huang, Shuo; Chen, Jian; Wu, Peng			INVENTORY MANAGEMENT IN A SUPPLY CHAIN WITH UNILATERAL TRANSSHIPMENTS	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING			English	Article						unilateral transshipments; continuous review; inventory control; multi-echelon system		One basic way for a firm to perform a particular task in a supply chain is to form strategic alliances with other companies. The alliances can be formed between suppliers and retailers, or among retailers. In this paper, we analyze a two-echelon, multi-retailer, continuous review inventory system in which coordination among retailers is allowed. The retailers are given the flexibility to transfer their inventory in situations where a retailer is stocked out and at least one of other retailers has surplus inventory, which is called emergency lateral transshipments. In addition, we assume that the transshipments are only allowed in one direction, i.e., we only consider unilateral transshipments. This assumption is reasonable under some conditions, such as the retailers have very different cost parameters. We design a heuristic rule for retailers to decide whether to transfer their stock or not, and provide an approximate technique to evaluate the transfer policy in this system. Finally, a simulation study is conducted to test the validity of this technique, and to analyze the impact of different parameters on the retailers' performances.

Design/methodology/approach - The adopted approach is based on the combination of conclusive feedback research technique and action research. The intention is to elicit background information in its initial phase, formulate an interim solution, which will evolve through users' constant feedbacks into a full-blown desirable system. Findings - Highlights the UAE dates industry existing state of readiness in adopting IS/IT and the extent of optimizing supply-chain management business practices. Research limitations/implications - Transforming organization manual operations to achieve efficiency towards strategic effectiveness is a lengthy process. While quantitative and qualitative evidences suggest the adoption of a certain solution, the benefits yield cannot be realized overnight. Practical implications - This research proposes a paradigm shift in the organization's culture. Adopting supply- chain principles and implementing a strategy to align both business and use of IS/IT will facilitate an elevation for UAE dates factory to be one of the economy contributing industries. Originality/value - This research addresses existing states of readiness to implement IS/IT within the UAE dates factory, proposes supply- chain model customized to UAE dates factory and highlights challenges faced by the factory in implementing the strategic alignment of its business through IS/IT optimization.

J	Jelenc, L				Jelenc, Lara			Testing Validity and Reliability of Classical and Contemporary School of Strategic Management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						classical school of strategic management; contemporary school of strategic management; Croatian large firms; reliability; school of strategic management; validity		School of strategic management is a concept that relates to paradigm, as the common way of perceiving process of strategic management. Sharing the same beliefs, judgments, point of view and values researches form a special way - paradigm of perceiving process of strategic management. The paper is testing two school-classical and contemporary schools of strategic management out of the four schools and analyze their paradigms. This paper is testing validity and reliability of the classical and contemporary schools of strategic management. Validity is tested with content validity and reliability with internal consistency coefficient Cronbach alfa. Only if the results show satisfying level of conformance of both of the tests, constructs of the classical and contemporary school of strategic management can be taken into further statistical analysis (factor analysis) and the conclusion grasped from the data can meet the requirements of the scientific relevance and robustness.

J	Jones, RO				Jones, Richard			An examination of tenant evolution within the UK factory outlet channel	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Retailing; United Kingdom; Out of town stores		Purpose - The research paper examines the commercial evolution of retail tenants within the UK factory outlet sector. The research aims to identify the key characteristics of commercialisation and the resulting strategic positions occupied by tenants. Design/methodology/approach - The paucity of research surrounding the research objectives necessitated exploratory research based on 32 in-depth interviews conducted with factory outlet tenants, managers and owners. Findings - The research presents four tenant segments used to analyse commercial evolution. Although many tenants are initially pushed into the channel to solve a physical stock problem they invariably increase their level of commercialisation as they apply the experience curve, economies of scale and opportunism. Ultimately, the key to commercialisation lies in the ability of a factory outlet tenant to make adjustments to their retail business model, through sales productivities and improved cost ratios. The single biggest adjustment lies in the potential of made for outlet merchandise which secures both product continuity and enhanced margin. Originality/value - The research provides a conceptual framework for evaluating the relevance of current factory outlet leasing and performance management programmes. Practical application of the framework will require a correlation to be established between the stages of commercialisation and actual sales performance across a wider sample of tenants. The finding provide possible stepping stones to further research within the sector, not least the evolutionary pattern of factory outlet tenants across Europe. The findings provoke many questions related to the role of outlets within a tenant's overall multi-channel distribution strategy. The sophistication of certain tenants' outlet business models and the high level of integration across channel of distribution suggest factory outlet centres are becoming increasingly accepted as part of mainstream growth strategies.

Indian automobile sector has also adopted TQM path but it is still a player of little consequence in the global auto market. One of the major reasons for dismal performance of the Indian automobile sector can be attributed to the fact that it has not been able to prioritize and Pelts on the key variables, which are instrumental in enhancing TQM index. For the success of the Indian automobile sector, it is equally important to understand the implications of key variables in two different market scenarios and take policy decisions accordingly. TQM initiatives also fail due to lock of understanding of the complex interactions among different TQM variables. To overcome these limitations causal loop diagram has been developed to provide better insight regarding interactions and policy experimentations using system dynamics methodology has been used to prioritize the key variables in two different market scenarios. These experimentations reveal that the main contributing variables to enhance TQM index are leadership, strategic planning, customer and market focus, and human resource focus in both the market scenarios. However, the contribution of each variable and the priority of variables change in two different market scenarios.	[Khanna, V. K.; Sahay, B.

J	Lee, JF; Wu, MJ				Lee, Jen-Fang; Wu, Ming-Ji			ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES BUILDING THROUGH CMMI: THE CASE OF TAIWAN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING			English	Article						CMMI; Taiwan; software industry; capabilities; competencies		This paper studies the change for capabilities/competencies of Taiwan software firms through physical systems, knowledge and skills, managerial system, and value and norm aspects before and after they introduce CMMI. By conducting qualitative-based multiple case-study approach and using semi-structural questionnaire as the tool, we identified CMMI related organization routines. Grounding on these routines, we integrate capabilities/competencies related literatures and value co-production studies to propose a co-evolution model, which suggest that capabilities/competencies of software companies come from the co-evolution between organizational standard operation procedures (SOPs) and customer projects. The co-evolution model would be useful to supplement the dynamic capabilities theory of firm from the value co-production viewpoint. Further, it is analyzed whether these capabilities can become the strategic assets of the software firms. Finally, we recommend that the introduction of CMMI is not only the behavior for Taiwan software firms to build their competitive advantage without differences, but also to build a high performance mechanism for co-producing value with their customers.

J	Makrigiannakis, G; Soteriades, M				Makrigiannakis, Georgios; Soteriades, Marios			Management Accounting in the Hotel Business: The Case of the Greek Hotel Industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY & TOURISM ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Management accounting; costing systems; decision support; budgets; performance measurement; Greek hotel industry		This article reports on a study investigating Management Accounting (MA) applications and practices in Greek hotels. Relevant bibliography indicates the way in which MA supports management decision-making: Costing systems aim to analyze revenue centers, and are structured according to marginal costing principals. MA makes extensive use of budget and performance measurement techniques to support operational and strategic decisions. In the present study, a sample survey was carried out by means of a structured questionnaire. The findings indicate that Greek hotels make use of MA techniques in all of the above ways, but also reveal a number of differences, such as the application of full costing methods. This in turn has implications for the criteria used to evaluate managers' performance, as well as for the information used in making pricing decisions. Moreover, budget design is more flexible than that used in other fields, while benchmarking is not so popular. The study's findings reveal that hotel size and sales mix structure affect some MA practices, while the use of specific MA methods and techniques determines the emphasis placed on the application of others.

J	Moorer, C				Moorer, Cleamon, Jr.			A University Name Change: Significance of Faculty Involvement	JOURNAL OF MARKETING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						College name changes; university name changes; faculty involvement		The landscape of higher education is more competitive now than ever before. Colleges and universities are changing and refocusing their identity, missions, and strategic visions to better serve students, prospective students, partners, and other external constituencies. As a result, many colleges and universities have changed their name to distinguish and differentiate themselves in this growing and evolving marketplace. This study takes a closer look into the phenomenon of a university strategic name change process and faculty involvement. It addresses the following questions: How much faculty involvement is needed to facilitate a successful university strategic name process? What is the impact of faculty involvement on a university strategic name event? What are the drivers of a university strategic name change? What are the roles of faculty members in fulfilling the desired outcome(s) of university strategic name change events. This paper proposes that faculty involvement is pertinent to the process and outcomes of a strategic university name change. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

Identifying and determining the key processes for quality management systems in the hotel sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						hospitality management; processes; quality system; quality standard; resource-based view; RBV		In response to the need to identify and establish the strategic value of the processes covered by the Quality Standards (ISO 9001, EFQM) this work proposes a methodology that combines the Resource-Based View (RBV) with the 'process-based approach' that enables the key processes and their importance to quality system management to be identified. This methodology is applied to the hotel sector, which allows a comparison to be made with the criteria of the Q Standard of Spanish Tourism Quality and the proposal to be validated. In this respect; three types of processes have been identified: principal, complementary and support processes.

Identification of possible surface waters as drinkable water sources in case of natural disasters in Romania	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						renewable surface waters; drinkable water; resources; natural disasters; Romania		Providing adequate water is critical for survival in the initial stage of a natural disaster. The impact of natural hazards such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, landslides and droughts, frequently results in contaminated potable water sources with direct impact on local population health. Therefore, to save the drinking water supply, alternative sources are needed. In this paper we discuss the possibility of unrestricted use of the renewable surface waters for drinking water supply in case of flood, the most dangerous natural disaster that occurs in Romania every year. The analysis of the relevant parameters (chemical and microbiological) showed that contaminated freshwaters (inland rivers, lakes, the Danube river) or seawaters (the Black sea) could be relevant in case of this natural disaster by applying of an optimised and low-cost process of water purification such as desalination. In conclusion, in areas where rivers and sea exist they Could be an interesting alternative for regional aquifers, which are affected by natural disasters like floods and can become an importance on strategic concepts for risk management.

J	Teck, FC				Teck, Foo Check			OM of manufacturing: exploring futuristic manufacturing perspectives	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT HISTORY			English	Article						Strategic manufacturing; Oriental philosophy; Technology led strategy; India; China		Purpose - Technology is fast transforming how we supply both services and products. With virtual reality technology rapidly becoming available and much user friendlier and affordable than before, the next challenge is to supply not just products but also dreams. The purpose here is to explore the possibilities in manufacturing the dreams of customers. Design/methodology/approach - Instead of literature from psychology, the paper taps on deep Indian philosophy to explore the unconscious. For the unconscious is the source of dreams. The ancient, Indian OM is widely accepted in spiritual circles as the primordial sound of the universe. Using this OM symbol as a metaphor, the paper suggests that deep dimensions of competition - and roots for future excellence - may lie in creating products that are the dreams of customers. Findings - The paper then explores from the ancient Indian conceptualization of dreams to the current practices in supplying products to customers. It finds large corporations are more members of a supply or rather, innovation driven chain. That is despite being in an age of knowledge-driven economy. Perhaps, the chain is too rigid, sequential a word. A better metaphor may be as part of a molecular structure, one that interconnects one organization with several other firms globally. Research limitations/implications - The community of global manufacturers has yet to realize that the key driver behind the customers' relentless pursuit of quality and low prices - and as is argued here, increasingly, their dreams - may lie deeply hidden within the realms of their unconscious. Practical implications - What is emerging is a triangulated polarization in terms of organizing of functions: conceptualization of product in the USA, with services (soft but labor intensive aspects) in India and the hard, implementation and manufacturing as well as production routed to China. The full impact of what is raised in this paper will be realized later as and when global manufacturers seek to conceptualize products not just for the US markets but also for the swelling demand in China and India. Originality/value - With the rapid rise of both Indian and Chinese economies with enormous impact on global management, it is essential for scholars to integrate ancient philosophy. Given the tremendous pressures to meet demand of the future, interactions-oriented, internet-based customers, manufacturing organizations may have to design newer, technology-enabling forms for the organizing of the dreams of customers.

J	Wagner, HT; Weitzel, T				Wagner, Heinz-Theo; Weitzel, Tim			Towards an IT production function Understanding routines as fundamental for IT value creation	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication technologies; Resources; Strategic alignment; Value added		Purpose - The goal of this paper is to identify core IT value drivers in firms and to model them as an IT production function to help disclose and measure the IT value creation process and to guide managers in seeking adequate ways of employing the IT resource. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a critical review of the literature on the resource-based view, an IT value framework based on the constructs IT capability, resource, and routine is developed and then formalized as an IT production function. Findings - Organizational routines are decisive for turning firm resources into an IT capability and in turn into better business process performance. Shows how the IT value creation process in general and routines in particular can be measured and formalized. Practical implications - As the interaction between IT and business units is crucial for IT value generation, organizational routines provide for important knowledge flows that turn firm resources into value generating capabilities. Proposes a concrete method to measure and evaluate these routines and thereby contribute to making the IT resource controllable. Originality/value - The main contribution is the identification and analytical formalization of the role of routines for IT value creation. Shows how insights from the resource-based view, microeconomic theory (Cobb-Douglas/CES production function), and Granovetter's strength of ties argument can be used to describe, measure, and guide IT value creation and to develop an IT production function.

J	Zhang, H; Lin, ZX; Hu, XR				Zhang, Han; Lin, Zhangxi; Hu, Xiaorui			The effectiveness of the Escrow model: An experimental framework for dynamic online environments	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						online escrow service; online auction; fraud; perceived risk; discrete-event driven simulation; Monte Carlo approach	RISK; REPUTATION; AUCTIONS; MARKETS; TRUST	This article investigates the mechanism of an online escrow service (OES) in online consumer-to-consumer (C2C) auctions. We develop a discrete-event driven simulation model for the dynamics of an OES adoption in electronic markets that involves four types of agents: the strategic trader, the moral trader, the OES provider, and the law-enforcement agent. By applying the Monte Carlo method in computer-based simulations, we demonstrate that the OES business model can effectively block fraud attempts and promote security in online C2C auction markets. However, our findings reveal that the prevailing OES fee rates are not necessarily set at the profit maximization level. Meanwhile, the simulation results show that the legal mechanisms in electronic markets directly impact the profit of escrow services.

A wide variety of methods are available that intend to service this need, such as discounted cash-flow, real options, portfolio methods, roadmapping, etc. However, little evidence exists on who applies these techniques and how they are used in practice. This paper will evaluate the techniques from literature and compare the results with cases from the Aerospace industry. The paper will show that there are two distinct perspectives that can be taken when looking at the valuation process and these perspectives change in the course of the technology's life cycle.

EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND RIGHTS JOURNAL			English	Article						employee practices; human resource management; social responsibility; strategic human resource management; Wegmans		In 2005, Wegmans Food Markets Inc., the family-owned supermarket chain, was awarded the number one spot on the Fortune "100 Best Companies To Work For." Wegmans' recognition illustrates an exemplary case of strategic human resource management embedded in an overall culture of social responsibility, amidst a highly competitive and low margin industry. We detail Wegmans' human resource practices and its overall stakeholder orientation, arguing that the treatment of employees as strategic assets constitutes an effective approach to social responsibility. In other words, strategic human resource management can help organizations reconcile the often cited conflict between profits and principles. We therefore begin with an overview of the contemporary supermarket industry, provide a brief history of Wegmans, and showcase the supermarket chain's human resource practices. In closing, we discuss Wegmans' stakeholder orientation and comment on the divide between strategic human resource management and social responsibility research.

J	Glavovic, BC				Glavovic, B. C.			Lessons learned from south Africa's coastal policy experience	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						sustainable coastal development; coastal livelihoods; conflict resolution		This is the third in a series of articles exploring South Africa's new approach to coastal management. Based on a critical analysis of South Africa's coastal policy experience, it presents a generic set of lessons for coastal management. These lessons are grouped into four themes consistent with the main objectives of the policy formulation process: (i) promote meaningful public: participation; (ii) improve knowledge and understanding by promoting scientific integrity; (iii) advance integrated coastal management; and (iv) build a practical foundation. These lessons are presented as strategic imperatives to inform and where appropriate guide future coastal management efforts. Whilst these lessons are directly relevant to future coastal management efforts in South Africa, they are likely to be of more general interest and relevance to those seeking to promote sustainable coastal development. The South African experience reveals, however, that this pursuit is a 'field of struggle' that must be forged across persistent power imbalances, fractured social relationships and strong vested interests.

J	Yee, CL; Tan, KH; Platts, KW				Yee, C. L.; Tan, K. H.; Platts, K. W.			Managing 'downstream' supply network: A process and tool	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						downstream supply network; strategy charting; performance measurement	CHAIN MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; LINKAGES; FIRMS	A review of literature shows that little is available to assist managers to manage the 'downstream' end of a supply network involving manufacturers, dealers, and end-users. The interaction of important strategic factors in this respect is vital to companies but is not well understood by managers. This research proposes a process and tool, i.e. supply network analysis process (SNAP) to assist managers in addressing this issue. SNAP enables managers to visualise the inter-plays of downstream supply network strategic decisions, and to monitor network performance. SNAP was developed through a series of case studies in one specific region. Research was carried out in one industry sector, a 'downstream' supply network that consists of a number of manufacturers, dealers, and end-users. Semi-structured interviews and site visits were used to explore and understand the interaction of network decisions. The process discovered many unique interactive relationships among manufacturers, dealers, and end-users. This paper describes the development of SNAP, and explains its functions in a longitudinal case study. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this research to academics and industrialists. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recognised as a leading participant in the geographic information industry, within which it is forging partnerships with key private sector companies, the organisation has enthusiastically grasped e-business as an all-embracing phenomenon and implemented a new strategy that transformed the way it did business. Drawing on longitudinal data gathered over a period of four years, this article explores the processes of strategic and organisational transformation engendered by e-business implementation in this organisation and discusses the successful elements, as well as some of the challenges to its change efforts.

J	Copeland, L				Copeland, Lynn			There Be Dragons ... Learning Management and Library Systems in Canada	IFLA JOURNAL-INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS			English	Article						research libraries; library instruction; online library services; e-learning; learning management systems		The importance of library resources and services to academic success is demonstrable. While current Learning Management Systems (LMS) do not support their integration, the signs are positive that this will change. A wide variety of LMSs are used at Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Canada, compounding the problem. SFU Library has achieved considerable success in technology, having developed reSearcher for Western Canadian university libraries; maintaining active digitization, institutional repository and e-journal support programmes; and supporting a very strong e-collection. SFU Library has a very active on-campus course-based instruction programme; extending that programme to the LMS environment has been challenging and, at times, frustrating. Through technology, strategic activity and active involvement in online pedagogical initiatives, some success has been achieved.

J	Mandal, P				Mandal, Purnendu			Behavioral Factors and Information Technology Infrastructure Considerations in Strategic Alliance Development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						behavioral factors; information systems management; organizational culture; strategic alliance		Since behavioral and cultural factors play a major role in strategic alliances between partners, IT managers must understand the intricacies involved in the development of resultant IT infrastructure in satisfying both business requirements and cultural fit of the aligned partnering units. This paper first highlights the IT-related issues and cultural issues which are important in the process of developing a strategic alliance between partners. Then, a case study involving a major telecommunications organization and several retail electricity organizations is presented to illustrate the IT requirements and human-related considerations. The analysis focuses on the requirements of pre-strategic alliance phase of the negotiation process.

J	Sozanski, T				Sozanski, Tadeusz			On the core of characteristic function games associated with exchange networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Game Theory and Mathematical Economics	SEP 06-10, 2004	Warsaw, POLAND	Stefan Banach Int Math Ctr		exchange network; game theory; game in characteristic function form; assignment game; core; graph theory; matching	POWER	An exchange network is a social system in which the actors gain valued resources from bilateral transactions, but an opportunity to negotiate a deal is given only to those pairs of actors whose positions are tied with each other in a fixed communication network. A transaction consists in a mutually agreed-on division of a resource pool assigned to a network line. An additional constraint imposed on such a network restricts the range of transaction sets which may happen in a single negotiation round to those consistent with a given "exchange regime." Under the one-exchange regime every actor is permitted to make no more than one deal per round. Bienenstock and Bonacich [Bienenstock, E.J., Bonacich, P., 1992. The core as a solution to exclusionary networks. Social Networks 14, 231-243] proposed to represent a one-exchange network with an n-person game in characteristic function form. The aim of this paper is to develop a mathematical theory of games associated with homogenous one-exchange networks (network homogeneity means that all lines are assigned resource pools of the same size). The focus is on the core, the type of solution considered most important in game theory. In particular, all earlier results obtained by Bonacich are re-examined and there is given a new graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of nonempty core for the game representing a homogenous one-exchange network.

The inclusion of sustainable drainage systems in flood management in the post-industrial city: A case study of Glasgow	SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						sustainable drainage systems; flooding; basin management; urban regeneration; Glasgow	SCOTLAND	The management of urban stormwater and flooding is challenging, particularly within older, post-industrial urban environments where infrastructure, housing and businesses already operate. The urban environment constrains opportunities for the development and integration of new approaches to drainage management, particularly the use of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). These issues are investigated through a case study of Glasgow. The northeast of the city suffered significant urban flooding in July 2002 following an intense convective summer storm. This event overloaded the urban drainage system, which was heavily integrated and led to the back flow of foul water into streets and homes. This study examines the response to this event and the construction of an integrated drainage management plan for the city, the Glasgow Strategic Drainage Plan (GSDP), which includes greater use of SuDS in tackling the city's capacity problems. Reflecting on the interdisciplinary nature of urban drainage management, this study adopts a social science method, undertaking semi-structured interviews with key actors involved in producing the GSDP.

UNDERSTANDING HOW RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES AFFECT PERFORMANCE: ACTIVELY APPLYING THE RESOURCE-BASED VIEW IN THE CLASSROOM	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						strategic management education; experiential exercise; resourcebased view; VRIO framework		The resource-based view is a strategic framework for understanding why some firms outperform others. Its importance is reflected in its wide inclusion in strategy texts as a tool for assessing a firm's internal strengths and weaknesses. This article outlines an experiential exercise that demonstrates how different bundles of resources and capabilities may explain differences in value created across firms. The primary benefit of this in-class exercise is that students actively apply Barney's VRIO (valuable, rare, inimitable, and organized) framework to understand why their team won or lost. The debrief can also focus on issues such as the impact of imitability on sustainability, why strategies emerge, and elements of a good strategy. Preliminary data from 18 undergraduate and graduate sections indicates that learning objectives have been consistently met.

J	Kabasakal, H; Asugman, G; Develioglu, K				Kabasakal, H; Asugman, G; Develioglu, K			The role of employee preferences and organizational culture in explaining e-commerce orientations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-communication; e-commerce; high vs. low context culture; internationalization; technology	SELF-EFFICACY; ELECTRONIC COMMERCE; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; INTERNET; MANAGERS; MEDIA; TASK; OPPORTUNITIES; BUSINESSES	Culture has always been a cornerstone variable in the study of international business subjects. Several authors have dealt with the concept of culture and its dimensions. Among these Hall's (1981/1976) proposal of high- versus low-context cultures still stands as an important subject matter to be explored. This study is an attempt to explore the significance of high- versus low-context orientation and its implications for communications. Further, strategic orientation of the firm in terms of e-commerce adoption is explored within the framework of high- versus low-context organizational cultures and the internationalization and technological orientation level of the firm. A survey was conducted with 525 employees and managers working in financial services and textile manufacturing firms. Results supported the hypotheses that high-versus low-context values and perceptual and demographic characteristics of employees influence attitudes towards e-communication. Organizational culture regarding high- versus low-context practices, firm's internationalization and technological orientation levels influence the e-cornmerce adoption at a strategic level.

J	Wincent, J; Westerberg, M				Wincent, Joakim; Westerberg, Mats			Resource contributions from entrepreneurial firms in strategic SME networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION			English	Article						strategic SME network; entrepreneurship; resource contributions		This research uses social exchange theory to explore direct and contingent relationships between a firm's degree of entrepreneurship and its resource contributions to the strategic network in which it operates. The empirical study is based on two strategic multi-partner SME, networks in which all 54 firms participated. The results show a higher level of entrepreneurship to be associated with a higher degree of resource contributions to other firms in the strategic SME network, regardless of firm size. However, higher resource contributions to the strategic SME, network entity were only supplied when the entrepreneurial firm was large. Suggestions for further research are developed in detail.

J	Baker, L				Baker, Leanne			'The Trouble with Today's Young Ones ...' : A Case Study of One Club's Failed Attempt at Attracting the Youth Market	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Clubs; youth market; marketing; strategic management; Seven-S Framework		This article examines the challenges for Australian clubs in attracting and keeping the younger demographic. Using a case study approach written by a participant observer, and Waterman, Peters, and Phillips' Seven-S Framework, the issues and difficulties faced by one NSW coastal club are examined as they trialled two "youth market" specific products aimed at the under-18 segment. After less than 12 months, both products were cancelled and a decision was made by the board of directors to no longer target the "difficult" youth market. In examining the challenges faced by this club, it was found that the "troublesome youth" became a convenient scapegoat for the real contributors to the under-18's product failures. This article found that, while the initial strategy to target the youth market was sound, there was a lack of support from the other internal factors of structure, systems, skills, style, staff, and superordinate goals that contributed to the cancellation and thus failure of these youth-oriented products. It is useful to examine these failures from a strategic viewpoint as a means for other clubs to become more familiar with the pitfalls of targeting the youth market from the outset, instead of through the lens of hindsight.

J	Biong, H; Silkoset, R				Biong, Harald; Silkoset, Ragnhild			Extendedness as a relationship governance mechanism for securing cooperation in marketing relationships	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING			English	Article						governance mechanism; extendedness; cooperation; commodities; marketing relationships	BUYER-SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS; SELLER RELATIONSHIPS; TRANSACTION COST; STRATEGIC ALLIANCE; TRUST; DEPENDENCE; CHANNELS; DETERMINANTS; INFORMATION; PRICE	Traditionally, buyers encourage fierce price competition among suppliers. Such price competition has been the dominating strategy for purchase of commodities in business markets. Undoubtedly, this practice has been effective in many cases. Unfortunately, transactional purchasing practices could have negative effects because they demotivate suppliers to engage in value creating activities and incur substantial transaction costs. In contrast to competition, buyer-seller cooperation can also bring prices and total costs down. One problem of cooperation is that the parties can realize individual gains by defection while the other continues to cooperate. This article examines how industrial buyers of a commodity can overcome this problem and realize cost savings and low prices by motivating the supplier to cooperate by offering an extended time frame for purchases. The authors test the research hypotheses in a sample of 347 industrial buyers of electricity. The empirical tests provide general support for their predictions.

J	Collier, M				Collier, Mel			Strategic change in higher education libraries with the advent of the digital library during the fourth decade of Program	PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						digital libraries; management strategy; strategic change; business planning; publishing; higher education		Purpose - This paper sets out to review how the business of libraries in higher education has changed with the impact of the digital library during the latest decade of Program, in which the content of the journal swung decisively from being primarily about library management systems to primarily being about digital library issues. Design/methodology/approach - An article is taken which typifies the changing emphasis of Program and then the systemic changes underway in libraries are looked at more broadly, placing the digital library in its context of scholarly publishing, higher education policy and user behaviour. Findings - The business of libraries is changing, primarily as a result of change in the scholarly publishing industry. Research limitations/implications - This is a review article based on a literature review and operational observations. Originality/value - The observations build on the author's original work on business planning for digital libraries, and are based on experience of library and information services management in The Netherlands, Belgium and Great Britain.

J	Dewit, G; Leahy, D				Dewit, Gerda; Leahy, Dermot			Investment timing under uncertainty in oligopoly: Symmetry or leadership?	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS			English	Article						Uncertainty; Flexibility; Strategic commitment		This paper examines firms' investment-timing decisions in an oligopolistic set-up. Facing demand uncertainty, firms decide whether to invest early or wait until uncertainty has been resolved. We show that the precise form that investment commitment takes matters for the investment-timing outcomes that emerge. When firms can commit immediately to the final investment level, investment leadership may occur and early investment is referred to as being primarily "aggressive". By contrast, the presence of a time lag between when and how much firms invest yields symmetric investment-timing outcomes only; we argue that early investment is mainly "defensive" in that case.

J	Divita, L; Cassill, N; Ludwig, D				Divita, Lorynn; Cassill, Nancy; Ludwig, David			Value and fairness in US textile industry partnerships	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						United States of America; Textile industry; Partnership; Economic value analysis; Social values	ADOPTION; TRUST; MODEL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a demographic profile and to examine the types of value (social and economic) and fairness received from strategic partnerships between members of the US textile industry with their US suppliers and vendors. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a theoretical Relationship Retention Model by Gassenheimer and Houston and incorporating Transactional Cost Analysis, social exchange theory and distributive justice as theoretical frameworks, a quantitative instrument measured partnership economic value, social value and fairness. Standard least squares regression analysis combined with bootstrap analysis was used in data analysis. Findings - Results indicated that a significant relationship (p > 0: 0001) existed between social value and fairness. These findings refute the theoretical model, which shows both economic value and social value to be equally important to a successful partnership. Research limitations/implications - Limitations arose from adapting a theoretical model to a testable path model, a limited number of partnerships and that this survey did not involve time-series or longitudinal research methods. Future research may include dyadic research, a longitudinal study or the scope of the survey may be broadened to the global level. Practical implications - Industry can use study findings to evaluate their own strategic partnerships, while results may be taught in academia as part of a strategic planning or management course or used as a basis for further research. Originality/value - This study fills a void in current research literature by: using an empirical approach to analyze strategic partnerships in the US textile industry, and testing a previously untried theoretical model.

Another reason is the assumption that the choice of cooperation structure will lead to higher flexibility and lower production-risk exposure. More specifically, the conditions behind the choice between venture and alliance for global industrial production are examined in order to know how to keep the flexibility to change the cooperation structure when the business environment conditions change. A theoretical scheme is developed and the key findings are illustrated with three examples from global production in the car and truck industry and in the telecom industry: Volvo/Renault, Volvo/Mitsubishi and Sony/Ericsson.

J	Eisler, G; Tan, J; Sheps, S				Eisler, George; Tan, Joseph; Sheps, Samuel			A Metric for Healthcare Technology Managment (HCTM): E-Surveying Key Executives and Administrators of Canadian Teaching Hospitals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND INFORMATICS			English	Article						abstraction ladder; healthcare technology; hospital performance; literature content analysis; management of technology; medical management of technology; metric development; strategic resource management; technology assessment		Among key drivers of healthcare reform in Canadian society are the challenges faced by the rapid rate of technological change and its impact on organizational performance in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and innovation in business and operational processes. However, despite the noted significance of the impact of technological change on healthcare organizations, the challenge of healthcare technology management (HCTM) has received only scattered and marginal attention in the technology management (TM) literature. The lack of formalization in HCTM construct, attributes, and measures motivated an empirical study to develop a metric for HCTM. This metric was then used to assess HCTM practices in teaching hospitals across Canada. The project began with an analysis of developments to date in the fields of Management of Technology and Management of Medical Technology. An extensive literature content analysis generated a set of definitions and attributes of the conceptual TM construct, which was eventually extended to HCTM. A measuring instrument was developed through a formal design process involving expert panel review, pilot testing, instrument refinement, and field-testing to extract and measure HCTM performance indicators. Administration of this metric with the help of the Association of Canadian Academic Health Organizations via a Web-based survey of senior healthcare administrators provided insights into the HCTM status of Canadian teaching hospitals and its relationship with organizational performance.

J	Gomez, PY; Moore, R				Gomez, Pierre-Yves; Moore, Rickie			From Strategy of Religions to Religion of Strategy: Comments on Miller's "Competitive Strategies of Religious Organizations"	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SPIRITUALITY & RELIGION			English	Article						Strategic Management View; Religious Organizations; Transposition; Prerequisites; Metaphor; Rhetoric		In a recent article, Miller (2002) employed strategic management tools (SMT) to explain the competition amongst religious organizations as well as their evolution. Intrigued by the novelty of the approach, were sought to analyze the use of the SMT in this situation. Based on our analysis, we challenge the appropriateness of the transposition, and argue that beyond the novelty and the peculiarity of the topic, the pre-requisites for defining religious organizations as being firm-like and competition amongst them as being market-like have not been satisfied. Consequently, we advocate that SMT are limited in describing religious organizations' strategies. Finally, we demonstrate that Miller's essay is metaphorical and we identify how the metaphorical use of strategic management thought can be misleading.

The USA and some other countries have more mature venture capital sector dominated by investments in high technology. However, this is not the case in most other countries. Surprisingly, this is the case in countries with a strong and highly developed economy such as Germany, as well as in smaller Countries with a booming high technology sector such as Israel. In both countries, little empirical work has been done to gain insights on how the venture capital industry works. By using the same research methodology as in prior US Studies, this paper identifies different investment behaviours of German and Israeli venture capitalists prior to the investment decision and as well as their involvement in the strategy of the portfolio firm.

J	Hong, P; Noh, J; Hwang, W				Hong, Paul; Noh, Jungbae; Hwang, Woosang			Global supply chain strategy: a Chinese market perspective	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supply chain management; Globalization; China	PERFORMANCE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop an understanding of changing business control patterns that may be critical for firms, in order to manage effective enterprise information infrastructures in and through the Chinese market. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a typology that shows four types of Chinese market penetration and development, in terms of level of foreign management control and level of foreign ownership control. The model is illustrated through case examples of US, Korean, and Chinese firms. Findings - The paper shows that sustainable design and management of enterprise information infrastructures require continuous awareness of changes in corporate management and ownership control. Research limitations/implications - The transition paths among the four different types of global operations provide a rich basis for further theory development in the areas of the global supply chain practices beyond the Chinese market. Future research is needed to identify key variables that define the level of management and ownership control. Practical implications - The typology and transitions paths presented in this paper may be a valuable road-map for firms that are considering the Chinese market. In the course of implementing global supply chain strategies, foreign firms operating in China face complex business challenges, including multiple performance requirements, environmental regulations and cultural differences. In designing and managing effective enterprise information infrastructures, firms need to be conscious of both internal and external changes related to their management and ownership control. An understanding of changing business control patterns is critical if firms are to sustain effective enterprise information infrastructures in and through the Chinese market. Originality/value - China is a potential global supply chain base. Global firms must consider carefully the extent of foreign management and ownership control with which they enter the Chinese market. These two dimensions are useful in analyzing the behavior and strategic options of global firms in this market.

J	Jones, G				Jones, Glyn			Why public sector reform does not transform A processual explanation of the 1989-1997 French experience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public sector reform; Public administration; France		Purpose - The paper proposes to look at the transformational strategies undertaken in relation to the 1989-1997 French administrative reform process and to examine their impact on the ministerial field services through using Burgelman's "model of the interaction of strategic behaviour, corporate context and the concept of strategy". Design/methodology/approach - Empirical research was carried out in a field service of the French Education Ministry with the presentation of the findings being structured around Burgelman's criteria for autonomous strategic behaviour. These criteria-operational slack, project champion, circumvention of the structural context and organisational champion-provided a mechanism to assess whether operational and institutional factors at field service level impeded or facilitated moves towards a more managerial logic of appropriateness as envisaged by the reform programmes during this period. Findings - The explanatory insights of Burgelman's model show how the resilience of traditional institutional features minimised the transformational impact of the reforms. Research limitations/implications - Burgelman's model is able to facilitate a greater understanding of the 1989-1997 French administrative reform process through identifying those conditions conducive to micro-organisational actors exercising greater autonomy in their operational management. In this way, the organisational dynamics that constrained the transformational impact of the reforms could be highlighted and an explanation provided of why the respective reform programmes had minimal effect at field service level. Originality/value - The paper will be of relevance to those interested in the effect of the new public management agenda on national administrations in Europe and the applicability of private sector models in affording explanatory insights into such processes of change.

J	Kirk, AK				Kirk, Andrea			Employee Assistance Program Adoption in Australia: Strategic Human Resource Management or 'Knee-Jerk' Solutions?	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH			English	Article						Employee assistance; program adoption; strategic human resource management		Employee Assistance Programs have been enthusiastically adopted by Australian organizations, although generally in the absence of clearly identified corporate needs. To date EAP adoption research has relied on retrospective accounts that include rationales such as the provision of a socially responsible service to employees. Such rationales, which are biased by knowledge of the EAPs' outcomes, may not accurately reflect the strategic and operational influences behind an organization's decision to adopt an EAP. Using semi-structured interviews this study demonstrated the existence of different thematic patterns between prospective and retrospective rationales for EAP adoption in Australia, and developed a 2-stage (adoption and continued use) model of organizational rationales for the use of EAPs. Developing strategically integrated rationales for EAP adoption will enable more effective and efficient organizational use of these services. (C) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Mohan, AV; Krishnaswamy, KN				Mohan, Avvari V.; Krishnaswamy, K. N.			Marketing programmes across different phases of the product life cycle An explorative study in the Indian machine building sector	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Product life cycle; Marketing planning; Industrial marketing; India; Machining centres; Discriminators		Purpose - This paper seeks to report the findings of a survey aimed at understanding the marketing programmes (MP) for industrial products in different phases of the product life cycle (PLC). Design/methodology/approach - The study is an exploratory one, conducted in a sample of 63 Indian organisations manufacturing general- purpose machinery. Data pertaining to a total of 191 product lines in four phases of the PLC (42 in introduction, 59 in growth, 53 in maturity and 37 in decline phase) were collected using a specially developed questionnaire. Findings - The results of the descriptive analysis revealed that the marketing programme variables emphasised in different PLC were different. In the Introduction phase decisions about product attributes, physical performance of the product, direct mail advertising, quality improvements and differentiation by design were emphasized. In Growth phase: feature additions, improvements in product styling, quality and service and market segmentation. In maturity and decline phases re- tailoring products, sales force efforts were some of the marketing variables emphasised. The results support the views in literature about MP being different in different phases of the PLC. Based on a discriminant analysis, marketing variables that discriminate the different phases of the PLC were also obtained. Research limitations/implications - The study is done in the machine-building industry in one country (India) - this limits the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - The results can be useful to marketing managers to anticipate the type of strategic MP in future and this in turn can help in planning activities of other management functions like manufacturing and R& D. Originality/value - This study adds to the body of literature, which proposes to plan marketing and business strategies differently at the different PLC phases.

J	Noonan, J; Wallace, M				Noonan, John; Wallace, Michael			Improved optimisation through advanced relationship planning	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						contracts; strategic manufacturing; competitors; channel relationships; supply chain management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for advanced relationship planning between a contract manufacturer and the other key players within the supply chain. In doing so it allows the contract manufacturer to achieve improved optimisation through better insight into current and future supply chain activity. Design/methodology/approach - The research commences with a literature review that synthesises across total quality management (TQM), customer focus and contemporary business excellence to create a framework specific to contract manufacturing. The major elements were verified by surveys. Applicability and exploitability was validated using action research. Findings - The paper confirms that horizontal alliances in either collaborative or cooperative form are in their infancy as regards contract manufacturing. The framework presented makes it possible for contract manufacturers to identify, evaluate and form relationships with competitors and complementor companies towards understanding the interdependence between all supply chain players. Research limitations/implications - Further refinements are possible and could include the determination of formal avenues for relationship development and guidance while operating within supply chains at different levels of development. Practical implications - Understanding how supply players interact in the field of contract manufacturing will assist in determining the influence of cooperation and competition or a mixture of both. The framework presented will provide direction in unravelling the intricacies of the connections and therefore provide the contract manufacturer with a valuable tool for relationship planning. Originality/value - The Advanced Relationship Planning Framework described offers a unique supply management approach from the supplier of contract manufacture viewpoint that synthesises across the TQM, Customer focus and business excellence.

Occurrence and severity of the weeds Anthriscus caucalis and Torilis nodosa in pyrethrum	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							SEED	Pyrethrum [Tanacetum cinerariifolium (Trevis.) Sch. Bip.] is a short-lived, perennial horticultural crop grown for the production of pyrethrins. Weed management in pyrethrum is heavily reliant on chemical use and has unintentionally selected for a range of species. One of the major concerns to the pyrethrum industry is the presence of Apiaceae species, Anthriscus caucalis M. Bieb and Torilis nodosa (L.) Gaertn. Increased occurrence and severity of infestation of these species in pyrethrum is a threat to the industry through reduced crop yields and increased costs for their control. To determine the severity of this threat, pyrethrum crops were surveyed for the presence and level of infestation of A. caucalis and T. nodosa over 2 years. More than 30% of all pyrethrum crops had either 1 or both species present, with A. caucalis the more prevalent of the 2 species. Although the level of infestation was generally low, 23 pyrethrum crops had a severe or very severe infestation of the species in 2001. The severity of infestation was generally low, although older crops were found to have a higher level of infestation than newly established crops. All pyrethrum crops, which had undergone 4 annual harvests, were found to have Apiaceae weeds present.

J	Rohracher, H				Rohracher, Harald			Sustainability as a matter of social context: information technologies and the environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						energy efficiency; information technologies; social studies of technology; smart homes; users of technology; sustainability		The paper focuses on the potential of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to improve the sustainability of residential buildings. While ICT can contribute to improving building energy efficiency (e.g., energy management systems) there are also plausible scenarios of an increasing energy demand triggered by ICT use. The main argument of this paper is that harnessing the sustainability potentials of ICT in buildings is largely a matter of social and institutional embedding and is not determined by the characteristics of this technology. The paper argues that the strategic management of technological change towards sustainability means providing sufficient scope for a co-evolution of configurations of technology, services and patterns of usage by allowing users and designers to interact at the early stage of product development. Examples for the organisation of such a process are drawn from a research project in Austria.

Meeting Business Goals and Managing Office Bandwidth: A Predictive Model for Organizational Change	JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational change; change strategy; change management; employee capacity; managing impact; organizational health		While it is recognized that implementing organizational changes impacts both employee and organizational health, there is a lack of research that utilizes these known impacts to empirically build functional models that are predictive of future change event outcomes. Although diagnostic tools are available to businesses to guesstimate the impact of large-scale corporate changes, these tools are not designed for assessing impact rapidly, nor are these designed to effectively assess the impact of concurrent changes. Additionally, a clear link between the issues identified by the diagnostic tool and what occurs when the change is rolled out cannot be made. The purpose of this work was to build a predictive model of organizational change impact that incorporates the achievement of strategic business goals. Prior knowledge of change-related impacts is of particular importance when a change or multiple changes must occur and must be implemented rapidly. By building a predictive tool that eliminates the need to undergo lengthy evaluations of the viability of each individual change, the organization can adapt the business at the pace of market demand without severely disrupting its operational performance. A procedure was developed to prioritize initiatives based upon alignment with corporate strategy and a scientific predictive model was constructed that quantitatively predicts the impact of change initiatives.

J	Tzelepis, D; Skuras, D				Tzelepis, Dimitris; Skuras, Dimitris			Strategic performance measurement and the use of capital subsidies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic planning; Corporate strategy; Research		Purpose - This paper seeks to show that capital subsidies are used as instruments of long-term corporate strategy. Previous research indicates that capital subsidies do not improve firm performance, as this is reflected by measures of productivity growth or by financial measures of profitability and improved capital structure. Design/methodology/approach - The paper shows that a large, publicly available database of firms in the Greek food and beverages, covering a significant time span, is used to evaluate the effects of capital subsidies on strategic performance. Strategic performance is reflected by three novel indicators capturing a firm's orientation towards market power and leadership. Findings - The paper finds that capital subsidies have a positive impact on firms' long-term strategic orientations such as the firms' net market growth and the optimal scale of operation. The provision of capital subsidies assists firms to overcome the cost disadvantages coming from operation at a sub-optimal scale of output and fixed capital, and increase their net market share. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows that more measures of long-term strategic corporate performance should be employed in order to provide more research evidence that is required to detail the exact impacts of capital subsidies on corporate strategy. Practical implications - The paper shows that the capital subsidies have an impact on strategic performance and thus their provision should be the outcome of careful design from the point of view of both the individual manager and the policy authorities. Originality/value - In this paper three new indicators of a firm's strategic orientation are employed and provide the first empirical evidence of the impacts of capital subsidies on corporate strategy.

J	Volberda, HW; Verwaal, E; van der Weerdt, N				Volberda, Henk W.; Verwaal, Ernst; van der Weerdt, Niels			Ownership structure, organisational flexibility and store performance in retail chains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						business environment; organisational flexibility; ownership structure; retail chains; store performance		Drawing on agency and flexible capability perspectives, the authors develop a theoretical framework explaining the impact of ownership structure on organisational flexibility and store performance in retail chains. The researchers argue that franchised stores attract more entrepreneurial managers with more flexible capabilities and they have a stronger incentive to align their flexible capabilities with the demands of the business environment. A sample of 105 franchised and company-owned stores of an optical retail chain is used to test the hypotheses. Furthermore, the study found strong support for the hypotheses that, 'Franchised stores have a higher structural flexibility than company-owned stores', but only weak support for operational and strategic flexible capabilities. Furthermore, in line with the study's theoretical framework, it has been found that in a highly turbulent business environment, franchised stores perform better than company-owned stores. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for theory development and management of ownership structures in retail chains.

First the uncertainty factors embedded in a supply system were assumed to be unreliable server with or without unreliable repairman. The market demand may be non-stationary random process. Steady state performance measures under different uncertainty scenarios were investigated by using an algorithmic procedure to solve the underlying quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process. The optimal resource design of the supply systems under various uncertainty constraints was then solved as the trade-off among costs of inventory holding, customer waiting, server repair and normal operation. Numerical studies of the proposed models investigated the impact of uncertainties on the performance of a multi-echelon supply system under a make-to-order (MTO) supply policy. The results are satisfactory and provide managerial insights on strategic supply decision.

Specifically, the e-finance model is comprised of four components: 1 digital wealth creation 2 digital wealth collection 3 digital wealth management 4 digital wealth protection. The four components constitute the Create-Collect-Manage-Protect (CCMP) model. Extensions of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) with CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and web services are presented to demonstrate the value-added implications of a networked approach to business digitisation. The e-finance model offers a new view to broaden the present understanding of e-finance from the technology perspective and shapes the basis for strategic decision making.

J	Lim, GC; Lee, H; Kim, T				Lim, GC; Lee, H; Kim, T			Formulating business strategies from a stakeholder's perspective: Korean healthcare it business cases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						business performance; business strategies; formulation methodology; healthcare; medical EDI business; stakeholder theory; strategy evaluation	CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; MEDIATION; CONFLICT; SALIENCE; FIRM	The management of competing stakeholders has emerged as an important topic for formulating business strategies. This is especially the case in the complicated business environment like the healthcare IT (Information Technology) industries. This paper proposes a methodology to formulate business strategies based on stakeholders' demands. Our methodology begins with the understanding of stakeholders' demands. This understanding is particularly useful for businesses with conflicting stakeholders. Our methodology consists of four phases: current business analysis, strategy development, strategy evaluation, and strategy implementation. Power, legitimacy, urgency, interdependence, cooperation, and conflict are used as stakeholders related variables. Strategic alternatives are derived on the basis of stakeholders' demands. Resolution, replacement, integration, reaggregation, and balance guidelines are employed for this derivation. Strategic alternatives are then evaluated according to a business social performance index. In order to demonstrate the practical usefulness of our methodology, three business cases for the Korean healthcare IT industry are illustrated. The case results imply that our methodology is useful for strategy formulation, especially in the case of competing business stakeholders.

J	Moedritscher, G; Mussnig, W				Moedritscher, Gernot; Mussnig, Werner			EVALUATING THE LONG-TERM BENEFIT OF CRM-SYSTEMS: A COST-ORIENTED APPROACH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Customer lifetime value; customer relationship management; dynamic evaluation	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; LOYALTY; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT	Since the late 1990s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) has become a buzzword especially among business practitioners and consultants. Companies have invested or are planning to invest huge amounts to implement CRM strategies, tools and infrastructure in order to win the battle in the increasingly competitive economy. However, many executives are struggling to determine how their enterprises will balance the business value of CRM against its costs to determine CRM return on investment. Our model presented in this paper allows an adequate feasible, theoretically established prospective evaluation for the contribution of a CRM-investment to the value of the firm under cost aspects. The premise for the application of this model is that strategic concepts, a fully developed cost accounting system as well as information on the part of the market are available. However, at the present in companies it is still not common to use such integrated and dynamic models. But an essential barrier of the implementation is the mindset of the management, which is stamped by conventions like e.g. orientation on financial statements or pursuit of partial orientation.

Our aim is to analyze the impact of strategic management and dynamic capability developed by a firm of such an industry, which supports the entire system and manages inter-industry differences of consumer goods and CoPS. Recent convergence among technologies has raised competition among firms. Achieving and sustaining competitive advantage in this converging market is therefore possible by identifying threats and then developing strategies and capabilities to resolve them. This article concludes by examining how the firm can achieve its competitive advantage.

J	Hinshaw, M				Hinshaw, Michael			A survey of key success factors in financial services marketing and brand management	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING			English	Article						Financial services; brand management; performance measurement		What challenges and opportunities do financial services marketers face as they strive to improve marketing and brand performance, relevance, value and accountability within their organisations? To help answer this question, MCorp., a strategic brand and marketing consultancy, surveyed marketing executives from 67 financial services institutions across the USA in the autumn of 2004. The survey grouped responses into several categories, ranging from an understanding of how marketing and brand performance is tracked, to respondents' views on specific challenges to improve marketing and branding effectiveness. Across all categories, data drove two 'big- picture' conclusions which reveal key strategic issues facing financial services marketers today. First, there is a stated lack of brand and marketing performance information, and an absence of the systems and programmes to track it. Secondly, there is a perceived lack of top-down organisational understanding of the importance, value and meaning of brand within respondent organisations. Within the overall context of these conclusions, analysis led to a series of key findings, and drove specific recommendations for addressing the issues raised. While the illustrations given are based on data gathered from institutions in the USA, the author's experience suggests that the conclusions and attendant recommendations can serve as a basis for process and performance improvement in any financial services institution.

J	Mirman, LJ; To, T				Mirman, LJ; To, T			Strategic resource extraction, capital accumulation and overlapping generations	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						renewable resource; overlapping generations; golden rule	FISH WARS; COMPETITION	The standard resource extraction framework assumes infinitely lived agents and yields an overfishing result. For some applications, a finite time horizon may be more appropriate. A direct extension of the Levhari-Mirman model to overlapping generations yields an extreme overfishing result. Alternatively, we assume young and old specialize, and respectively fish and supply capital. In this model, under some circumstances there may well be under-utilization of natural resources. However, for a given production technology, if there are a sufficiently large number of agents, overfishing always results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Ali, M				Ali, M			Routing of 40-Gb/s streams in wavelength-routed heterogeneous optical networks	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						network design; optical impairments; optical networks; quality-of-service (QoS); 40 Gb/s		In this paper, we address the design and management issues in routing a mixture of OC-192 and OC-768 streams in wavelength-routed optical networks. We assume that fiber links in the network are heterogeneous with respect to their transmission capability (i.e., links are designed to handle a given maximum bit-rate imposed by regenerator spacing).We investigate the issues of routing connection demands of various bit-rate requirements in such heterogeneous networks. In this environment, we introduce the routing of multirate traffic (RMT) problem. The RMT problem is informally defined as the process of finding the best routing which maximizes the total bandwidth carried in the network, for a set of sessions, within a given TDM equipment budget. We propose a two-phase optimization scheme (two-phase RMT). This scheme first obtains a basis solution used in routing 40-Gb/s traffic only on OC-768 capable links without the use of TDM equipment. In the second phase, an iterative routing, rerouting, and resource allocation step is used to optimize the total bandwidth carried in the network, while allowing 40-Gb/s traffic to be routed on OC-768 incapable links by the proper installation of TDM multiplexors and demultiplexers at some strategic locations in the network. Numerical results reveal the following:. 1) the two-phase RMT optimization algorithm provides substantial savings in terms of both the total TDM equipment installed and number of wavelengths used; 2) noticeable enhancements of the bandwidth utilization and the TDM budget are observed when the route-optimization takes into account the transmission quality of the links; and 3) the use of intermediate TDM multiplexing/demultiplexing functions provides substantial savings, in terms of the total number of channels, over the source-splitting scheme.

J	Steyn, B; Grobler, A; Cilliers, B				Steyn, B.; Grobler, A.; Cilliers, B.			A theoretical framework for the concept of 'Internet strategy'	COMMUNICARE-JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION SCIENCES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article							WEB	Organisations know that the Internet could or should play an important role in goal achievement, but are uncertain about its strategic application. It can therefore be said that the Internet remains largely 'a technology in search of a strategy'. This article explores 'Internet strategy' from the perspective of the corporate communication domain, specifically within the framework of two meta-theoretical approaches: the Excellence approach and the two-way symmetrical approach to public relations and communication management. 'Internet strategy' is conceptualised based on the following theories: information theory, the communication process, mass communication theory, strategic management theory, corporate communication roles theory, and the models for developing corporate communication strategy and communication plans. The most important findings indicate that, with regard to the corporate communication process, the Internet is regarded as a medium or channel and, as such, it can make a contribution on all strategy levels. The concept of 'Internet strategy' is specifically seen to be part of operational strategy at the micro organisational level. However, considering the use of the Internet already at the functional strategy level ensures that its use is not decided upon in isolation, but forms part of corporate communication goal achievement.

Visitor Preferences in Kruger National Park, South Africa: The Value of a Mixed-Method Approach	JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Park visitor preferences; conjoint analysis; mixed-method; park management	DELPHI TECHNIQUE	South African protected area managers are increasingly being forced to ask strategic questions regarding the economic sustainability of the reserves they administer. To do this, managers need to know more about what visitors expect from their visits to protected areas and, for the strategy to succeed, visitors need to understand the objectives of environmental managers. In this research a mixed-method approach, using conjoint analysis and visitor comments, provides empirical data on the underlying determinants of visitor preferences in Kruger National Park. This data will assist park authorities in making better-informed planning decisions. The conjoint analysis results showed that accommodation type and cost were the most important variables to visitors, when making decisions on visiting Kruger National Park. Accommodation cost alone was seen as more important than the combined importance of animal viewing, activities, and facilities. This finding was more prevalent for international visitors than South Africans. The qualitative visitor comments indicated that service in terms of staffing, maintenance, and information flow was poor. The value of using a mixed-method approach is that is provides park managers with a more complete picture of visitor preferences, rather than relying on numbers or comments alone. Park management can now implement appropriate strategies to meet visitor preferences, in terms of concentrating its limited resources on improving the standard of service and reviewing accommodation type and cost.

J	Gustavsson, B				Gustavsson, Bengt			The Ethics of Managing Corporate Identity	JOURNAL OF HUMAN VALUES			English	Article								This article addresses the issues of identity and ethics. Individual identity can be understood from an essence and/or constructive perspective, and organizational identity from an individual and/or strategic perspective. Three ethical dilemmas are identified in relation to human identity: construction of corporate identity, change of corporate identity, and the corporations' role in society, summarized as the utility vs humanity dilemma. The conclusion recommends an increased focus on human values management and a process of detachment and transparency in identity issues.

J	Saffre, F; Hoile, C; Shackleton, M				Saffre, F; Hoile, C; Shackleton, M			Bandwidth management for the people	BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article								In the context of a rapidly growing broadband market, it is critical to understand the expectations and quality of service requirements of a changing population of end users, in order to make informed strategic decisions. Although a number of technologies are available to fine-tune bandwidth allocation and ensure various forms of 'fairness', the performance, cost and marketing implications of choosing one regime over another are not always obvious to decision-makers. In this paper, we present the broadband broker (B-Cube) simulation tool and demonstrate how it can be used as a strategic planning tool to identify and evaluate the advantages and shortcomings of a wide variety of broadband products, bandwidth management schemes or changes in usage patterns. The main difference between B-Cube and other tools is that using it only requires an understanding of the top-level principles governing the distribution of the limited broadband resource.

J	Hwang, P				Hwang, P			Managing relational bond: An integrative approach	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article							PRISONERS DILEMMA GAME; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; SUPPLIER RELATIONS; TRUST; COOPERATION; ORGANIZATIONS; BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; VIEW; PLAY	Managing voluntary cooperative relationships is growing in strategic importance. While some scholars emphasize the importance of fostering interpersonal ties and establishing a long-term perspective, others focus on managing the pattern of payoff to enhance a relationship. We offer a contingency framework that integrates these two perspectives of relationship building. The central thesis is that the effectiveness of payoff management hinges systematically on the context of a relationship jointly comprising interpersonal and intertemporal dynamics. The framework can be useful in enhancing the decision-making capabilities of managers who either proactively improve cooperation or reactively mitigate unfavorable payoff changes.

J	Palm, D				Palm, D			Designing and building new local public health agencies in Nebraska	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						public health agencies; tobacco settlement funds; Turning Point		Prior to 2001, the local public health system in Nebraska was weak, fragmented, and severely under funded. Local 93 counties. The Turning Point project provided the impetus for change by allowing a diverse group of public health stakeholders to develop a strategic plan for strengthening and transforming the public health system. The plan acted as a catalyst to use some of the Nebraska Tobacco Settlement Funds to provide dedicated state funding to build the local public health system, By June 2002, 16 new local public health departments had been organized, ultimately covering all of the 93 counties in the state. Some of the keys to long-term sustainability are creating a network of community health partners that support collaborative decision making, continually seeking input from the community, developing and implementing an education and training plan for public health professionals and local board of health members, and demonstrating accountability by documenting results and communicating them to policy makers and the general public.

As a result, we have witnessed the rapid flow of foreign direct investment into mainland China since it adopted its open market strategy in the 1980s. This paper sets out to combine regional and industrial concepts to form an innovation system based on a global view of the development strategy for the ICT industry under the triple dimension structure of interaction between markets, technology and institutions. The competition amongst multinational corporations for the mainland Chinese markets has been of equal importance, with strategic industrialists' adoption of 'co-opetition' strategies which have contributed to significant growth in the Chinese economy. The development of the ICT industry on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, under such cooperative but competitive strategies, highlights the simultaneous development of an industrial innovation system.

J	Delorme, M; Cloutier, LM				Delorme, M; Cloutier, LM			The growth of Quebec's biotechnology firms and the implications of underinvestment in strategic competencies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Technology and Human Resource Management	MAY, 2003	CERAM, Sophia Antipolis, FRANCE		CERAM	human resources competencies; biotechnology; capacities; growth management		This paper examines the problem of human resources access for biotechnology firms in Quebec. The results of a survey conducted with 124 biotechnology firm managers document that access to human resources is a sizable challenge, the second most important issue facing these firms, after financing. The results further indicate that while firm managers are preoccupied by the skills and competencies of human resources, and recognise its importance; the scarcity of available headcount in the market, coupled with firm growth management imperatives, are a key limiting factor in the development of the firms' competencies. In this study, a strategic competence model is applied to understand the contribution of human resources to the management process of biotechnology firms. In particular, we formulate the working hypothesis that firms engage in fierce competition in the input market for scientific, technological, and management competencies. A systems archetype is used to illustrate the tradeoff between short-term financial priorities and the need for capacity building, whose 'tangible' benefits will only be measured in the long term.

J	Hilmola, OP; Helo, P; Maunuksela, A				Hilmola, Olli-Pekka; Helo, Petri; Maunuksela, Ari			The economic nature of feedback loops in product development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						design structure matrix; feedback loops; learning; product development; economics		In contemporary industrial management Design Structure Matrix (DSM) has been applied in managing uncertain and unpredictable product development processes. In many cases the problems are arising from the feedback loops; one of the most awkward situation is the feedback dependency from the last task to the starting phase of the project. This kind of situation will not only increase the costs of development activity, but will increase the development time as well, which is the key factor to maintain competitiveness in markets. However, DSM research has been able to solve partially these problems with clustering; instead of task-based management, product development is managed through important clusters of numerous different tasks-processes. Justification of feedback loops is an increasingly important research issue in the current as well as future research of DSM. This paper will analyse further the economic impacts of probability for feedback loops and available number of strategic alternatives in decision-making to possibly avoid these situations. Economic tradeoff will occur between feedback loop costs and the costs of increasing the organisational awareness of process problems. Based on this modeling, some managerial recommendations are suggested.

J	Hopkins, CD; Alford, BL				Hopkins, Christopher D.; Alford, Bruce L.			Pioneering the Development of a Scale to Measure E-Tailer Image	JOURNAL OF INTERNET COMMERCE			English	Article						E-tailer image; functional dimensions; affective dimensions; unidimentionality; reliability; convergent validity; discriminant validity; nomological validity; browsing; revisiting; purchase intentions	CONSUMER	Given the risks and returns associated with conducting business online, practitioners and academics alike are urged to gain an understanding of the strategic variables that can offer firms competitive advantages. A strategic variable of importance to traditional retailers is the image that is promoted to consumers. To date the concept of online retail or "e-tail" image has not been assessed in marketing literature. This study forwards the development of a multi-dimensional scale to measure e-tailer image. By way of extensive review of retail image literature, the authors develop a six-dimensional definition of e-tailer image consisting of the functional dimensions of price, merchandise, and service, and the affective dimensions of atmosphere, self/site image congruence, and convenience. Through interviews with online consumers and experts in the field, an item pool is generated to represent e-tailer image. The results of three empirical tests, the first consisting of a student sample and the second and third consisting of online shoppers, are reported. Utilizing exploratory/confirmatory factor analysis and correlation analysis, findings confirm the proposed dimensionality, reliability and validity of the e-tailer image scale. The most important contribution of the study revolves around the fact that it takes the first logical step in measuring a very illusive, yet crucial, strategic marketing variable.

J	Koch, HJ; Reese, M				Koch, Hans-Joachim; Reese, Moritz			Revising the Waste Framework Directive Basic Deficiencies of European Waste Law and Proposals for Reform	JOURNAL FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL & PLANNING LAW			English	Article								For years, there has been criticism that there are substantial ambiguities in European waste law and that, in particular, crucial legal terms, such as waste, disposal and recovery, have not yet been defined sufficiently clearly. Such ambiguities hamper transposition into national law, complicate implementation by the national authorities and thus give rise to considerable economic: and environmental problems in the waste management sector. Prompted by the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, the European Commission has finally initiated a revision of the general legal framework for European waste management. Amendments to the Waste Shipment Regulation have already been approved at a political level and are likely to he adopted this year. Revision of the basic terms, principles and provisions of the Waste Framework Directive (WED), however, is still at a rather early stage. Against this background, we hope to show by the following that the ambiguities in EC waste law are not just a consequence of a lack of definitions but also the result of uncertainty surrounding basic regulatory and strategic issues which must be addressed first (Part I. We will therefore submit recommendations as to how these strategic questions should be answered in the light of both the environmental risks currently faced by the waste sector and the specific potential of waste-law approaches to reduce these risks (Part III. Finally, we will show how these strategic solutions could be converted into specific provisions and amendments to the WED (Parts III and IV). The recommendations and suggestions presented below have been generated by a study conducted by the authors at the request of the German Ministry of the Environment'.

J	Magnan, M; St-Onge, S; Cormier, D				Magnan, Michel; St-Onge, Sylvie; Cormier, Denis			The adoption and success of profit-sharing plans in strategic business units Opportunism or contingency?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Earnings; Financial services; Capital growth; Company profit sharing schemes; Strategic business units		Purpose - To provide insights as to the determinants of profit-sharing plan (PSP) adoption, as well as conditions that underlie their successful implementation. Design/methodology/approach - The sample comprises strategic business units (SBUs) within a large financial services organization, some of which voluntarily adopted a PSP while others did not. All sample SBUs face similar economic and market conditions. Through a logit analysis, we identify determinants of PSP adoption. Through longitudinal cross-sectional design, we assess the impact of PSP adoption on earnings growth, as well as conditions that underlie successful implementations. Findings - Larger SBUs as well as SBUs exhibiting superior asset growth are more likely to adopt a PSP than other SBUs. Prior earnings performance is not found to be a determinant of PSP adoption. PSP adoption translates into superior earnings growth, but such impact quickly declines over time. Among PSP adopters, earnings growth following PSP adoption is greater for SBUs that adopt late (late adopters) and for those which had poor prior earnings performance. Research limitations/implications - Limited external validity as the analysis is performed within a single North American organization. Practical implications - PSPs are found to be an effective performance turnaround tool. In addition, their limited life cycle suggests that continuous reinforcements and communications are needed to maintain effectiveness. Originality/value - In contrast to most prior research that uses multi-industry samples, the paper relies on a unique organizational database that controls for confounding factors and different earnings generation processes. Moreover, the paper provides additional insights as to the conditions for success.

A. Simon	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; FRAMEWORK	About 25 years ago, the Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon and other top Management Science/Operations Research (MS/OR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers, suggested that an integration of the two disciplines would improve the design of decision making support tools in organizations. The suggested integrated system has been called an intelligent decision-making support system (i-DMSS). In this paper, we use an existing conceptual framework posed to assess the capabilities and limitations of the i-DMSS concept, and through a conceptual meta-analysis research of the Decision Support System (DSS) and MS/OR literature from 1980 to 2004, we develop a strategic assessment of the initial proposal. Such an analysis reveals support gaps that suggest for further development of the initial i-DMSS concept. We offer recommendations for making the indicated improvements in i-DMSS design, development, and application.

Design/methodology/approach - Seven years of complaints data (1993-2000) are examined. The data showed that of nearly 40,000 complaints amounting to over 80,000 allegations, less than 2 percent relate to drug-related allegations. These allegations were isolated and the pattern of officer demographics from these incidents were compared to the police service as a whole, with the aim of exploring if particular groups (such as length of service, age, gender etc.) were particularly susceptible to attracting drug-related allegations. Findings - The most common drug-related allegation was for supplying drugs. The distribution of drug-related complaints follows the general demographic pattern of officers in the police service, though female officers attracted fewer drug-related allegations. Adverse findings, while rare, are most likely to be recorded against lower ranking police officers who have served less time in the police service. Practical implications - The paper shows that demographics alone are not sufficient to identify officers at risk of being on the receiving end of a drug-related complaint. The age, service and rank analysis conducted in this paper has not revealed any particular groups that are more susceptible to allegations of drugs misconduct. This paper therefore supports the idea that a more thorough early warning system tailored to individual officers may be necessary for an effective strategic complaints system. Originality/value - With a pool of nearly 80,000 allegations to draw upon, the research employs one of the largest data sets ever examined. The findings are therefore sufficient to provide robust statistical comparisons, and are of interest to police practitioners, law enforcement managers, and researchers.

J	Marin, GS; Sanchez, AA				Sanchez Marin, Gregorio; Aragon Sanchez, Antonio			MANAGERIAL COMPENSATION AND FIRM PERFORMANCE The Moderating Role of Firm Strategy as a Proxy of Managerial Discretion	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Compensation; Strategy; Control; Managerial discretion		This paper analyzes the effect of strategic context on managerial compensation design, and the interactive influence on firm performance for a set of Spanish companies. Specifically, this study examines the performance implications of the fit between different managerial compensation systems and diverse firm's strategic orientations-representing various levels of managerial discretion. Based on a framework combining agency theory and managerial discretion concept, a research design with both archival and survey data is used to test hypotheses in a sample of 82 firms. The findings offer sufficient confirmation of theoretical arguments, providing extensions of this research stream for non-U.S. firms. Results show that firms benefit from the design of managerial compensation systems when they match the managerial control and risk-bearing requirements imposed by the strategic context. Specifically, risk-encouraging compensation systems are better for prospector firms-high level of managerial discretion-whereas risk-discouraging compensation systems are better for defender firms-low level of managerial discretion.

J	Sen, R; Sen, TK				Sen, R; Sen, TK			A meta-modeling approach to designing e-warehousing systems	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						dataware house; meta models	DECISION-SUPPORT; MANAGEMENT	A business application that leverages the Internet for selling products and services or for information dissemination is called an e-business solution. In the past few years, organizations have moved aggressively towards deploying e-business solutions to improve process efficiencies, be competitive, access new markets, increase market share, reduce costs and satisfy an array of other business drivers. Within the domain of e-business initiatives, particular emphasis has been provided on e-warehousing initiatives. The differentiating facet of e-warehousing initiatives is that they are high-impact solutions that affect various parts of the organization, and ultimately the business goals of the enterprise, by providing relevant decision-making information at the manager's desktop, irrespective of geographic location. Despite this, many of these initiatives are technology based and have lacked strategic level sponsorship, leading to compromised results. Development of e-warehousing systems should be viewed as a strategic business initiative with distinctly different business models and processes. Traditional design approaches alone are not suited to such strategic initiatives. E-warehousing initiatives require new models for design in the early stages of development. In the later stages, traditional design approaches are applicable. In this article, we propose a meta-modeling approach for e-warehousing initiatives. The model has four components: developing business goals and strategies, defining functional business processes, developing an e-warehousing integration architecture, and designing metrics for evaluating the performance of the e-warehousing initiative. This model is illustrated by using an e-warehousing initiative for a government agency.

J	Tayles, M; Webster, M; Sugden, D; Bramley, A				Tayles, Mike; Webster, Margaret; Sugden, David; Bramley, Andrew			Accounting "gets real" in dealing with virtual manufacturing	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL			English	Article						Accounting; Intellectual capital; Intangible assets; Financial reporting; Resources		Purpose - Of relatively recent origin is the virtual organisation where companies are able to marshal the necessary competencies from a range of independent external agents through the strategic use of outsourcing mechanisms. The paper discusses the challenge of accounting for intellectual capital (IC) and intangible assets and presents a financial analysis and background of companies exhibiting different levels of virtuality, from traditional manufacturing to virtual manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on the interaction of the researchers with three companies examining their positions on the continuum from traditional to virtual manufacturing. Case studies of the companies and some key financial results for a period of years are presented in order to explore implications and inform strategic decisions. Findings - It concludes that conventional financial reporting for IC and intangibles has limited scope. This is elaborated through contrasts in a number of conventional accounting measures and some others, less conventional, to highlight the implications of the intellectual capital employed. The results are reported and implications of these discussed in the context of the companies whose background and activities are briefly outlined. Practical implications - The measurement and management of the intangible assets and intellectual capital of organisations has been the focus of recent research in accounting and finance. This has applied to the corporate reporting of financial results involving its impact on the balance sheet, managerial accounting concerned with decisions and the internal use of various financial and non-financial performance measures and finance where market values of companies have been shown to differ significantly from their book values as shown in published accounts. Originality/value - The content will be of interest to academics studying issues surrounding the reporting and decision making concerning intellectual capital and intangibles. Additionally, managers and consultants whose companies are engaged in outsourcing and or virtual/semi-virtual manufacturing should find the results informative.

VALUING STRATEGIC GROWTH OPTIONS A Portfolio Approach	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategy; Investment; Portfolio management; Cournot game; Real option theory	MINIMUM; MAXIMUM	This study analyzes the trade-off between strategic flexibility and commitment for cases of simultaneous and related strategic investments under high levels of uncertainty. It develops a model that, using a Cournot game and real option theory, demonstrates that (1) a correlated strategic investment adds value to a portfolio of ongoing strategic investments in a decreasing marginal fashion, and (2) the new investment delays the development of the other investments. Managers who fail to recognize these properties may make strategic commitments that destroy value, even in the presence of options with individual positive values. An important feature of the model is that competitive advantages may flow from market power or from the capability of managing the portfolio.

J	Anson, M				Anson, M			Thinking outside the benchmark	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The twin decades of 1980-1999 provided annual returns to the U.S. equity market in the high double digits, but moving forward over the next decade, returns are expected to be in the mid- to high single digits, just when corporate and public pension plans face both a growing retiree population and lengthening average retiree longevity. To meet these challenges, pension plans must think beyond their benchmarks, and remove the restrictions associated with strategic asset allocation models. Traditional-asset allocation models partition the financial markets into neat benchmark boxes, perhaps useful for planning purposes but surely inhibitive for alpha extraction and return maximization.

J	Harris, DL; Lloyd, JW; Marrinan, MJ				Harris, DL; Lloyd, JW; Marrinan, MJ			Hospital management principles applicable to the veterinary teaching hospital	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article							ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS; MEDICAL-SCHOOLS; BALANCED-SCORECARD; MISSION; PRODUCTIVITY; ISSUES; CARE	The Skills, Knowledge, Aptitude, and Attitude (SKA) Subcommittee of the National Commission on Veterinary Economic Issues (NCVEI) has identified the need for veterinary teaching hospitals (VTH) to be at the forefront of progressive business management to serve as a model for both students and practitioners to emulate. To provide a foundation for developing a model, this study reviewed pertinent literature applicable to the management of a VTH. Much of the literature relevant to VTH management relates to work completed for the human side of medicine (academic health centers, or AHCs) or to the private sector. This review explores management practices in strategic planning, financial management, human resource management, marketing, pricing, operations, and legal issues. It is concluded that strategic management is important to provide the foundation for success in the VTH. In addition, periodic financial reports are recommended, as are the development and use of benchmarks for financial management. Establishing positive, motivating human resource practices is also suggested, along with development of a marketing plan based on a clear understanding of VTH core competencies and the market's specific needs.

J	Laux, C; Probst, DA				Laux, C; Probst, DA			One signal, two opinions: strategic heterogeneity of analysts' forecasts	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						anti-herding; relative performance; investment analyst	MACROECONOMIC FORECASTS; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; SECURITY ANALYSTS; BEHAVIOR; CONSERVATISM; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; REPUTATION; INCENTIVES	When investors choose analysts based on past performance as featured in magazines and rankings, the demand an individual analyst faces depends not only on his own forecast but also on the number of analysts who also forecasted successfully. As a consequence, analysts may predict strategically to increase the expected demand for future forecasts. However, in such a setting, investors might ignore rankings and stories about past successes while analysts make predictions according to their best knowledge. We derive comparative statics results regarding the correlation structure of analysts' information and reinterpret results in the empirical herding literature from an anti-herding viewpoint.

Anticipating the future return of new projects is a critical challenge that confronts marketing managers at present. However, the transfer of success models from new products to services has not allowed a global vision of the internal and external environment that best set up the success of new services. Using a sample of 120 new Portuguese financial services (67 successful/57 failures), this study examines the relationships foreseen by a global model of success determinants of new services, i.e., formulates and tests hypotheses relative to the differentiated impact of the strategic and environmental factors on the multiple return indicators. The results of a binary logistic regression analysis suggest that a group of factors that best discriminate between new services of average and high return, through its different indicators that distinguishes the factors, is slightly different and less than one that distinguishes between successful and failed innovations.

If two-fund separation is found to hold across periods for competitive behavior, it also holds for strategic behavior. In this case the relative prices of the assets do not depend on whether the agents behave strategically or competitively. The agents acting strategically will however invest less in the common mutual fund. Constant relative risk aversion and the absence of aggregate risk are shown to be two alternative sufficient conditions for two-period fund separation. By including derivatives in Our model, further strategic aspects arise. In this case the strategic behavior is found to differ from the competitive behavior even for utility functions leading to two-fund separation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Makropoulos, CK; Butter, D				Makropoulos, CK; Butter, D			Planning site-specific water-demand management strategies	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						GIS; master plan; spatial decision support; water-demand management	FUZZY-LOGIC	Water-demand management is a pro-active approach to water conservation, which considers water-consumption 'needs' as 'demands' rather than requirements. Taking into account a variety of engineering strategies to reduce urban water consumption, this research discusses the use of a tool for developing a master plan for site-specific implementation. The tool links the characteristics of urban areas (engineering, economic and social) with the applicability of particular water-demand management strategies within a fuzzy logic framework, to provide spatially-sensitive decision support - both at a strategic and an application level. The initial results, under various user-defined scenarios, are presented and discussed. It is argued that decision-support tools are beneficial in assisting the water industry to move towards a more pro-active approach to urban water management, similar to the approach which has already been adopted by the Telecommunication and Energy sector.

J	Kaskie, B; Coddington, S				Kaskie, B; Coddington, S			A strategic response to the challenges presented by older patients with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ELDERLY PERSONS; CARE; INDIVIDUALS	Clinical dementia has become one of the most serious and persistent health problems affecting persons over the age of 65. Efforts to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia are ongoing, while healthcare executives continue to face a number of challenges. Access to targeted programs and services for persons with dementia is lacking. The costs of program development and service delivery are substantial. Persons with dementia who do use services often do not receive the most effective and efficient care, and their providers often do not receive sufficient payment. Because few examples exist of how healthcare executives can appropriately respond to these challenges, we created an operational planning strategy. This strategy defines the challenges presented by persons with dementia, identifies four viable responses, and describes two factors that will contribute to successful implementation of these responses. If healthcare executives begin planning now, then the challenges presented by one of the more serious health problems of the next 20 years can be mitigated.

J	Maoz, Z				Maoz, Z			Domestic politics of regional security: Theoretical perspectives and Middle East patterns	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article							REALISM; REGIMES; POWER	Three general perspectives on national security have dominated the literature. The realist perspective focuses on the effects of the power-related aspects of an anarchic system on the security calculus of states and on the conflict and alliance diplomacy outputs of national security policies. On the regional level, this perspective emphasizes the practices of balancing and counterbalancing as the key aspects of regional and global security management. The liberal perspective emphasizes the impact of domestic structures and processes, including the concern for economic well-being, on the formation of security policies. On the regional level, this perspective emphasizes the formation of security regimes and regional organizations that condition and limit short-term conflict. The revisionist perspective focuses on the regime-preserving function of most security organizations in Third World states. It argues that the pursuit of certain security-related objectives - such as increases in defense expenditures and the design and deployment of armed forces - is guided by domestic considerations. This study examines the relative relevance of the three approaches to the evolution of the Middle East. It argues that the revisionist perspective was the most relevant one in the 1950s and 1960s, the realist perspective was the most relevant one in the 1970s and 1980s, and. the liberal approach became increasingly important in the 1990s. Despite the relative decline of the latter approach, it has left traces in the policies of the region that offer some degree of optimism regarding the evolution of regional structures and institutions once the key conflict in the region are resolved.

J	Banerjee, P				Banerjee, P			Resources, capability and coordination: strategic management of information in Indian information sector firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic management of information; information as a resource; Indian software; job-switch	INDUSTRY	Coordination of capability and information amongst firms is a strategic objective. This cannot be solved only by innovation in information sector firms but through strategic management of information (SMI) received from outside or structurally generated internally. Firms need to undertake a new kind of SMI, which is dependent on generating information on the other firms, technology, standards, logistics and customer base. This generative aspect is solved by firms in the information sector resorting to a practice of sustaining high manpower turnover. Job-switching individuals act as an 'intermediate good'. Job-switches thus act as an information-generating activity and a firm's SMI can be based on that in order to serve strategic coordination. This inter alia solves some riddles pertaining to theories of strategic capability and the resources view of strategy. Examples from Indian job-switches are discussed to substantiate the argument.

J	Harper, RB				Harper, RB			Asset allocation, decoupling, and the opportunity cost of cash - Enhancing performance in investment portfolios.	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Investors often increase their cash and near-cash balances during periods of significant equity volatility. Feeling compelled to salvage what they can in the face of adversity, these investors overlook the opportunity to enhance performance by extending duration in the fixed-income portion of their balanced portfolios. They neglect to keep strategic as well as tactical goals in mind. When equities dominate portfolio volatility, the risk profile of the overall portfolio is relatively insensitive to measured duration extensions. Conversely, the portfolio receives the full return benefit of such an extension. The decoupling of liquid Treasury returns from equity returns during periods of crisis can reinforce the beneficial trade-off of extending duration and slightly reducing equity exposure. An analysis of market data over the past 21 years not only documents the risk-adjusted return benefits of extending duration, but also suggests enhanced downside risk protection.

J	Ong, GG				Ong, GG			Credibility over courage: NATO's mis-intervention in Kosovo	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article								NATO officials have cited various reasons for conducting their air campaign in Kosovo. Though not emphasised as much, the concern that NATO's credibility was at stake stood out as the most paramount on the basis of logical comparison. In fact, NATO intervened in Kosovo primarily to maintain its credibility as the Trans-Atlantic's only multilateral security mechanism because its continued existence depended on it. While NATO's search for its new role in the post-Cold War strategic environment has been fraught with several problems, the inclination towards collective security and crisis management has placed it in a position of proactive military obligation. Predictably, NATO's venture in the Balkans this time around has had various implications on its future prospects as an organisation.

This unique triad offers an opportunity for examining how technology acquisition and business development are pursued under such circumstances. The paper shows that alliances are utilised by both major players in commercial aviation, while acquisitions are the principal strategies selected in the military aviation industry. Boeing appears to shift its strategic choices appropriately by industry to match its competitors as well as to correspond to the approach advocated by related technology strategy literature.

J	Halemane, MD; van Dongen, B				Halemane, MD; van Dongen, B			Strategic innovation management of change in the pharmaceutical industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovation strategy; capabilities; intellectual property rights; pharmaceutical industry	GLOBALIZATION; PERFORMANCE	The pharmaceutical industry is currently preparing for a transition in many countries that gives rise to many unanswered questions regarding innovation strategy and ultimately may threaten the survival of companies in the industry. The cause of this transition is the GATT/WTO agreement that these countries signed in 1995. This agreement has broad implications for intellectual property rights, and particularly for the pharmaceutical industry. Major changes will occur in this industry, now that its intellectual property rights are being brought in line with those of the main economies in the world. The change from near-perfect competition with homogeneous and price controlled drugs to a market with patent protected products, a virtual monopoly in many sub-markets, will give rise to an extensive shift in the form of competition. This study, using the Indian pharmaceutical industry as a case study, proposes an approach to strategic innovation management, on which to build capabilities and from which to manage change, which can form a guide for companies preparing for this change.

J	Nagel, A				Nagel, A			Beyond Knut Holt's Fusion model, balancing market pull and technology push	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th ISPIM International Conference	SEP 26-29, 1999	TOKYO, JAPAN	ISPIM		market pull; technology push; strategic product innovation; strategy; competencies; future demand; position of the R&D manager		Should a firm rely on market pull or on technology push? Some scholars have extreme opinions on this and firms do switch emphasis on push and pull over time. Knut Holt, the first president of ISPIM, presented his so-called Fusion Model in the early 1970s to shed light onto this debate. This paper summarises some insights beyond this early model. We believe, like Holt, in balancing the two. Marketeers should be aware of the technological possibilities of the firm in communicating with the market and R&D should be market-oriented while creating new products as well as developing their (core) technologies. R&D should not develop what the market asks for. Listening to market needs for new products is difficult, if not impossible. For upgrading existing products however, it is a must. Balancing market pull and technology push should not be left to chance or to lower management in the marketing, production or R&D-departments. Instead, it should be managed strategically. i.e. at the top level, where the managers of these disciplines meet.

There are profound issues in product and in market classification. This paper reports the results of an exploratory study that illustrates the use of strategic groups as a means to research this emerging industry, using a sample of 280 companies in Canada. The analysis identifies six main strategic groups within the NFFs sector that compete on the market, product and capability strategic fields. The results indicate that the sector is widely heterogeneous in firm composition, markets served, and intragroup and intergroup product strategies.

The Chilean quality assurance (QA) program evaluation took place in July 1999, at the request of the Chilean Ministry of Health. The main objectives of the evaluation were to identify key aspects of the 8-year-old Chilean QA program that could be considered by other countries and to make strategic recommendations. Setting. In 1991, the Ministry of Health of Chile launched a national QA program. A national-level team initiated countrywide training of health care providers in QA skills, the development of quality committees at facility levels to direct local quality improvement activities, and training of quality monitors to provide technical support for training and quality improvement activities. Design. The evaluation team, consisting of two international consultants and a regional consultant from the Costa Rican Ministry of Health, visited six regions and seven health 'servicios' (geographically defined administrative units within a region). The regions and servicios were purposefully chosen to represent different geographic areas, types of facilities, and levels of performance of QA activities. The evaluation was based on a framework developed and applied by the Quality Assurance Project (Center for Human Services, USA). Group and individual interviews with staff complemented document and record reviews. Results. The evaluation team found that Chile's QA program had been successful in achieving sustainability and institutionalization. Factors contributing to this success included the enabling environment, management and leadership, technical functions, and support functions. Conclusion. The Chilean QA program constitutes an interesting experience for consideration by other countries. Key features include its sustainability, nationwide coverage, decentralization, and alliance of quality improvement and regulation. Training results are impressive: almost 20% of Ministry of Health personnel received training, and 19 training modules are in use. Coaches are active and technically sustaining quality assurance activities nationwide.

J	Bitran, I; Bitran, J; Conn, S; Nagel, A; Nicholls, H				Bitran, I; Bitran, J; Conn, S; Nagel, A; Nicholls, H			SMART: System for the development, management and support of strategic alliances	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						SMART; strategic alliances; alliance competencies; alliance management; knowledge-based support systems	JOINT	Despite the increasing number of strategic alliances (SAs), how to ensure their success is poorly understood. Studies suggest that up to 75 percent of alliances fail to meet their initial objectives due to a multitude of cultural, political, technological and human factors. If such an eclectic set of competencies is required for success, alliance management is clearly a difficult task for today's manager. Traditionally, managers wishing to develop SA competencies have relied on ad-hoc consultancy services and training. This has not, to date, resulted in a notable improvement in alliance success. The SMART project redresses this growing need by developing a knowledge-based software support system to help managers conceptualise, implement and manage SAs. First, this paper introduces the field of SAs; then the foundations of knowledge-based support systems are discussed. Finally, how the SMART approach will create value for managers is relayed.

J	Merlone, U				Merlone, U			Incentives and computing systems for team-based organizations: A mathematical and economic analysis	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						teams; production and organization; moral hazard	MORAL HAZARD; CONTRACTS; TOURNAMENTS; AGENTS	This paper provides a mathematical and economic analysis of "Incentives and Computing Systems for Team-Based Organizations" by A. Barua, C. H. Sophie Lee, and A. B. Whinston, which was published in Organization Science in 1995. Several points were not adequately stated in the original article and one of the key definitions is not clear, nor is it in keeping with the classical theory of production. Although the Cobb-Douglas production function is often used in the article, it does not comply with the article's definitions. The two main contributions of this paper are (1) to provide a word of caution to other readers who might try to extend Barua et al. (1995) and (2) to suggest alternative formulations and directions for future research.

During the last century, considerable hydraulic drainage and flood-alleviation works were carried out to increase agricultural production in the region. However, during the last two decades, the catastrophic effects of flooding and the persistence of low agricultural productivity in most of the area, demonstrate that the interventions (which have been made so far) have been inadequate. Perhaps one of the key factors in the lack of success of historic hydraulic interventions has been the absence of a strategic/integrated approach. This paper describes the first attempt at integrated river-basin planning in Argentina.

J	Talluri, S				Talluri, S			Single price system model for optimal decisions in capital equipment purchasing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION INVESTMENTS; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; MANUFACTURING SYSTEM; TECHNOLOGY SELECTION; STRATEGIC APPROACH; REPLACEMENT MODEL; CIM SYSTEMS; ACQUISITION	Capital equipment purchasing models require the consideration of several important factors that include both financial and non-financial measures. The traditional methods utilized for capital equipment purchasing decisions primarily consider cost-related factors and do not allow for the incorporation of other important measures that characterize the benefits derived from these systems. While the application of multifactor models and advanced mathematical programming techniques has received significant attention in this area, several of these existing methods also have limitations. The paper presents the application of a recently developed multicriteria technique referred to as the single price system model for optimal decisions in capital equipment purchasing. The technique has several distinct advantages over existing methods. The model application is demonstrated through a previously published dataset of flexible manufacturing technologies. The results provide interesting insights relating to negotiating and purchasing manufacturing technologies.

J	Sack, AL; Nadim, A				Sack, AL; Nadim, A			Strategic choices in a turbulent environment: A case study of starter corporation	JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article							INDUSTRY MATTER; MANAGEMENT; POWER; FIRM	The Starter Corporation, the industry leader in the sports licensed apparel business in the 1980s and 1990s, declared bankruptcy in 1999. This case study examines Starter's rise and fall, focusing on the interaction between management decisions made over the years and the profound changes that were taking place in the sports licensing industry. It was found that Starter's dependence on professional leagues for licensing agreements, a flood of new entrants into the licensing industry (especially large footwear manufacturers), the threat of substitute products, dependence on overseas and other suppliers, and players' strikes and lockouts created a volatile business environment in which Starter had to compete. The major question raised in this case concerns the relative importance of environmental factors and strategic choices by management in Starter's demise. Michael Porter's (1980) "five forces model" of industry competition provided a theoretical starting point for this study.

J	Wimberley, T; Rubens, A				Wimberley, T; Rubens, A			Management support organizations and university partnership in nonprofit education, training and consultation	SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article								Over the last decade there has been a tremendous growth in the nonprofit sector. Local community centers and foundations are developing Leadership Institutes to educate and assist the burgeoning nonprofit sectors needs for education and consultation. Universities and colleges are also responding to the call for nonprofit education. Since 1990 there has been a 300% growth in universities offering concentrations in nonprofit education. This paper documents how Florida Gulf Coast University, the nation's newest university, partnered with the Center for Leadership of the local community foundation to conduct a needs assessment of demand for graduate education, training, and consultation in the area of nonprofit management. The partnership began with three focus groups of key administrative personnel from local nonprofit organizations. The survey documented a preponderance of interest in marketing, fund raising and strategic planning across all agencies, regardless of size. Smaller agencies, with budgets of less than $500,000 (52% of the sample) tended to be primarily interested in education, training, and consultation activities involving fund raising and marketing. Comparatively larger agencies tended to be interested in assistance with computer technology, legal and ethical issues, and cooperation among nonprofit organizations. The survey also indicated that that was a high interest among agency staff and board members for a nonprofit management track within an academic degree program or a graduate certificate program in nonprofit management.

J	Vellinga, TV; Hilhorst, GJ				Vellinga, TV; Hilhorst, GJ			The role of tactical and operational grassland management in achieving agronomic and environmental objectives; 'De Marke', a case study	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						De Marke; operational grassland management; nitrate leaching; modelling	FERTILIZER INPUT; DAIRY-COW; NITROGEN; GROUNDWATER; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; CATTLE; SWARD	Reduction of N losses, especially nitrate leaching, is an important objective for dairy farms in the Netherlands. So far, many strategies have focused on changes in strategic and tactical management. Little attention has been paid to operational grassland management. So a conceptual model of operational grassland management was defined, with strong interactions between N rates, realized dry matter (DM) yields, herbage N content, growing days and utilization per cut. Analysis of data from 'De Marke' and from monitoring projects shows that grassland production and utilization can be improved by changes in operational grassland management. DM yields for grazing and cutting need to be increased, grazing per paddock must be shorter and slurry must be applied as early as possible. This improved grassland management is able to partly compensate the decrease in DM production resulting from a lower N input.

J	Zhou, ZY; Cheng, SW; Hua, B; Zeng, MG; Yin, QH				Zhou, ZY; Cheng, SW; Hua, B; Zeng, MG; Yin, QH			An investment decision support system for process industries	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						investment evaluation; decision support system; process industries; analytic hierarchy process	OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT	Most studies on investment evaluation mainly focus on enterprise economic benefits only, without process operability and sustainability considered. In this paper, we suggest that investment evaluation in process industries should be executed under three strategic objectives enterprise benefits, social benefits and customer benefits. A systematic investment evaluation and decision-making method with a four-step procedure based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to evaluate various qualitative and quantitative elements with various criteria. At the first step, the decision hierarchy is constructed under the three strategic objectives. Second, pair-wise comparison is utilized to evaluate the weights of elements and criteria. Third, qualitative elements are quantified by pair-wise comparison and quantitative elements axe re-scaled by a uniform criterion. At the last, the best choice is made through synthesizing values upward in the hierarchy. An investment decision support system (DSS) is developed based on Microsoft Excel, and applied to a retrofit investment of united fluid catalytic cracking(FCC) and liquefied gas separation process in a refinery plant.

J	Macfarlane, AS				Macfarlane, AS			The implementation of new technology in southern African mines: Pain or panacea	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article								The introduction of new technology into mining operations is seen as a strategic necessity by many mining companies, in order to improve safety and to improve operational effectiveness. Many attempts have been made in recent years to introduce new technologies into mining operations in southern Africa. Amongst these are noteworthy successes, as well as some disappointing failures. Often, the reason for failure does not fie with the technology itself, but with the work system into which the technology is introduced, Such failures may come with a significant opportunity cost, and have a detrimental effect on future development, simply because the system has not been adequately engineered, and the risks have not been adequately assessed and managed. This paper examines the reasons for such failures, and proposes a methodology to be followed to ensure successful and sustainable implementation of new technologies, such as to reduce technical and financial risk to the company, and to energize the workforce into ensuring the initial objectives of the project are met. The paper also focuses on the application of appropriate technology, and the development of technological applications which are commensurate with the level of development of the work environment into which it is introduced. The paper therefore focuses on the application of risk management, change management, systems engineering and feasibility analysis as being key elements of a successful and holistic technology implementation programme.

J	Minnick, AF; Halstead, L				Minnick, AF; Halstead, L			Use of a faculty investment model to attain the goals of a college of nursing	JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL NURSING			English	Article								Driven by demands for fiscal prudence, new services, and an orderly transition as aging faculty approach retirement, a new model for administrative planning and decision making was tested. In its first year of using an investment model, a private, 600+ student, College of Nursing was able to achieve a labor savings of 10 per cent, an enhancement of revenue of 3 per cent, and a human capital pool equal to 12 per cent of total full-time faculty equivalents. The model, which includes the integration of strategic planning, benchmarking, continuous quality improvement, and management by objectives, was accomplished by taking three investment steps. The steps included goal determination, market understanding, and resource allocation. Investment activity distribution and work determination frameworks were developed as a result of the commitment to the investment process. Suggestions for the future include the need to continue to reorient administrative and faculty thinking as definitions of the educational enterprise evolve. Copyright (C) 2001 by W.B..

The paper provides insight to the process of establishing such networks and the use of indicators in the design and monitoring of this process. It is based on five extensive case studies and in addition on several in-depth interviews with SME entrepreneurs and business managers. The practical experiences in these case studies and the indicators used by practitioners in network development are briefly described. These experiences together with theoretical insights were combined into a comprehensive set of indicators, describing the progress and effectiveness of the network formation and operation process. The discussion closed with more generic conclusions about establishing inter-organisational networks and monitoring network development processes in practice. Implications for further research have also been put forward.

J	Cohn, MJ				Cohn, MJ			The TransAlta High-Energy Piping program - A five-year history	JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference of the American-Society-of-Mechanical-Engineers	JUL 23-27, 2000	SEATTLE, WASHINGTON	Amer Soc Mech Engineers				In 1995, the High-Energy Piping Strategic Management Plan (HEPSMP) was initiated at TransAlta Utilities Corporation (TAU) for the three generating facilities. At that rime, it tvas recognized that several of the piping systems were exhibiting signs of creep relaxation, with some hangers bottomed or topped out online and/or offline. Previous hanger adjusment attempts were not always adequate. The program workscope included: Ij hot and cold piping system walkdowns, 2) selection of high-priority girth weld inspection locations, 3) examination of critical weldments, 4) weld repairs where necessary, 5) adjustments or modifications of malfunctioning steam line hangers, and 6) recommended work for future scheduled outages. Prior to 1996, examination locations were limited to the traditional locations of the terminal points at the boiler and turbine, with reexaminations occurring at arbitrary intervals. Since the terminal points are not necessarily the most highly stressed welds causing service-related creep damage, service damage may not occur first at the pre-1996 examined locations. There was a need to maximize the safety and integrity of these lines by ensuring that the highest risk welds were identified and given the highest priority for examination. An engineering consulting company was selected to prioritize the highest risk weldments for each piping system. This risk-based methodology included the prediction and evaluation of actual sustained lends, thermal expansion loads, operating loads, maltiaxial stresses, creep relaxation, and cumulative creep life exhaustion. The technical process included detailed piping system walkdowns and application of advanced analytical techniques to pr-edict and rank creep/fatigue damage for each piping system. TAU has concluded that the program has met its objective of successfully prioritizing inspection locations. The approach has also resulted in reducing the scope and cost of reexaminations. Phases 1 and 2 evaluations and examinations have been completed for all units. Results of some of the important aspects of this program are provided as case history studies.

J	Williams, A				Williams, A			Economic marginalism and the microstate, the impact of donor conditionality requirements in international aid programmes on a SHRM training project in the Cook Islands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						donor conditionality; marginal economies; contingency needs; strategic human resource management; agenda capture; post-Washington consensus		Donor conditionality involves the formal terms and commitments under which major international aid agencies, such as the World Bank and the IMF grant aid or arrange loans for developing countries. In doing so, said agencies have tended to emulate, as a matter of policy, private-sector market reforms based on the contemporary neoclassical model. As a consequence, donor conditionality tends to place formalized and regular stress on inflationary control, privatization of publicly owned equity and the deregulation of public-sector employment. In turn, the functional utility of strategic human resource management as a vehicle able to obtain major change-related outcomes has tended to give it an important role in the implementation process. This paper reports on events that took place in the Cook Islands, a central Pacific microstate, during a university-based training course for public service managers in which the government imposed on a virtual exercise the full weight of real decisionmaking process. It will attempt to place this action in a larger context by, first, critically examining the tendency for SHRM initiatives to be distorted - a situation that arises when the requirements of donor conditionality do not fit the economic, social and cultural conditions in which they are to be applied. It will conclude by reviewing some of the issues to be debated should the tendency to use a single model of reform be replaced by a more country-friendly programme of requirements.

J	Newman, JF; Tyler, L; Dunbar, DM				Newman, JF; Tyler, L; Dunbar, DM			CEO performance appraisal: Review and recommendations	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								CEO performance appraisal (PA) is very valuable to an organization, but the chances of obtaining a Ph of high quality decrease as executive responsibility increases. The realities of CEO Ph are that it: (1) is inevitable; (2) is creative and complex; (3) involves politics; and (4) has a significant effect on the organization and the executive. Ph is conducted for legal and social requirements, to enhance communication, to provide opportunities for improvement, and to relate performance to compensation. This article discusses several problems with chief executive officer (CEO) PA and the contemporary approaches that seek to improve it. Three fundamental areas for evaluation are identified: (1) organizational success; (2) areawide health status; and (3) professional role fulfillment. These provide an outline for successfull healthcare PA. III addition to a discussion of the strategic considerations behind a successful CEO Ph system, several recommendations are offered for the implementation of the annual evaluation process. The final goal of CEO Ph is to link its results to CEO incentive compensation. It is strongly recommended that some portion of the CEO's salary directly hinge on his performance in two critical areas: organizational effectiveness and community health status.

J	Stading, G; Flores, B; Olson, D				Stading, G; Flores, B; Olson, D			Understanding managerial preferences in selecting equipment	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity management; empirical research; measurement and methodology; operations strategy; multiattribute utility analysis	MANUFACTURING STRATEGY	Industry continues to look for methods of gaining competitive advantage through manufacturing techniques. These techniques, however, can be matched by competitors if used without the guidance of a strategic framework. Similarly, structural capacity choices can be matched by competitors without the infrastructural benefits of a well defined operations strategy. In this study, multiattribute utility (MAU) theory analysis was used in an experiment to quantify the contribution of various structural and infrastructural strategic factors toward sustaining competitive advantage within the context of a capital equipment selection decision. The experimental respondents were manufacturing managers and professionals from the plastics industry. This research provides groundwork for understanding the role of strategic infrastructural factors in sustaining competitive advantage within the structural capacity decision of selecting capital equipment in the plastics industry.

J	Bangerter, A				Bangerter, A			Self-representation - Conversational implementation of self-presentational goals in research interviews	JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							PSYCHOTHERAPY; MANAGEMENT; TACTICS	One way of implementing self-presentational goals in conversation can be termed self-representation (SR) that is explicitly referring to attributes, actions, or qualities of the self: SR is studied as a form of self-disclosure. Studying spontaneous SR in natural discourse implies analyzing how the self is introduced into talk previously focused on another topic. Descriptive analyses of cases from the present corpus focus on describing SR sequences and explaining them according to the interactional circumstances of their production. Three forms are discussed: (a) elicited SR, where predetermined questions on the interview agenda lead to more talk about oneself; (b) emergent SR, which is a response to an unforeseen conversational situation; and (c) strategic SR, where self-talk can be attributed to a conversational goal on the part of the narrator. Discussion focuses on the nature of SR as a sensitive topic and related implications of the data for interview methodology.

Once new information system architecture is in place, the flow of information is altered leading to organizational change. This study explores the use of information engineering methodologies at 45 organizations in different industries and the resulting organizational changes, The results of this study indicate that organizations that have exhibited greater organizational change (particularly in terms of business functions and processes) employ information engineering methodologies more.

J	Hoffman, JJ; Williams, RJ; Lamont, BT; Geiger, SW				Hoffman, JJ; Williams, RJ; Lamont, BT; Geiger, SW			Managerial tenure and recovery following M-form reorganization in diversified firms	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article							TOP-MANAGEMENT-TEAM; MULTIDIVISIONAL STRUCTURE; ORGANIZATIONAL-STRUCTURE; TRANSACTION COST; STRATEGIC CHANGE; CEO TENURE; PERFORMANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; DYNAMICS; OUTCOMES	We identify two factors that affect how quickly highly interdependent diversified firms recover from the performance disruptions that typically accompany M-form reorganizations: (1) organizational tenure and (2) the tenure of top management teams. We find that top management teams with a rare combination of long organizational tenure and relatively short ream tenure are associated with faster performance recovery in diversified firms with extensive business unit interdependencies. The effects of managerial tenure on recovery time were found to be inconsequential in unrelated diversified firms where the reorganization task is less complex. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Companies of all types and sizes, particularly in the manufacturing sectors are finding that their survival in the market place is increasingly in doubt. What has been lacking is a robust solution in terms of new methodologies, techniques and tools to meet their own particular challenging needs. Some of the three-letter acronym programmes such as TQM, JIT, BPR and DFM are not highly effective because employees did not focus on those issues of strategic importance and significance in the market. This paper explores the role that a set of strategic functions plays in the long-term success of a company.

J	Kuprenas, JA; Chinowsky, PS; Harano, W				Kuprenas, JA; Chinowsky, PS; Harano, W			Strategic planning in public sector engineering organization	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION	In today's engineering and construction industries, the concepts of company loyalty, traditional competitors, and employee development are changing at a pace that has not previously been encountered in postindustrial times. In response to these changing concepts, private and public organizations alike are increasing their emphasis on long-term or strategic planning. This paper introduces strategy planning, describes the expected results of strategic planning efforts in engineering and construction organizations, and provides a case study illustration of the process for the City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Engineering (a 1,000-person public sector architectural and engineering organization). The case study describes the seven steps used by the Bureau starting with building a strategic planning team to ending with evaluation of the implementation effort. Lessons learned from the case study are used to identify several recommendations for future planning efforts in the area of strategic planning.

J	Hill, PS				Hill, PS			Bilateral health aid: lessons from Europe	AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							MANAGING EXTERNAL RESOURCES; SECTOR; COORDINATION; MANAGEMENT	Objective: The objective of this study is to document current issues in policy and planning for development assistance in health from the perspective of key bilateral aid donors in Europe, and to explore its relevance for Australia. Methodology: This study is based on seventy-seven interviews and documentary analysis undertaken between July and December 1999 with policy, technical and field staff of major European bilateral aid donors. the World Health Organisation (WHO), and key academic institutions. Notes were taken of interviews. and relevant documentation collected. Forty-five key interviews were tape recorded and transcribed for analysis. Results: The shift towards program and Sector Wide Approaches in development assistance reflects broader political changes in Europe since the collapse of the Communist block. increasingly, achieving an impact on poverty is seen as linked to better governance, improved policy frameworks. and collaboration between donors and partner governments, and between donors themselves, reflected in the broad support for Sector Wide Approaches to development assistance. Conclusions: These perspectives bring new demands to donors such as Australia: structural changes. procedural changes, collaborative approaches to programs, closer relationships with counterparts. Implications: The uncertainty in which health sector reform operates necessitates a reflective and adaptive approach to management of aid, and responsiveness to monitoring and evaluation and the development of new knowledge. Given Australia's strategic positioning in its sphere of influence, the experience from Europe should inform the development of our own future directions.

J	Jansson, I				Jansson, I			Popularity structure in friendship networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORKS; CENTRALITY; BETWEENNESS; GRAPHS	A model of popularity structure in social networks is introduced where popularity is viewed as a latent attribute of the individuals in the network. The group of individuals is assumed to have a latent popularity structure, composed of individuals from different popularity groups. An individual is assumed to choose other individuals within its own group or within groups of more popular individuals. The model is illustrated using a data set where sociometric choices are measured on children in a number of school classes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bancroft, DRE; Gopinath, C; Kovacs, AM; Rejto, LK				Bancroft, DRE; Gopinath, C; Kovacs, AM; Rejto, LK			A new methodology for aggregating tables: Summarizing journal quality data	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING			English	Article							BUSINESS POLICY SCHOLARS; EMERGING FORUM; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT	Often successive studies are conducted to rank items across time or across different raters. For instance, different consumers may be asked to rank products, or banks may be ranked at different points of time based on their lending practices. In such cases, a simple model would suggest arriving at a summary set of rankings by averaging across the sets. However; when the rank of an item is missing in some of the sets, a simple mean cart produce a biased result. This is because the absence of an an item in a particular set may be important information that is being ignored. MacMillan conducted a series of studies to identify a forum for publishing business policy research, the most recent of which appeared in this journal. The design of the study involved two stages of selection: first, the journals were to be voted into a set, and second, they were to be ranked by a panel of scholars. This procedure resulted in some of the journals not appearing in every study. Thus, taking a simple average across the studies would result in misleading information, because the absence of journal in a particular study is information that is important (because the panel chose not to vote it into consideration) but lost in averaging. One of the objectives of the MacMillan studies was to provide scholars with information about the importance of the journal as a publication outlet. Thus, it is important to be able to arrive at a summary set of rankings to provide cumulative information. To achieve this, a left-censored model was developed. Assuming that the ranks follow a normal distribution, with unknown mean and the same variance, maximum likelihood estimates of the means were calculated.. The summary set of ranks were then calculated using these estimates. The summary ranks were compared with those arrived at fi om an independent estimate of journal quality and found to have validity. Our model helps enhance the value of the MacMillan studies by providing cumulative information on the journals and facilitating their comparison with other studies. We see the applicability of the model in other areas too. Known by the generic term of league tables, such sets of data are generated in marketing research, educational studies, etc. Thus, the model is an important contribution to the tool kit of empirical research.

The selected core design is based on extensive researches for the possible enrichment gains over various design options and in-care fuel management strategies. As a result; an economic and safe uranium metallic fuelled core design is established in the equilibrium cycle. Further optimization has been achieved by applying strategic loading schemes for initial and transition cycles to reach the target equilibrium cycle early. An iterative method has been developed to find initial core enrichment splits. With non-uniform feed enrichments at the initial core adopted, this iterative method shows the core can reach the uranium equilibrium cycle after just five reloads, keeping the feed enrichment unchanged from Cycle 2. Reactivity parameters are evaluated to assure the safety characteristics of this design at both BOC and EOC of the initial care and the equilibrium cycle core. The transition cycle analysis indicated that recycling of serf-generated plutonium alone is not sufficient to make the designed reactor a pure plutonium equilibrium core even after 56 reloads.

J	de Reuck, J; Schmidenberg, O; Klass, D				de Reuck, J; Schmidenberg, O; Klass, D			A reconceptualisation of Decision Conferencing: towards a command methodology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision Conferencing; group communication; shared understanding; contemporary management		Decision Conferencing can be viewed as comprising two major elements: (a) the decision modelling component and (b) the process of group communication and facilitation in which the modelling is embedded. Whilst the former has a theoretical foundation in Decision Theory, the process of group communication and facilitation in which the modelling is embedded is, we argue, seriously under-theorised. It is therefore open to different interpretations, depending upon the assumptions held by individual facilitators about the nature of groups and their facilitation as well as about the process of communication within groups. This paper sets out to augment the current theories underpinning Decision Conferencing. The discussion relates to Decision Conferencing as applied to strategic planning. The proposed theoretical framework draws on Habermas' theory of communicative rationality by developing a command methodology. Implications of this formulation are described and discussed.

Even though Large Enterprises (LEs) are integrating IT into their practices, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are much slower in assimilating IT. The first part of this analysis will demonstrate Japan's global position in IT in terms of production and diffusion, discussing the current direction of informatization in Japan. The second section will illustrate the critical relationship between Japan's technology spillover production growth, and RED showing that this process is partially accountable for Japan's current economic stagnation. The third section will show that information technology diffusion plays a critical role in this process. The final section will deal exclusively with the micro-causes of this imbalance demonstrating a disparity of IT diffusion in SMEs and LEs. This critical faultline in Japan's transition to an information-based society has relevant policy, economic and corporate implications for strategic national decisions.

J	Hoffman, JJ				Hoffman, JJ			Evaluating international ethical climates: A goal programming model	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article							BELIEFS; BEHAVIOR; MANAGEMENT; PHILOSOPHY	A critical concern for firms pursuing international expansion strategies involves identifying countries that offer a good fit with the firm's overall ethical orientation. Unfortunately, little has been written to aid firms in identifying countries that offer this type of fit. This paper presents a model that combines the concepts of strategic management, cross-cultural management, business ethics, and the management science technique of goal programming. The purpose of the model is to aid managers in identifying countries for international expansion that offer the best fit with the firm's ethical orientation. The paper also extends the existing literature on crosscultural management and business ethics by applying a computer optimization model to evaluate potential countries for international expansion in a way that has not been done before.

The findings have identified the weak areas and reveal that inspite of appreciating necessity of top management commitment for quality the effort has been diluted by delegation. This is further aggravated by functionally structured organization due to lack of holistic view, and shared vision. Existing organizational structure models are not suitable in spasms of change and require refinement. The performance appraisal system is generating internal competition and definite action plan is needed on this front. The paper also suggests strategic options & possible action plan for maximum benefit. The thrust areas identified are refinement of functionally structured model, modification in performance appraisal system, effective change in the environment, culture and attitude of people through training and HRD efforts, The paper also presents a summary of various issues facing the Indian Industry. Significance: The work has helped in identifying critical success factors, to achieve sustained growth in competitive environment. The finding provides additional knowledge, which will help India and other countries in developing and refining their approach for successful quality improvement. The findings will also facilitate development of realistic model for achieving corporate excellence.

J	Benaroch, M				Benaroch, M			Knowledge modeling directed by situation-specific models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article							EXPERT SYSTEMS; LANGUAGES	Clancey (1992) proposed the model-construction framework as a way to explain the reasoning of knowledge-based systems (KBSs), based on his realization that all KBSs construct implicit or explicit situation-specific models (SSMs). An SSM is a rational argument that explains the solution produced for a specific problem situation pertaining to a target application task (e.g. SSMs constructed for typical diagnosis tasks are causal arguments having the structure of a proof). From a knowledge engineering perspective it makes sense that the notion of an SSM should play a major role in the modeling of tasks. Motivated by this view, we present a structured knowledge modeling methodology called SSM-directed knowledge modeling (SSM-DKM). In SSM-DKM, an SSM is a central structure that drives the entire modeling endeavor. In light of this fact, we explain how SSM-DKM supports three main stages in the knowledge engineering process-conceptualization, formalization and validation and instantiation-and illustrate the application of SSM-DKM to a medical diagnosis task. The knowledge model that SSM-DKM produces for a target application task has two appealing traits. First, the model embodies explicit knowledge about the ontology of SSMs that the task entails creating as solutions, thus enabling the construction of a KBS that makes these SSMs explicit. Second, the model captures strategic (or problem-solving) knowledge in declarative terms pertaining to the ontology of SSMs created for the task. Both these beneficial traits have been illustrated in the context of ACE-SSM, a KBS architecture that constructs explicit SSMs (Benaroch, 1998). (C) 1998 Academic Press.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a model that focuses on this particular decision-making problem. Simplifications and approximations introduced at the operational level permit two key issues to be addressed: (1) where should AMS be implemented; and (2) when should this implementation occur. The model is shown to have good structure for a simplified analysis, thus making it particularly useful in instances where only rough estimates of costs are available and extensive 'what if' type analyses are therefore required.

J	Cooke, J				Cooke, J			Cost issues in sequential therapy	JOURNAL OF INFECTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Switch Therapy	FEB   22, 1997	GLASGOW, SCOTLAND				INTRAVENOUS ORAL CIPROFLOXACIN; RESPIRATORY-TRACT INFECTIONS; COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA; ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY; STEPDOWN PROGRAM; ANTIBIOTICS; CEFTAZIDIME; CEPHALOSPORINS; METRONIDAZOLE; RANITIDINE	Pharmacoeconomics is starting to be employed in strategic therapeutic decision making. Costs associated with antimicrobials included: (i) acquisition costs; (ii) preparation, administration and consumables costs; (iii) monitoring costs; (iv) costs of unwanted drug effects; (v) costs of resistance and therapeutic failures and (vi) costs of duration of stay. Most hospitals have a Drug and Therapeutics Committee but acquisition costs are still the most important economic criterion for acceptance for use, even though medicines only consume between 3 and 5% of total revenue costs, of which antibiotics account for around 15%. In any sequential programme acquisition costs and consumables are immediately realizable. Staff time and monitoring tests are less realizable but require changes in the way budgets are handled. Microbial resistance and risk management are difficult to quantify but are increasingly becoming important in strategic decision-malting. The educational needs of health care decision makers in economic need addressing and mechanisms need to be put in place to enable the putative savings reported in the pharmacoeconomic literature to be realized.

J	Fowler, A; Wilkinson, T				Fowler, A; Wilkinson, T			An examination of the role of the information systems centre	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						information systems centre; centralization; decentralization; role selection model	ORGANIZATION; POLICY; MODEL	This research examines the role of the corporate-centre in the formulation and implementation of an information systems strategy. The approach is inspired by recognition of an established parallel model, available for role prediction in general corporate management. Existing IS strategy models are evaluated for applicability against the role-prediction criterion but found to be inexplicit in this respect. A number of potential roles, for the IS centre, are therefore defined and evaluated in the light of literature sources and field research undertaken through interviews with senior IS managers in a small group of technologically oriented organisations. By this process the framework for a predictive model, suitable for discussion and analysis of IS roles at executive level, is derived and critically evaluated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The client in the case varied by cognitive capacity (impaired or intact), behavior problem (physical aggression, verbal disurption, or noncompliance), and living situation (nursing home or family home). Participants rated sir types of psychotherapy treatments with Kazdin's Treatment Evaluation Inventory: person-centered therapy, strategic family therapy, transactional analysis, play reading, group therapy and purposeful activity All treatments were considered acceptable by these older respondents; however person-centered therapy was rated the most acceptable. These treatments were also rated as slightly more acceptable for cognitively intact cafe clients than for impaired ones. Treatment ratings varied according to the case client's living situation (i.e., nursing home or family home).

Where should it be placed in the organisational structure and who should it report to? These issues inevitably raise the questions of accountability, coupled with that of charging For OR services. It is this issue in particular, whether to charge or not to charge for OR services, that the paper seek to explore.

Through these cloned enclaves, tiny Singapore aims to control change and restructuring in Asian economic environments, and thereby its own destiny. The first section elaborates on Singapore's regionalisation drive and Virtual Singapores. The ensuing section identifies the strategic goals for internationalizing Singapore Incorporated, the alliance of stakeholders that guides governmental policy in Singapore. The final section discusses the implications of the Virtual Singapores for competitive environments, as well as for organizational and structural changes in the Asia Pacific.

J	Lucchini, N				Lucchini, N			European technology policy and R & D consortia: the case of semiconductors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						co-operative R & D; European competitiveness; semiconductors; technology policy	COMPETITION; COOPERATION; INNOVATION; ANTITRUST; INDUSTRY	Government policies have played a decisive role in the semiconductor industry since it was born. They evolved during the 1980s as a result of the pressure exerted by innovation and R&D. Governments were forced to re-direct their policies at that time to develop 'technology policies' in an industry considered to be strategic. This sector is encouraged and actively supported, which leads to co-operative initiatives among (national) firms. Many public R&D programs now exist in most countries. This paper deals with technology policy and collaboration in the European semiconductor industry. It demonstrates that R&D consortia are mainly viewed as a means to improve Europe's competitiveness and to catch-up with foreign competitors. We briefly discuss the impact of co-operative research on restoring the competitiveness of European semiconductor firms.

Further, significantly different motivations explain domestic and cross-boundary alliances. In addition, strategic behaviour theory and synergy explain strategic alliances of both kinds better than transaction costs theory or mimetic theory. Finally, certain types of strategic alliances progress more smoothly than others. The study offers a number of avenues for future research.

J	Udo, GJ; Kick, RC				Udo, GJ; Kick, RC			The determinants of the critical success factors of information systems downsizing	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							PATH-ANALYSIS	Competitive advantage in the information age is based, in large part, on a firm's capability to acquire and use quality information as well as effective and efficient services, with its information technology resources at the least possible cost. One possible strategy for improving the cost-performance ratio of information technology resources is known as downsizing. The downsizing effort is a strategic move that is believed by many organizations to be capable of yielding significant benefits. It can also be a costly endeavour which may leave a firm worse off. Therefore, careful planning and control must be exercised if information systems downsizing is to succeed. This paper reports the results of a study whose purpose is to identify and explain the critical success factors for a downsizing effort. Results of the study show that information systems downsizing may produce benefits such as improved information systems, improved organizational structure, higher productivity, and lower cost. The results also indicate that downsizing success is dependent upon complex linkages of communications, action plans, needs for downsizing as perceived by employees, and the specific method of downsizing used.

J	Abduli, MA				Abduli, MA			Solid waste management in Guilan Province, Iran	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article								The main objective of this paper is to analyze the present status of solid waste management (SUM) in the Guilan Province of Iran and subsequently to draw up a comprehensive strategic plan for SWM in urban areas. Solid waste samples from the city of Rasht were subjected to physical and chemical analysis for one year. Despite the high percentage of putrescible materials (80 percent) in the waste stream, composting is not recommended because of the high expenditures required, the unavailability of market for composting product in the vicinity, and the climate. Use of incinerators would face the problems of the high moisture content (>60 percent) and low calorific value of the solid wastes, as well as the large capital investments required. In spite of land scarcity, sanitary landfilling is found to be the best alternative for disposal of municipal solid wastes in the Province of Guilan. Adequate liners (either natural or synthetic) and facilities to treat leachate are required. Practical aspects of the solid waste management system in Guilan are described.

These key issues are evaluated from the experience of a recent and comprehensive national strategic study involving detailed consultation with many stakeholders with an interest in groundwater resources. Such balances are not easy to achieve because groundwater systems are complex to analyse and slow to respond to change, resulting in considerable uncertainty in assessment and prediction without in-depth research and high-resolution monitoring. Current institutional and regulatory arrangements for the water sector in England and Wales do not appear to be achieving the best possible use of aquifer storage and optimal investment in groundwater protection.

J	Scarbrough, H				Scarbrough, H			Making the matrix matter: Strategic information systems in financial services	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article							MANAGEMENT	This study draws on findings from a sample of large Scottish-based financial institutions to examine the development and impact of innovative 'strategic information systems'. It contrasts prescriptive, discourse-based and institutional models of strategic IS (information systems) with a social constructionist approach. In this approach, the development of strategic IS is viewed in terms of IS functions' attempts to construct new ways of classifying and justifying IT investments. Such attempts are seen partly as a response to the dynamics of interprofessional competition, and partly as a means of handling the uncertainties of a shifting technological and sectoral environment. The case studies - which encompass remote banking, management information and branch network applications - highlight the impact of the new strategic vocabulary on the development and management of IS projects. The emergence, aims and eventual success or failure of such projects is seen to be closely linked to the parallel development of new ways of classifying IS work. The cases further demonstrate the role of both the institutional and sectoral context and the internal structuring of expertise (principally the role of the IS function within the management structure) in favouring or inhibiting the new categories of action associated with the strategizing of IS. The paper concludes by suggesting that institutionalized forms of classification may not only provide the most enduring legacies of new management paradigms, but may also stand as the greatest barriers to their success.

J	Bacon, M				Bacon, M			HSE policy on decommissioning and radioactive waste management at licensed nuclear sites	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article								In the UK, radioactive waste management and decommissioning on a licensed nuclear site is regulated by the Health and Safety Executive. The same legislative framework used for operating nuclear power stations is also applied to radioactive waste management and decommissioning activities. This provides a continuous but flexible safety regime until there is no danger from ionizing radiations. The regulatory policy is discussed, taking into account the implications of the 1995 White Paper reviewing radioactive waste management policy. For both radioactive waste management and decommissioning the key element of HSE policy is the need for strategic planning. This should ensure that problems are not allowed to build up and to demonstrate that, taking into account all factors, the proposed actions are the optimum in terms of safety There is a presumption in HSE's policy towards disposal of radioactive waste as soon as possible where disposal routes exist. Where long-term storage is necessary passively safe forms are preferred over those requiring continuous monitoring or frequent intervention.

J	Abetti, PA				Abetti, PA			Convergent and divergent technological and market strategies for global leadership	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Apple Computer; General Electric; high-tech marketing; MapInfo; market strategy; Motorola; Rhone-Poulenc; role of technology; technology strategy; Toray; Toshiba		This paper analyses the technological and market strategies of eight technology-intensive companies (5 American, 2 Japanese, 1 European) that have achieved global leadership through strategic focus. Both technological and market strategies are divided into two broad categories: (I) convergent; (2) divergent. Therefore, four strategy clusters could occur. A convergent technology strategy is defined as the development and synergistic integration of all technologies necessary to achieve worldwide leadership for a new product. A typical example is the first laptop computer by Toshiba. A divergent technological strategy is defined as the development of alternative technologies, related or unrelated, that will assure leadership in a given market. A typical example is General Electric Medical Systems. A convergent market strategy is defined as the utilization of all marketing efforts to gain worldwide leadership in a specific market segment, as for example General Electric Medical Systems. Finally, a divergent market strategy is defined as targeting a broad spectrum of customers across many industries, with a great variety of diverse applications. A typical example is the Toray Company of Japan which has achieved worldwide leadership in the application of carbon fibres. The paper discusses the characteristics of the four strategy clusters, their applicability on a contingency basis, and their impact on corporate strategy and organization. Guidelines for practical implementation are offered, which appear to be applicable within the triad of North America, Western Europe and Japan.

J	Akkermans, H; Bertrand, W				Akkermans, H; Bertrand, W			On the usability of quantitative modelling in operations strategy decision making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						case studies; modelling; operations; simulation; strategy		Quantitative modelling seems admirably suited to help managers in their strategic decision making on operations management issues, but in practice models are rarely used for this purpose. Investigates the reasons why, based on a detailed cross-case analysis of six cases of modelling-supported strategic decision making. In several of these cases, effective strategic decision making was achieved despite unfavourable technical contingencies, such as a lack of quantitative data, or low tangibility of the issue at stake. This suggests that such technical conditions cannot be crucial for effective model-based support. However, no case was found where good overall results were achieved under adverse organizational conditions, such as low quality of communication between stakeholders during the modelling/decision-making process and low ownership with these stakeholders for the resulting model and its implications. This suggests that such organizational contingencies are indeed crucial for effective model-based support. The modelling method described achieved good communication and ownership by operating in process-oriented consulting mode, where client participation in group model-building sessions played a central role.

In these contexts, it is vital that the strategic aspects of the document management decision-making processes and the user and functional requirements of document management are fully understood prior to consideration of shorter term implementation decisions. This paper goes some way to providing guidelines on addressing these issues through the development of a structured approach to engineering document management, coupled with the specification of generic process and data models which can form the basis for developing company-specific strategies, plans, models and requirements before committing to investments in technology to implement solutions. The paper is therefore specifically aimed at those engineering, production, project and quality managers within manufacturing companies who have the responsibility for implementing data and document management systems. Relationships with relevant standards and technology, and future issues are briefly discussed.

A set of hypotheses are tested through analyzing the data obtained from one hundred and twelve technology-based companies with R&D activities, Australian R&D managers generally perceive that consistency with customer requirements, a firm's competitive strategy and the competitive market environment is critical for strategic R&D decision making. They also believe that R&D decisions must take into account both current technological trends and a firm's resources and capability, Australian companies, while taking advantage of government tax incentives for industrial R&D, do not regard such incentives as key to formulating corporate R&D strategies.

J	Southon, FCG; Braithwaite, J; Lorenzi, NM				Southon, FCG; Braithwaite, J; Lorenzi, NM			Strategic constraints in health informatics: Are expectations realistic?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information systems; health management; patient; professional; strategy	MEDICAL INFORMATICS; SYSTEMS	In response to demands to enhance the efficiency and accountability of health systems, a range of different information technologies are being promoted. These technologies include integrated hospital systems, community health information networks and data repositories. However, the record of such technologies inside and outside the health industry suggest that such technologies cannot necessarily be relied on. The reason identified is that information systems are inherently logical and rational systems, and often come into conflict with the less rational social systems of organizations. Health information is identified in terms of three basic dimensions of information; that associated with managers; with professionals; and, with patients. The information of these dimensions are focused on very different objectives, have different structures and functions and are controlled by very different social processes. The information is also very complex and diverse within the dimensions. In the clinical encounter the clinician draws on specialist expertise, satisfies administrative requirements, and provides a clinical record. Thus, these dimensions converge at that point. However, collecting information is costly, and an efficient service demands economy in data collection. However, the technologies being promoted demand 'complete' data acquisition based on consistent and stable data definitions and data structures. The article argues that there is, thus, a conflict between the requirements of these technologies, and the realities of providing efficient services within a changing organizational, professional and social environment.

In this paper (Inkpen and Choudhury, 1995), we argued that strategy absence should be viewed as a legitimate phenomenon of interest. Bauerschmidt maintained that we failed to instill a new strategy paradigm and challenged our arguments as a rhetorical ploy. Unfortunately, Bauerschmidt misinterpreted our intended message. Although we challenged the conventional wisdom that every firm must have an articulated strategy, instilling a new paradigm was not our objective.

J	Eisley, N; Tang, MT				Eisley, N; Tang, MT			The middle path: Dealing with transformation in Asia's information technology competitiveness experience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								While the past two decades of literature have managed to establish reengineering and retention of the status quo as the two alternate poles for corporate strategic planning. the consideration of these 'All or Nothing' tactics have resulted in a dearth of research in interim or more controlled strategies for business change. The majority of companies in Asia do not have the resources for rapid information technology (IT) or structural change; nor do they have reasons to implement such changes. Though they are not necessarily market leaders they do have a mandate for change. but such a mandate demands a more conservative and evolutionary development methodology. This paper discusses the issues which must be considered by such companies, reasons for choosing an evolutionary. middle-path development methodology. and strategies for effecting changes with limited resources. The paper concludes with a case study of the XYZ Corporation. a composite of 30 different companies. which attempts to describe many of the successful strategies applied by these companies in an attempt to improve their ii structures, increase their market shares. and maintain the flexibility which companies will need in order to survive in the future. It is hoped that this paper will serve as a prelude to further discussion of alternative business growth models for resource-limited organizations.

J	Schalow, DL				Schalow, DL			Setting stops with standard deviations	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The use of stop orders is widely accepted in the investment community. Where to set the stop is a key issue in the effective use of stops as a strategic device. Set too low, a stop exposes the investor to losses. Set too close to the current price, it may stop the investor out before a large price rise. This article suggests a methodology that allows investors to decide how much of each type of risk they are willing to accept. Once the risk level is decided, the method is stable, whatever the underlying volatility of the security.

From 1983 through 1988, the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) positions in the pharmacy department at a 468-bed medical center was reduced from 63 to 39.4. To cope with the challenge of a sharply reduced staff, the department established a permanent pharmacy-nursing task force, developed a pharmacy strategic plan, used total quality management, recruited the best staff possible when openings appeared, and held staff retreats. In addition, measures were taken to begin documenting all pharmacist clinical activities online. As data were accumulated, it became clear that more pharmacist involvement in patient care areas was needed and that more resources would be necessary to achieve that. Presentations were made to hospital administration to demonstrate the existing and potential contributions of the department; the presentations drew heavily on the clinical documentation. Formal reports were also submitted. As a result, the department received approval for a pharmacist career ladder, an increase of 1.6 pharmacist FTEs for the evening shift, a large salary-range adjustment for staff pharmacists, and an increase of 1 pharmacist FTE to focus on antimicrobial use. A pharmacy department successfully used documentation of its clinical activities to make a case to administration for reclaiming some of the pharmacist FTEs lost through downsizing.

J	Powell, J; Goddard, A				Powell, J; Goddard, A			Cost and stakeholder views: A combined approach to evaluating services	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK			English	Article								This paper focuses on the decision-making process at a strategic level in the context of implementing a 'community care' policy for older people with mental health problems. It is based on the findings of an evaluative study of the implementation of one district health authority's strategy for the decentralization of its mental health services for older people. The study was an attempt to develop an evaluative approach which acknowledged the importance of cost, but also the need to include the views of the several 'interested parties', not least those who used the service. The reconciliation of what might be seen as the conflicting interests of the wider public for a careful utilization of resources with the individual's needs for an accessible and responsive service represents a major challenge for planners, managers and practitioners within the public sector. This paper argues the need for dialogue as the basis for partnership between those with a primarily financial focus to their work and those more intimately concerned with individual needs.

J	Cardoso, JA				Cardoso, JA			The multimedia content industry: Strategies and competencies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						multimedia content industry; multimedia publishing; competitive strategies; strategic management of core competencies		The impact of Multimedia in a variety of industry sectors is yet to be fully assessed. So far, the technological perspective has been dominant. Few studies exist dealing with Multimedia outside the telecommunications infrastructure sector, and the enterprises manufacturing components and equipment with multimedia capabilities. This paper focuses on the Content industry sector and is an attempt to identify the 'core competencies' that firms producing multimedia products should develop in order to be competitive. After reviewing the various elements of the Multimedia concept, the 5-Forces model of Michael Porter is used to carry out the structural analysis of the Multimedia Content industry. The value chain for the Multimedia Content producers is examined and the 'Bonsai' model of 'core competencies' is used for competitive advantage diagnosis. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the attractiveness of the sector and suggestions are made on the 'core competencies' deemed necessary, for the enterprises planning to become active in this area, to be successful competitors.

J	Evans, GN; Naim, MM; Towill, DR				Evans, GN; Naim, MM; Towill, DR			Educating the supply chain: An holistic approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS & PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						analyse simplify integrate automate; business process reengineering; change; supply chain management		Supply chain management is currently perceived as the means of enabling successful international competitive advantage. Considerable interest has been directed al strategic and structural levels on the cost implications of poor dynamic behaviour generated by delays, distortion and noise within various levels of the supply chain. While the principle of dynamic behaviour is recognised from individual in-house experiences, the effects on the total supply chain performance are less well known. With companies operating in increasingly competitive environments, there is an educational need to realise the consequences of in-house redesign strategies on the dynamics of the whole supply chain. Research by the Logistics Systems Dynamics Group (LSDG) in Cardiff has shown the value of using the Ingersoll Engineering adage of 'simplify - integrate - automate' in re-engineering supply chains. System simplification leads to considerable insight into the generating mechanisms of poor business operation which would be difficult to detect due to the original complexity. It is argued that systems integration must evolve at a strategic level, prior to automation. At the same time attitudinal changes instigated at the local level ensure the successful implementation management change.

In this phase, we have focused on the role of technology in international expansion in three industries which contain virtually the entire spectrum of possibilities from pure service to pure product-based firms. Yet this study demonstrates that their ability and success in incorporating technology has been remarkably similar. The availability of technological applications does not diminish the importance of developing and implementing a coherent overall business strategy. Globalization should not be driven purely by technological capabilities. If the front line operations of the firm are not compatible with expansion before the introduction of technology, they are unlikely to be so afterwards unless the technological innovation is specifically intended to address the limiting factor.

J	Millsap, RE; Taylor, R				Millsap, RE; Taylor, R			Latent variable models in the investigation of salary discrimination: Theory and practice	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Causal Modeling Conference	MAR 03-05, 1994	PURDUE UNIV, W LAFAYETTE, IN	Purdue Univ, Sch Management, Res Methods Div, Acad Management	PURDUE UNIV		INFERENTIAL CONDITIONS; MEASUREMENT BIAS; REGRESSION; ERROR	Statistical methods play an important role in salary discrimination litigation. Regression analysis is the most widely used method in this application. In regression analysis, group differences in salary are evaluated among employees who have been matched on measured ''merit'' variables (e.g., years of job experience). Difficulties often arise because important merit variables may be unmeasured, or because the available measures of merit are fallible. An alternative approach in this case lies in the use of several latent variable path models that have been proposed for the salary problem (Birnbaum, 1979; McFatter, 1987). The theoretical and practical implications of these models are discussed. The use the models is illustrated in real data.

It looks at the specific case of a European collaborative 'multimedia newspaper' project, with specific emphasis on the project's strategic methodology which draws on a systematic understanding of the nature of processes involved in the emergence of new technologies such as the 'multimedia newspaper'. This methodology treats the entire process as one of creating a multimedia-newspaper 'sociotechnical constituency' - in which major constituents are the final 'readers', and business organizations able to exploit the technology. A brief description of multimedia developments in the newspaper industry is included.

J	Srivastava, A; Prabhu, SS				Srivastava, A; Prabhu, SS			The role of corporate synergy accomplishment in determining performance of diversification strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic management; synergy; diversification; direct and portfolio risk	ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE; MERGER STRATEGIES; SYSTEMATIC-RISK; RETURN; MANAGEMENT; PARADOX; FIRMS; FIT	This study investigated the diversification-performance relationship for two five-year time periods. Although, there was no difference in the long-term performance of firms pursuing different strategies, improvements in long-term performance on both profitability and risk dimensions were possible for those firms that exploited unique advantages associated with their strategy. Portfolio synergy (risk education) was found to be a key determinant of total synergy (increase in profitability) for all diversification strategies. Direct synergies representing production and technical economies were associated with related constrained and related linked categories. Accomplishment of synergy is suggested as the moderating factor that influences the direction of the strategy-performance relationship. Implications for the practising manager are that diversification, irrespective of the type of diversification, can result in creating Value for the diversifying firm. However, such value creation is determined by the level of exploitation of the unique advantages associated with each strategy, like various synergies.

Technology assessments supported by such analysis have numerous advantages since future product performance is tied directly to anticipated customers, markets and competitors. This linkage imparts certain rigorous requirements upon any technology assessment method, however. Clear paths must be established between future product performance and today's technology investment choices. The technology assessment method must be flexible and adaptable, since 'future customer' requirements may change or unanticipated technologies may appear on the horizon. Finally, the technology assessment method must be practical. It must provide research and development (R&D) management with a clear decision tool that sheds light on issues such as the cost, development time and performance outcomes of choosing one set of technologies over another for a future product.

Releves were compiled in 33 stratified random sample plots, A default TWINSPAN classification based on total floristic composition, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed five plant communities and seven sub-communities, which all can be regarded as distinct ecological systems. Each of these plant communities may be regarded as a unique natural entity, each with its own species composition, specific environmental conditions and inherent forage production potential. The identification, hierarchical classification, description and ecological interpretation of these plant communities are not only essential for a comprehensive syntaxonomy of South African grassland vegetation, but may also serve as a basis for strategic planning of conservation areas, the preservation of biotic diversity and general veld management planning.

J	DUTTA, S; DOZ, Y				DUTTA, S; DOZ, Y			LINKING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO BUSINESS STRATEGY AT BANCO-COMERCIAL-PORTUGUES	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						STRATEGIC PLANNING OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT IN BANKING; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION		Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP) has grown to become one of Portugal's largest and most profitable banks in little over half a decade. Since its inception in May 1986, by mid-1993 it had around 300 locations, 4300 employees and the equivalent in Portuguese escudos of over $11 billion in assets. BCP's extraordinary growth has been marked by a series of innovations (remarkable for the Portuguese banking environment in the 1980s) including extensive research of client needs in the target markets, careful segmentation of the bank groups, the appointment of a personal account manager for each customer, rigorously designed and efficient branches and the rapid introduction of new banking products. Technology has played a critical role in enabling these innovations, such as strategic databases for prospecting and selling to clients, distributed processing with centralized data for the different bank groups, comprehensive information support systems for account managers, sophisticated automation in branches and the flexible and rapid deployment of systems to support new banking products. BCP is in many ways a leader in the strategic use of information technology (PT) among European banks. However, its leadership position arises less from the use of cutting-edge technology as from a deliberate attempt to link IT to its business strategy and built a competence in the business use of IT. This case study focuses on the management of IT within BCP and illustrates how BCP has successfully linked IT to its business strategy.

In this paper, we build on a study by Mitchell and Singh (1993) to test for differences in expansion effects, depending on whether the new goods substitute for old products and whether the firm is a generalist or specialist participant in the industry. The analysis helps us understand when a business can undertake major change successfully. The results have implications for ecological and other definitions of the core of a business and highlight the necessity for firms to undertake changes even at considerable risk to their existing operations.

J	CIMBALA, SJ				CIMBALA, SJ			DETERRENCE STABILITY WITH SMALLER FORCES - PROSPECTS AND PROBLEMS	JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH			English	Article							ATTACKS	Many scholars and policy-makers have assumed that reduction of US and Russian strategic nuclear forces to the lowest possible levels, perhaps to zero, is contributory to deterrence and crisis stability. This study tests a variety of reduced US and Russian nuclear forces, including hypothetical forces and START configurations, for their relative force advantage and for their ability to fulfil previously accepted standards of assured retaliation. It turns out that, as forces decrease towards very low levels, the Russian force falls behind the US force in operational flexibility and becomes much more vulnerable to surprise strikes without warning. Both forces maintain the ability to inflict historically unprecedented retaliatory damage even at the 1,000 warhead level, the lowest included here. The good news is that minimum deterrent forces rapidly run out of plausible targets, making them irrelevant for counterforce first strikes or for escalation dominance. The bad news is that minimum forces can become exclusively city attacking forces by default. Former adversaries now turned into potential partners in search of regional and global stability, the USA and Russia must safeguard the transition from a nuclear deterrence regime to a more disarmed world. The reduction of US and Russian arsenals to several hundreds of weapons is contributory to stability on the assumption that the British, French and Chinese nuclear weapons inventories undergo proportionate reductions also. A second assumption built into favorable prognoses for US and Russian reductions well below START levels is that nuclear proliferation can be constrained. Absent constrained proliferation and cooperative European and Asian nuclear powers, US and Russian force reductions below 1,000 warheads are ambiguously stable. Neorealist arguments in favor of well-managed proliferation understate the extent to which Cold War stability was overdetermined.

J	BLAU, PM				BLAU, PM			A CIRCUITOUS PATH TO MACROSTRUCTURAL THEORY	ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						BUREAUCRACY; FORMAL ORGANIZATION; MEMOIR RESEARCH; SOCIAL EXCHANGE THEORY		I introduce this memoir about my academic career by describing the fortuitous incidents involved in my coming to this country and becoming a sociologist. In graduate school my sociological orientation changed under the influence of Merton and Lazarsfeld from grand theories to systematic theory grounded in research. My dissertation was a field study of bureaucracy in terms of Weber's theory, which led to a book on exchange theory. Next I collaborated with Duncan on a nationwide study of occupational achievement and mobility, for which I learned regression analysis, reluctantly at first, but later becoming converted to it. During the next decade I conducted a research program on bureaucracy, specifically of quantitative studies of various types of formal organizations, from which I developed a limited organizational theory. The limitations of this theory prompted me to construct a formal macrostructural theory of population structure's influences on intergroup relations, which was subsequently tested in empirical research on the 125 largest metropolitan areas in the United States.

J	Elenkov, DS				Elenkov, DS			Executive insights: The Russian aerospace industry - Survey with implications for American firms in the global marketplace	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING			English	Article								This article highlights the factors that have made the global expansion of Russian aerospace enterprises possible and the importance of ''relational networks'' as key strategic assets of these companies. Russian aerospace organizations appear to have developed some distinct core competencies, such as state-of-the-art technology, capacity to manufacture high-performance products and systems at relatively low costs, and pragmatic management. These companies also pursue strategies leading to the use of a variety of different types of international strategic partnerships, including joint ventures, joint R&D agreements, co-production agreements, co-marketing alliances, and cross-licensing agreements. The article concludes with a section on the implications for American companies in the global marketplace. it is argued that international networking, technology sharing, co-marketing, cross-licensing, and the other forms of international strategic partnerships represent an important change in the ways that companies do business. These arrangements necessitate a different approach to corporate management and organization. The potential advantages of value-driven superstructures, cross-functional teams, cross-organizational task forces, and improved understanding of foreign cultures have been specified.

J	GUTIERREZ, LHS				GUTIERREZ, LHS			TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE HR FUNCTION IN THE CONTEXT OF RESTRUCTURING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER			English	Article						ALIGNMENT; BRAZIL; KAIZEN; METALS INDUSTRY; TOP MANAGEMENT; TRADE UNIONS		Considers the impact on the HR function of the strenuous restructuring and redeployment of resources brought about by the current need for organizational change. Argues that the transformation of the HR function, while interesting in itself as a research concern, is perhaps more usefully approached from the wider angle of the general transformation of the business environment. Organizational restructuring programmes invariably impose strategic decisions on and within the HR domain. The consequent changes, in turn, require a re-evaluation of the current HRM approach, together with modifications to behaviour and altered activities. Examines the choices facing HR managers through a study of the strategic decision-making process and the impact on it of major organizational restructuring. This approach exposes the options available for the re-orientation of HRM after organizational change. Develops a theoretical framework to address impacts on HRM in restructuring contexts and applies this contextual framework to-evaluate an empirical study of an industrial company of US origin, based in Brazil, which has undergone major structural change.

J	MCARTHUR, DN; SCHILL, RL				MCARTHUR, DN; SCHILL, RL			INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE TECHNOLOGY ARRANGEMENTS - IMPROVING THEIR ROLE IN COMPETITIVE STRATEGY	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article							MANAGING TECHNOLOGY; ALLIANCES; PERFORMANCE; ADVANTAGE	This article uses a strategic management perspective to examine ways in which firms may fail when undertaking international cooperative technology arrangements (ICTAs) between sovereign firms. Called by several names, e.g. strategic alliances, joint ventures, or cooperative engagements, these hybrid organizational forms have various degrees of engagement between partners and share a central mission of acquiring and/or exploiting new technology. The implementation of such a decision has serious implications for the strategy of the firm. Decisions regarding technology strategy are often driven by technologically oriented managers within the firm who may or may not include strategic issues in their consideration. This exploratory field research found that many European managers spent substantial amounts of time working to prevent disaster in ICTAs rather than concentrating on success and that from a strategic management viewpoint, success was difficult. From field interviews, personal experience, and the literature, this article develops several hypotheses about essential components for success in ICTAs, a strategic management framework of developmental and implementation issues, and suggests areas of future research.

By describing a firm's technology as an evolving competency system due to computer integration of tools and an external change in industry technology, the framework portrays it as an independent and strategic variable. By elaborating the foundations of strategy as both environmental and internal to a firm, the framework suggests that strategies can be deliberately planned based upon changes in manufacturing competencies or changes in the external environment. The emergent view of strategy is at the same time recognized. The paper offers an illustrative typology that can be used to examine whether different technologies are associated with different strategic orientations.

This study, based on Porter's (1980) generic strategy framework, theoretically evaluates three propositions which may be used to extend this work to the retail sector. This article examines the unique forces affecting the relationship between strategy and performance within the retailing industry. Based on prior research, the authors hypothesize that in terms of both financial performance and operating performance, retailers employing multiple strategies to attain competitive advantage will outperform those using a singular approach.

A variety of interorganizational relationships are possible: shared services, joint programs, umbrella organizations, health agency networks and mergers. As governments try to control health care costs, physicians will play an important role in developing and implementing these alliances. They will be expected to advocate on behalf of patients and communities to ensure that these new organizational arrangements facilitate coordinated care.

J	YARBOROUGH, CM				YARBOROUGH, CM			STRATEGIC QUALITY PLANNING	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; IMPROVEMENT; MANAGEMENT	Instilling the principles of total quality management (TQM) into organizations is a difficult undertaking, yet many leaders of health care organizations are forging this paradigmatic shift with encouraging results. In this paper, a practical approach is described that has been deployed within an occupational and environmental health setting. The vehicle for this transformation is called the Strategic Quality Plan. Once the purpose was clearly elucidated by the leadership, a basic design of the plan was developed that melded two interrelated goals: achieving strategic business objectives by applying quality principles. The resulting matrix became the basis for detailed flowcharts that show the steps, inputs, decision points, deadlines, and continuous improvement loops for each strategic objective. A deployment plan was developed to aid implementation.			YARBOROUGH, CM (corresponding author), EXXON RES & ENGN CO,POB 101,FLORHAM PK,NJ 07932, USA.

J	SALEM, M; MARTIN, OD				SALEM, M; MARTIN, OD			THE ETHICS OF USING CHAPTER-XI AS A MANAGEMENT STRATEGY	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article							BANKRUPTCY	In the past decade, the use of the Chapter XI has soared to the detriment of many creditors, workers, and consumers. A good number of cases were not based on imminent insolvency, but on firms attempts to avoid litigation claims against them, to terminate labor or other contractual obligations, or to gain new financing. These filings for Chapter XI highlight the use of bankruptcy as a strategic option used by management in running a viable organization. This usage is even advised by some academics and management consultants. While such uses may not be illegal, this paper questions the seeming ease with which a firm may use bankruptcy to escape contractual obligations to customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. It also questions the 'ethics' of the academics and management consultants who recommend such usage. Finally, the paper calls for a change in the law in order to minimize the opportunity for the unethical abuse of the bankruptcy law.

J	GRAINGERSMITH, N; OPPENHEIM, C				GRAINGERSMITH, N; OPPENHEIM, C			THE ROLE OF INFORMATION-SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY (IS/IT) IN INVESTMENT BANKS	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								Based upon a survey of the literature and a small-scale case study, this paper considers the role of IS and IT within investment banks. Do investment banks receive value for money from their investment in IT, and how can IT be evaluated for their contribution to profitability? The paper concludes that failure to implement techniques for systematically identifying and quantifying IT costs and benefits has made it difficult for them to determine the level of added value resulting from such investment and the contribution of IT towards the bottom line. The paper also considers what role technology plays in the strategic management process, and if a distinct IT/IS strategy is necessary. The paper concludes that it is essential to incorporate both information and IT strategy into the strategic management process, to ensure that IT is concentrated in those areas in which it can add most value. Finally, the paper considers the potential for deriving competitive advantage from IT. The paper concludes that IT generally performs only a support function and does not generate long-term competitive advantage. The paper further concludes that senior management's lack of awareness of, and belief in, the relevance of IT to corporate strategy, coupled with the failure to integrate IT strategy within the strategic management process, acts as a constraint upon realising the full potential of IT.

J	KARBHARI, VM				KARBHARI, VM			THE ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS - A VIABLE DECISION TOOL FOR COMPOSITE-MATERIALS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						COMPOSITES; DECISION-MAKING; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP); MANUFACTURING SCIENCE; MATERIALS SCIENCE	SUCCESS	With the development of integrated product design methodologies and the growing emergence of the field of manufacturing science, materials, both advanced (such as composites) and traditional (such as aluminium and sheet steel) are competing for applications. With the creation of a global economy, the importance of rapid decision-making, even when complete quantitative information is not available, is becoming increasingly evident. Methodologies for strategic decision-making are needed that will (a) develop deeper understanding of the problem under consideration, (b) improve decision-making quality through consistent, explicit and realistic sets of assumptions, and (c) lower overall systems costs through savings of resources. This paper highlights the use of Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a viable means for rapid decision-making in a concurrent engineering team. An example for the selection of manufacturing technologies for the fabrication of an automobile fender is used and it is seen that the AHP provides results consistent with those derived through more in-depth and time-consuming approaches, without any waste of precious time or resources, by using team expertise.

This paper examines the concept and measurement of competitiveness, the findings of several studies and some of the methodological issues involved in analyzing this phenomenon. While there is general agreement that the concept has most relevance at the level of the firm where it can be described as ''the ability to profitably gain and maintain market share,'' it has been applied mostly at the industry and country levels where there is less agreement on measurement and interpretation. This is reflected by a remarkable lack of consensus among studies of the Canadian food industry. The methodological issues most in need of being resolved are those relating to appropriate measurement and the relationship between strategic behaviour of firms and the determinants of competitiveness as found in the environment of firms.

MANAGERIAL REACTION TO TAKEOVER BIDS: A THEORY OF STRATEGIC RESISTANCE	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article								This paper develops a theory to explain the frequently observed resistance offered by the management of target firms to high-premium takeover bids. Contrary to the popular perception of managerial entrenchment at the expense of the shareholders' interests, such resistance may be strategically designed to increase shareholder wealth by threatening to initiate an informal auction process fur the target involving other potential bidders. Remarkably, this strategy can be effective even when it is common knowledge that the other bidders do not have a higher reservation price for the target. The analysis also offers insights into division of takeover gains and several other takeover-related issues.

Participants were 85 graduates of master's degree programs in foodservice management (1980 through 1988) from five universities. The research instrument contained three scales to assess 43 foodservice management concepts regarding relevance, educational preparation, and competence gained from other sources. Demographic information was also requested. The most commonly held present position was foodservice director. Graduates were most likely to be employed in health care facilities or colleges and universities. All concepts were rated as relevant to graduates' present professional responsibilities, and quality of educational preparation was rated satisfactory or better. Principal component analysis, using a varimax rotation, resulted in four factors, which were titled food production, management, organizational communication, and strategic thinking. Analysis of variance was conducted to determine whether differences existed in the factor scores on the basis of position title or graduate program attended. Foodservice directors rated the food production and management of organization factors more relevant to their present position than did clinical dietitians. Scores for quality of educational preparation for the four factors did not differ on the basis of graduate program attended.

J	CHIDAMBARAM, L; CHISMAR, WG				CHIDAMBARAM, L; CHISMAR, WG			MANAGING GLOBAL COMMUNICATION-NETWORKS - KEY CHALLENGES FOR THE NINETIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper is aimed at helping telecom executives understand and meet the challenges faced by multinational corporations operating in a rapidly changing global environment. Results from a survey of over 100 of the largest US multinational corporations (MNCs) and telephone interviews with over a quarter of these firms are discussed in the first half of the paper. The primary results from this two-step study were: (a) the type and intensity of telecom problems faced by MNCs are affected by both internal and external factors; (b) the deregulation of domestic telecommunication services has been a mixed blessing to US MNCs; and, (c) nations are imposing hidden communication costs on MNCs using a wide variety of legislation. The second half of the paper provides a detailed action plan for telecom managers to deal with these challenges. The primary audience for this paper includes practising telecom managers, information systems executives, strategic planners, network consultants and senior executives in global firms.

Describes the results of a questionnaire survey of 110 library authorities in England, Scotland and Wales, conducted by Leicestershire Library and Information Plan (LLIP), at the request of Library and Information Co-operation Council (LINC), to collect factual data concerning the levels of expenditure on books in the range of languages covered. Eighty-three of the 110 public library authorities responded, plus four of the regional library systems. Reports data for languages coverd by region (27 different lan guages); projected expenditure for each language for 1991-92; and the use of library co-operatives. Notes the commonest languages covered, the fact that the annual expenditure on purchase of such books exceeded 5000 pounds in only 13 authorities, and the services of co-operatives was valued. The need for further provision of languages from Western Europe was noted. On the basis of this interim report, the following five topics were identified as being worth further investigation: organizational structures, adequacy of provision; stock management; financial provision; and strategic issues. Concludes with prioritized recommendations to be built into a 3 year plan.			COOKE, M (corresponding author), LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT INFORMAT & LIB STUDIES,LOUGHBOROUGH,ENGLAND.

The relationship is most pronounced amongst senior managers and can lead to 'type homogeneity' in top management teams. This tendency of managers of a similar psychological type to congregate and form homogeneous enclaves has a number of implications for organizational effectiveness. Type homogeneity may have positive consequences such as team harmony and cohesion, as well as negative consequences like strategic myopia, unfairness in promotion and difficulty of culture change. These issues are discussed and explored to provide a deeper understanding of how type and culture interact and the resulting consequences for organizational effectiveness.

Total farm size averaged 220 ha, with an average market milk quota of 699 L/day (50% of total milk produced). One-third of producers described their farm activity as dairying only. Some 116 calves were born per farm, with a year-round calving distribution. Calves were fed 5.4 L whole milk/day, with an average age at weaning of 13 weeks (range 5-26 weeks). Mortality recorded to 3 months of age was 4% and the most important health problem associated with calf rearing was scours. Of those properties with a health problem, 25% used antibiotics on a regular basis. All producers provided supplementary feed preweaning. In the period between weaning and mating, more than half the producers ran heifers on paddocks 3-80 km distant from the main farm, with hay the most common form of supplementary feed. Most dairy heifers were naturally mated to Hereford, Friesian, or Angus sires; hence, few heifers from first calvers were kept as dairy replacements. Average age at first calving was reported to be 30 months, with 1 in 9 heifers culled post-calving, generally for low milk production. The survey highlighted several aspects of heifer management with the potential to improve overall productivity of dairy farms in Western Australia. They include earlier weaning, strategic use of antibiotics to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, greater use of artificial insemination, and a reduction in age at first calving.

This paper examines the ways in which associations of public officials are helping to redefine public professionalism. The focus on the paper is on the promotion of professionalism by association activities, the sense of professional identity fostered by association involvement, and the ways in which associations integrate issues of policy, management, and professional expertise to contribute to the development of true public professionalism. The paper examines ways that professional/specialist and political/generalist associations are converging on issues of policy, strategic thinking, and role effectiveness.

Traditional cost accounting techniques have been criticized for their failure to adequately support decision making in an environment of ever shorter product life cycles. This is true especially for the information technology, the automotive and the chemical industries. On the basis of the 'Integrated Product Life Cycle' conceptual framework we expanded the design of our REMBA-prototype - a data and methods base for managerial accounting - to provide decision information and support from a strategic perspective. The paper describes this holistic approach to product accounting and gives an overview of the basic design elements of the underlying data and methods base. Two sample applications are presented in summary to give an idea of the thrust of the system.

J	WHYMARK, GK				WHYMARK, GK			DEVELOPMENT OF THE EIS CONCEPT AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE RAN	AUSTRALIAN COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						EIS; ESS; DSS; EDIS; MIS; INFORMATION ANALYST; IMPLEMENTATION; PROTOTYPING		Executive Information Systems (EIS) and Executive Support Systems (ESS) are a form of decision support system (DSS) for senior executives. This paper presents an overview of the EIS concept and its implementation in the Royal Australian Navy. The terms EIS and ESS are defined, and their relationship to other forms of decision support are discussed in terms of their purpose and function. The difference between management functions dealing with operational and tactical issues and those dealing with strategic issues are also addressed as these concepts are fundamental to the development of user oriented decision support systems. The development of the EIS concept as it would apply to a particular organisation is discussed and the methodology, pitfalls and successful strategies are described. The RAN has implemented an EIS and this report briefly discusses the development and implementation of an EIS drawing on that experience. Finally, the value of an EIS will be addressed, some observations will be made on the future of EIS and DSS, and recommendations put forward as to what research avenues could provide useful results.

To meet the LECs' objectives, AT&T has introduced its A-I-Net(TM) advanced-services-platform (ASP) products. AT&T's offering for the ASP supports the intelligent-network concept while still interworking with existing switch-based features. Thus, the LECs can maximize use of their previous investment in network-switching hardware and software while still offering new services through the ASP's distributed network intelligence. AT&T has also been working with the Regional Holding Companies and Bellcore to plan their Advanced Intelligent Network Release 1 architecture, which has been proposed as the next-generation, intelligent-network platform. Advanced Intelligent Network Release 1 makes possible an even wider variety of services than the ASP by defining a more flexible switch interface with a corresponding expansion of the communications interface between the switches and external-service-logic nodes. This paper describes the architecture, features, and services provided by AT&T's ASP as well as the new capabilities planned with Advanced Intelligent Network Release 1. We focus primarily on AT&T's 5ESS(R) switch features.

J	WIGHTMAN, KR				WIGHTMAN, KR			THE MARRIAGE OF RETAIL MARKETING AND INFORMATION-SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY - THE ZELLERS CLUB-Z EXPERIENCE	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						COMPUTER APPLICATIONS; ADMINISTRATIVE DATA PROCESSING MARKETING; MANAGEMENT OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS; PROJECT AND PEOPLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT; TRAINING		This paper examines the major influences and events that led to the creation and implementation of Club Z, a very successful frequent buyer program, by Zellers Inc., a Canadian mass merchandiser and a division of the Hudson's Bay Company. While the paper describes this major retailer's innovation in the adaptation of computer technology to store-level marketing, it also analyzes some of the significant aspects of the Club Z implementation from an IS management perspective: how a champion emerged to advocate and protect the project at the highest executive level; how an outside systems consulting firm was brought in to manage the Zellers IS function during the project life; and how the cultural problem of anticipated store resistance to the required new technology was overcome.

J	Shomenta, J; Kamp, G; Hanson, B; Simpson, B				Shomenta, Jack; Kamp, Gary; Hanson, Bob; Simpson, Brandon			The Application Approach Worksheet: An Evaluative Tool for Matching New Development Methods with Appropriate Applications	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Life cycle; selection criteria; application development; systems analysis and design; traditional; user developed systems personal computer		This article presents a method used by the Hennepin County Information Services development staff to help determine how best to use new development methods. The tool described and the method for using it were designed to help both data processing personnel and user personnel make the transition from using one development approach only, to a variety of approaches using new technologies and methods. In brief, the "Application Approach Worksheet" is a document used by mid-level and senior user management to identify, in data processing terms, the characteristics of a proposed application. Once the application's characteristics are defined, the user utilizes the worksheet's matrix to determine which development method might be most appropriate for the application. The completed worksheet and a work request then becomes the basis to propose development of the new application. At that point, an Information Services Department (ISD) project manager discusses the application with the user. Together, they agree on the new project's priority relative to other projects, and work out how the project will be handled in general. This article first describes the environment in which the "Application Approach Worksheet" was developed and the circumstances that led to its development. The article goes on to discuss how the worksheet was created and describes the criteria that form the heart of the document. Finally, the article describes how the worksheet is used and discusses the results of its use since it became a part of the work request process in January of 1983.

J	Doyle, JR; Becker, JD				Doyle, James R.; Becker, Jack D.			Computer Assisted Planning (CAP) at Dinero International Bancorporation	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Financial information systems; banking information systems; strategic planning; strategic information		This article describes three inter-related computer based systems that were designed and developed to assist with the implementation of a major long-term strategic planning effort at a multi-billion dollar bank holding company, Dinero International Bancorporation, (DIB). New strategies at DIB included: (1) a major redirection of its marketing efforts to a multi-state mid-western region in the U.S., and (2) to correspond with this new marketing direction, a major change in the bank's image, including a name change. The first system, the Regional Banking Information System (REBIS) was designed to extract key information from a 1G (gigabyte) bank database. With REBIS, DIB was able to monitor the level of banking activity in a designated region and to measure the performance and level of competition of over 1,000 selected banks with operations in this region. A second system, the SAS/Dunn and Bradstreet (D & B) system, was designed to analyze and plot key financial characteristics (sales, debt, etc.) of the more than 20,000 selected companies also in the region. Information pertaining to business activity by industry was plotted on maps of the region in order to identify the most desirable marketing opportunities.

Marketing the MIS During Times of Resource Scarcity	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Corporate computing facility; demarketing; marketing; marketing mix; marketing plan; resource shortage; marketing strategy; MIS manager; target market		MIS managers generally have not stressed the marketing aspects of their operations. A more widespread concern is with the shortage of systems analyst and programmer resources. In an effort to learn how one group of MIS managers views their marketing responsibilities and practices in a shortage era, a study was conducted and the results were used to describe both short term and long term MIS marketing plans. These plans are developed by identifying critical areas in the organization in light of corporate objectives, user needs, and MIS resources.

MANAGING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STANDARDIZED COMPUTER BASED SYSTEMS	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Systems implementation; governmental systems; user behavior; implementation management; organizational change		Systems development and implementation are traditionally approached as a process of designing and fitting a tool to its user's needs. Cases arise, however, due to economic constraints or the desire to standardize, in which an organization directs its subunits to implement a system "as is." In such a case, organizational change is mandated and must be managed as such. Certain units of the U. S. Forest Service have been successful in developing a process to manage the implementation of a standardized program planning system across multiple national forests. The process includes a systematic evaluation of the knowledge, skills, and/or attitude changes indicated for specific individuals in the implementing units. This in turn allows the selection of the most appropriate techniques to foster the changes. The results of these Forest Service efforts have been encouraging and offer some insights into the process of managing system implementation.
