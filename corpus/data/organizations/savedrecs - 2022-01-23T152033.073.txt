J	Westerhoff, GP; Pomerance, H; Sklar, D				Westerhoff, GP; Pomerance, H; Sklar, D			Envisioning the future water utility	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								This article presents the findings of a Malcolm Pirme Inc. 2004 national survey of 71 water utility industry experts with regard to their views on the future issues facing US utilities. The survey challenged respondents to predict the future and outline how utilities can best prepare themselves for upcoming issues. According to respondents, effective leadership and management are key to the success of the US utility industry. Respondents also suggested that leadership and management will be very different in the years ahead. The effective leader of the future will provide emotional direction-driving effective interpersonal relationships at all levels, strategic thinking-driving development of vision and planning and operational excellence, and business and technical leadership-driving complex financial and environmental decision-making. Key to this type of leadership in the future are succession planning, strategic planning, and asset management plan implementation today.-SH.

J	Seltsikas, P				Seltsikas, P			Can Europe's governments manage identity?	BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article								Since its inception, the concept of the internal market has been enshrined in the European Commission (EC) as '... an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty' [1]. Within this market, optimising the flow of movement across borders is no easy task, especially in today's age of heightened security fears. It falls to identity management in electronic government to play a vital role in making processes more effective by providing the mechanisms through which identities of citizens and businesses can be managed safely across Europe's borders. Nevertheless, despite the concerted efforts that have been made by individual member states to ensure security on a national level through the better management of identity, the same cannot be said on a pan-European basis. To date, there is little understanding or even consensus on how electronic identities could be managed by governments in a cross-border context. As a result, there is a very real need to take a look at the most prominent themes that are emerging from research in this area, particularly with reference to market activity as more and more software and solution vendors brand products for identity management (IdM). This paper examines the increasingly complex domain of pan-European IdM for electronic government. It is based on research conducted and compiled by the author, during the last 24-months, and provides a vendor-neutral high-level examination of the critical business challenges facing the EC today. The research is vendor-neutral and populated by data obtained using diverse forms of data collection. These include interviews, questionnaires and participant observations conducted with the involvement of 17 European Member States as well as relevant industry experts. The paper concludes with a suggested strategic roadmap for Europe's governments and technology implementors.

J	Edwards, R; Abraham, A; Petrovic-Lazarevic, S				Edwards, R; Abraham, A; Petrovic-Lazarevic, S			Computational intelligence to model the export behavior of multinational corporation subsidiaries in Malaysia	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							FIRM SIZE; MANDATES	The academic literature suggests that the extent of exporting by multinational corporation subsidiaries (MCSs) depends on their strategic role in the multinational corporation (MNC), their age and size, and whether their products are targeted at niche or commodity markets. In particular, it is claimed that MNCs seek to invest in a particular country if its resources adopt a vertically integrated structure, if the country grants regional or global sales mandates to their subsidiaries, or if it has been established in a host market for a longer time and is thus more likely to promote subsidiary exports. Our aim in this article is to model the complex export pattern behavior of multinational corporation subsidiaries in Malaysia using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system. The proposed fuzzy inference system (FIS) is optimized by using neural network learning and evolutionary computation. Empirical results clearly show that the proposed approach could model the export behavior reasonably well compared to a direct neural network approach.

J	Gibson, J				Gibson, James			A RESEARCH STRATEGY FOR INVESTIGATING BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT APPROACHES	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								We are witnessing a revolution in industry which, if successful, will change forever how business systems are developed and the type of staff required. This paradigm shift has only recently become possible as business process conceptual understanding evolved, technologies have matured and higher abstraction levels have become possible. Industry leads Business Processing Systems research as it has the strategic imperative and resources to be effective. Academic research is faced with three challenges: firstly, how to do effective research in an area of such broad scope, secondly, how to make research relevant to practice, thirdly how to spend limited resources effectively. This paper defines the research framework for effective academic research at the University of Wollongong by the Software Effective Process group. Effective research is enabled by co-ordinating research based on the primacy of the business model and its resultant effective representation in executable systems. The framework aims to build a core research team, promote strong synergy with existing research areas, and create academic and industry relevant research.. We report on the results to date of our pilot program and seek feedback and advice to help us refine our approach. A major Australian project is utilising a new software development lifecycle for 'system of systems' development which has arisen out of this research strategy. Later papers will report on both the theoretical basis and practical impacts of this work and other research by the group.

J	Jan, MMS				Jan, Mohammed M. S.			Pediatric neurologists in Saudi Arabia: An audit of current practice	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Pediatrics; child; neurology; audit; practice; Saudi Arabia		Pediatric neurological disorders are common and constitute up to 30% of children seen in general pediatrics. Information about the availability and practice of pediatric neurologists is vital for strategic planning of management of neurological disorders. The aim of this study was to audit current pediatric neurology services in Saudi Arabia and establish a correlation with regional population figures. Physicians practicing in the field of pediatric neurology in Saudi Arabia were identified and contacted. A structured 17-item questionnaire designed to examine their clinical practice was completed and validated by a follow-up interview. Thirty-two full-time hospital based pediatric neurologists were concentrated in the 3 most heavily populated regions of the country. Saudi Arabia as a whole had a ratio of 0.4 pediatric neurologists per 100,000 children <15 years of age given that 38.3% of the general population was <15 years at the time of the study. Pediatric neurologists had an average of 3 half-day clinics per week with an average of 13.4 patients per clinic. The ratio of follow-up visits to new patients was 3:1. Waiting times for a new non-urgent consultation ranged from 1-6 months (mean 3.4 months). Inpatient hospital admissions ranged from 1-20 (mean 6.5) per week with an average of 5.7 in-hospital consultations per week. Major deficiencies were identified in the availability of specialized nurses, occupational therapists, and psychologists. The study documents a significant shortage of pediatric neurologists in our country. The currently practicing neurologists are required to see many patients with long waiting lists and inadequate support services in many institutions. I feel that a strong demand exists to train and recruit more pediatric neurologists and that generalists and pediatricians need to continue to take a proactive role in the routine care of children with neurological disorders in Saudi Arabia.

However, this research has largely focused on large businesses, with little comparable data collected in the context of small businesses. This paper reports preliminary results from a pilot project investigating the relative importance of various IS concerns from the perspective of small business managers in the Albury-Wodonga region. Initial results confirm the operational focus of small business managers despite evidence of some concern with more strategic issues. In light of the preliminary nature of these findings, the paper concludes by identifying areas for further research.

J	Jentgen, L; Conrad, S; Lee, T				Jentgen, L; Conrad, S; Lee, T			Optimizing system operations	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								For many reasons, including growth, increasing environmental awareness, and mounting local, state, and federal regulations, managing a water system has become more complex. Having the right tools is essential to properly managing a water system in this environment. An operations optimization system is such a tool that offers water utilities a strategic opportunity to provide the most effective, overall management of operations. Implementation of an operations optimization System can be done over time with minimal initial investment. It addresses the entire water system, from the initial raw resource to the customer. Benefits may include lower energy costs for pumping; reduced cost of water supplies; consistent, high-quality water; and lower capital costs by coordinating operations optimization with water system planning.

J	Montalvo, UW; van de Kar, E; Maitland, C				Montalvo, Uta Wehn; van de Kar, Els; Maitland, Carleen			Resource-Based Interdependencies in Value Networks for Mobile E-Services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						e-services; interdependencies; mobile services; resources; resource-based view; partner; strategic position; value network		The advent of new electronic platforms, such as fixed and mobile Internet, is forcing firms from a range of industries to come together in so-called value networks for the provision of innovative e-services. Firms from different industries have widely varying resources. Our analysis is aimed at specific types of interdependencies, relating the actors' own and others' resource contributions to the value creation involved in bringing the service about. To better understand these interdependencies, we draw on theories about firm resources and interorganizational relations. We analyze the importance and relevance of different resources in a number of case studies of mobile information and entertainment services in terms of the actors' resources and contributions to value in the provision of such mobile services. In the cross-case comparison, we contrast the power structures in the different value networks and identify similarities and differences in terms of the types of industrial players that assume positions of greater or lesser importance. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for value network research.

J	Truong, D				Truong, Dothang			Methodologies for Evaluating Investment in Electronic Data Interchange	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Beer Game; electronic data interchange; investment assessment; simulation		Reluctance of organizations to invest in electronic data interchange (EDI, Internet-based EDI, and XML/EDI) is largely due to their inability to assess the return on these investments. We identify prescriptive and evaluative methodologies for analyzing investment in EDI: non-financial methods, purely financial methods, and financial and strategic consideration methods. We also show how computer simulation can be used as a tool for assessing EDI. Evaluating the benefits resulting from EDI implementation was illustrated through the well-known Beer Game. Our analysis and review also identifies difficulties involved in assessing the benefits of EDI in supply chains.

J	Abdelazim, MH				Abdelazim, Mohamed H.			The Role of Accounting Information in Organizations' Strategic Management	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES			Arabic	Article						Accounting information; Strategic management		Over the last two decades, there have been considerable changes in the business environment because of the use of information technology, modern communication means, and market globalization. Because of these changes, competition augmented and each organization started to search for the most efficient use of resources to dominate markets or at least to keep their market shares. To manage organizations in such complicated environments, managers need a lot of imperative precious information. Some arguments have been made regarding the ability of accounting systems to provide the new information requirements. This stimulated a stream of studies in an attempt to improve accounting systems and accounting information to serve the new management requirements. Some of these studies merged the accounting with the organizations' strategic management in a new theme called "Strategic Accounting". This paper concentrates on the concept of Strategic Accounting (SA) as a field and demonstrates how strategic management approaches affect the information developed by accounting systems. The paper illustrates definitions of SA, SA development stages, approaches that merge accounting with strategic management, and the effect of each of these approaches on the information that accounting systems provide to support organizations' strategic management.

A MULTI-COUNTRY COMPARISON OF PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS, INDUSTRY EFFECTS, AND PERFORMANCE IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING CULTURE			English	Article							STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION; CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; DETERMINANTS; CAPABILITIES; ORIENTATION; OPPORTUNITY; RESOURCES; BEHAVIOR; VENTURES	This paper examines the relationship between industry effects, environmental perceptions, and firm performance in a multi-country sample of entrepreneurial firms. Using a sample of 1045 finalists in Ernst & Young's International "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition, we examined whether environmental constructs that have been studied and validated in North American entrepreneurship research were generalizable to firms in fifteen countries located in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Using measures common to North American entrepreneurship research; we identified two environmental dimensions in subsamples of North American (United States and Canada) and non-North American firms: dynamism and hostility. However, while the constructs were identified in both subsamples, they also were not significantly associated with firm performance. We conclude the paper by suggesting this lack of environmental perception-firm performance relationship may be attributable to an entrepreneurial mindset that focuses on identifying and recognizing specific opportunities rather than responding to general characteristics of the external environment.

J	Chang, WC; Hsu, Y				Chang, Wen-Chih; Hsu, Yen			STRATEGIC GROUPS, PERFORMANCE, AND ISSUES RELATED TO PRODUCT DESIGN STRATEGYy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product development; performance; product design; strategic group		This study examined design cases involving new product development related to Taiwanese home appliance firms for exploring the strategic groups formed by local firms and their performance in new product development and other issues related to product design strategy. The questionnaire survey demonstrates that Taiwanese home appliance firms, in terms of product design strategy, can be grouped into passive response, aggressive response, and R&D focus groups. In their response to the challenges faced following Taiwan joining the WTO, firms in different strategic groups exhibited different financial and non-financial performance. Furthermore, they differed significantly in dealing with product design activities, particularly new product development types, product design features, motivations, and design appeals. Differences in these aspects may be the reason for their differences in new product development performance.

In this paper, which aims to clarify the role of knowledge management solutions in an enterprise business, we survey the market of commercial knowledge management solutions and analyse their functionalities in domains such as document management, information retrieval, collaboration, decision support, e-learning, business automation and enterprise integration. The survey is based on a thorough study of web resources of knowledge management solution providers. Regarding the role of knowledge solutions in the business process, the present study will show that on an operational level they serve for better utilisation of the enterprise knowledge resources and, on a strategic level, they synthesise new knowledge needed for better management of customers, suppliers and partners. This paper gives an insight into the knowledge management market that can help strategic planners to easily begin a knowledge management initiative.

J	Lim, GS				Lim, Ghee Soon			IT'S SO CLEAR: HYFLUX AND THE SUCCESS STORY OF A SINGAPORE FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING CULTURE			English	Article								The present case documents the success story of water treatment specialist Hyflux, a young and growing technology company based in Singapore. Founded by female entrepreneur Olivia Lum in June 1989 on a shoestring budget of S$20,000 (US$ 1 = about S$1.70), Hyflux gradually and painstakingly built its clientele from scratch over a period of more than a decade. On January 17, 2001, Hyflux was listed on Singapore's SESDAQ, the country's stock market for smaller firms. Within three years after the listing, Hyflux chalked up impressive growth results: Revenues quadrupled from the prelisting level of S$20.8 million in 2000 to S$81 million in 2003; profit before tax shot up by more than 100%, from S$8.6 million in 2000 to S$20 million in 2003; and profit attributable to shareholders grew from S$6.4 million in 2000 to S$12.3 million in 2003. These results were accompanied by the firm's upgrading its listing to the Singapore Exchange main board on April 14, 2003. What factors have contributed to Hyflux's success? What is Hyflux's strategic competency and to what extent is the competency inimitable? How fast and in what ways is the competitive landscape changing? Does Hyflux need a strategic reorientation? These are some of the critical questions that a successful company should consider preemptively before the market or the competitive landscape turns against it. Students will gain a great deal of insight from this case of a successful female entrepreneur from Singapore.

J	Ciptono, WS				Ciptono, Wakhid Slamet			EXPLORING THE LINKAGES BETWEEN DEMING'S PRINCIPLE, WORLD-CLASS COMPANY, OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND COMPANY PERFORMANCE IN AN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY SETTING	GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						company performance; Deming's principles; operational excellence; world-class company	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; FIT	This study explores the linkages between Deming's Principle, World-Class Company, Operational Excellence, and Company Performance in the Indonesia 's oil and gas industry. The aim of this study is to examine the causal relationships model between the Deming's Principle (DP), World-Class Company (WCC), Operational Excellence (OE), and Company Performance (Monetary Gain Performance or MGP and Value Gain Performance or VGP). The author used 140 strategic business units (SBUs) in 49 oil and gas companies in Indonesia. The survey was administered to every level of management at each SBU (Top, Middle, and Low Level Management). A multiple informant sampling unit is used to ensure a balanced view of the relationships between the research constructs, and to collect data from the most informed respondents on different levels of management. A total of 1, 332 individual usable questionnaires were returned thus qualified for analysis, representing an effective response rate of 50.19 percent. Path analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) are used to analyze the effect ofDeming's principle on company performance and to investigate the interrelationships between Deming 's principle, world-class company, operational excellence, and company performance. The results show that Deming's Principle has significant positive and indirect effect on company performance (monetary gain performance and value gain performance). Although the Deming 's Principle has no significant direct effects on company performance, the Deming's Principle has significant positive effects on the intervening variables (world-class company and operational excellence). The result also shows that a complete model fit and the acceptable parameter level that indicate the overall parameter are good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. By concentrating on a single industry (oil and gas), SEM specification of the causal relationship model between five constructs can be more complete and specific because unique characteristics of the oil and gas industry can be included (upstream and downstream chain activities). Finally, the particular design of the research and the findings suggest that the structural model of the study has a great potential for replication to manufacturing as well as service operations.

J	Maynard, S; Powell, GM; Kittredge, W				Maynard, Stephen; Powell, Gwynn M.; Kittredge, William			A Strategic Plan at the Core of Public Recreation Financial Management: A Case Study of Gwinnett County, Georgia	JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Public sector finance; strategic plan; management		Many public sector park and recreation departments are experiencing financial difficulties as states, counties, and municipalities face severe revenue shortages as a direct result from a struggling economy. This trend may result in decreased operating and capital budgets, decreased or eliminated grant monies, and / or frozen vacant staff positions. This crisis is not entirely unfamiliar for many public recreation agencies who over the years have grown accustomed to responding to high expectations from the public for quality facilities and services within significant budget constraints. Unfortunately, many agencies may have overextended themselves in the 1990's by acquiring and developing recreation facilities such as parklands, fitness centers, and aquatics complexes without anticipating potential negative financial conditions. This struggle with operating costs may threaten the agencies' ability to sustain these facilities, as well as the programs that have been implemented and whose delivery is dependent upon the utilization of such facilities. This dilemma may be the result of poor capital planning, inaccurate operating and / or maintenance planning. As a result, some multi-million dollar recreation facilities are poorly maintained, under-utilized, and in extreme cases, abandoned. Fortunately, there are public recreation agencies who have managed to maintain financial health while continuing to improve and expand facilities and services. This financial health is accomplished by piecing together an intricate puzzle consisting of various financial management practices, while maintaining public support through the adoption and continuously updating of a recreation and park comprehensive strategic plan. To further complicate the situation, some communities' efforts to generate revenues through property tax increases, establishment of special taxes, and increased fees and charges have been met with stiff resistance from the public. Agency efforts to reduce operating costs through the reduction of operating hours, less frequent maintenance scheduling, and the purchasing of lower quality supplies and equipment are also publicly frowned upon. Fortunately, there are public recreation agencies who have managed to maintain financial health while continuing to improve and expand facilities and services. This financial health is accomplished by piecing together an intricate puzzle consisting of various financial management practices while maintaining public support through the adoption and continuously updating of a recreation and park strategic plan. The purpose of this paper is to examine the finance system and structure of a county park and recreation department, Gwinnett County, Georgia, and to examine potential explanations for its financial health and stability by identifying unique management practices and philosophies, that when combined, contribute significantly to positive agency outcomes. Gwinnett County was chosen for examination because of its dedication to utilizing sophisticated and diverse methods of financing its recreation and park facilities and programs. A history of Gwinnett County recreation finance will be presented along with revenue sources, budget structure, and existing partnerships, while emphasizing the relationship between finance and a current recreation and park comprehensive strategic plan.

J	Clegg, AM				Clegg, AM			Risk in project preparation - 'determining the project needs and the effects on the management strategy'	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article								in general, overall experience has shown that the approach to the appointment of a project manager is given much attention, but little specific attention is given first to the risk associated with the project conceptual design and its overall executability within either the new legislative framework or the sustainability of the outcome. The risk in project executability and sustainability within the 'new age' legislative framework of the Mining Charter, etc, is itself however, of far greater importance. The degree of importance being defined by the intended projects impact on the business going forward. This is particularly the case where the intention of the implementation is effectively to turn around or even enhance a loss-making strategic investment like a mine or process plant operation in an 'old-order rights' or Brownfield's operation. This paper attempts to highlight the importance of a 'pre-project project' (PPP) to mitigate the risk in the 'new age,, with specific reference to operational due diligence (ODD) and project conceptual design.

J	Schulze, BC; Fietz, NM				Schulze, BC; Fietz, NM			Management Systems - software solutions for today's sugar industry	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article								Information technology is a key-component in today's industry. In order to operate production facilities in a technical and economical optimum way, the operating personnel have to have accessibility to different sources of information. Modern process control systems in a central control room narrow communication ways within the facility. The time period to reach a strategic decision and its quality is dependent on the amount and the combination of information. An improvement of these procedures can be achieved by using management systems and expert tools. Since several years, offline systems are used in the international sugar industry to link process data with analytical data and to optimize the production process. The information technology status of modern sugar factories allows for an implementation of online systems which are able to conduct energy and mass balances and prepare additional information for operating personnel. Such a software system will shorten the response time to arising problems and compensate peaks of e.g. energy and auxiliary consumption within the production process. The ESCON Energy-Management-System described here was first introduced in 2000 to the sugar industry. Since then, the software system has improved from a stand alone system to a server based and database operated online tool, accessible from multiple workstations via network or internet.

They may include strategic, tactical, scheduling and operational decisions. In such a context, solving logistics optimization problems has always been a challenging task, especially in the presence of nonlinear, implicit or disjunctive constraints. However, constraints are used in optimization based on intelligent search methods. These methods usually search for an acceptable near optimal solution (or a set of solutions) rather then the optimal solution. We will explore these to identify flexibility and efficiency of optimisation afforded by metaheuristic methods.

J	Barnes, SJ				Barnes, Stuart J.			Understanding information systems implementation in the UK health sector: methodological innovation and the use of cause mapping	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						IS implementation; cause map; case study; longitudinal; health sector		This paper is written with two objectives. First, to report some research results relating to the implementation of large Information Systems (IS) in the UK Health Sector. Second, the research method used is presented as an exemplar of the way an innovative technique, Multiple-Case Cause Mapping (MCCM), can strengthen and enrich case study based research. Implementing large strategic IS in the UK Health Sector has recently become the subject of much debate, as hospitals have undergone wide-reaching government-led institutional reforms involving the introduction of IT. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the associated organisational changes, an intensive research method was employed to capture the richness of context and processes. It involved a longitudinal multiple-case cause mapping investigation of the collective constructs and organisational processes impacting upon four hospital implementations. It is suggested that this qualitative research methodology could be of benefit to other areas of IS research.

J	Cele, N				Cele, Nhlanhla			Effective schools operating with amazing (dis)grace of human resources strategy, policy and practice: A South African case.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP IN EDUCATION			English	Article								The public profiling of schools as 'effective schools', 1 based on Grade 12 results, has resulted in a jingoistic race by many public schools to get their names on the 'public notice board' of effectiveness recognition. Besides creating a skewed perception of school effectiveness, this public profiling of schools as effective organizations, conceptualised within an inadequate criterion (Grade 12 results), has not only stirred public controversy (when the national Minister of Education threatened to close down the least effective school), but has also been widely identified as a problem by researchers. The research conducted by Jansen (1998) discovered that besides contravening social justice legislation by beating facts into learners' minds (corporal punishment), most of these schools publicly branded as the most effective also subscribe to rigid authoritarian management and leadership practices, sometimes ignorant of legislation and policy imperatives. This paper presents a critical analysis of unplanned human resources (HR) practices and management styles observed in two of these ` effective schools' where school principals and five educators per school were interviewed. The two schools studied are public high schools based in Durban at the Umlazi District. These schools offer education from grade 8 to grade 12 to the predominantly disadvantaged working class communities. The research findings reveal that the management of these schools is based largely on rigid practices that are devoid of strategic planning and consented investment, with respect to human capital development as aligned with human resources strategy and the broader Skills Development Act 97 of 1998 and other related labour legislation. The Skills Development Act of 1998-is the South African labour relations legislation that specifically claims space for skills-based training programmes in the education, training and development landscape. Under this Act, organisations are compelled to provide continuous training and Re-skilling of employees. These findings also reveal that critical policy and legislation on labour relations (Skills Development Act no. 97 of 1998 and Employment Equity Act) are not only contravened, but there are no state-led systems and processes in place to rectify the situation, cascade policy to staffroom level and reinforce school compliance with government policy and legislation. Educators are not treated as knowledge workers, but as mere civil servants, with limited professional development rights. This paper also draws parallels between these schools and best practices in human resources strategy in the corporate domain. The conclusions of the study clearly reveal that: 1. Educators in public schools work and live under total ignorance of human resources legislation 2. There is discontinuity in state policy reinforcement between public and private employers	[Cele, Nhlanhla] Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa		Cele, N (corresponding author), POB 1629, ZA-2058 Glenvista, South Africa.

J	Dan, HZ				Dan Hazen			Better Mousetraps in Turbulent Times? The Global Resources Network as a Vehicle for Library Cooperation	JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						AAU/ARL; Global Resources Network; academic libraries; Farmington Plan		Straitened budgets can provoke very dissimilar responses among institutions sharing the same broad goals. Cooperative efforts to pool resources, identify efficiencies, and exploit economies of scale comprise one strategy. An opposed but also common reaction, however, shrinks each player's focus to local programs and core constituencies. Academic libraries show the same range of response as any other institution when the times get tough: some seek cooperative means to sustain or even expand their coverage; others hunker down to focus only on the most urgent local demands. This paper probes the historical and contextual considerations that have made collections cooperation so difficult to achieve, in good times as well as bad, before looking yet again at our current opportunities for successful joint endeavors. The AAU/ARL "Global Resources Network" is one emerging initiative that, on its own terms and also in conjunction with other efforts, may prove more enduring. (C) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

J	Dolnicar, S				Dolnicar, Sara			Improved Understanding of Tourists' Needs: Cross-Classification for Validation of Data-Driven Segments	JOURNAL OF QUALITY ASSURANCE IN HOSPITALITY & TOURISM			English	Article						Segmentation; validation; post-hoc (a posteriori, data-driven) segmentation		Data-driven segmentation has become standard practice in strategic marketing. Typically, however, respondents are grouped only once, implicitly assuming deterministic nature of the segmentation methods applied. Once the segments are derived, background variables are used to test the significance of the difference between clusters indicating external validity of the market segments. High external validity implies a high level of trustworthiness of the solution and thus managerially useful market segments to choose from. However, single runs of explorative analysis remain only a weak basis for good long-term managerial decisions. In this study a different approach is suggested to improve the quality of the market structure insight for decision-making: two data-driven segmentation solutions are constructed independently. Association between them is used as an additional internal validity indicator. Benefit and behavioural segmentation bases are used to illustrate the concept: surfers provided information regarding the importance of aspects of proposed surf destinations and destinations they had previously visited. Segments resulting from both bases are profiled: they notably differ in background information. Significant association between these solutions supports the validity and managerial usefulness for target segment choice for the following targeted marketing action. Using this procedure results in the identification of stable consumer groups, which in turn leads to an improved understanding of customer segments; and thus enables the industry to improve the quality by customizing the product.

However, the gap between academic research aiming at increased sophistication of the methodology and managerial use has steadily increased. This paper takes the perspective of a destination manager and compares two segmentation approaches. One typically used in destination management (a priori geographical segmentation) and another one that is common in academic literature (a posteriori behavioural segmentation). The comparison emphasizes managerial usefulness (implying maximization of match between the tourists' vacation needs and the destinations' offer) and is illustrated with an empirical guest survey data set for Austria.

J	Doyle, SA; Reid, J				Doyle, Stephen A.; Reid, Jenny			A dedicated follower of fashion: the expansion strategy of David Linley & Co. Ltd	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic planning; Fashion industry		Purpose - This paper aims to consider the adaptability of the traditional growth strategies of couture/fashion houses in the context of non-fashion sectors. Design/methodology/approach - By means of a case study approach based upon David Linley & Co. Ltd, a furniture design company, it explores the relevance of implementing a strategy based upon product extension as a means to market development and internationalisation. Findings - The research demonstrates the distinct and conscious similarities between the strategy adopted by the company and that of the fashion houses as delineated in the literature. The paper concludes that there is value in pan-sector consideration in respect of strategic planning, particularly when there are acknowledged similarities in the relative positioning of the companies within their markets. Originality/value - Provides information on the strategic thinking of one company - based on the probable experiences and expectations of customers - which may have wider applicability in other areas of the fahion industry.

J	Freedman, G				Freedman, Gordon			The coming transformation of the textbook	LOGOS-JOURNAL OF THE WORLD PUBLISHING COMMUNITY			English	Article								Three years ago I wrote an article for LOGOS about whether textbook publishers would follow the e-Learning industry and go digital. The dot-com crash had just occurred and publishers were tinkering with electronic options as tactical support for book sales and, possibly, to gain incremental sales. Now, three years later, the digital issue is again in the forefront for higher education publishers and, shortly, for primary and secondary publishers. What has changed? Why are the textbook giants looking at digital differently? The answer to these questions appears to be economic. The rising cost of textbooks in the US has hit the proverbial wall. Protests over book prices, in an economically challenged time complicated by rising tuitions, have pushed the publishers into high gear. What is being contemplated is a change across the span of publishing - from product creation to product management to sales and marketing to contact with the end-user. Compared in this article are the variables in a publishing equation that is coming to grips with traditional form and convention as contrasted with the emerging market realities of servicing educational and economic expectations through the Internet. When taken together the price, consumer pushback, and mature technologies add up to an unmistakable trend. Strategic changes in the industry signal an evolution from Gutenberg's press to Berners-Lee's World Wide Web.

They represent a new challenge for research in the field of production and operations management. The reasons for cluster formation have been explored for many years, but there is little research that explores the strategic consequences of this type of collaboration. This paper deals with the manufacturing-capability development process and with the research conducted in the industrial clusters. The research is based on a case-study methodology.

J	Julian, CC				Julian, Craig C.			International Joint Venture (IJV) marketing performance: alternative approaches to performance measurement	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International Joint Venture (IJV) marketing performance; Thailand; subjective; objective; performance measures		This paper assesses International Joint Venture (IJV) marketing performance in the Republic of Thailand, as opposed to general business performance. Furthermore, the paper develops an objective measure to assess IJV marketing performance and compares two different types of measures for measuring IJV marketing performance, a subjective measure and an objective measure, and finds both measures to be significantly correlated. The objective measure of IJV marketing performance is a composite measure that includes strategic objectives for establishing an IJV. The objective measure assesses the respondents' satisfaction with the achievement of the strategic objectives and the subjective measure is a perceptual measure. The data for this study are from a sample of 161 IJVs located in the Republic of Thailand with the sample coming from a wide cross-section of industries including agriculture, mining, light, metal-working, electronics, chemical and the service industries.

The EC FARMING project aims to create a European stakeholder network to consider possible rehabilitation strategies for rural areas contaminated after a nuclear accident. The Institute of Patrimonial Strategies of the National Institute on Agronomy had responsibility for setting up the French stakeholder group. The objective was to develop favourable conditions and ways whereby stakeholders could deal with such a complex situation as a nuclear emergency and develop rehabilitation strategies. The results from the 3-year work programme on both strategic and technical aspects, showed an increasing commitment from the stakeholders that led to the building up of a common understanding of what a nuclear accident could be and how it could be dealt with.

J	Kahane, B; Raz, T				Kahane, Bernard; Raz, Tzvi			Innovation projects in Israeli incubators Categorization and analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Incubators; Classification; Innovation; Israel		Purpose - Based on an Israeli innovation incubators program, aims to describe a procedure to define relevant categories in order to reduce the complexity of representing the population of projects supported by an innovation program in a meaningful way. Design/methodology/approach - Provides a concise description of the Israeli innovation incubators program and presents the characteristics of the data available. Introduces the analysis methodology and describes in detail its application to the specific data set and the classification scheme that it induces. Discusses the information that can be obtained based on this classification, and outlines some policy implications. Concludes with remarks regarding possible applications and extensions of themethodology. Findings - Finds that the classification induced by the iterative category exclusion (ICE) procedure can serve as the basis for more sophisticated analysis using statistical tools such as regression analysis. Once the relevant categorization is obtained, it becomes easier to collect meaningful data about incubator performance for analysis at various levels of aggregation. The ICE procedure has the advantage that it does not give a priori preference to any category or to any relationship between categories, and does not require a priori identification of the categories that are to be kept and those that are to be deleted. Further, it does not need to classify categories under headings such as "scientific and technological" on the one side, and "sector applications" on the other. Both are seen as equal from the beginning to the end and thus avoid any bias in the process. The subjectivity inherent in the selection process is reduced, perhaps even eliminated. The same values provided the basis for the identification and quantification of overlap and proximities between the final categories, throwing some light on their mutual dependencies and interactions and leading to a level of representation from which strategic assessment and thinking can start. Originality/value - The core principle of ICE is to eliminate categories that do not convey sufficient information to justify the additional complexity. This principle is universal and can be applied to a wide variety of situations that suffer from too much data and not enough information.

Strategic aspects of aging nuclear infrastructure: game theory and the Chernobyl event	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES			English	Article						ageing infrastructure; Chernobyl; decision analysis; game theory; strategic decision-making		Game theory can provide an analytical framework for investigation of the strategic conflicts surrounding critical infrastructure. Immediately after the 1986 Chernobyl event, for example, plant management, political appointees, and world media struggled over the timing and accuracy of information release. The aging of nuclear power plants and the increasing difficulties faced by management and regulatory agencies in assuring high plant reliability virtually guarantee the recurrence of such contests. Standard operating procedures and conservative plant design were once considered sufficient to guarantee plant safety, but after the 1979 Three Mile Island event management practice was also recognised as crucial. We contend that crisis behaviour can be best understood in the context of the strategic interaction among regulatory agencies, plant management, and the media. Strategic issues lead naturally to game-theoretic models, which focus on the interaction of action choices and information. The Chernobyl event provides an illustrative case study to show that game analysis can provide insights into decision-makers' best responses to nuclear accidents.	[Kilgour, D.

The current research explores levels of multi-channel integration among major U.S. retailers (N = 74) in the softgoods sector from an Organizational Diffusion of Innovations perspective. A network of hypotheses examining Internet innovation across retail formats is empirically tested using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Findings indicate significant differences among retail formats in the degree that marketing executives have integrated a multi-channel focus into their current and/or future strategic agendas. Outcomes reveal important multi-channel opportunities and considerations for domestic softgoods retailers among specialty apparel, footwear, and general merchandise formats.

J	Shaver, D				Shaver, Dan			Characteristics of Corporate Boards in Single-Industry and Conglomerate Media Companies	JMM-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MEDIA MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Although there has been much research into corporate governance generally, little attention has been focused specifically on issues in media companies. The question is further complicated by the increasing frequency with which media enterprises that have traditionally operated within the industrial context of a specific medium are becoming business lines for media conglomerates and must compete for resources and strategic attention from a board more concerned with bottom-line profitability than with traditional media industry norms. This study examines board compositions of 21 firms with leadership positions in 1 or more traditional mass media industries and compares governance structure and results for those firms that are concentrated in 1 media segment to those that operate multiple media segments. Relations between skills sets associated with different categories of board members (legal, finance, consumer/marketing, service, academic, and other), management influence, and other board demographics to the creation of shareholder value were identified based on financial measures of market value, earnings per share, and dividend levels. The relations between board characteristics and strategic measures of capital reinvestment, asset sales, and acquisitions were also examined. A number of significant differences were identified between single-industry and conglomerate firms in these dimensions.

J	Shim, SJ; Kumar, A				Shim, SJ; Kumar, A			Selection and diversification of market segments for robotics products	INDUSTRIAL ROBOT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						robotics; market segmentation; United States of America	STRATEGY	Purpose - Examines the selection and diversification of market segments for robotics products with respect to application areas and customer sectors. Design/methodology/approach - This study attempted to investigate the selection and diversification of market segments by 50 robotics firms in the US with respect to application areas and customer sectors that they serve. Based upon the concept of strategic groups, we classified those robotics firms into three distinct strategic groups along the dimensions of application area diversification and customer sector diversification. The three strategic groups were identified as high, moderate, and low diversification groups, with respect to both application areas and customer sectors. Findings - The results show that robotics firms vary in their selection of application areas and customer sectors, and more importantly in the degree of diversification of application areas and customer sectors. Also, three distinct strategic groups are observed among them, based upon the degree of diversification of application areas and customer sectors. Research limitations/implications - A few limitations are recognized in this study. First, we used only the dimensions of market segment diversification in classifying the strategic groups in the US robotics industry. Given the important role of technology in the industry, we may consider pairing market dimensions with technology dimensions in exploring any strategic groups in the industry. Second, we only tested for the existence of strategic groups in the industry. We may further consider investigating the factors or reasons for the differences between the strategic groups, as well as any performance differences between the strategic groups. In studying the firm's performance, it is desirable to utilize financial performance measures such as sales growth and profitability. But securing such financial performance measures for individual robotics firms is hampered by the consolidated financial results of diversified firms and the presence of privately held firms in the industry. Third, we used data compiled from a secondary source. We may consider collecting time-series data directly from robotics firms. These limitations are not certainly exhaustive but rather important ones for future research. Practical implications - Given the limited studies on robotics firms and their strategy, the results should be of interest to those who formulate product strategy in the robotics market. Originality/value - The issues of diversification of market segments and the resultant strategic groups that we examined are well worth trying to understand for more viable market strategy in the field. Particularly, the identification of such strategic groups in the industry would help robotics firms evaluate their competitive positions, as well as competitors' approach to the market place.

Gender Needs for Participation in Poverty Alleviation Programmes in Selected Villages of Kwara State, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article								The study examined factors motivating men and women in terms of their gender needs to participate in poverty alleviation programmes in the rural areas of Kwara state. The subjects studied consisted of 186 men and women randomly sampled from two LGAs, and interviewed using a structured interview schedule. Data analysis involved the use of both descriptive and inferential statistics. Die results showed that more participants were concerned about their strategic gender needs than the practical gender needs. The need for capital was the topmost priority for men and women participation. The strategic gender needs which were important for men participation in poverty alleviation programmes in the rural areas was esteem and for women were achievement and recognition. The practical gender needs that where determinants of participation were paying children's school fees and social engagement expenses for men while those for women were feeding, buying clothes and capital for establishing business venture.

ICT platforms for enhancing agricultural productivity: the case study of Tata Kisan Kendra	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						remote sensing technology; geographic; information system; ground truthing; precision-farming		The potential for application of ICT in the agro-sector is high. New tools and techniques are evolving and the implications of this are clearly visible at a global scale. But the level of penetration of ICT is very low in India since the rural masses are not aware of the new technological innovations. The private initiative taken by Tata Chemicals Ltd started with an objective of providing the farmers with infrastructure support, operational supports, coordination and control of farming activities, and strategic support. Tata Kisan Kendra has been replicated successfully in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. The project has generated learning experiences such as customisation of the project for the rural users, implementation in a phased manner and community learning. The project is scalable and replicable, which Tata Chemicals Ltd keenly looks forward to. It has also managed to look into the economic and cultural sensitivities.

J	Viardot, E				Viardot, E			Human resources management in large information-based services companies: towards a common framework?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Technology and Human Resource Management	MAY, 2003	CERAM, Sophia Antipolis, FRANCE		CERAM	information based services; human resources management; high technology	KNOWLEDGE	Professional information based services are the fastest growing activities in the high technology information sector. But the management of those companies is a largely unexplored area of strategic management. This paper reports the findings of an exploratory survey of the ten largest international companies in this field about their models and practice of people management. The paper underlines the strategic importance of HR management for those companies whose people are their most important assets and who have recently experienced meteoric growth in the number of their employees. Findings suggest that there is a common framework of practices which can be divided in seven different components. These include a vision of the role of the employees, as well as their recruitment, training, evolution, management, communication, and remuneration. The paper presents and discusses the impact of the service technology on each of those components.

Pathways of Care for Patients with Suspected Cancer of the Pancreas: A Tiered Questionnaire-Based Survey of Medical Personnel Across a Single United Kingdom Calman-Hine Cancer Network	JOURNAL OF THE PANCREAS			English	Article						Cancer Care Facilities; Pancreatic Neoplasms		Objective This study examines clinical management pathways for patients with suspected pancreatic cancer within a single United Kingdom Calman-Hine NHS cancer network with particular focus on referral patterns and the primary care-hospital specialist interface. Methods A questionnaire-based study appraising responses from three key groups (general practitioners, gastrointestinal physicians and gastrointestinal surgeons) practising within a cancer network. The questionnaire addressed caseload, referral pathways, multidisciplinary care teams and involvement of specialists. Participants The study population comprised 448 general practitioners, 14 gastroenterologists and 23 gastrointestinal surgeons. Results The mean number of new patients with suspected pancreatic cancer seen per general practitioner per annum was 0.4 (range: 0-1). Fifty-three percent of general practitioners refer to gastrointestinal physicians and 47% to gastrointestinal surgeons. In hospital, a relatively large number of physicians and surgeons see a small number of new patients each per annum. The involvement of multidisciplinary teams and referral of patients with nonresectable disease for chemotherapy is limited. Fourteen (60.9% out of 23 general surgeons) refer all patients to pancreatic specialists, 4 (17.4%) selectively refer and 5 (21.7%) never refer. Conclusion The findings suggest divergence in standards of care from those advocated in governmental cancer strategic plans. In particular, not all patients with suspected pancreatic cancer see specialists, many hospital specialists see small numbers of cases and multidisciplinary care is limited.

The strategic deworming schedule involved treating cattle twice at an interval of 2 months, at the end of the 1st wet season and during the 2nd wet season. Two groups of 30 cattle, each consisting of a treated and a control group, were examined for nematode infections every 4 weeks from June 1999 to January 2000. The treated group had significantly lower mean faecal egg counts than the untreated groups (t-value = 2.47, P < 0.05). Generally, the pasture larval counts on treated farms were lower than on untreated ones, but not significantly so (t-value = 2.22, P = 0.068). Pasture larval counts with different nematode species on treated farms were lower than on untreated ones, but the differences were not significant for Haemonchus spp. (t-value = 1.68, P = 0.145), Oesophagostomuni spp. (t-value = 1.87, P = 0.111), Trichostrongylus spp. (t-value = 1.93, P = 0.102), Dictyocaulus spp. (t-value = -0.74, P = 0.485) and Cooperia spp. (t-value = -1.00, P = 0.356). Treated farms did, however, have significantly lower pasture larval counts of Bunostomum spp. (t-value = 4.64, P < 0.05). This study has revealed that the application of moxidectin pour-on on cattle has an effect on faecal egg count and pasture contamination under the tethering grazing system. Moxidectin pour-on and the strategic deworming schedule evaluated here could be used for the control of gastrointestinal nematode infections in cattle by small-scale farmers who practise tethering or semi-intensive grazing management in Uganda and other tropical countries, especially where there is a bimodal rainfall pattern.

THE IMPACT OF STRATEGY ON ICT PROJECTS	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY-MALAYSIA			English	Article						Strategy; Implementation		Strategic planning processes are oriented towards the selection of objectives and product/market choices by senior management. From this viewpoint strategic planning provides a mechanism for setting and reviewing objectives, focusing on choices of long-term significance, identifying strategic options, allocating resources, and achieving corporate-wide co-ordination, monitoring, and control. Current literature on strategic planning has recognised the problems with traditional approaches to planning. In this article, the authors seek to consider links between strategy and the implementation of ICT projects within the telecommunications industry.	[Ojiako, G.

J	Yeomans, JS				Yeomans, JS			Improved policies for solid waste management in the municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth, Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION			English	Article							SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION; ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS; PROGRAMMING APPROACH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALGORITHMS; MODELS	Public planning formulation can prove especially complicated when system components contain considerable degrees of uncertainty. Earlier research had demonstrated the utility of using evolutionary simulation-optimization (ESO) for solid waste planning in the Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth, Ontario. This paper demonstrates how both penalty function minimization and grey programming (GP) can be integrated into ESO in order to efficiently generate multiple good policy alternatives that meet the Municipality's required system criteria for solid waste management. Since ESO techniques can be adapted to problems in which many system components are stochastic, the practicality of this approach can be extended into many other operational and strategic planning applications containing significant sources of uncertainty.

The challenge comes from the fact that currently each discipline within the marketing communications plan is measured differently, so there can be no composite scorecard. McCann introduces two models, based on seven Universal Marketing Drivers that assess how these drivers work in tandem, in a discipline-neutral manner. These models can help marketers assess the contributions of each of the diverse disciplines within a marketing communications plan and accurately allocate resources to best deliver strategic priorities.

These orders correspond to different soil groups of the FAO/UNESCO system. The soils are potentially fertile, but indicate a number of physical, chemical and biological constraints and thus their sustainability is only at risk. Many developmental aspects are still either unattended or only at the initial stage of their adoption. Systematic research and developmental activities on soil survey, soil classification, land evaluation and land use planning for specific uses, watershed development and water harvesting, zero tillage adoption, afforestation, utilization of available resources, restoration of degraded land and maintenance and enrichment of soil fertility followed by conservation and management packages on sustainable basis need to be addressed. A healthy soil can only yield healthy crops for healthy population in order to build up an economically prosperous healthy nation of Ethiopia. In terms of genesis, taxonomy and potential fertility, the Ethiopian soils contain scientific merits to be discovered and recognized selectively as reference for strategic planning of development to attain food self-sufficiency followed by food surplus in days to come. There is ample scope for horizontal as well as vertical expansions of the land, if strategic management policies are executed at the grass root level.				shimelisw@hotmail.com; kibretkt@freemail.et					Abbi M., 1995, C ETH EC ADD AB; Betre A., 2001, ADV VERTISOLS MANAGE, P43; Bill M., 1978, FIELD GUIDE ETHIOPIA; Constable M., 1989, ONCCP FOOD NUTR STRA, P142; CSA (Central Statistical Authority), 1999, STAT ABSTR, P377; Dereje T., 2004, THESIS ALEMAYA U; Desta B., 1982, SCI B IAR, V4, P43; Dubale P., 2001, P INT S VERT MAN NOV, P19; Dubale P., 1996, P 3 C ETH SOC SOIL S, P119; EARO (Ethiopian agricultural Research Organization), 1999, SOIL WAT CONS PROGR, P47; EARO (Ethiopian agricultural Research Organization), 1999, DRYL AGR RES STRAT P, P86; Elias E, 1998, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V71, P93, DOI 10.1016/S0167-8809(98)00134-0; Engida M, 1999, ETHIOPIAN J NATURAL, V1, P137; Ethiopian Forestry Action Plan (EFAP), 1994, ETH FOR ACT PROGR, P64; FAO, 1986, ETH HIGHL RECL STUD; *FAO, 2001, SOIL FERT MAN SUPP F; FAO (Food and Agriculture Organizations), 1986, ETH EC AN LAND US, P35; Fitsum H., 2002, 25 ILRI; FRESCO LO, 1995, GEODERMA, V67, P171, DOI 10.1016/0016-7061(95)00018-J; Gebeyehu T, 1994, THESIS ALEMAYA U ETH; Gebrekidan H, 2003, J AGR RURAL DEV TROP, V104, P113; Gebrekidan H., YIELD RESPO IN PRESS; HURNI H, 1988, MT RES DEV, V8, P123, DOI 10.2307/3673438; Hurni H., 1984, COMPILATION PHASE 1, V1-4; Hutchinson R., 1991, FIGHTING SURVIVAL IN; IUCN (International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources), 1990, ETH NAT CONS STRAT, V1; Lakew D., 1998, AGR RES TECHNOLOGY T, P78; LAL R, 1995, GEODERMA, V67, P159, DOI 10.1016/0016-7061(95)00016-H; MABBUTT JA, 1984, ENVIRON CONSERV, V11, P103, DOI 10.1017/S0376892900013795; Mesfin A., 1980, ETHIOPIAN J AGR SCI, V2, P139; Mishra B.B., 2002, P 2 INT C SUST AGR F; Mohr P.A., 1961, GEOLOGY ETHIOPIA; MUCHENA FN, 1995, GEODERMA, V67, P141, DOI 10.1016/0016-7061(95)00015-G; MUCHENA FN, 1995, GEODERMA, V67, P179, DOI 10.1016/0016-7061(95)00019-K; Murphy H.F., 1959, COLL AGR EXPT STATIO, V1; MYERS N, 1986, ENVIRONMENTALIST, V6, P251, DOI 10.1007/BF02238056; Srivastiva K.L., 1993, DISTRIBUTION IMPORTA; Sys C, 1976, LAND EVALUATION; Taye B., 1996, P 3 C ETH SOC SOIL S, P162; Tesfu K., 1996, P 3 C ETH SOC SOIL S, P111; Vlek P.L.G., 1995, GEODERMA AMSTERDAM, V67, P167; Wakene N., 2003, ETHIOPIAN J NAT RESO, V5, P17	42	1	1	0	10	WFL PUBL	HELSINKI	MERI-RASTILANTIE 3 C, HELSINKI, FI-00980, FINLAND	1459-0255	1459-0263		J FOOD AGRIC ENVIRON	J.

J	Dynkin, L; Hyman, J; Phelps, BD				Dynkin, L; Hyman, J; Phelps, BD			Optimal credit allocation for buy-and-hold investors - A top-down, strategic approach.	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The trade-offs between risk and return are different for buy-and-hold investors and total return investors. For buy-and-hold investors, the portfolio return distribution is asymmetric; the maximum return is the yield, and the maximum loss is represented by default. The standard tools that total return investors use for top-down asset allocation (such as mean-variance optimization) and bottom-up security selection (such as multifactor risk models) are thus inappropriate. A more suitable approach for buy-and-hold investors, given current spreads, default rates and correlations, and loss tolerance, derives an optimal macro allocation across credit qualities. Application of this approach yields an optimized portfolio to minimize expected shortfall due to defaults, subject to a spread target and other portfolio constraints. The results suggest buy-and-hold investors should first determine their allocations to the A and Baa sectors, and then use an optimizer to select individual names.

J	Garvin, MJ				Garvin, MJ			Strategic characterization of water system infrastructure and management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						infrastructure; water supply; subsidies; financial; water policy; water management	BENCHMARKING	The capital needs of America's water systems have received substantial, recent attention within engineering and public policy circles. Various groups contend that national water systems face a multibillion dollar annual funding gap and advocate for a considerable federal role in supplying the necessary capital to fulfill anticipated requirements. Opposition groups contest these assertions, arguing that federal subsidies will reduce the incentive for the industry to develop lasting solutions. The industry's path forward remains unsettled as this debate continues. Missing from these discussions, however, is objective evidence concerning the state of the industry. Accordingly, this paper presents a rational methodology to characterize community water systems to provide a basis for (1) understanding the state of systems within the national portfolio; and (2) guiding strategic assessment and policy development. Common indicators are deployed that rely upon widely available operating and financial data and make use of thresholds that serve as estimates of industrywide averages. The developed methodology was applied to a national cross section of large water systems. The evidence indicates that large systems are adequately positioned to handle near-term capital challenges, so a substantial federal role is unnecessary. In addition, alternatives that might improve national water provision remain largely untested, so strategies that support the exploration of these approaches are recommended. The work presented is a key step toward normalizing an industry that is decentralized and locally managed.

Simulation turns to be reference aid for developing and acknowledging the appropriate set-ups and the adaptive schedules. The investigation, besides of reference concepts, summarises, for explanatory purpose, a case example related to the management of the fabric warehouse in order to grant adaptive sorting and dispatching of bolts, with on-process selective retrieval and handling of the actually used cloth, with account of fabric quality-data and of time-varying schedules. Purposely designed front-end automation rigs are required to enable the prospected up-grading options, and example robotic aids are studied, to show their actual feasibility. The considered combined-mode schedules show the benefits for prompt response leaving open middle/long horizons issues; direct checks on alternatives are provided by virtual reality tests.

J	Hyland, PWB; Jenkins, R; Chapman, RL				Hyland, PWB; Jenkins, R; Chapman, RL			The strategic mindset of Australian manufacturing managers: some missing links	PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL			English	Article						strategy; frames; collocate analysis; mental maps; manufacturing managers		Manufacturing managers have a measurable mindset (or frame) that structures their response to the manufacturing environment. Most importantly, this frame represents a set of assumptions about the relative prominence of concepts in the manufacturing domains, about the nature of people, and about the sensemaking processes required to understand the nature of the manufacturing environment as seen through the eyes of manufacturing managers. This paper uses work in the area of text analysis and extends the scope of a methodology that has been approached from two different directions by Carley (Journal of Organizational Behavior, 18(51), 533-558, 1997) and Gephart (Journal of Organizational Behavior, 18(51), 583-622, 1997). This methodology is termed collocate analysis. Based on the analysis of transcripts of interviews of Australian manufacturing managers mind maps of the concepts used by these managers have been constructed. From an analysis of these mind maps it is argued that strategy plays a minor role in their thinking second only to the improvement domain, whereas design and related concepts play a dominant role in their day-to-day thinking.

DRL started its operation by leveraging strong process engineering skills. With India signing the WTO agreement and strengthening the IPR, DRL has firmed up its molecular discovery plans. The small size of the domestic market has made the company turn to the international markets through exports, acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures. The focus of DRL has been on achieving leadership in the Indian market through innovation and at the same time capitalising on the opportunities prevalent in the global market place. DRL has moved up the value chain by placing greater emphasis on its finished dosage market to gradually emerge as an important player in this segment. The major driver of growth has been the long term vision to dominate the market through innovation.

J	Walsh, AM; Szabat, K				Walsh, AM; Szabat, K			Sustaining the edge: Factors influencing strategy selection in academic health centers	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							INTERORGANIZATIONAL COOPERATION; INTEGRATION	Competition within the acute care sector as well as increased penetration by managed care organizations has influenced the structure and role of academic health centers during the past decade. The market factors confronting academic health centers are not dissimilar from conditions that confront other organizations competing in mature industries characterized by declining profitability and intense rivalry for market share. When confronted with intense competition or adverse external events, organizations in other industries have responded to potential threats by forming alliances, developing joint ventures, or merging with another firm to maintain their competitive advantage. Although mergers and acquisitions dominated the strategic landscape in the healthcare industry during the past decade, recent evidence suggests that other types of strategic ventures may offer similar economic and contracting benefits to member organizations. Academic health centers have traditionally been involved in network relationships with multiple partners via their shared technology, collaborative research, and joint educational endeavors. These quasi-organizational relationships appear to have provided a framework for strategic decisions and allowed executives of academic health centers to select strategies that were competitive yet closely aligned with their organizational mission. The analysis of factors that influenced strategy selection by executives of academic health centers suggests a deliberate and methodical approach to achieving market share objectives, expanding managed care contracts, and developing physician networks.

J	Atwater, R; Blomquist, W				Atwater, R; Blomquist, W			Rates, rights, and regional planning in the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						social and political; urban water management; regional planning; water policy/regulation decision making; water resources planning		The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has for more than 70 years shaped the development of an immense urban region. The district's current strategic planning process therefore could have substantial effects on regional water planning and management. The rate restructuring phase of the planning process has produced a multiple component, cost of service based framework. This paper describes that framework as well as some criticisms that have been directed toward it. The rate restructuring was shaped, and for a while stalled, by old disputes among member agencies over rights to water supplied by Metropolitan. That controversy has diverted attention from the resource management implications of the rate structure. This paper presents an alternative future focused approach to regional integrated water resource planning for Southern California based on projections of current trends and anticipation of future events. This discussion raises the question of how regional integrated water resources planning of this sort may proceed, and what role Metropolitan will play in that process.

From the literature it is known that if users take the charge as given, the zero-profit constraint of the public firm results in an inefficient allocation of resources. In this paper, it is shown that the inefficiency will be completely corrected if the not-for-profit supplier faces a surplus-maximising single purchaser. The model has been applied to analyse the efficiency of public wastewater management, but it also has regulatory implications for other markets that cannot be liberalised.

Previous research highlighted many aspects of the industry that could detract from the efficacy of conventional discounted cash-flow techniques, and found that an investment-appraisal technique must fulfil a number of criteria in order to overcome these difficulties. This paper examines a number of financial and strategic management techniques for investment appraisal, and assesses their suitability with reference to these criteria. It shows that, of the studied techniques, the 'balanced scorecard' appears to be most suited for use in the water industry of England and Wales.

J	West, TD; Gupta, M; Balas, EA; West, DA				West, TD; Gupta, M; Balas, EA; West, DA			Identifying cost management strategies in dialysis clinics: Sustainable savings with positive outcomes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE			English	Article							ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; REGIONAL VARIATION; HEALTH; CARE; RECOMMENDATIONS; INFORMATION; HOSPITALS; MEDICINE; SCHEMES; SYSTEM	Objectives: To examine whether cost management strategies are used in a revenue-constrained environment without compromising clinical effectiveness. Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis of monthly cost and acuity-adjusted hospitalization data. Methods: This research included longitudinal regression analyses involving 10 years of data, 1990 through 1999, from each of 6 dialysis centers. Two sets of regression models were used: one set examined cost interactions and cost trends (P less than or equal to .001); the second set examined clinical outcomes (P less than or equal to .001). Four cost management strategies were examined: (I) selective reductions in targeted cost categories, (2) cost reductions through improved efficiencies, (3) cost avoidance by shifting responsibilities to external parties, and (4) uniform reductions across all cost categories. Results: Managers appeared to have limited opportunity to selectively or uniformly reduce costs because of cost "stickiness" and minimal resource substitutability. Improvements in operational efficiencies and cost shifting to external parties occurred. Over time, however, realized efficiencies increased at a decreasing rate, whereas cost shifting actually declined. Contrary to prior hospital studies, these results indicate significant economies of scale. No statistical correlation was found to indicate that the physician/clinic management teams' use of cost reduction strategies affected acuity-adjusted hospitalizations of dialysis patients. Conclusions: Strategic models that include both financial and outcomes data can enable healthcare managers to predict both positive and negative results of cost management proposals. These models can help identify aspects of an organization's cost structure that affect sustainable cost savings: cost stickiness, cost substitutability, institutional experience, realized operational improvements, and economies of scale.

With this aim in view, several tools to assist innovation management have been developed. The Technological Information Office (GIT) and the Database of Research Concepts and Contacts have been designed to promote knowledge of the firm's sphere of action. The role of the R&D Project Appraisal Methodology is to aid in the selection of innovative projects that afford a competitive advantage to the firm. The GIT is a service of IBERDROLA that responds to the technological monitoring requests of the professionals who work in the areas of Research, Technological Development, and Innovation. The GIT is part of an in-house information service and acts in the capacity of information broker making use of the technology of the World Wide Web (Intranet). The Database of Research Concepts and Contacts is one of the underpinnings of the GIT. This database furnishes information relative to leading institutions and researchers in their fields who carry out activities in technological areas of interest to IBERDROLA. The information gathered defines the scientific and technological environment that serves the firm as benchmark. The aim of R&D project appraisal methodology is to optimise the allocation of R&D resources through the prioritisation and selection of R&D projects and programs. To evaluate the merits of each project as well as the costs and risks associated, criteria consistent with IBERDROLA's strategic objectives have been established. This article explains the characteristics of these tools and their different stages of exploitation, as well as the results obtained.

J	Sheather, G				Sheather, G			Transforming Australian manufacturing enterprises for global competitiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						industry policy; best practice; manufacturing strategy; integrative planning; technology management; key performance indicators		The title 'Transforming Australian manufacturing' presumes there is a need to review the performance of the manufacturing industries and the Government's sectorial policies for achieving best practice to leverage manufacturing capabilities of Australian firms. Pressures to reconfigure the manufacturing industry within Australia have been intense and diverse over the last decade in the face of globalisation, advanced technologies, innovation and commercialisation of R&D. Federal and State Governments' intervention and assistance programs to redress the situation have had varied degrees of success in the absence of a strategic approach to management by SME firms, in particular. This paper examines the structural situation facing the Australian economy and the problems confronting its manufacturing sector as it moves from traditional commodity to global information and knowledge-intensive industries. It explores the record of best practice initiatives taken to combat these pressures, provides a specification for defining the requirements for transforming our manufacturing firms' performance, and outlines a conceptual framework for firms to develop a strategic manufacturing capability for competitive advantage in global markets. A number of recommendations are made in these respects.

J	Spacek, J; Matichich, M				Spacek, J; Matichich, M			Gaining funding support for infrastructure programs	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								It is no secret that many US distribution systems are in critical condition because of a low historical rate of spending on infrastructure replacement. National needs in this area are expected to triple to $250 billion within the next 30 years. Managing this problem effectively will require public involvement, good communication, and long-range planning. Spacek and Matichich explain how Portsmouth, Va.-with portions of water infrastructure dating back to the late 1800s-used water utility management, operations, financial planning, and public relations to deal with its own infrastructure challenge-even in the face of multiple other problems. Even though confronted with extensive city redevelopment, a declining population, loss of jobs, and a limited tax base, the city managed to rally the support of its local government and citizens to raise rates and tackle a backlog of infrastructure projects. The city was successful because of its holistic, interactive, optimized, and well-communicated approach. As the authors point out, an infrastructure revitalization plan must be consistent with a city's overall goals and, objectives, recognize rehabilitation and growth needs, include the effect of regulations, and provide a long-term financial forecasting perspective. It should also address long-term rates and competitiveness issues and provide a, set of tools for ongoing planning. As Portsmouth found out, such a strategic financial plan can afford a water utility and its community several direct and immediate benefits. These include improved insight into immediate and long-term system needs, the development of good public information, alignment of utility and city programs and plans, and securing of favorable terms. The authors hope their experiences can serve as a blueprint for other utilities and cities.

J	Fuhrer, MJ				Fuhrer, MJ			Federal agency management practices for prioritizing and funding rehabilitation-related research	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION			English	Article						rehabilitation research; federal agencies; priorities; funding	NIH	This article focuses on the processes by which priorities are established and research is funded by three organizational entities that finance the preponderance of this country's rehabilitation-related research: the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (the focal point of rehabilitation research at the National Institutes of Health), and the National Institutes of Health in aggregate (i.e., the several institutes that support rehabilitation-related research), Two perspectives are emphasized: the stakeholders' opportunities to influence deliberations at key steps in setting priorities and reaching funding decisions and the extent to which these management practices are explicitly conceptualized, transparent, and evidence-based. Those perspectives are brought to bear on three pivotal considerations: the agencies' commitment to directed vs. nondirected research, the role they assign to strategic planning, and their approach to reviewing applications for funding.

J	Desai, C; Fletcher, K; Wright, G				Desai, C; Fletcher, K; Wright, G			Drivers in the adoption and sophistication of Database Marketing in the services sector	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article							INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; IMPLEMENTATION; ORIENTATION	Database Marketing has emerged as the technological means of achieving competitive advantage through the development and retention of customer relationships, but not all companies in the services sector have been successful in moving beyond operational benefits to strategic use. This article presents key empirical findings on the relationship between the degree of both marketing and information orientation within an organisation and the use and sophistication of Database Marketing. The use of a cross industry sample of four UK industries namely; the financial services industry, the retail industry, the travel industry, and the performing arts industry, provides generalisable insights into how firms can make the most out of their Database Marketing investments. Our findings suggest that a marketing orientation is important to the adoption and sophistication of Database Marketing applications, but only in so far as it is not already developed in the industry. It is information orientation that is critical, particularly in developing sophistication. Once using Database Marketing, those service organisations with the greatest level of information orientation will be best placed to develop fully the strategic aspects of Database Marketing.

J	Stevenson, J				Stevenson, J			Persuasion as a strategy for managing up	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	American-Society-of-Health-System-Pharmacists Midyear Clinical Meeting	DEC 04-05, 2000	LAS VEGAS, NEVADA	Amer Soc Hlth Syst Pharmacists		administration; administrators; pharmacy, institutional, hospital; professional relations; strategic planning		Managing up and the effective use of persuasion are described. Managing up involves the use of relationships built on respect, understanding, and effective communication. Persuasion is an important strategy for managing up; its elements include establishing credibility, framing goals on common ground, vividly reinforcing your position, and connecting emotionally. Persuasive strategies that should be avoided include using hard-sell tactics, refusing to compromise, relying on strong arguments alone, surprising the boss in front of others, and assuming that persuasion is a one-shot effort. The use of supporting data helps establish credibility, Anticipating important data elements and locating published outcome data and experience at peer institutions that support a proposed plan of action increase the likelihood of the plan's acceptance. The plan and supporting data should be presented clearly and concisely. Once a proposal is approved, delivering what has been promised and following through with measurements of effectiveness are critical for enhancing credibility and increasing the likelihood of future successes. Persuasion is one key to working synergistically with an organization's upper-level management.

J	Peffers, K; Tuunainen, VK				Peffers, K; Tuunainen, VK			Leveraging geographic and information technology scope for superior performance: an exploratory steely in international banking	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						IT scope; strategic information systems; geographic scope; financial services industry; IT/Geographic Scope Matrix	STRATEGY; BUSINESS; DIVERSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; REVOLUTION; ALIGNMENT; INTENSITY; DIVERSITY; IMPACT; FIRMS	Here we investigate the relationship between the use of geographic and information technology (IT) scope as complementary factors to affect the value of products, the cost of operations and the overall performance of firms. We introduce the IT/Geographic Scope Matrix (IGSM) as a framework with which to study and understand the relationship in order to better manage the firm. We develop expectations that the consistent use of either high or low levels of IT and geographic scope may result in better firm performance than inconsistent use; where high levels of one are matched with low levels of the other. We apply the IGSM in a study of eleven firms, all of which provide financial services, specifically international cash management and trade finance, to firms in Hong Kong. The results of our study suggest that the IGSM may be a useful tool for IS planning and research and have implications for the co-ordination of business and IT planning.

J	Ozyildirim, S; Criss, NB				Ozyildirim, S; Criss, NB			Survival of rationalism between hostility and economic growth	JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH			English	Article							MILITARY EXPENDITURE; BILATERAL TRADE; CONFLICT; PEACE; INTERDEPENDENCE; MODEL	This article examines the interaction of country pairs who have historically been and are potentially hostile. Hostility is described as a function of arms stocks versus bilateral trade. Armament intensifies the current level of hostility whereas trade reduces the possibility of militarized disputes. We argue that welfare-maximizing decisionmakers have to seek methods other than accumulation of arms to increase the security of their nations, and we highlight the strategic nature of trade in overcoming enmity. Rational governments, who consider bilateral trade as a factor that reduces the level of enmity, allocate resources more efficiently between arms imports and consumer goods.

J	Kawaura, T; Watada, J				Kawaura, T; Watada, J			Fuzzy mean-variance approach to strategic decision in agricultural management	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONS RESEARCH SOCIETY OF JAPAN			Japanese	Article								When we decide the production of each agricultural product in the uncertain circumstance where its sell price. climate, consumers' preference and so on are not known previously, we should take its risk as well ass the best expected selling volume or its interest into consideration. In this paper we employ fuzzy mean-variance analysis to decide the optimal solution in agricultural management which minimizes the risk and maximizes the expected selling volume. The mean-variance analysis is proposed by H. Markowitz and widely employed in stock investment. Nevertheless. it. is also hard to treat an aspiration beheld by a decision-maker, because the formulation given by H. Markowitz is written using constant rigid values. In this paper a fuzzy number is employed to deal with a vague aspiration level and a fuzzy goal given by a decision-maker, that is, the fuzzy mean-variance analysis enables us to obtain the best solution which iu realized within a vague aspiration level and a fuzzy goal. In the method, the decision maker defines a necessity level and a sufficient level for each of expected interest rate and risk. The decision-maker can obtain a solution that satisfies an aspiration level and a fuzzy goal required. The effectiveness of our method is shown using a numerical example.

J	Rhee, BD; Norton, SW				Rhee, BD; Norton, SW			Strategic quality decisions under heterogeneous resource endowments	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							MOBILITY BARRIERS; PRICE-COMPETITION	The literature on product competition advocates a differentiation strategy assuming firm homogeneity in resources. However, firm heterogeneity in resource endowments has long been recognized in economics. Merging these two perspectives, we show that the increase in consumer preference for quality leads to firms' aggressive price competition instead of quality differentiation. As consumers look for higher quality, the cost advantage arising from superior resources increases and makes head-to-head competition more profitable than accommodating a less efficient rival. When consumers are highly concerned about quality, even a small resource difference leads a more efficient firm to initiate cutthroat price competition for market dominance.

The UK Government's mandatory structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) was examined to determine its value to software projects. The evidence was collected from interviews with 17 project managers, discussions with participants on three large SSADM projects and from observing 90 end users in training. The generic conclusions are that prescriptive information systems methodologies are unlikely to cope well with strategic uncertainty, user communication or staff development. The recommendations are to focus more on soft organizational issues and to use approaches tailored to each project. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Smith, BL; Miller, JS; Revels, BM; Smith, KW				Smith, BL; Miller, JS; Revels, BM; Smith, KW			Planning for civil engineering applications of information technology	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Providers of civil engineering infrastructure face increasing pressure to apply information technology. Unfortunately, technology's rapid evolution renders it easy to acquire expensive equipment that quickly becomes obsolete. In response, this paper outlines a systems analysis planning approach that focuses on the long-term goals of engineering managers. Using the case study method, the strengths and weaknesses of a relatively new technology, the World Wide Web, are mapped to the goals of a key civil infrastructure user, a transit provider. Six strategic areas are identified where the Web can have a high impact on the delivery of transit services: attracting greater advertising revenue, improving the image of the service, improving services for existing patrons, attracting other market segments, educating customers, and facilitating electronic commerce. The value of this goal-oriented planning application is that uncommon but practical transit initiatives are identified, several of which would have been undiscovered had a more traditional technology-oriented approach been employed. The significance of this approach is that one makes better investments rather than simply better justifications for existing projects.

J	Young, DW; Barrett, D; Kenagy, JW; Pinakiewicz, DC; McCarthy, SM				Young, DW; Barrett, D; Kenagy, JW; Pinakiewicz, DC; McCarthy, SM			Value-based partnering in healthcare: A framework for analysis	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							QUALITY	Value-based partnering is designed to move the healthcare system beyond cost-based competition. It recognizes that the healthcare "product" is not a commodity and that much of the value in the system comes from relationships between and among four stakeholders: consumers, providers, health plans, and employers. Given the difficulty of measuring such benefits as quality of care, improved health status, and increased employee productivity, stakeholders within the system traditionally have focused on easily measurable financial considerations such as premium rates. This focus has led to a system that defines relationships in purely financial terms. In contrast, the value-based partnering model presented in this article recognizes the range of factors that stakeholders consider in their relationships with each other. This approach has the potential to change the nature of competition and presents opportunities for those organizations that can effectively partner with other stakeholders and demonstrate value, rather than just lower cost. Moreover, by recognizing the interdependencies among stakeholder groups, the approach creates a strategic reason for employers, health plans, providers, and consumers to exchange information and create long-term alliances.

J	Mann, P				Mann, P			Tacit knowledge in an age of reform	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						tacit knowledge; knowledge formation; knowledge conversions; civil service reform; departmental management development; training for decentralization		This article traces the periods of centralized management training in the Cyprus civil service, from Independence in 1960 to the mid 1990s. For each period, an original analysis of the purpose for, the approach to and the focus of the training is given. These three perspectives correspond, respectively, to why training is provided, how it is designed and what it covers. It is then asked whether tacit assumptions about management training accruing from these historical periods might not affect civil servants' current attitudes toward training for reform. To answer this question, a case study is presented of recent department-specific management development, against which - in reverse order - each of the three questions above is examined. Evidence is presented that suggests participants undergoing the training experienced an interplay in the formation of their knowledge between tacit and explicit knowing. This finding is in turn held up against recent research from Japan, where conversions in knowledge-creating companies were documented between tacit and explicit abilities. Finally, it is suggested that, by taking account in the strategic design of management learning for reform of 'crossing' over thought worlds (converting tacit to explicit knowledge and back again), progress can be made in achieving relevant learning and transferable training.

J	Scott, J				Scott, J			The management of venereal disease in New South Wales, 1871 to 1916	VENEREOLOGY-THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEXUAL HEALTH			English	Article							GOVERNMENT	Practical techniques to manage the dangers associated with sexually transmitted diseases have varied considerably both cross culturally and historically. Adopting a Foucauldian perspective, this article examines sociohistorical aspects of the governance of venereal disease in New South Wales between 1871 and 1916. Public debates and official documents are analysed to identify strategic shifts in practices associated with venereal disease management, especially in relation to prostitution. Particular attention is paid to the development of contagious disease legislation and its role in the regulation of venereal disease. It is argued that during the period in question, two distinct governmental regimes of disease control can be identified. In the first, medical policing managed venereal disease through the mobilisation of repressive controls, requiring the isolation and detention of polluting bodies. In the second, liberal governance adopted pedagogic practices to train populations perceived as either healthy or unhealthy. It is further argued that as liberal strategies of governance came to dominate the management of venereal disease, the association of prostitution with venereal disease began to weaken. Instead, authorities became increasingly concerned with populations whose behaviour was not traditionally linked with venereal disease, such as the young and the sexually inexperienced.

The essential first step is a change in management mentality. Subsequent steps involve the three critically important types of business planning. Strategic planning is concerned with general courses of action to achieve competitive advantage and financial stability in the intermediate and long-term future. Tactical planning defines all of the specific tasks required to implement the strategic plan, and operational planning is concerned with the near-term operation of the business. Finally, a follow-up control process is outlined which is intended to ensure that those plans are implemented and desired results are achieved.

While much of the blame can be laid on the weak financial infrastructure and poor corporate governance, one of the root causes for development unsustainability is the lack of competitiveness of their economies, in turn resulting from lack of innovative capability based on science and technology. This is required in order for these countries to make economic transitions necessary for advanced developing economies. The future of these countries is therefore intimately linked with the future of their science and technology. A balanced development is required, with emphasis placed on niche areas where these countries have strategic advantages.

J	Brenes, ER; Martinez, J; Skoknic, ES				Brenes, ER; Martinez, J; Skoknic, ES			ENDESA	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article								This is the success story of an electric company that was founded in the 1940s as a public enter-prise but that has been run since its founding as though it were a private company. Throughout the years, it has operated efficiently and with a high level of technology. The company was privatized in 1987, and its performance improves still further, making it a success model for Latin America. As frequently happens with successful, high-growth companies in the region, ENDESA began to face some limits to expansion in its domestic market and began generating a surplus beyond its investment requirements. In fact, the company projected that its cash flow would exceed projected investments by 500 million dollars; Most Latin American companies, when confronted with this hind of situation, would invest within its home country, in nonrelated businesses, creating a diversified business group. In contrast, ENDESA decided explicitly not to diversify in nonrelated businesses but rather to pursue its cove business in other countries, beginning with neighboring Argentina. This first project outside Chile required a large financial investment, an enormous organizational effort, and the need to forge strategic alliances with multinational enterprises. The case describes this initial experience in detail, emphasizing the importance of human resources in any internationalization effort. It is clear from the case that ENDESA's most valuable assets for success in this effort were managerial. The dilemma now facing ENDESA management is whether to continue investing in Argentina. A new opportunity for the expansion of electric power has arisen, but an investment of $100 million is required. ENDESA must make this investment decision in an environment of economic decline in Argentina. Other options include seeking investments in other South American countries, or perhaps investing in other sectors in Chile. (C) Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	D'Andrea, G; Postigo, S; Florin, J				D'Andrea, G; Postigo, S; Florin, J			Rheem-Saiar	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article								Salar, S.A. was created in the 1940s as a joint venture between a diversified Argentine business group with interests in petrochemicals and a European manufacturer of water heaters to produce steel containers, but as frequently occurs in Latin America, the original objectives of the joint venture were broadened to take advantage of the foreign firm's expertise. Thus, Salar became the first company to introduce the tank water heater to the Argentine market, which had previously relied upon pilot electric heaters. As part of a global divestiture strategy, the European manufacturer sold its interest in Salar to the Argentine group, allowing the company to continue selling under the Rheem brand name. Faced with economic recession and a declining domestic market, Salar embarked upon a strategy of product diversification and geographic expansion. The company broadened its product line and began to export to less sophisticated markets in the neighboring countries of South America and in the Caribbean. Having thus gained international experience, it leaped into the far more demanding markets of Australia and the United States in the early 1990s. Salar now faced an array of strategic decisions typical of the Latin American company attempting to go global. The decision that faced a company about to export to a new market was the selection of an appropriate distribution channel. In the U.S. market, Salar has received three offers:from a small family-owned company over which it would have a strong negotiating position; from a Japanese company that saw potential in adding Rheem-Saiar to its product line; and from a leading U.S. manufacturer that, despite its size, proposed to begin with a very modest sales volume. The decision that faced a company that has achieved limited market penetration with exports is whether to move into overseas manufacturing. Salar was considering this alternative in Australia because it would enable the company to adapt its products to the needs of the local market while cutting shipping costs by move than half However, such a move was threatening to local industry and could have provoked retaliation. The Rheem subsidiary in Australia had threatened to retaliate by entering the Argentine market. Finally, a company that had established an overseas subsidiary was faced with the decision of when to "pull the plug" on a losing operation. Saiar management had to decide what to do about its Chilean subsidiary, Hometech, which was losing money as a result of low sales volume and high fixed costs. The company has received an offer from an important national distributor which would help gain volume but would mean losing control. Apart from these decisions, the case raises several issues about global strategies in Latin American companies that deserve reflection and discussion. One issue is whether the formula used by Salar, to first gain a dominant position in the domestic market, then export to less demanding neighbors, and finally to penetrate the toughest world markets, is one which makes sense and may be replicated. A second issue is whether the temporary role of the foreign partner is desirable, and if so, how such temporary arrangements might be structured so as to maximize technology transfer while benefitting both parties.

On a host of issues, from stability in Europe to the maintenance of effective arms control regimes and management of regional crises beyond the Continent, cooperative working arrangements with Russia are vital. To assure such cooperation NATO should make clear that it is open to Russian membership, priority should go to EU expansion, and the United States should pursue joint defenses with Russia against potential ballistic missile threats.

J	Wilson, WW; Dahl, BL				Wilson, WW; Dahl, BL			Logistical strategies and risks in Canadian grain marketing	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE			English	Article								Logistics management in grain marketing has become very important with the maturity of the industry. This is particularly critical in the Canadian grain marketing system, which has experienced disruptions for various reasons over many years. These problems have been the topic of numerous industry evaluations, have resulted in a complaint about service obligations during the 1996-97 crop year, and were addressed by the Estey Commission. A detailed model of the Canadian grain logistics system is developed in this paper to evaluate factors that cause disruptions, as well as the effect of several important logistics and marketing strategies on system performance. The results illustrate that there is sufficient randomness throughout the various functions of the system that it is expected that demurrage at the west coast would periodically be an important cost. The frequency of service disruptions and demurrage are affected by several factors, including the distribution of rough and damp grains, mis-graded grain and the level of exportable supplies. Several strategic variables affect system performance. These include the aggressiveness in selling relative to capacity and the level of beginning port stocks.

J	Brah, SA; Hunsucker, JL				Brah, SA; Hunsucker, JL			R&D to operations transition management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						organizational change; R&D; operations management; air transport		This paper outlines some strategic considerations in the transition of an organization from essentially a research and development or design environment to an operational or production environment. We propose a transition life cycle model that is in agreement with the existing life cycle models. The building blocks of the research are the results of an extensive literature search and a series of industrial interviews. The desired expectation of this effort was to find methods for moving NASA's space shuttle program into an era of routine, timely operations Proposes utilizing some existing concepts of change for achieving a smooth transformation tinder various levels of technical political, cultural managerial and economic uncertainties. Recommends an initial planning stage followed by various possible courses of actions and considerations for the transition. We hope that the framework presented in this paper will serve the individuals and organizations considering a major transition, especially those from a research and development to an operational one.

J	Weil, TP				Weil, TP			How to enhance the efficacy of health network growth	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						health networks; economics of regulation; strategic health planning; corporate divestitures; managed care; public health regulation	UNITED-STATES; CARE; MERGERS	In almost every American metropolitan area, health executives are busily enhancing the efficacy of their health networks by corporately restructuring so that their organization can become a fiscally and politically powerful oligopoly or a regulated monopoly. When the formation of these alliances are initially announced by the local media, they are reported to be vehicles to enhance access, social equity and quality of care, and to reduce costs. Since an increasing number of these health networks are currently experiencing fiscal, cultural and other difficulties, it is critical to study: (a) what factors should be considered when developing an effective and efficient health network?; (b) what are the practical issues in their strategic formation and management so they eventually achieve their full potential?; and (c) why will some divestitures among these health networks occur and how will these corporate 'spin offs' impact on consumers, providers, insurers and governmental agencies? Within the next decade the United States will face some inevitable economic difficulties. At that time, enhancing access and reducing costs will become more critical issues for health networks. These alliances may then need to become more responsive to consumer pressures as the Americans shift their political proclivities from the current quasi-competitive to a more quasi-regulatory position. In this context, the use of global budgetary targets is discussed as a possible option in the United States to constrain costs, an approach used in almost all other western industrialized nations.

J	West, E				West, E			The Danube programme: The challenge of international river-basin management	JOURNAL OF THE CHARTERED INSTITUTION OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Danube basin; river-basin management; water-quality protection		This paper highlights the key issues which affected the design and implementation of water policy within the first phase of the Environmental Programme for the Danube River Basin. The programme represents one of several regional environmental initiatives in Eastern Europe which were designed to control pollution through the coordinated actions of national governments, international organizations, international financial institutions and non-governmental organizations. The paper identifies three key controversial findings. Firstly although the programme has been a valuable tool for the skins and technology transfer which are necessary to enable the Danube states to control water pollution, it has failed to generate the anticipated levels of capital investment or establish itself as a cornerstone of Danube basin management. Secondly, the policy process has been beset by political, economic, social and historical conflicts and power struggles between the participating parties. Thirdly, valuable lessons for the strategic and sustainable management of international river basins can be learned from the operational experiences of the Danube programme.

J	de Neufville, R; Pirnar, A				de Neufville, R; Pirnar, A			A dynamic technology strategy for Xerox to respond to the threat of high-tech commoditization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						high-tech commoditization; personal computers; personal copiers; digital technology; organizational competency; first mover; dynamic strategic planning; dynamic technology strategy; risk aversion		This paper shows how Xerox can make decisions to respond to the threat of high-tech commoditization in copiers. The extent of the threat is seen in the example of the computer industry commoditization by personal computers, and the negative effects on the industry leader IBM. The threat to Xerox is presented by the personal copier segment possibly being quite different, eroding existing competencies technologically and in markets, threatening profits, market share, and revenues. Decisions on digital technology, being first mover, and transition risks from the organizational competency perspective are combined using dynamic strategic planning which recognizes risk and the imperfection of technological and market forecasts. Decisive strategic moves into digital technology appear to provide the best response to the threat of commoditization of the copier industry. Aggressive strategies have higher expected outcomes under extreme commoditization, but also higher variances and risk. Doing nothing is the worst strategy. The value of each strategy depends on the level of future commoditization, and the risk aversion of decision makers.

Through an analysis of variation in policy recommendations published in the major journals read by staff of such institutions between 1895 and 1970, the chapter shows that variation was not randomly distributed but was affected by the social, economic, and historic context in which the recommendations were published. The results suggest that variation is higher after periods of uniformity and monotony, during a general climate for change, and during or shortly after times of public debate of particular issues. This has important implications for population-level learning and strategic managers, as low variation among recommendations may increase the likelihood of implementation but lead to suboptimal performance in the long term.

To flourish in a managed carl environment the subspecialist will need to rely on strategic planning. Four emerging approached to healthcare lend themselves to strategic planning. They are 1) practice-based clinical trials. 2) outcomes research, 3) clinical practice guidelines, and 4) systems-based disease management. This report explains how subspecialists in private practice can participate in and profit from each of these new approaches.

A strategy utilized to reach this goal is to apply the principles of managed review to the entire regulatory process. Managed review principles include the design of a review process which is streamlined, consistent, and efficient. Control of this review process is through performance goals in the form of review events which move the process forward. CBER has extended and enhanced its current Managed Review Process, thereby achieving this goal. This new Managed Review Process is presently being implemented in the center It spans from discovery to post marketing, includes all regulatory mechanisms used for submission review and approval, proposes a change in the review team leadership structure, reinforces the importance of project management activities, and enhances performance goals through the addition of new review milestones and target dates.

J	Woods, WW				Woods, WW			Information technology costs and productivity gains	DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL			English	Article						client-server costs; information technology investments; productivity gains; strategic reengineering; critical success factor		This report is an overview of two strategic issues currently facing the pharmaceutical industry: the high cost of client-server computing and ensuring that investments in information technology result in productivity gains. This report begins with a discussion of the high costs involved in supporting a client-server architecture (reported by KPMG Management Consulting and Nolan Norton & Co. to run as high as $20,000/year/PC). If a company is to maximize the returns from its current and future investment in information technology it is critical that it carefully limit the number of initiatives undertaken in this area. Companies must only undertake projects targeted at improving processes identified as critical to the success of the whole organization. Three observations drive this conclusion. One is the high cost of ownership associated with the client-server approach to computing. Two, computerization of organizations typically occurs along the vertical lines of the organizational chart and within functional departments. Three, findings indicate that the client-server architecture does not exhibit the same economies of scale associated with more traditional centralized architectures, which provide some forgiveness if trivial or peripheral applications are undertaken. These observations, coupled with the limited amount companies have to invest in information technology resources, make it critical that they carefully limit initiatives in this area.

In the particular case of a commercial or industrial companies, the agents are for example the shareholders, the customers/consumers, the subcontractors/competitors, the workers/employees etc. The role of the managers is to find and to maintain the adequate balance of resources between various management levels to respond to the conflicting interests of these agents without endangering the viability of the company. A distinction is made between operational, strategic and normative levels. Kolm's triangle is introduced as a convenient representation for making visible the relative strength of the three management levels. In the triangle a stability polygon representing a viability zone is identified and monitored by observing the company's indicators. failure paths are followed whenever the current representative point in Kolm's triangle shifts towards the boundaries of the stability polygon. Herewith a diagnostic tool is provided to the managers in charge to design control policies preventing such adverse evolution. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Marinescu, ID; Lavelle, JP				Marinescu, ID; Lavelle, JP			Innovation and globalization of manufacturing 2000	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						innovation; globalization; discovery; invention; manufacturing		The global economic structure is creating immense transformations in the way companies and nations organize production, trade goods, invest capital and develop new products and processes. Tomorrow's manufacturer needs a smaller workforce with higher-order multidisciplinary critical skills in management, labor, process and products to respond rapidly to opportunities and constraints. In this environment innovation is the engine for new products and technologies and globalization provides a new outlet paradigm for that innovation. Innovation and globalization are key strategic issues dealt with by most contemporary manufacturers. This paper will present these concepts and the interdependence between them as well as provide examples from industries in the United States and Japan. Significance: Product and process innovation for a company or industry is not a random event. The seeds of innovation are sown in discovery either directly or in a collaborative fashion. This work describes several paradigms of innovation and challenges companies to evaluate how innovation fits with their long-range business strategic plans.

The AWWA Research Foundation has funded two studies of benchmarking, is sponsoring expansion of WaterStats into a database that can support benchmarking efforts, and has defined two forms of benchmarking-metric benchmarking and process benchmarking. Metric benchmarking, more commonly used by water suppliers, involves tracking operations over time and comparing the performance against that of similar companies within one industry. Process benchmarking breaks system processes into individual steps and then compares these process elements with those of the best practice providers from ally field. For water utilities, benchmarking is particularly useful in five distinct applications: management review, strategic planning, outsourcing of services, reports to management, and system acquisition.

This test relates the temporal notions of leadership central to such models to the empirical methods of statistical causality. This test is performed using data from the US softwood plywood industry of the last three decades. Others have productively explored the spatial pricing practices of this industry by applying a leader-follower model. Similarly, we find that a leader-follower model explains well the temporal relations between key strategic variables (prices) in the industry. We conclude that the leader-follower model imposes meaningful restrictions on observable time-series data and that statistical causality is a useful method for testing these restrictions.

J	Rosenhead, JV				Rosenhead, JV			Success and survival - a comment	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on the Foundation, Development and Current Practice of OR Groups	MAY 20-22, 1996	BOWNESS ON WINDERMERE, ENGLAND			OR practice; client base; strategic OR; voluntary sector		It is proposed that consideration of the prospects for operational research should pay attention to changes, actual or projected, in the material base of its potential users. These include the IT revolution, the global restructuring of labour, de-layered management, smaller more autonomous business units, and privatisation of public services. It is argued that these developments have eroded OR's traditional institutional base, and are likely to continue to do so. Opportunities for offsetting gains are suggested in the areas of strategic analysis and of interaction support, both resting on the exploitation of participatory analytic methods. The 'third' or voluntary sector might also prove to have growth potential. Threats to the occupational cohesion and culture of OR are identified together with some possible remedies.

J	Samson, D; Wacker, J				Samson, D; Wacker, J			Maximising the 'benefits per dollar' to customers: A new organisational focus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						organisation; benefits per dollar; operations management; competitive performance		Organisations which engage in 'customer focus', continuous improvement and reengineering programs are attempting change initiatives which are not nearly deep enough to position them for the future. In the future organisational success will be based on focusing all strategies, decisions, collective energy and activity on maximising customers' benefit per dollar (BPD). In any industry, companies which achieve success in this regard will dominate traditional, continuously improving rivals. BPD-focused companies will have much more effective strategic decision processes than traditional companies and have truly prioritised the influence of activities which directly add value and influence BPD such as engineering, line operations and marketing relative to support activities such as information provision (traditionally accounting and information systems). We outline the new priorities for each of these functions. Accelerating international competitiveness will increasingly drive companies to ensure that all activities and agendas are derived from the principle of BPD maximisation. Although different market segments will always exist, companies will not be able to undertake pure cost leadership or pure differentiation positions. Reflecting consumer choice processes of maximising 'benefits per dollar', supply companies must increasingly compete on both costs and benefits simultaneously. More benefits are expected today than previously from low-end, no-frills products and price competition of luxury-end products has never been fiercer. Strategic decision paths will be to deduce product/service benefits from knowledge of customer requirements, translate these into features and designs then find the lowest cost path to manufacture and delivery of those benefits. This very focused process is in sharp contrast to traditional processes having cross-functional teams designing products to cost budgets. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Birchall, D; Smith, M				Birchall, D; Smith, M			Developing the skills of technologists in strategic decision making - a multi-media case approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic decision making; management competences; multi-media case study; MBA; case method in teaching; knowledge management tool		The information age is posing new challenges for organizations. The role of technology as a source of competitive advantage has long been recognized as dependent upon how effectively those within the organization deploy it. The contribution of technologists in shaping strategy is also well recognized. However, technologists are often seen as not having sufficient input into the strategic decision making process. Many turn to MBA programs to develop their knowledge, understanding and personal competences. In this paper the authors describe how the case method has traditionally been used to aid in this process. They then discuss the opportunities afforded by multi-media and group ware to create enhanced learning opportunities based on a dynamic case analysis. Such a system is seen by the authors as having the potential to be the backbone of a knowledge management system to support everyday decision-making.

J	Costa, RS; Jardim, EGM				Costa, RS; Jardim, EGM			Total punctuality approach for the jobbing industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Brazil; delivery date; delivery reliability; scheduling		Presents results of a nine-year research and development project. At the beginning a scheduling simulation software was built and assessed in real contexts. Then it has grown into a technology for shop-floor planning and control in the jobbing industry, developing now into a philosophy for strategic jobbing production management, named here as "Total punctuality approach". Based on this approach, a conceptual model was developed to orientate control system design in the jobbing industry. The model was conceived on a manufacturing strategy base being clearly driven by punctuality which was identified as being the main order winning criteria in such markets, when quality and price issues have already been resolved. Flexibility, speed and costs were addressed as well according to their relative importance to competitiveness. Concepts extracted from the various technologies available are mixed up forming a special blend with regard to the total punctuality goal. Almost all aspects of the model were implemented in a software that has been successfully used in small Brazilian jobbing firms. Using the software, it is possible to assess a large range of shop-floor management practices in terms of their contribution to the competitiveness of the company.

J	Middleton, P				Middleton, P			Software quality by administration	SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL			English	Article						information systems; management; methodology; public sector; SSADM; project management		This paper examines the efficiency and effectiveness of a prescriptive systems development methodology in practice. The UK Government's mandatory Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) was examined to determine its value to software projects. The evidence was collected from interviews with 17 project managers, discussions with participants on 3 large SSADM projects and from observing 90 end users in training. The conclusions are that prescriptive information systems methodologies are unlikely to cope well with strategic uncertainty, user communication or staff development. The recommendations are to focus more on soft organizational issues and to use approaches tailored to each project. 0963-9314 (C) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Programmed innovation occurs as a result of top down conscious efforts by the top management. Emergent innovation occurs spontaneously from the bottom up. In today's dynamic environments, competitive positioning and strategic adaptation should be vastly improved with the judicious balancing and shifting of programmed and emergent innovation. Dynamic control mechanisms give managers the ability to do this. The common driver behind these control mechanisms is the notion of tight and loose interlocks. Five ideal types of mechanisms work alone and in concert with each other to effect innovation; administrative, institutional, cultural, game-theoretic and affective control mechanisms are described.

J	Tang, P; Hulsink, W				Tang, P; Hulsink, W			The winds of change: digital technologies, trading information and managing intellectual property rights	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						intellectual property rights; global governance; digital technologies; piracy; multimedia companies; collecting societies; Internet; electronic copyright management systems; electronic commerce		The paper will investigate how the management of intellectual property rights will affect the shaping of the newly emerging global and digital market place. The relevant question to be dealt with is: how can we understand the transformation in the content/copyright industries (as a consequence of technical change, sectoral convergence, and international deregulation) and the newly emerging patterns of competition in the digital/global era? Besides giving an overview of the traditional organization of the copyright industry (from creation and collective administration of rights to content production companies, and usage), the paper will discuss the major technological, economic, political-institutional, and international challenges creators, collecting societies and 'content companies' face now and in the near future. Finally, the coordination problems between creators, collecting societies, publishers and users, and the strategic opportunities and responses of the major stakeholders in the competitive copyright industries will be analysed. Although the discussion focuses on the developments of advanced industrial economies, the impact of these developments will have implications for economies that are less 'digitally' developed.

J	Hasan, H; Hasan, S				Hasan, H; Hasan, S			Computer based performance information for executives in local government	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article								Performance information is crucial to effective management. Computer-based information systems (CBIS) now play a significant role in the effective delivery of information to senior managers. Executive information systems (EIS) are emerging as popular tools to assist organisations in their strategic decision-making processes. This trend has spread from the private to the public sector, and is now evident in Australian government organisations. This article draws on the findings of a survey into the uses and benefits of CBIS and EIS, from a sample of Australian local government organisations. The study shows that lessons from the private sector are being heeded by system developers in public organisations, leading to successful EIS projects, or at beast improved CBIS. The study indicates that EIS, which were originally developed for profit-oriented private companies, are now seen as appropriate for many public sector organisations, providing effective delivery of information to senior managers. Survey results indicate that improved information systems give executives a more accurate picture of their organisation's performance and so provide support for improved strategic decision-making. In addition, EIS are seen by respondents as offering significant benefits not only to managers but also to the rest of the organisation.

J	Robins, NS				Robins, NS			The role of groundwater as a strategic and economic asset in Northern Ireland	JOURNAL OF THE CHARTERED INSTITUTION OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						groundwater; Northern Ireland; water supply; yield		In Northern Ireland, groundwater contributes 77 Ml/d out of 700 Ml/d in public supply, and a further 31 Ml/d to private users, Of the latter, agriculture takes about 11 Ml/d and industry uses 18 Ml/d; a further 2 Ml/d are consumed by up to 15 000 people for rural domestic needs. Groundwater is a protected asset and, as such, its use should be maximized for both strategic and commercial gain. Increased demand on the public supply system by the year 2001 will involve no new major groundwater input, but private exploitation of groundwater will increase, particularly by the specialist industries such as electronics and water bottling.

In an era of flattened research budgets, the overarching concern has become how more can be done with less. One approach, still novel for the biomedical research community but proven successful for the commercial sector, is the establishment of strategic alliances. Among federal entities, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Office Of Research on Minority Health (ORMH) have as their goal the improvement of the health of the nation's minorities through support for alliances between academic research institutions. These partnerships serve to maximize an institution's opportunity for success, especially with regard to research and training. There are many different opportunities for institutions to establish partnerships, especially among minority institutions, and between minority and majority institutions. Features of successful alliances are described, working partnership models identified, and other opportunities explored.

J	Whitman, ME; Gibson, ML				Whitman, ME; Gibson, ML			IT importance in supporting reengineering: Performance perceptions versus reality	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Rapid changes in the business environment are causing organizations to dramatically redesign how they do business. Business reengineering has been defined as the fundamental re thinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures. Reengineering cannot, however, accomplish radical redesign without the support of fundamental aspects of the organization, such as information technology. This research project surveyed 43 companies and identified five factors that individuals currently involved in, or experienced with, reengineering believe impact the use of information technology in strategic business reengineering. In addition, the study found six factors that respondents indicated they were actually observing as influencing the IT in BPR. These factors are presented and examined. The impact of critical change management issues are also addressed as integral parts of the factors.

J	Jain, RK				Jain, RK			Metrics of organization effectiveness	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Organization effectiveness is defined in the context of engineering and research organizations, and different approaches for determining organization effectiveness are presented. Metrics of organization effectiveness that include process, result, and strategic indicators to comprehensively focus on this issue are formulated. A questionnaire to define organization effectiveness elements for each one of these categories is developed and administered to a group of engineers and scientists. Questionnaire results are analyzed and presented. A conceptual framework that takes into account multiple objectives, preferences, and value trade-offs is suggested for identifying those items that may be crucial for organization effectiveness. Uses and integration of information technology are expected to have profound effects on engineering and research organizations, and their effectiveness. An analysis of potential improvements, effects, or impacts of the cyberfuture on engineering and research organizations is presented. Much of this information can provide a framework for developing organization-specific metrics of organization effectiveness.

This article describes strategic cost management within the framework of strategic management reflecting the current European approach. The conclusion is that at present European companies (1) are making core competencies the guiding ideas of their strategies, and (2) are striving aggressively to increase their value, first by reengineering practices, and second by 'inventing' new markets and satisfying all stakeholders, not only the shareholders, better and quicker than the competitors or other reference companies are able to do.

The data indicate that European technological competencies improved in the latter half of the 1980s. Increasingly, European firms adopted pro-active technology partnerships (joint ventures and technology exchanges) as opposed to passive activities (second-sourcing and licensing). Although the European research and development subsidy programmes of the 1980s attempted to remedy Europe's weaknesses, there are reasons for questioning the policy methods chosen. Given the risks of high cost close-to-market subsidies, policies for the 1990s should seek to encourage technology transfer from non-European partners and to stimulate healthy competition within Europe.

The system was originally based upon the Nissan 'green area' (GA) concept but it was extended at the company into a complete business management structure covering the entire business. This new structure involved a GA system in the operational activities of the business, for example shop-floor and commercial activities, a 'business excellence' GA system primarily aimed at business improvement and development projects and a business strategic GA system. The GA system was used throughout the business and integrated the activities of cells in the commercial, engineering and shop-floor domains. It was more than the quality circle concept in that it also provided a mechanism for performance assessment, business control, improvement, training and communication.

A least squares analysis of cross-sectional information indicated relative market share and revenue per employee were statistically significant components of profitability in this sector. States that focus on these factors may lend direction to the management of services, especially at the strategic level.

J	Zavanella, L				Zavanella, L			Guidelines for tool store dimensioning in flexible manufacturing using an analytical technique	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Working Seminar on Production Economics	FEB 21-25, 1994	INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA			tool management; analytical techniques	RELIABILITIES; CONSTRAINTS; SYSTEMS; FMS	The problem of tool management has become extremely relevant with the increased applicability of automated control of manufacturing and flexible production. Combination of proper tooling of the machining centres with the item flow is now a strategic feature, because of the importance of tool cost in production accounting. The present study proposes a review of the parameters which influence the dimensioning of tool inventory, e.g. tool life, batch size, duration of machining jobs. In addition, the paper reviews different tool management strategies and compares them. Their performance and influence on the tool spectrum determination are evaluated by an analytical technique based on Queueing Theory.

J	Choi, K				Choi, K			An approach to a common form of defense white paper	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	CSBM Working-Group Meeting, at the 4th Council-for-Security-Cooperation-in-the-Asia-Pacific	APR 22-23, 1996	WASHINGTON, DC	Council Secur Cooperat Asia Pacific, CSBM Working Grp				A defense white paper is ''the authoritative, open, publicly available, and highly specialized official document prepared for and published by a country's ministry or department of defense. It not only provides a review of defense issues of the past and present but also provides the blueprint and vision for various defense fields for the future. Given the strategic reality of the Asia Pacific, many scholars and policymakers argue for the publication of defense white papers (or defense policy papers) as a way to promote transparency. In the Asia Pacific the number of countries who publish a defense white paper is increasing, and many who do not presently are considering to do so soon: quite a positive signal. However, form and contents of defense white papers differ from one country to another, as do type, scope, and level of information. Sometimes a current version differs from the previous ones. There are many variations regarding defense white papers longitudinally, cross-sectionally, or both. Of course, all these variables are determined state by state. However, if we had a standard format for a defense white paper, and if we could agree on that form, we might be able to decrease such variations and increase trust and confidence among the Asia Pacific nations by reducing the chances of misjudgment and misinterpretation. Each defense white paper would meet the five criteria: comprehensiveness, balance and harmony, preciseness and reliability, consistency and standardization, and availability. It would cover at least the following six areas: threat assessment (or assessment of security environment); national security objectives and goals; current defense posture; defense requirement and initiatives; defense management; and overall evaluation. However, publication of a defense white paper is a unilateral and voluntary measure. In most cases, it is targeted to the domestic audience. No one 'can force others to publish one or to use certain forms or outlines. Nor is it an easy task for any country to change its format, contents, and scope and level of information to meet a common format; each country has its own rationale for having a specific format. To promote the idea of common form of defense white paper, there should exist consensus between the concerned states at the governmental level. We should at the beginning take a ''minimalist approach.'' In the meantime, it is possible to adopt the following measures to increase transparency and to build confidence and trust among the states in the region: utilization of internet web sites; expansion of ARF ISG and direct involvement of military personnel in the ARF ISG; and inclusion of each government's reply(ies) to UN requests in an appendix.									*DEF AG JAP, 1994, DEF JAP 1994; Information Office of the State Council, 1995, CHIN ARMS CONTR DIS; *ROK MIN NAT DEF, 1995, DEF WHIT PAP 1995 19; ROTFELD AD, 1986, BUILDING SECURITY EU, P112; *US SECR DEF, 1996, ANN REP PRES C 1996; 1994, DEFENDING AUSTR DEF; DEF NZ 1991 POLICY P, P14	7	1	1	0	1	KOREAN INST DEFENSE ANALYSES	SEOUL	OFFICE RESEARCH COOPERATION, PO BOX 250, SEOUL 130-650, SOUTH KOREA	1016-3271			KOREAN J DEF ANAL	Korean J.

Software already dominates the computer industry while its role in electronic products such as telecommunications equipment, medical systems and televisions is rapidly increasing. A four stage model that describes the transition of the electronics industry is presented in this paper. The four stages are the hardware stage, the embedded software stage, the proprietary software stage and the open system stage. The authors will argue that market forces will drive most of the electronics industries to the open system stage in which software is the driving force. Consequences for electronics companies are discussed and two possible strategies are outlined.

A framework is constructed for the analysis of environmental issues in relation to the dynamics of business, from input via processes through to output and outcome. The concept of quality of products and services is matched with the concern for pollution and quality of life. Guidelines are presented for effective codes of practice for environmental responsibility with specific focus on technology. Examples are given from both European and American perspectives. It is the link between corporate responsibility, technology and strategic performance that organizations would need to integrate into their corporate culture of the future.

Although caused by several factors, previous research has demonstrated that social, labour, organizational and cultural variables are closely linked to the turnover problem. To study the strategies that managers use to retain workers in their companies in the USA and how they apply those strategies to subsidiaries in Mexico, selects 13 multinationals with headquarters in north east Ohio and plant operations in Mexico and interviews were conducted with human resources top executives. Finds that each one of the companies has adapted and implemented similar policies consistent with the factors previously identified.

In the case of flexible and CIM-orientated plants, it is essential to evaluate the effects of different dispatching rules to foresee the system performance. The Authors proposed an analytical technique, based on the Markov Chain Theory, enabling the analysis of the behaviour of some common-practice dispatching rules. The results obtained in the previous studies suggested the application of the analytical method to a dispatching rule observing a variable priority criterion. This research aims to show the possibility of extending the method to the investigation of such dispatching rules, offering some of the results that this kind of approach may lead to.

Staff of South West Water Services have carried out a strategic review of sludge utilization and treatment options, and have developed a strategic planning computer model to assist in the financial evaluation of the many options which are available. The strategy allows for the provision of new raw sludge thermal-drying facilities for the anticipated increase in sludge production. Trials were carried out with an indirect dryer system to develop and investigate the operational issues and use of the dried raw product. The initial trial produced a fluffy, low-density material with poor storage and handling characteristics, apparently associated with the high-fibre content of the sludge. The process has been modified to include pelletization.			BROWN, MJ (corresponding author), SW WATER SERV LTD,EXETER,DEVON,ENGLAND.

J	STEWART, TM; MUMFORD, J				STEWART, TM; MUMFORD, J			PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT IN HAWKES-BAY, NEW-ZEALAND APPLE ORCHARDS - RESULTS OF AN ADVICE-GIVERS SURVEY	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CROP AND HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						APPLES; MALUS-DOMESTICA; SURVEY; SERVICING SECTOR; CONSULTANTS; PEST AND DISEASE ADVICE; REDUCED PESTICIDE USE; TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER		Twenty-seven Hawke's Bay, New Zealand apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) pest and disease control ''advisers'' including horticultural merchant and New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board (NZAPMB) field representatives, private consultants, and apple plant protection scientists (The Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Ltd (HortResearch)) were interviewed over the 1993/94 growing season to determine their role in growers' pest and disease spray decision-making. Horticultural merchant representatives considered themselves to be the main spray decision-maker for 40% of growers. In the opinion of the latter, 50% of growers expected the horticultural merchant representative to know more about the problems in the orchard than they did themselves. Plant protection scientists and (increasingly) NZAPMB representatives play an important role in strategic pest and disease advice to the industry. Growers are very well serviced in the Hawke's Bay region which has led to an expectation of ''free'' advice regarding pest and disease management. Spray recommendations from merchant representatives and consultants are generally risk-free and prescriptive, with a large safety margin applied for unskilled growers. Introducing more complex spray-saving techniques, or taking full advantage of those that already exist, will require many growers either to upskill themselves, or employ consultants to manage their orchards. NZAPMB/HortResearch seminars and bulletins along with an on-line advisory service (e.g., Orchard 2000) could play a useful role in educating,growers and providing more complex advice. Basic pest and disease identification and biology, together with a knowledge of pesticides are regarded as being essential to manage pests and diseases successfully. Nutritional problems and resistance development are two areas where more knowledge is required.

Survey findings revealed the pressures of economic and business conditions of the early 1990s, and identified a number of kev Information Systems (IS)-related concerns. While investment in technology and systems may have slowed as a result of the current economic climate, business management still have considerable expectations from IS. The top two management issues in the 1992 survey were: gaining business value from current investment in IT, and achieving alignment between business and information strategies. IS executives also indicated strongly that business managers hale yet to realise the potential of IT to make a significant contribution to improving client services, did not fully understand the size of the IT investment, and did not believe that IS provided a quality service. Improving these perceptions nias regarded as critical for successful performance as an IS manager. The three most significant technological issues for AS/G organisations were the development and implementation of IT infrastructure, the application of client server architecture (CSA), and mechanisms for the establishment of interorganisational electronic data interchange (EDI). Implementing an appropriate IT infrastructure was seen as particularly important, and was viewed as a way of realising the long term strategic intent of an organisation, while maintaining flexibility and containing costs. The overall message of the 1992 survey is that closer links need to be forged between IS and business management, with IS playing a more proactive role. The paper concludes with a number of suggestions for IS managers seeking to achieve this, and move forward in their organisations.

It discuses the aims of the 'new economic order' and attempts to discriminate positively in favor of under-developed countries. Proposals of sharing technology by active intervention are outlined and the problems associated with technology transfer discussed. Changing attitudes of the OECD countries, led by the USA, are attributed to globalization of the world market, leading to legal uniformity. Finally, the paper predicts that developed countries will increasingly concentrate on lighter industries and will require a more efficient international legal structure.

The highly competitive nature of the banking world makes it necessary for institutions to gain an understanding of their environment, and thus the way in which they organise and use information is of crucial importance. The research explored the organisational role of departments concerned with environmental analysis, the character of business environment analysis and the nature of the information used. It suggested that the way in which information is collected and analysed to make strategic decisions appears directly linked to organisational structure and particularly to the extent of decentralisation. Such structures differ noticeably and it is unclear how far business units are involved with both enviromnental analysis and the supply of information to the centre.

Few topics generate as much interest today. What is leadership? How do effective executives inspire and instruct their employees to do their best work What do tomorrow's leaders in judicial administration need to know and to do? What are the pressing issues they must confront? What is the context in which leadership must operate today? This article explores some of the issues of leadership, ventures some tentative answers to the questions about the development of leadership in the courts, and describes four challenges and opportunities facing leaders in judicial administration in what promises to be a virtual transformation of the courts, including an increasing responsibility for social problem solving, institution building, and governance; the crumbling barrier between the public and private sectors; the need for continuous learning by individuals and court organizations alike; and the need to maintain strategic focus.

J	MARSH, I				MARSH, I			POLITICAL LEARNING-DISABILITIES OF THE 2-PARTY REGIME	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							POLICY; DEMOCRACY; TRADE; STATE	This paper examines the characteristics of the two-party regime from the perspective of its impact on political learning. The idea of political learning and the way it is differently framed in different regimes is first outlined. The relationship between the experience of learning and the structure of power is then explored. Next, four particular features of the political learning that is fostered by the two-party regime are noted: first, political learning takes place overwhelmingly through election campaigns and parliamentary conflict; second, political learning is largely focused on competing statements of general interests; third, political learning about strategic issues takes place in a horizon broadly defined by the life of parliament; fourth, there is virtually no capacity for bipartisanship on any phase of any issue. The compatibility of these patterns of political learning with the learning required by two possible roles for the state is then considered. First, in relation to economic competitiveness, an extensive literature on the developmental states of Japan and east Asia attests to the contribution of a broad social consensus about longer-term goals. Second, in relation to interest integration, there is an extensive literature pointing to the inadequacies of private managed incorporation. This is illustrated by reference to the link between the absence of a wage norm and current British labour market outcomes. The political learning mediated by the two-party regime is incapable of dealing with either situation. This incapacity has its genesis in the structure of power in the two-party regime. The paper thus concludes economic competitiveness and fairness can be reconciled at a new substantive level only in a new participatory context.

J	NOORI, H				NOORI, H			MODELING SUCCESSFUL TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN			English	Article						ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY (AMT); COMPETITION; INNOVATION; PRODUCTIVITY; PROFITABILITY; SURVEY		The design by a firm to invest in advanced manufacturing technology is based on the expectations of at least a market return on the investment within the competitive marketplace. In this paper, a conceptual model is proposed describing the sequential relationship between new technology investment and profitability. The model is based on an empirical study of Canadian manufacturing companies undertaken recently. In a broader sense, the investment and implementation of new technology will affect many factors that can be captured under three general categories: (i) technical, (ii) human organizational, and (iii) strategic. Each of these three categories contains a a number of components which could, in turn, affect profitability sources independently in combination with components in one of the other categories.

J	STUMPF, W				STUMPF, W			THE FUTURE-ROLE OF NUCLEAR-POWER IN ADDRESSING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-PROBLEMS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING			English	Article								Decision makers have to increasingly balance the costs versus benefits of various energy choices against a background of global environmental deterioration. This is particularly so in the choice of long term electricity production strategies where these have to be balanced against the potential of a very severe disruption of the world's climate due to global warming. In this presentation, the threat of global warming is quantified and scenarios are developed of future predicted energy consumption patterns and their impact on international policies to curb global warming, are analyzed. The conclusion is reached that the threat of global warming is so severe that, on the macro level, an international accepted strategy of utilising a proper balance between all forms of electricity production, is a matter of priority and that all national energy choices should be taken against this framework. Such strategic decisions on the macro level must, however, also translate into the micro level of energy production on topics which include: more efficient plant utilisation; more effective risk management; correct choice and application of technology; and better understanding of issues concerning safety, quality and environmental impact.

This paper, therefore, begins with an examination of the gender roles including reproductive, productive and community management activities. Establishing that men and women have differential gender roles, the concept of practical and strategic gender needs are defined and illustrated. This follows outlining a framework for gender analysis and examining its various components like activity analysis, resource analysis, benefits analysis, inclusion analysis and social sustainability analysis. How these five components provide basis for designing and implementing projects that can benefit women and benefit by women's participation are also shown through an inventory of project cycle adaptation parameters.

Applying our algorithm in the context of a sociability survey allows us to pinpoint groups with sociological coherence. The study shows that network differences correspond to socio-demographic differences.

A study of several banks in the USA reveals various areas where support is needed for successful operation of IS. Three areas emerged from the study, namely (a) installation and updates, (b) problem solving, and (c) training and documentation. Training and documentation were the areas most lacking in support. Managers should strive for better support in this area from internal IS departments and from software vendors. A valid instrument is provided for measuring current IS support levels and for identifying and improving deficient areas.

Using a game theoretic analysis, we study an equilibrium channel structure under different power balance scenarios. We show that refiners cannot increase their profits by strategic disintegration when their intermediaries retain more power than they do. We also investigate power balance issues in three-level, unintegrated channels. Finally, we apply our results to the gasoline market in Korea, and discuss policy implications.

These systems constrain people's talents. They are characterised by concentrated decision-making power, leading to such problems as product market monopolisation, deindustrialisation and constrained technological change. In contrast, it is desirable to cultivate a diffuse, deconcentrated economic process where people are given new roles in society. We advocate a process where communities strategically plan their own futures and do so using markets as an instrument. Government industrial policies - for example measures to influence technological progress - should be designed and assessed in the context of nurturing such democratic economies.

J	GLASNER, P; ROTHMAN, H				GLASNER, P; ROTHMAN, H			SCIENCE STUDIES - A GUIDE FOR STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT	TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The paper describes and discusses the current state of science studies research and its linkages to other fields, such as applied policy and management. It is argued that science studies is differentiated into science and technology studies, and science and technology policy research; and that these are twin interdisciplinary areas of research in which a whole range of social scientists, as well as historians and philosophers are involved. The high degree of interdisciplinarity makes the field peculiarly difficult to categorize simply. Nevertheless, it is sufficiently mature and focused to be an established academic field in its own right; it possesses its own journal structure, specialized institutions, national and international professional associations, and teaching programmes. Research in science studies is potentially applicable-especially in the longer term-for policy-makers in the public and private sectors, as well as for public interest groups. However, the need to bridge a perceived gap between academic studies and the needs of policy-makers is highlighted. Finally, a listing of emerging issues wa the field is provided.

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in the transportation is used as an exemplary case. Recent research has shown that higher efficiency is the main reason for service organisations to implement EDI. But ED] can also be used as an enabling tool to develop new or improved customer services-e.g. tracking and tracing, real door-to-door concepts etcetera. But in most organisations it takes time to discover the strategic potentials of EDI. In the first part of the paper the field of customer service and new information technology are described. Subsequently, the two subjects are linked in a theory on innovation in services, termed the reverse product cycle theory posed by Barras [4, 5]. Finally some first results are presented.

Yet it is clear that, in practice, the reality generally seems to have fallen well short of the ideal. Organisations seeking strategic advantage from their information systems frequently undertake a Strategic Information Systems Planning (SISP) exercise as an initial step. However, despite the substantial increase in SISP activity over the last decade, it would appear that most strategies have not been successfully implemented. In this paper, some important recent research in support of this contention is summarised, and key problems in SISP implementation are identified. It is argued that: (i) the objective of data and systems integration is a distinguishing characteristic of SISP work; (ii) such integration may cause major changes to the balance of organisational power; (iii) SISP implementation is unlikely to be successful unless political turbulence caused by potential power losses is adequately addressed; and (iv) political turbulence may well be the single most important issue facing SISP implementors. Strategy implementation problems are illustrated through reference to a recent, major (three-year) case study of a SISP implementation in one of Australia's largest organisations. We conclude by presenting some suggestions aimed at offering a way forward out of the current malaise.

Simulation results indicate that an operative ceiling price that is unknown to bidders will yield lower supply costs to the buyer than when the latter announces the reservation price truthfully. However, given enough bidders, the buyer can achieve an even lower expected cost of supply by announcing a falsely low reservation price.

J	Noe, TH; Rebello, MJ				Noe, Thomas H.; Rebello, Michael J.			RENT DIVISION, RESTRUCTURING, AND MANAGERIAL RISK TAKING: A STRATEGIC BARGAINING MODEL	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article								This paper demonstrafes that, when the manager of a poorly performing firm generates firm-specific rents, strategic considerations associated with anticipated future restructuring may lead to the adoption of risky operating policies. Furthermore, this bias toward risky policies may be exacerbated by increases in managerial entrenchment. This is the case even when the manager does not have an ownership slake in the firm. On the other hand, a manager of a firm that is performing well will prefer safer policies. These results are driven by endogenously determined management-borne costs of financial distress, and obtain under both restructuring regimes that enforce the priority of creditor claims as well as restructuring regimes that induce deviations from absolute priority.

The first part of the paper examines the history of database marketing and the development of two different approaches. In the first approach, the database is used tactically as a high quality mailing list. In the second approach, the database is used strategically, to re-engineer the sales and marketing process. The second part of the paper looks at the practical issues in implementing the strategic approach. Risk management rules are proposed to deal with these implementation problems, and sources of advice and assistance described.

The methodologies employed are described: exploratory positioning research; static/driven clinic and advertising assessment, each having an important and distinct part to play. The paper also demonstrates the strategic role of research. Research at Volvo is clearly positioned as a management tool that recognises the commercial application of findings and maximises the contribution research suppliers can make to the company.

(That is) ... the search for industry best practices that will lead to superior performance'' (Camp 1989, p.10). ''Benchmarking'' or die ''Search for Industry Best Practices'' has been accepted as a useful strategic tool. The move into the public administration arena is more recent. The underlying research in both cases is limited. The paper considers the advantage of benchmarking over business intelligence systems. Also, the government's stance on establishing quality programs and the relationships to benchmarking are considered. The paper is based on research conducted in the public sector in Western Australia to determine the extent to which benchmarking is used. The results indicate that whilst the concept is being embraced, the full range of benefits that could accrue is as yet not being realised. Indicators as to why this is so are outlined.

Ethical relativism concerns an individual's beliefs about the appropriateness of flexible vs. firm ethical standards to judge the actions of oneself and others. Higher levels of performance were associated with more relativistic orientations, while lower performance was associated with conflict. Role relativism was found to moderate the negative effects of conflict. Implications of the study for the practice of strategic management are discussed.

Broad activities include goal setting, strategic planning, training programmes coordination and resource allocation, courses methodologies selection, actual running and training evaluation. In order to provide an initial picture of the current OA training practices to the local OA planners/trainers, a survey was conducted of over 400 local trainers earlier last year (1992) to find out the general training methodology adopted by Hong Kong firms and public organisations (response rate = 12.7%). This paper reports the findings of the survey and provides recommendations on the general direction in which local organisations should head.

J	Espejo, R				Espejo, R.			Strategy, structure and information management	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						complexity; management processes; organization structure; performance measurement; viable system model		This paper offers a framework to relate strategy, structure and information systems in an organization. Current developments in information systems, particularly in the executive information systems (EIS) area, make apparent that the emphasis of design is in the ergonomy and flexibility of the reporijng, and not ih their alignment with effective management processes. Partially to overcome this shortcoming the paper offers criteria to improve management processes. Such criteria are provided by the viable system model (VSM). The emphasis is on the structural improvement of strategic processes. This leads to the discussion of a class of inlbrmation systems aimed at balancing the longer-term, strategic and the shorter-term, operational needs of the organization. Methodological and practical aspects for the implementation of such systems are discussed with reference to a management tool-CYBERSYN-which illustrates one way of linking information systems to management processes.

ISDN awareness: implications for the management of telecommunication technology	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Rapid changes in telecommunication technology ( TT) and its usage have elevated it to a strategic role. This strategic thrust of TT has certain implications for TT management. This paper reports on a study conducted to identify and analyse the factors that influence ISDN technology awareness in an organization. Based on a statistical analysis of the responses to a survey instrument, our hypotheses of a positive relationship between desirability of ISDN adoption and influence of external customers, strategic importance of TT, operational importance of TT, TT management awareness of ISDN, top management awareness of ISDN and extent of resource-sharing are tested. The implications of these factors for achieving enhanced connectivity through ISDN are discussed.	[Kunnathur, A. S.; Raghunathan, T.

J	MCSHERRY, D				MCSHERRY, D			DIALOG MANAGEMENT IN A TOOL-BASED KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION ENVIRONMENT	IRISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1993 Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Conference	1993	QUEENS UNIV, BELFAST, NORTH IRELAND		QUEENS UNIV		SYSTEMS	As knowledge acquisition environments grow in complexity, the number and diversity of tools provided can be overwhelming for unfamiliar users. Such users often lack the strategic knowledge necessary to build a complete and consistent knowledge base. A model of the knowledge elicitation process in a tool-based knowledge acquisition environment has been developed and implemented within the environment to guide the knowledge elicitation dialogue by identifying appropriate tasks at each stage of the process, recommending the most appropriate task to be undertaken, and guiding the user towards completion of the selected task. The approach emphasises the importance of modelling sub-tasks of the knowledge elicitation process, and strategic relationships between them, independently of the assumed problem-solving method and underlying method of knowledge representation. As a result, certain components of the model are potentially reusable with other problem-solving methods.

Massive flows of goods, services and capital cross international borders each day and at the same time, human activities in every community and every country are eroding the natural regenerative capacity of the environment. As a new strategy evolves for addressing these problems, the public health ramifications must not be blurred by debates over economic and social parameters. The National Environmental Health Association is in a strategic position to ensure a consistent focus on the human health aspects of environmental management.

This case study analyses the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by the drug misuse services of one Inner London district health authority (Bloomsbury) during the period 1985-89. While innovation and enthusiasm were much in evidence, a number of special problems prevented an effective and coherent strategic response. Key factors in the management of change in drugs/HIV services are identified which may be of special importance to clinicians, managers and funders and a number of key organizational and managerial competencies are suggested.

Specifically, what is the optimum expenditure level required to create an investment option? Can the Black & Scholes option pricing model be used to determine the approximate option value? This concept may have value to the petroleum industry in western Canada. Many oil companies have made strategic investments that could probably not have been justified by using standard economic analysis. The authors are unaware of any commonly used methodology to evaluate strategic investments. This paper includes a discussion of the variables in the Black & Scholes model to value having the option to develop hypothetical oil sands projects. The analysis will include consideration of the model's limitations and the difficulties of applying it in a corporate setting.

This has changed little over the last decade. The causes of this stagnation are analyzed, strategic choices as a function of clinical situations, size of aneurysm, and associated lesions exposed, and means explored to improve the prognosis. Since the perioperative mortality rate appears incompressible, an improvement in the prognosis of AAA can be obtained only by a combined medical effort. This requires the more rapid recognition ot' prodromal symptoms of rupture, the detection of a larger number ot' asymptomatic AAA and improved postoperative life expectancy, already reasonable, by more rigorous vascular and cardiologic surveillance.

A recent survey indicates there is much room for improvement in how state governments administer sponsored research in colleges and universities. It is time to look at research administration systems comprehensively-to target those requirements which are necessary, those which should be modified, and those which should be eliminated. Administrative flexibility is of greater strategic benefit to the state than achieving maximum reduction of risk through airtight administrative requirements.

Information must produce knowledge, and that knowledge must be combined with a strategic management style to be effective. The best information with the most insightful knowledge is sterile in the hands of a short-sighted executive. By the same token, without information, even a strategically oriented executive is operating only on the basis of good intentions. This article explores the lessons learned in a business unit implementation of an EIS, discusses the necessary conditions for an executive information system to improve organizational effectiveness, and presents a diagnostic model for management use.

J	Andreu, R; Ricart, JE; Valor, J				Andreu, R.; Ricart, J. E.; Valor, J.			The strategic dimension of transactional information systems: some organizational implications	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						information systems planning; organizational implications of IS; strategic information systems; transactional information systems		Often information systems (IS) are classified in three groups: (a) transactional, used mainly for co-ordination and resource allocation purposes at the operational level of a company; (b) tactical, often employed to support the resource procurement activities typical of middle management; and (c) information systems for strategic decision making, designed to help in the planning and strategy design processes which are the direct responsibility of top management. In general, the amount of care and management attention that companies give to these different types of systems is proportional to their position in this hierarchy: little attention is devoted to the mundane transaction-pushing systems and exquisite care is put into developing the sophisticated decision making aid for the CEO and his/her staff. The IS/IT literature has beer, reporting quite commonly cases in which companies have attained or lost great competitive advantages by way of their transactional information systems [for example, Emery Worldwide, Baxter Healthcare ASAP system, and Frontier Airlines]. The aim of this paper is to identify actions that companies can take to realize potential benefits of their IS, in particular from their low-level, transactional IS. Among other actions, we will conclude that companies would be better off if they: (a) have the IS department at the right place in the organization, staffed with people knowledgeable about the basic nature of the business in which the company is engaged; (b) are sensible to what can be called 'strategic maintenance' of systems, (c) set up a formal procedure for IS planning to ensure coherence between IS plans and business plans, derived, in turn, from business strategy, and (d) keep abreast of the relevant technology. Several examples taken from European companies are used to illustrate these conclusions.	[Andreu, R.; Ricart, J.

Information management in service industries: towards a strategic framework	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Business strategy; information resource management; service sector		Investments in information and communications technologies are large-scale, and often the real potential is not being realized. It is stressed that an information systems strategy should be aligned with the business strategy, and the management of the information resource is discussed by considering the components of a strategic framework. Aspects of implementation in the service sector are illustrated through a brief discussion of different variables which could be measured.	[Beaumont, J.

Brought about by market demand, the changes offer increased functionality at decreasing prices. These product benefits result from intense efforts to develop new concepts and materials, as well as new ways to process the materials. All companies that derive revenue from manufactured products are subject to market demand, but only those able to marshal adequate materials and processing resources will remain competitive.

They have usually been concerned with only one aspect of manufacturing strategy such as capacity or technology choice and have framed that choice using a single dimension of value such as cost. This study develops a comprehensive decision analysis model base which can be implemented as a DSS, to gain insight about the broader manufacturing strategy set. Decision trees, influence diagrams, Monte Carlo risk analysis and multiple criteria utility functions can contribute to a better understanding of and to decision support for manufacturing strategy formulation.

J	McCauley, HN				McCauley, Herbert N.			Developing a Corporate Private Network	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Telecommunications		The integration of telecommunication resources has been fundamental to Harris' information management systems strategy since the inception of a corporate-wide MIS program in 1977. From 1977 to 1979, communication requirements expanded rapidly. Traffic volume was evaluated periodically to determine the appropriate time to integrate voice, data, facsimile, text and, ultimately, video transmission for teleconferencing. In 1979, corporate MIS started a major program to optimize transmission of digitized voice and data over a private, satellite/microwave network, with switch/access networks at the three satellite earth station nodes to concentrate local traffic for wide area satellite transmission. The primary objective was improved cost-effectiveness by minimizing distance-tariff-usage sensitivity. The network has been in operation since December, 1980 and is achieving all cost and performance goals. Due to the high visibility of the network, Harris divisions are more sensitive to the cost and management of communications. The network positively impacted the overall MIS program, particularly the consolidation of telecommunications/office/data processing systems management, and its success influenced Harris' plans for future markets.
