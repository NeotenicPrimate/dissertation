J	Jungblut, M				Jungblut, Marc			Between sealed borders and welcome culture Analyzing mediated public diplomacy during the European migrant crisis	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Framing; Strategic communication; Public diplomacy; Governmental communication	ELECTIONS; NEWS; WAR	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the German and Hungarian Governments' mediated public diplomacy (mpd) efforts during the European migrant crisis and their reflection in the international news media. Design/methodology/approach - The study relies on a quantitative content analysis of English press releases and interviews distributed by the governments and their reflection in CNN and Al-Jazeera English. Overall, a sample of 483 texts was coded. Herein, the main actors, topics, frames, and information subsidies were analyzed. A comparison of the public diplomacy efforts and their reflection in the news then allows for assumptions about their potential impact on the news. Findings - The data shows that the Hungarian Government uses more information subsidies in their communication than their German counterpart. Hence, the news agenda shows more similarities to the main topics put forward in the Hungarian sub-sample. The news framing, however, is more favorable toward the perspectives put forward in the German public diplomacy. Practical implications - The results indicate that well planned and designed messaging does not guarantee successful communication. It also shows that critical journalism still plays an important role in the international news production. Originality/value - The paper's main contribution is that it goes beyond the war-based case studies on mpd and investigates one of the most relevant transnational issues in the last decades. In addition, it sheds light on why the media reflect some sponsored frames while they mostly discredit others.

We investigate whether asset transfers to children are an avenue which parents use to secure old age. We model post-marital residence and transfers simultaneously in a two-stage probit least squares estimation framework. We find a positive relationship between transfers and post-marital residence, a proxy for old age support. Children who receive more assets are more likely to stay at birth place after marriage and vice versa. In conditions of scarce or lacking social security mechanisms, parents make strategic transfers to ensure better old age.

J	Khadzhynova, O; Gonchar, V; Kalinin, O				Khadzhynova, Olena; Gonchar, Victoriya; Kalinin, Oleksandr			RESEARCH ON INVESTMENT APPEAL AND COMPETITIVE CAPACITY OF INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES OF UKRAINE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						investment appeal; competitiveness; strategic management; industrial enterprises		The purpose of the research is an elaboration of theoretical, methodological, and methodical approaches to forming and developing competitive capacity and investment appeal of steel industry enterprises. The achievement of the given purpose has led to the necessity of formulating such scientific research concept, which bottom line is in the relevance of using modern management methods implemented in foreign manufacturing practices. These are innovative economic, technical, organizational, and corporate methods of managing enterprises with the help of developed systems of managing strategic changes in enterprise activities, the steel industry in particular, which will contribute to achieving the high level of effectiveness and competitiveness of domestic business units. The research methodology is based on the combination of theories of managing economic systems in the globalized market economy. The empirical base for the research consists of the works by domestic and foreign scientists on problems of formation and development of strategic change management systems at industrial enterprises, statistical records, companies' public records in the Internet, data of international information agencies, Ukrainian legislation on regulating economic activity of enterprises. In carrying out the research, such methods were used as: general academic analysis and synthesis, systemic generalization, statistic and correlation analysis (when justifying the directions of development before carrying out the economic analysis of activities of metallurgical enterprises). There is a conclusion that the industry is concentrated and, consequently, long-term trends are quite predictable, but they require additional clarifications, taking into consideration the uncertainty in the modern state of world economy. It is determined that metallurgy development depends on GBP. The analysis shows that the countries with the high GDP level have quite developed metallurgy. One of the main problems of modern industries (metallurgy included) is the problem of corporate management and its reactions to challenges of the external environment, which is becoming less and less predictable for analysts. We have presented the recommendations on improvement of strategic management to increase the investment appeal.

The task of energy-efficient development is solved through the search of the agreed scenarios of development of the Fuel and Energy Complex (FEC) and economy of the region; the scenarios which help to achieve the maximum approach to the targets for the offered system of energy indicators. The authors developed a dynamic multisectoral model of the Fuel and Energy Complex, which reproduces interconnected production processes, processing, transportation and use of all types of fuel and energy resources in the region. The methodology of formation of the multiple regional fuel and energy balance (FEB) is offered. It allows predicting energy intensity and energy consumption of economy, including, energy consumption of GRP, estimating energy security and energy efficiency of economy, and revealing "narrow" places and threats in FEC development. The methods and algorithms allowing solving the problems of multi-purpose management of FEC for many tens of the purposes and hundreds of control variables are developed for estimation of achievability of the purposes of energy-efficient development of the Russian Federation regions. On the basis of the methods and models, presented in the article, information technologies of situational forecasting and strategic planning are realized in the form of predictive and analytical system, aimed at support of managerial decisions of regional authorities in the task of energy efficiency and energy security increase at the Russian Federation regions. The developed tooling was calibrated on the statistical material of the Samara region and was tested while solving practical tasks of strategic planning of energy-efficient development of the Russian Federation regions.

J	Khocha, N				Khocha, Nadiya			THE ORGANIZATION OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING AT SMALL ENTERPRISES IN UKRAINE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						small enterprise; management accounting; tools; methods; organization		The purpose of the research is to study the organization of managerial accounting in Ukrainian small enterprises. Methodology. The survey of management accounting is conducted by an interview with the manager/chief accountant/financial director of small enterprises, or by sending the questionnaires to these persons via the e-mail. The sample of study includes fifty-five small enterprises of the Lviv region in different types of activities and forms of ownership. Results. Analysis of theoretical base of Ukrainian scholars and the experience of management accounting in foreign small enterprises allowed distinguishing three main stages of the study. Summarizing the results of the survey, received on the base of the questionnaire of the first stage "Information for management decision-making", we can conclude that the main source of information for the manager in making managerial decisions are the operational reports or their combination with financial assessment; the preparation of such information is made by chief accountant (outsourcer), who submits it to the chief manager daily, once per week or month.The indicators of financial reporting, analytical information, obtained on the base of management accounting methods, as well as non-financial indicators that characterize the economic activities of a small enterprise, are the basis for managers in managerial decision-making. The results of the second stage "Practice of conducting the management accounting" show that, in order to improve the financial position of small enterprises, their managers use information derived from the application of methods of operational and strategic management accounting. However, the level of their implementation is rather low since most small entities use only one of the methods of operational and strategic management accounting. It is defined that the number of management accounting methods used by small enterprises is higher if the founders are foreign citizens and/or whose average number of employees exceeds 30 persons. Significant money and time expenditures for the organization and conducting of the management accounting are the main reason for the refusal to use it at small enterprises, due to the results of the third phase of the research "Reasons for the refusal from the management accounting and organization of management accounting". Otherwise, most of the small enterprises have an understanding of the benefits from using management accounting, as well as do not deny the expediency of its organization and determine the methods of managerial accounting, which will help to improve their financial situation. Practical implications. The results of the study confirmed that a sufficient part of the management informational support at small enterprises of Lviv region is the information obtained by the use of methods and tools of managerial accounting. However, we can observe a low level of their application. Therefore, appears a need to ensure the awareness of managers on the benefits of using different management accounting methods, which can be achieved by attending specialized courses, trainings or seminars conducted on the base of higher education institutions. Value/originality. The results of the study are the framework for the creation a theoretical base of managerial accounting for Ukrainian small business entities and mechanisms of its implementation in practice.

Evidence from Hugumbirda forest, Tigray, Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY			English	Article						Climate-related benefits; smallholder farmers; communal interventions; livelihood enhancement; state forest		Forest rehabilitation activities within centrally controlled state-owned forests in Ethiopia could not deliver communities with increased income. A study aiming to assess the benefits of forests for smallholder farmers whose land falls close to the state forest was conducted in Hugumbirda and Endedo kebele, two villages located adjacent to the Hugumbirda forest. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect data from 251 randomly selected households living near or adjacent to the state forest. A logit model was used to analyze factors affecting household's willingness to scale up forests at the communal level. Most of the respondents living near or adjacent to the national forest were found to be dependent on the forest for fuelwood and therefore energy, timber products, and farming equipment. Furthermore, households were found to perceive that communal intervention management is a significant factor in attempts to further scale up forests. Scale-up of forests at the community was one option to enhance the vegetation cover and therefore increase primary production by promoting infiltration and decrease evaporation and runoff water. Finally farmers have suggested the state forest should be devolved to the community to improve the current level of forest contributions to the livelihood of smallholder farmers.

In this series of two papers, we proposed a design support framework for strategic chemicals management in SMEs, and the supporting mechanisms in the framework were informatized as software tool developed in the case study of metal cleaning. In part 2, a software tool which informatized supporting mechanism in process design was developed for chemicals management in SMEs operating metal cleaning processes utilizing chlorinated organic solvents with an open-top washing machine. The developed tool was reviewed by trial users in cleaning industry. Such highly user-friendly tool dedicated for specific industry can strongly facilitate a strategic chemicals management by firm-level decision makers. An informatization approach through analysis scrutinizing industry-specific conditions can lead to familiarize SMEs with assessment methods of health and environmental impacts through practice of LCA and RA.

J	Kniazieva, T; Kolbushkin, Y; Smerichevskiy, S				Kniazieva, Tetiana; Kolbushkin, Yuriy; Smerichevskiy, Sergiy			METHOD OF STRATEGIC PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING CONSIDERING THE LIFE CYCLE THEORY	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						life cycle; portfolio analysis; strategic areas of management; financial results; management decisions efficiency		The subject of the study is a set of theoretical and methodological aspects of development strategy formed for objects (country, region, branch, enterprise) on the basis of the life cycles theory under the external environment uncertainty. The methodology of strategic planning under the external environment uncertainty with the consideration of the life cycle theory includes: the definition of key criteria for assessing the product lifecycle, the definition of the limits scope for the solvable problem, the definition of parameters of models stability, the formation of models for analysis, setting the problem under uncertainty, the mechanism of step-by-step adjustment, and effectiveness assessment of strategic decisions based on strategies, the algorithm for the integrated assessment of the strategies effectiveness taking into account the uncertainty factors. Strategic planning is not characterized by temporal intervals but by a set of strategies, each of which is determined by the ways of achieving the main object objectives. For a rapid analysis of the product life cycle, the external indicators are used, such as: the growth rate of the product market, the relative growth rate of the product (compared to the growth rate of the entire market of the region or country), the firm market share, the firm relative market share (compared to the market share of leading competitor), and internal indicators, such as: the dynamics of enterprise revenue by product, the dynamics of company profits by product, the dynamics of enterprise profitability by product, the dynamics of enterprise investment. For each indicator that describes the enterprise performance, the directions of change are taken: alpha - growth, const - constant or beta - decrease. The methodology involves a certain sequence of studying the product life cycle in retrospect and at the current moment, then the modelling and development of options for short-and long-term strategies implementation are made. Results of the survey are to substantiate the methodology of strategic planning under conditions of external environment uncertainty with the consideration of the life cycle theory. Practical implications: the possibilities of using life-cycle models allow: 1. reasonably predicting sales and plan production program; 2. determining the basic strategies at different stages of development; 3. determining the sequence of stages of enterprise development; 4. ensuring harmonious interaction of organizational characteristics with the external environment factors that influence the process of organizational development. Increasing the sustainability of the organization's development can be achieved by re-establishment of dynamic changes in the plan in terms of using effective methods for forecasting with the consideration of the life cycle theory. It is necessary to take into account the interconnection between all levels of life cycles: industry, technology, enterprises, product; ensuring the competitive advantage of the organization. Using the theory of optimal solutions making in uncertain conditions under the analysis of long-term projects allows transferring qualitative factors into quantitative indicators that can be used in the future to bring investment projects to the same kind and choose the best. In conditions of increased uncertainty of the external environment, it is necessary to develop the theory of enterprise management, taking into account its life cycle, as well as the life cycle of its separate elements and processes at all levels. Combination of strategic management with the life cycles theory will increase the objectivity and effectiveness of taken management decisions. The accounting of the organization life cycles in strategic planning allows choosing an effective strategy.

The choice of the direction of research is not random. Resource view in the analysis of strategy and strategy shaping (Barney, 1991) is an effective long term success tool. There are many costs in the process of resource allocation, in particular during resource valuation, in the market economy in connection, e.g. costs related to information collection and negotiating. Costs rise with the globalization of the economy. Therefore, it is important to create and maintain various institutions to control the level of costs and to study the most common practice of the resource strategy implementation. Particularly, it is important to study resource valuation in the context of institutional environment given the heterogeneity of markets. Human resource is the most important strategic resource on the market of professional command sport. At the same time, solving the problem of human resource allocation on this market leads to serious practical problems. Specifics of economic component of command sport results in the inevitability of labor market failure (Downward, Dawson, 2002) for sustainable development of the sector. Therefore, the need for institution which is to regulate the labor market occurs. Institute of transfer plays this role in some kinds of command sport, such as football. It is the system of concepts and rules, which regulate the transfer of athlete from one sport club to another prior to the expiration of the contract. The number of requirements exist due to the institute of transfer to the practice of athlete's valuation, which determine the sum and the order of payment of compensation for prior sporting club management. The latter should correlate with the value of the athletes, which they are interest in, with the existing restrictions, which is the reason of the strongly pronounced heterogeneity of markets. Formalization of existing practices of pricing in different segments of professional athletes' labor market is important for the support of decisions to invest in staff during resource strategy implementation. The current research deals with this problem. The model of linear regression with variable structure is used in the paper as the main instrument of formalization. The structure of the model reflects the structure of professional athletes' labor market.

J	Koohborfardhaghighi, S; Altmann, J				Koohborfardhaghighi, S.; Altmann, J.			How Organizational Structure Affects Organizational Learning	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE			English	Article						Knowledge Management Process; Exploration and Exploitation; Organizational Structure; Organizational Learning; Hybrid Network Structure	EXPLORATION; EXPLOITATION; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK	Nowadays, the knowledge has become a principal source of competitive advantage similar to other valuable resource and strategic assets in an organization. However, without proper management of such a valuable resource, utilization of knowledge becomes difficult and inefficient. From an organizational perspective, the most important aspect of knowledge management is to transfer knowledge. In this regards, organizations must adopt structures that allow them to create and transfer more knowledge. Organizational structure affects the nature of human interactions and knowledge flow which in its own turn can lead to a competitive advantage in the knowledge economy. In this article we emphasize the role of an organizational structure as a mechanism for knowledge flow and organizational learning. Hence we test organizational learning performance under different network structures which are mainly traditional hierarchical approach, hybrid structures and a fully connected network. Our experimental results indicate the fact that traditional hierarchical approach has the lowest performance in a learning organization while a fully connected network provides the best performance. The findings reflect the fact that organizations need a more flexible hybrid structure to allow mobility and lateral connection between the individuals, a structure which is between the two extremes, one of traditional hierarchy and the other of full connectivity pattern.

BUSINESS ANALYTICS OF ENTERPRISES IN TERMS OF STRATEGY	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						business analytics; business intelligence; strategic management; decision support; analytical competition		The paper is devoted to the problem of strategic business analytics. The aim of the study is to show business analytics supporting the construction and development of the company development strategy. In order to achieve the assumed goal there has been applied the method of critical analysis of the domestic and foreign literature in the field of business analytics of enterprises domestically and worldwide. In the paper, there have been identified the factors for the use of business analytics. Three priority factors which are the arguments for the application of business analytics in management processes and enterprise development strategies are: speed/ease of deployment (68% of indications), ease of use for business users (65% of indications) and self-service and data discovery tools (61% of indications). Moreover, managers of enterprises with the best economic and financial results, achieving return on assets (ROA) of more than 10%, almost agreeably (90% of indications) claim that analytical tools are necessary for the proper implementation of the strategy and the achievement of increasingly higher economic and financial results. The value of the paper consists in showing a new trend in the development of business analytics, which is to support the process of strategic management and analytical competition.

The theoretical and methodological background to the research is system and synergetic scientific approaches, which use in the research of the development of a socially-oriented economy is determined by orientation to basic values and fundamentals of the market economic system and focus on building a democratic society in Ukraine. Scientific results-it is substantiated that in modern conditions of transformational changes, a strategic course of Ukraine is to combine mechanisms of market self-regulation and state regulation, which in its basis is based on principles of socially-oriented economy. Such a model of the economy is focused on a human along with its needs and interests, relations with other members of society during production, distribution, exchange, and consumption. At the same time, social orientation foresees providing high productive economic management that configures private initiative and competition. Results of conducted analysis of analytical indicators of socioeconomic development of Ukraine show an urgent necessity and objectivity of forming a socially-oriented economy. It is proved that taking into account increase in openness of the national economy, it is appropriate to consider strict conditions concerning its adequacy to requirements of the current international competition. In this relation, there are analysed vectors of the formation of the socially-oriented economy in Ukraine declared by the Strategy of Sustainable Development "Ukraine-2020" within which a key reference point is an introduction in the country of European standards of living and its achieving a dominant position in the world. An economic platform of the formation and development of the socially-oriented economy is determined the following: providing economic freedom; availability of different types of business; development of competition; formation of a free pricing mechanism; creation of market and social infrastructure; formation of a model of the open economy. In addition, tools and measures of socioeconomic policy of the state are: transparency of activities of public authorities at all levels; focus of investment flows on an implementation of the nation's social potential and improvement of the population quality of life; priority of development of a transparent competitive area; demonopolization of business environment; strict control over the compliance with the international practical requirements; successive narrowing a sphere of influence of shadow economy and rooting out corruption; power consolidation and efficient cooperation of all its branches; solving a problem of a conflict in the southeast of Ukraine. Practical implication of the scientific results lies in the fact that the substantiated prerequisites and prospects for the formation and development of socially-oriented economy in Ukraine will contribute to the organization of public production that will combine efficiency of market mechanism and principles of self-organization on the basis of accentualization on achieving high standard of living for all segments of the population.

J	Kryger, A				Kryger, Anders			Strategy development through interview technique from narrative therapy	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Storytelling; Strategy development; Co-creation; Narrative therapy; Interview technique; Clinical inquiry	STORY; IMPACT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the successful strategy formulation process of a new purchasing department at an international engineering group. Design/methodology/approach - The strategy formulation was co-created by the department manager and employees at a storytelling workshop, facilitated with interview technique from narrative therapy, and later authorized by the business area director. The organizational intervention preceded the scholarly inquiry. Findings - Employees' retrospective storytelling about working at the company enabled them to formulate a joint mission statement using words and expressions from their own stories. Prospective storytelling enabled them to formulate a joint medium-and long-term vision and a corresponding action plan. This paper proposes interview technique from narrative therapy as a new practice-oriented strategic management tool and calls for further experimentation in rethinking best practices in strategy development. Originality/value - Introducing narrative therapy interview technique in an organizational context is valuable because it may facilitate affinity of employees to strategy through storytelling thus contributing to contextualized strategy formulation and paving the way for subsequent implementation. This "from practice to research" approach can serve as inspiration for action researchers interested in driving organizational change.

Knowledge level of shrimp farmers on better management practices (BMPs) of Penaeus vannamei farming: a comparative assessment of east and west coasts of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES			English	Article						Better management practices; Knowledge level; Penaeus vannamei; Shrimp farmers		Shrimp farmers need to have adequate knowledge and adopt better management practices (BMPs) for successful crop production. A study conducted among 240 proportionate random sample of shrimp farmers along the east and west coasts of the country has revealed that mean knowledge level of respondents was 52 and 44% respectively which needs improvement. Therefore, public-public and public-private partnership models integrating the efforts of research and development agencies, farmers groups and input companies need to be implemented for the capacity enhancement, increased access to quality inputs and services for the farmers. East coast has utilised 16% of its potential area and contributed 91% of country's shrimp production while west coast developed only 4% of potential area and contributed 9%. Limited access to quality inputs and services constrained their production vis-a-vis potential in the west coast. It is suggested that a strategic aquaculture development plan for the west coast states of India involving aquaculture research and development agencies as well as input companies is the urgent need of the hour for developing hatcheries, diagnostic laboratories, recommending location specific production systems and better management practices to enhance the capacity of farmers and production in the west coast states.

J	Kusumawardhani, M; Tore, M; Kumar, R				Kusumawardhani, Mayang; Tore, Markeset; Kumar, Rajesh			Development of strategic asset management planning in the petroleum industry	JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Asset management; Strategy; Petroleum; Strategic planning; Oil and gas; Asset integrity management	OIL; MAJORS	Purpose - Due to the certain risk carried in offshore petroleum installations, the integrity of these installations needs to be maintained at all times. Thus, asset integrity management (AIM) needs to be formulated and monitored to achieve the integrity objective. The purpose of this paper is to study the practices and progression of strategic AIM planning in the petroleum industry. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is written based on a literature study, observations and data collected from industry practitioners through an online questionnaire and interviews to study the AIM practices in their organization. Validation of the results is performed through respondents' reviews and cross-referencing with existing literature and supplemental data. Findings - The paper identifies, analyses and validates the work structure in formulating an AIM strategic plan. Research limitations/implications - Even though the research focuses on the AIM practices of offshore petroleum installations, the result can be implemented in similar fields. Originality/value - Researchers or practitioners can benefit from the knowledge gained of current practices and the presented work structure in establishing an AIM strategic plan.

J	L'Her, JF; Karthik, R; Desrosiers, S				L'Her, Jean-Francois; Karthik, Ram; Desrosiers, Stephanie			HOW TO CALIBRATE THE RISK OF BUYOUT INVESTMENTS? Through Buyout-Backed Initial Public Offerings	JOURNAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Private equity; leveraged buyouts; initial public offerings; risk-adjusted performance; reverse LBOs; BO-backed IPOs		This paper proposes to use the public market returns of buyout-backed initial public offerings (BO-backed IPOs) as a proxy for buyout funds'appraisal-based returns. Because they provide an economically significant route to exit, and their leverage and fund ownership are still significant three years after the IPO, they represent unique public candidates to directly assess the risks of buyout investments, and to circumvent the stale pricing issue inherent in appraisal-based returns. Our sample covers the 1980-2013 period, and comprises 1,063 BO-backed IPOs. Our risk factor analysis shows that the market betas are close to 1.2, and the loadings on size, value and liquidity are significantly positive. Further, the loadings on the Fama and French profitability and investment are both significantly negative. These results can guide the calibration of the expected return and risk of buyout investments in strategic asset allocation: beyond exposure to Large Cap Equities, approximately 40% of the risk and return of BO-backed IPOs is explained by additional exposure to the market, and exposures to risk factors.

J	Lamard, P; Lequin, YC				Lamard, Pierre; Lequin, Yves-Claude			ELEMENTS OF TECHNICAL DEMOCRACY	JOURNAL OF INNOVATION ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Democracy; Development; Modernization; Economic History; Political Economy; Industrial Policy		The concept of technical democracy is both obvious and perplexing: with technology so often appearing to be a natural extension of science, why should citizens have any say in the matter? And yet how could we imagine or accept that technical systems, which have such an impact on individual and collective choices, could escape the deliberations of civic opinion and decision-making? Citizens must be able to acquire the skills of democratic expertise to then be able to exercise them when strategic decisions are being taken. If we are to move towards this objective, the stakes are very high. Even if a movement is initiated that aims to construct a fairer, more civic and more democratic society, the appropriation of technical issues in both education and the workplace is confronted with multiple types of inertia.

The aim was also to explore whether these variables added to the likelihood of return to work to earlier defined significant variables in the group: age, perceived ADL ability and perceived ability in ET use. Method: A cross-sectional study. The Management of Everyday Technology Assessment (META), the short version of the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (S-ETUQ) and a revised version of the ADL taxonomy were used to evaluate 74 people with ABI. Individual ability measures from all assessments were generated by Rasch analyses and used for additional statistical analysis. Results: The univariate analyses showed that the observed ability to use ET, as well as intrapersonal capacities and environmental characteristics related to ET use were all significantly associated with returning to work. In the multivariate analyses, none of these associations remained. Conclusion: The explanatory precision of return to work in people with ABI increased minimally by adding the observed ability to use ET and the variables related to ET use when age, perceived ability in ET use and ADL had been taken in account.

J	Lau, G; Meredith, P; Bennett, S; Crompton, D; Dark, F				Lau, Geoffrey; Meredith, Pamela; Bennett, Sally; Crompton, David; Dark, Frances			A capability framework to develop leadership for evidence-informed therapies in publicly-funded mental health services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC LEADERSHIP			English	Article						Leadership; Mental health; Evidence-based practice; Capability framework; Therapies	COST-EFFECTIVENESS; CASE-MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; DEPRESSION; TRIAL	Purpose - It is difficult to replicate evidence-informed models of psychosocial and assertive care interventions in non-research settings, and means to determine workforce capability for psychosocial therapies have not been readily available. The purpose of this paper is to describe and provide a rationale for the Therapy Capability Framework (TCF) which aims to enhance access to, and quality of, evidence-informed practice for consumers of mental health services (MHSs) by strengthening workforce capabilities and leadership for psychosocial therapies. Design/methodology/approach - Guided by literature regarding the inadequacies and inconsistencies of evidence-informed practice provided by publicly-funded MHSs, this descriptive paper details the TCF and its application to enhance leadership and provision of evidence-informed psychosocial therapies within multi-disciplinary teams. Findings - The TCF affords both individual and strategic workforce development opportunities. Applying the TCF as a service-wide workforce strategy may assist publicly-funded mental health leaders, and other speciality health services, establish a culture that values leadership, efficiency, and evidence-informed practice. Originality/value - This paper introduces the TCF as an innovation to assist publicly-funded mental health leaders to transform standard case management roles to provide more evidence-informed psychosocial therapies. This may have clinical and cost-effective outcomes for public MHSs, the consumers, carers, and family members.

MANAGING SPORTS BRANDS IN A GLOBAL CONSUMER MARKET: COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN FIT IN CROSS-BORDER STRATEGIC BRAND ALLIANCES	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN SPORT PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION			English	Article						Cross-border strategic brand alliance; Country-of-origin fit; Product/brand fit	PRODUCT QUALITY; IMAGE TRANSFER; SPONSORSHIP; CONGRUITY; INFORMATION; ATTITUDES; PURCHASE; DRIVERS; EQUITY; IMPACT	The goal of this paper was to examine the effects of cross-border strategic brand alliances (SBAs) between host brands and partner brands on the evaluation of the consumer product. Two experimental studies using a series of 2 (Low vs. High COO fit) x 2 (Pre- vs. Post-attitudes) mixed factorial designs were conducted to understand the effect of Country-of-Origin (COO) fit on attitudes toward the host and partner brands. Data from a total of 244 college students were analysed using repeated measure ANOVAs and simple main effect analysis. The results of the first study revealed that high COO fit did not produce positive post-attitude changes toward the host brand On the other hand, low COO fit generated negative post-attitude changes toward the host brand when the host brand allied with another brand with an unfavourable country image. The results of the second study also support the findings of the first study in that attitude changes toward the partner brand were significantly affected by the level of COO fit. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed	[Lee, Jin-Kyun] Hongik Univ, Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, Sejong Si, South Korea; [Ahn, Taesoo] Merrimack Coll, Girard Sch Business & Int Commerce, Dept Mkt Int Business & Sport Management, N Andover, MA 01845 USA; [Lee, Wei-Na] Univ Texas Austin, Stan Richards Sch Advertising & Publ Relat, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Pedersen, Paul M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Sch Publ Hlth, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA		Ahn, T (corresponding author), Merrimack Coll, Sport Management, N Andover, MA 01845 USA.	ahnt@merrimack.edu		Pedersen, Paul M./0000-0002-9814-252X			Aaker D.A., 1991, MANAGING BRAND EQUIT; AAKER DA, 1990, J MARKETING, V54, P27, DOI 10.2307/1252171; Akdeniz B, 2013, PSYCHOL MARKET, V30, P76, DOI 10.1002/mar.20590; AMERICAN TIME USE SURVEY, 2014, TIM US AV WEEKD FULL; ANN H., 2012, J BRAND MANAGEMENT, V19, P414; BELL J., 2015, CHINESE SNEAKER BRAN; Bluemelhuber C, 2007, INT MARKET REV, V24, P427, DOI 10.1108/02651330710761008; Carvalho SW, 2011, J INT CONSUM MARK, V23, P135, DOI 10.1080/08961530.2011.543055; Chakraborti R., 2013, J BRAND STRATEGY, V2, P87; COBBS J., 2016, MARK MANAG, V25, P107; Cooke S., 2000, IRISH MARKETING REV, V13, P36; Desai KK, 2002, J MARKETING, V66, P73, DOI 10.1509/jmkg.66.1.73.18450; Elmuti D., 2001, MANAGE DECIS, V39, P205; Fishbein M., 1975, BELIEF ATTITUDES INT; Fleck ND, 2007, PSYCHOL MARKET, V24, P975, DOI 10.1002/mar.20192; Gross P, 2015, PSYCHOL MARKET, V32, P1079, DOI 10.1002/mar.20848; Gwinner KP, 1999, J ADVERTISING, V28, P47, DOI 10.1080/00913367.1999.10673595; Hadjicharalambous C., 2013, ACAD MARKETING STUDI, V17, P13; ICELLER K.

J	Leon, A; Mancheno, M				Leon, Amparito; Mancheno, Marcelo			Components of intellectual capital a focus toward the innovation of organizations	REVISTA PUBLICANDO			Spanish	Article						innovation; intellectual capital; knowledge management	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; ADOPTION	The objectives indicated in this research are related to the study of important conceptualizations on intellectual capital and innovation, considering that knowledge is an intangible, it is interesting to note that the analysis of its components points the way of organizations to achieve greater competitiveness, especially when It is about achieving added value for companies. We used the literature description relevant to the term intellectual capital and innovation, this review proposes interesting results to understand that intellectual capital is the addition of human capital, relational capital and structural capital, each has its implicit characteristics that if are not assimilated in their context, the potentialities of their content are wasted. In the same way, it provides a vision on the definitions of innovation, to understand how new ideas and knowledge can be generated for the benefit of organizations, this criterion on innovation is detailed based on scientific literature regarding product innovation And process, technological innovation, administrative innovation and incremental and radical innovation. The methodology that was used for the description of this article is the documentary, resorting to the localization of scientific articles in the databases of high impact journals, using keywords such as "intellectual capital" and "innovation".

J	Leshuk, H				Leshuk, Halyna			MONITORING MECHANISM FOR INVESTMENT DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONS' INFRASTRUCTURE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						monitoring; infrastructure; investment development; mechanism; region		The subject of the research is the theoretical and methodological principles of the monitoring mechanism of investment development of regions' infrastructure. The objectives of the research are the generalization of theoretical and methodological bases of monitoring mechanism of investment development of regions' infrastructure, as well as analysis of the current trends of investment development of the infrastructure in the regions of Ukraine with the identification of positive and negative trends. Methodology. The article deals with theoretical and methodological approaches to the definition of conceptual foundations of the mechanism of monitoring the investment development of the regions' infrastructure with the help of general scientific methods of analysis: systematization and generalization, induction, and deduction. Results. It is proposed to interpret a monitor of the investment development of the regional infrastructure (IDRI) as a systematic and complex measurement of the indicators of regional infrastructure development, the number of implemented investment projects, monitoring compliance with the developed strategic regional programs and concepts, which will ultimately help to effectively and efficiently regulate the detected deviations and passing the appropriate decisions.The IDRI monitoring mechanism should also provide a possibility of creating a system for collecting and analysing data concerning the assessment of infrastructure objects by the territorial community, which will allow potential investors to focus not only on analytical data on monitoring of regional authorities but also to take into account the public interest in a particular region. The general principles of the monitoring mechanism of investment development of the regions infrastructure are proposed in the following directions: complex and system monitoring and data collection concerning the development of the regions' infrastructure, while the aggregate of indicators should reflect the change in the level of investment potential as a result of the implementation of measures and implementation of investment projects for the development of regions' infrastructure; assessing the level of effectiveness of regional infrastructure functioning, using comparative analysis procedures - the concept of bench marking, which will allow reducing costs of improvement processes accordingly, as the best experience of management of other territories is studied and evaluated in order to use the acquired knowledge in the activities of the authorities. Conclusions. The researched theoretical and methodological principles of the monitoring mechanism of the investment development of the regions' infrastructure enable to substantiate the necessity of implementation of complex and system monitoring of the functioning of the infrastructure complex and the investment potential of regions. The researched tendencies of investment development of the Ukrainian regions' infrastructure allowed establishing significant spatial asymmetries, which negatively affects the implementation of both national development strategies and regional programs and concepts. Thus, the main directions of the monitoring mechanism of the investment development of the region's infrastructure in the composition should be based on analytical observation not only of the regional authorities but also potential investors and the territorial community. Practical meaning. On the basis of official static monitoring data of investment support and the level of development of the infrastructure complex of Ukrainian regions, trends of investment development of the regions infrastructure are investigated in the article, which allows noting about significant territorial imbalances as a level of investment support, as well as the efficiency of the functioning of the regions infrastructure complex, and this determines the need for the development of comprehensive regional development programs and proper control over their implementation in relation to investment regional infrastructure support. The system implementation of the mechanism for monitoring over the investment development of the regional infrastructure will facilitate the adoption of effective management decisions for all participants in the process, namely, the territorial community, investors, and regional authorities, which will increase the investment attractiveness of regions and the development of the Ukrainian regions' infrastructure.

J	Li, HM; O'Connor, A				Li, Huanmei; O'Connor, Allan			The entrepreneurial influence on winery market performance - a mediation perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WINE BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Entrepreneurial orientation; Opportunity; Winery market performance; Wine; Mediation	CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; RISK-TAKING; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; ORIENTATION; OPPORTUNITY; GROWTH; FIT; INTERNATIONALIZATION	Purpose - This paper aims to take a disaggregated approach to investigate the relationships between single entrepreneurial orientation (EO) dimensions and firm performance in the wine industry, with the generally established positive relationship between aggregated EO dimensions and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - Literature review, field studies, pilot tests, survey and structural equation modelling were used to build hypotheses and to test these hypotheses. Findings - Proactiveness was identified to be the predominant EO dimension that contributed most to winery market performance. Entrepreneurial opportunity perception, however, was found to positively mediate the risk taking-winery market performance relationship, while negatively mediating the competitive aggressiveness-winery market performance relationship. The authors found no innovativeness and autonomy winery market performance relationships. Research limitations/implications - First, as with much survey-based research, the study relied upon self-report measures and there was only a 12.4 per cent response rate. Second, we used Australian wine industry cross-sectional data in the research. Third, this research used conceptual measures of market performance including sales growth, market share growth, profitability and customer retention. Fourth, while the present research investigated the mediating effects of entrepreneurial opportunity perception to introduce new wine styles/services into national and/or international markets, additional research could explore the same questions in the context of some specific types of entrepreneurial opportunity perceptions. Originality/value - The research adds evidence to the ongoing debate about whether there are five or three EO dimensions by examining five EO dimensions and their individual relationships with firm market performance. This research meets Miller's (2011) call for research on the disaggregation of EO components, in particular, research contexts. This research contributes to the limited empirical research on entrepreneurial opportunity perception. This research also has important practical implications for practitioners and government.

However, this security should be kept through actions which will make possible to offer reliability, authenticity, integrity and availability of information, having its starting process through the implantation of information security policy. The main purpose of this study has been to define the best practices for implantation and review of information security policy. The research used documentary data and systematic review of literature to produce a Guide of best practices to the implantation of information security policy in the Federal Institutions of Higher Education - IFES. After its elaboration, the Guide was evaluated using the Model for Technology Acceptance, which suggests that both factors such as perceived easiness of use and perceive utility will influence in the intention of using either a new system or theoretical and methodological approach. Managers of information security believe that this document may be used in educational institutions as a way to add value in the process of implantation of information security policy.

Innovative Collaboration Ensures Industrial Success	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED BIOTECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						organization; innovation; collaboration; competitiveness; management		The paper considers collaboration forms that are able to influence positively economic potential and stability of an organization in the market, i.e. first and foremost, avoid negative impact of bigger companies on their business. It is a common knowledge currently that collaboration has always been a constructive characteristic of any organization. However, it becomes more and more ubiquitous, and practically expands into new forms and areas with new relations..o-competition as a current reserve at any enterprisemay grow into effective tool to support a specific industry or industrial territory in conducting innovative events. Innovative forms of collaboration between industrial organizations have become buzz-words so urgent in connection with their significance for the organizations trying really hard to improve competitiveness of their products and with that purpose using innovative energy and resource saving technologies, which in turn help them decrease dramatically their wastes. The study was made on the bases of a modelling technique as the leading method that is able to assist in examining the issue in the frames of a well-directed and managed process aimed at improving the integral aspects of the qualitymanagement systems of industrial enterprises. The authors propose their arguments and recommendations concerning viability of innovations in industry collaboration. The study of the research outcomes makes it possible for differentorganizations in various industriesto arrange better regulation of their innovative activity, as well as be a part of their industry corporate programs, and may be of certain interest to the state statistics bodies and departments responsible for strategic analysis and planning.

MANAGING PSYCHOPHYSICAL READINESS IN STUDENT ATHLETES AT LAW INSTITUTES OF HIGHER EDUCATION	RUSSIAN PSYCHOLOGICAL JOURNAL			Russian	Article						student athlete; psychophysical conditions; readiness; assessment; self-assessment; management; process of education and training; self-regulation; motivation; competitive activities	MENTAL-HEALTH; SENSATION SEEKING; SELF-ESTEEM	Introduction. Student athletes should be involved in assessment and self-assessment of psychophysical conditions. These psychophysical conditions reflect their physiological status, functional stability, and physical readiness that contribute to taking care of health, physical improvement, adhering to regulations of the institute of higher education, and changing the lifestyle in accordance with the objectives. The lack of scientific knowledge on self-assessment of psychophysical conditions is a problem for effective managing student athletes' sports training. Such a work helps to maintain student athletes' psychophysical readiness for competitive activities during their studies at a law institute of higher education. The novelty of the study lies in student athletes' training in managing their psychophysical conditions after their self-assessment. Materials and Methods. Student athletes had to master the information on the criteria of health. The study employed the assessing program which included a number of control exercises, functional trials, tests, tasks, and computational methods. These were the methods for assessing the functional state of the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, physical development, and anthropometric data. Taken together these parameters reflected their psychophysical condition. The efficiency of managing the process of education and training depended on the following: (a) control activities; (b) knowledge differentiation and specialization; (c) optimal solutions; (d) associations between substantive and procedural aspects of measured indicators. This promotes student athletes' motivation for conscious control and strategic self-regulation of psychophysical conditions. Results. During the experiment student athletes have changed the common knowledge of their body functioning. Study participants studied how to manage their psychophysical conditions on the basis of profound knowledge, individual experience of measuring and interpreting the results of control exercises, functional trials, and computational methods. Methods of self-control contribute to revealing the cause and effect relationship, prediction, revealing weak link, choosing of solutions, drafting individual training programs, predicting diseases and injuries, and the coach - athlete interaction at a high-level subject relationship. Discussion. Thus, the practical mastering the methods of self-assessment of conditions contributed to effective managing the process of education and training, and also competitive activities.

J	Mallon, MR				Mallon, Mark R.			Getting buy-in: financial stakeholders' commitment to strategic transformation	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic resources; Stakeholder analysis; Organizational change; Strategic transformation	CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM; LEGITIMACY; RENEWAL; ORGANIZATIONS; RESPONSIBILITY; ACQUISITIONS; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - Strategic transformations are likely necessary for all organizations at some point in their existence, but the role of external stakeholders in committing resources to support transformations has been largely overlooked. This paper aims to begin to fill this gap by developing a theoretical model detailing which factors increase the likelihood that financial stakeholders will commit resources to strategic transformation. Design/methodology/approach - Neo-institutional and stakeholder theories are applied to the strategic transformation phenomenon to develop six propositions regarding financial stakeholders' resource commitment to strategic transformation. Findings - Moral legitimacy, pragmatic legitimacy and unfamiliarity with the firm directly affect the likelihood that financial stakeholders will commit resources to strategic transformation. Cognitive legitimacy or familiarity amplifies the positive effect of pragmatic legitimacy on resource commitment, and pragmatic legitimacy lessens the negative effect of unfamiliarity with the firm on resource commitment.

J	Manzini, RB; Di Serio, LC				Manzini, Reinaldo Belickas; Di Serio, Luiz Carlos			Current thinking on cluster theory and its translation in economic geography and strategic and operations management Is a reconciliation possible?	COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW			English	Article						Strategic management; Operations management; Economic geography; Cluster theory	MANHATTAN HOTEL INDUSTRY; AUTHOR COCITATION; SCIENCE MAPS; SUPPLY CHAIN; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; AGGLOMERATION; REPRESENTATIONS; LOCALIZATION; PERSPECTIVES	Purpose - This paper offers an approach for outlining the main dimensions surrounding clusters in three areas of knowledge: economic geography, strategic management and operations management, the first being considered its natural field of knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - The work was developed using the citation analysis technique as applied to a database of 627 articles and 22,980 citations, taken from 15 important journals in the areas selected. Findings - The results proved that the theoretical and conceptual bases are unique to each of the areas studied and that they have few topics in common between them. They are complementary, however, and this facilitates their reconciliation. Research limitations/implications - The sample base, despite considering fairly influential periodicals in the areas of knowledge selected, can be considered to be a limitation. Originality/value - Common themes and different areas of knowledge surrounding the cluster concept were identified; despite being considered "common", a more detailed examination of their content reveals very different, but certainly complementary emphases, which makes it possible to reconcile the areas of knowledge.

J	Markiz, N; Jrade, A				Markiz, Nizar; Jrade, Ahmad			AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO OPTIMIZE COST AND SCHEDULE OF HEAVY EARTHMOVING OPERATIONS FOR EARTH- AND ROCK-FILLED DAM PROJECTS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decision-support; heavy equipment; operation analysis; cost estimation; linear scheduling	MODEL	Success of major embankment dam construction projects is measured by the enormity of optimizing costs and schedules of selected heavy equipment based on their operational analyses. In this paper, the main objective is geared towards developing a knowledge-based decision support system for optimizing costs of heavy earthmoving operations and corresponding linear schedules at early design stages. Also, the proposed system is capable of generating an automated linear schedule based on stochastic scheduling techniques. Thus, a meta-heuristic simulated approach utilizing a metropolis algorithm is implemented to assist in generating optimized line-of balances. The successful implementation of the proposed system will provide the user with optimum fleet of equipment for performing earthwork operations and linear scheduling for strategic planning purposes. Towards the end, an actual dam construction project is utilized to numerically validate the proposed system and quantify its degree of accuracy. Results presented in this study are anticipated to be of major significance to owners, designers, and construction managers specialized in embankment dams heavy earthmoving operations and would contribute to the database of fleet management systems by incorporating a novel system that integrates heavy equipment economical operational analyses with its corresponding line of balance.

The relational analysis has been limited to the case of the syndicate issuances that took place between 2002 and 2015 and the process whereby lead manager banks choose their partners to underwrite the issue. The main contribution of this paper is the identification of social tie patterns between market participants and their structural equivalence in the market. Furthermore, it reveals how status operates in the market, conferring advantages on those actors with optimum positioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Metz, P				Metz, Philipp			Distances, multinational organisational learning, and firm performance: a new perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						communication distance; content distance; cultural distance; current state of research; firm performance; geographic distance; knowledge; liabilities of foreignness; multinational enterprise; multinationality; organisational learning; psychic distance; strategic distance	ENTRY MODE CHOICE; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; PSYCHIC DISTANCE; INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION; CULTURAL DISTANCE; EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; FOREIGN-MARKETS; FLOWS; SUBSIDIARY	In the international business literature, the impact of organisational learning on firm performance in the multinational context is broadly discussed. However, oversimplifications and inconsistencies in theories and empirical analyses to explain the phenomenon hinder overall understanding of a supposed beneficial influence. The purpose of this paper is to discuss when multinational organisational learning generates positive implications for firm performance, in contrast to an observable taken-for-granted positive impact inherent in current research. Drawing on distance dimensions' influence, I revisit the assumptions of the effect of traditional geographic, cultural, and psychic distances on the positive impact of multinational organisational learning on firm performance and offer revised assumptions of the effect of newly identified, contemporary strategic, communication, and content distances. I thus address the importance of the strategic roles of organisational units, their connectivity, and perceptions of various knowledge contents. The implications for further research and practice are also discussed.

J	Mimbi, L; Kyobe, M				Mimbi, Lucas; Kyobe, Michael			PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF THE ROLE OF IT IN RESOLVING GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES IN A TRANSITION STATE: THE CASE OF TANZANIA	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						Governance; Tanzania; transition countries; information technology; alignment; cluster analysis; gestalt; socialism	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; E-GOVERNMENT; ACCOUNTABILITY; NETWORK; SOCIALISM; DEMOCRACY; AFRICA; SITES; MEDIA; MODES	International bodies and donors demand that countries demonstrate how they use IT to ensure effective governance. However, measuring the role of IT in governance remains problematic, particularly in transition economies characterised by poor IT capabilities. This paper measured public perceptions of the role of IT in addressing governance challenges in transition Tanzania. The paper identifies (i) usage of IT for governance and democratic purposes, (ii) governance processes and (iii) external pressures as key interplaying factors influencing effective governance. Adopting the Gestalts (configurational) approach, we argue that IT contributes to effective governance when it is coherent with (ii) and (iii). One hundred and sixty six members of the public were surveyed and cluster analysis was used to determine the degree of coherence. None of the three clusters of (i), (ii) and (iii) that emerged revealed a strong coherent relationship, indicating that IT was not playing a major role in addressing governance challenges in transition Tanzania.

J	Mohamad, AA; Ramayah, T; Lo, MC				Mohamad, Abang Azlan; Ramayah, T.; Lo, May Chiun			The novel concepts and practices of firm innovativeness: the mediating and moderating impacts	JOURNAL FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						knowledge management; innovative culture; firm innovativeness; information technology capability	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; ACQUISITION; MARKET; ORIENTATION; BUSINESS; ENTREPRENEURIAL; ANTECEDENTS	The objective of this study is to propose a conceptual model that blends the dimensions of knowledge management, information technology capability, innovative culture and firm innovativeness into a single framework for practitioners and academicians. In conceptualising the model, this study reviewed a range of existing literature. The findings identified: 1) four processes of knowledge management that represent the construct; 2) information technology capability as a variable that mediates the relationship between knowledge management and firm innovativeness; 3) innovative culture as a variable that moderates the link between knowledge management and information technology capability. The resulting conceptualisation is meant for evaluating the potential strategic model for firms to implement information technology capability and innovative culture. It is posited that the proposed conceptual model, when implemented, would give practitioners a better understanding of factors that enhance firm innovativeness.

High prices of land and the lack of strategic locations for housing has influenced developers to opt for stratified development. The challenge, most of the time, pertains to the maintenance of common areas, which requires substantial funds and professionalism, as well as skills in developing social and human relationships, despite the continual increase in the costs of management. Using doctrinal analysis of primary and secondary data, as well as comparative analysis with strata regulations in Australia, the study concludes that cash waqf can play a role as a potential vehicle to raise funds to maintain and manage common properties in strata schemes. The concept of waqf, where a certain category of properties is released from the ownership of man permanently while its benefits are dedicated to be used for the betterment of the public (ummah), is now regarded as a catalyst for the third sector economy. While religious reward may motivate Muslim owners or tenants to contribute to the waqf fund, other benefits offered such as financial security, sustainability, accountability and transparency would invite contribution and build trust from both, Muslims and non-Muslims. With adequate awareness, initiatives, and effective marketing of waqf products, the waqf concept would be able to provide a sustainable source of funds to cater to short term and long term maintenance plans for strata schemes.

J	Mohammed, R; Sharipudin, MN				Mohammed, Rosli; Sharipudin, Mohd. Nor			An Integrated Model to Measure Organization-Public Relationship (O-PR) and Reputation Practises in Malaysian Universities	JURNAL KOMUNIKASI-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Public relations; organization-public relationship; image; identity; reputation	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; RELATIONSHIP SCALE; IDENTITY; LOYALTY	Public relations are seen as an important part of an organization in helping to bridge the gap with its public so that rapport can be established. Previous researches show that the practises of trust, commitment, community involvement, openness, and customer satisfaction are attributes of Organization Public Relationship (O-PR) practises. However, literature seems to suggest that much research work is needed to develop a model, valid and reliable measurement for this practise. The main goal of this research is to test and compare the model, using confirmatory factor analysis. Questionnaires were distributed to 404 Malaysian university students. Confirmatory factor analysis was done to test whether specific evaluative dimensions relationships based on a theoretical framework that reflects organization-public relationships. The research findings show significant relationships between O-PR practises and organizational reputation. We hope to predict the best O-PR practises, the study elicited that trust; involvement, commitment and satisfaction were shown to have the strongest contributions in O-PR as compared to previous research. The findings of this research will help Public Relations practitioners to measure strategic relationship management and develope the best O-PR practisepractises. The need for improvement in this area requires serious attention, especially to the practises of commitment and customer satisfaction. Conclusions as to the impact of PR as the relationship management of organizations are offered as well as suggestions for future areas of research.	[Mohammed, Rosli; Sharipudin, Mohd.

J	Morelli, J; Perry, C				Morelli, Joseph; Perry, Chad			A manager/researcher can learn about professional practices in their workplace by using case research	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING			English	Article						Marketing strategy; Case studies; Management development; Management education; Customer orientation; Funerals		Purpose - The research involved a funeral home manager who used case research within another funeral home to learn more about how to manage his own workplace. This research aims to investigate for the first time how funeral homes can strategically manage the marketing of their services to customers during emotional times in their lives. Design/methodology/approach - The two methodologies of convergent interviewing and case research in a funeral home workplace are described in detail. Findings - The case research revealed what strategic marketing management principles have to be emphasized in the unique context of funeral homes, and the related need to develop a hybrid strategy. The project demonstrated that a case research project can align a formal research project with the professional development of managers. Practical implications - The paper provided the first author with a valuable learning experience of management in his industry, and provides other funeral home managers with a detailed guide to doing their strategic marketing management. Originality/value - The authors' contributions are the first example of case research used for workplace learning in a blend of formal academic research and workplace learning. It is also the first academically rigorous coverage of strategic marketing management workplace practices in the unique context of funeral homes; they were uncovered in interviews across a range of staff levels in a funeral home.

J	Nai, P; Luo, YQ; Yang, G				Nai, Peng; Luo, Yuqing; Yang, Guang			The establishment of carbon trading market in People's Republic of China A legislation and policy perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; Cabon legislation; Carbon market; Institutional development; Low-carbon economy	ENERGY; INSTRUMENTS; STRATEGIES; TRANSPORT; SECURITY; IMPACT; MODEL	Purpose - This study aims to propose a set of institutional frameworks, as well as practical polices and steps, with a view to facilitating the establishment of a unified carbon trading market in China. Design/methodology/approach - Based on existing empirical studies and reviews of the socioeconomic contexts, this study followed a qualitative approach consisting of secondary data collection and analysis, semi-structured interviews to collect primary data and comparative analysis. Findings - The establishment of a national carbon trading market in China is a systemic and complex process which requires coordination among various concerned government agencies and supporting mechanisms. Currently, the development of a unified national carbon market has been impeded by the lack of coordination among local pilot programs, and there is no specific law passed by the People's Congress or by its Standing Committee to regulate the emerging carbon trading market. It is of vital importance for China, in terms of both practical and strategic aspects, to take a gradualist approach in establishing laws and institutions to guide and support the development of its emerging carbon market. Research limitations/implications - This present study forms a part of a regional research project aiming to identify sound policy approaches for the establishment of a carbon trading market in China. Due to scope reasons, it focuses only on policy analysis and recommendations. Originality/value - China's emerging national carbon trading market has attracted much research attention. However, little has been done from the perspectives of legislations and policies.

Satyanarayana			ACTIVITY BASED COSTING AND PROFITABILITY OF IT COMPANIES - A CASE STUDY	JIMS8M-THE JOURNAL OF INDIAN MANAGEMENT & STRATEGY			English	Article						Activity Based Costing; Profitability; Performance	CHARGEBACK; MANAGEMENT	Modernization and expansion of business from one physical nature to another is highly influenced by cost ascertainment methods and the costing system is information system that requires a specific type of information such as direct labour hours and units produced. Cost information is necessary for decision making as managers rely upon the cost for effective operational and strategic decisions. Particularly, for IT companies it is very essential that the ascertainment and management of cost to combat with global competition, hence, Activity Based Costing (ABC) has become a tool in the hands of IT companies to surmount the problems with regard to cost management. The main objective of the paper is to throw the light on the ABC system in IT companies and impact of ABC on profitability vis-a-vis the traditional cost system.

It is moving from a strong long term relationship to an instable short term association. This change is primarily observed among highly skilled knowledge workers of the information technology industry as they seek the best organizational environment that will suit their needs. In the present operating business environment where organizational growth is an outcome of innovative and technological progressions, human capital has emerged as one of the most valued assets of the organization. Skilled human capital can be a source of competitive advantage to companies and be a significant antecedent to its success. The challenge for the information technology industry is therefore to design a work environment that not only attracts but retains such talented human capital. Hence, it is imperative for the companies to explore the attributes that such skilled talent expect and operationalise them to effective employer branding strategies. This study is an attempt to explore the important attributes that IT specialists aspire in an organization of interest which will be beneficial design employer branding strategies.

The study assessed the socio-economic factors affecting the trend of WEEE generation and handling in South Eastern Nigeria. The research concept identified key strategic aspects relative to socio-economic assessment of WEEE management. It used investigative approach through questionnaire administration. Twenty local government areas were purposively selected from five mutually exclusive strata. Data from 201 respondents were analysed using multiple linear regression and descriptive statistics. Results revealed that monetary provisions and public participation does not have significant relationship with WEEE generation and collection. The study revealed that the factors determined as affecting the trend of WEEE generation and collection cut across cheaper pricing of WEEE, availability of WEEE, quality/superiority of E.o.L EEE to newer ones, durability of device, low income consumers and the accessibility of end-users to WEEE.

Adapting transport modes to supply chains classified by the uncertainty supply chain model: A case study at Manaus Industrial Pole	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Uncertainty Supply Chain Model; Manaus Industrial Pole; Transport	MANAGEMENT	This paper discusses transport modes supporting Uncertainty Supply Chain Model (USCM) in the case of Manaus Industrial Pole (PIM), an industrial cluster in the Brazilian Amazon that hosts six hundred factories with diverse logistics and supply chain managerial strategies. USCM (Lee, 2002; Fisher, 1997) develops a dot matrix classification of the supply chains considering several attributes (e.g., agility, cost, security, responsiveness) and argues that emergent economies industrial clusters, in the effort to keep attractiveness for technological frontier firms, need to adapt supply chain strategies according to USCM attributes. The paper takes a further step, discussing which transport modes are suitable to each supply chain classified at the USCM in PIM's case. The research's methods covered the use of PIM's statistical official database (secondary data), interviews with the main logistical services providers of PIM and phone survey with a sample of firms (primary data). Findings confirm the theoretical argument that different supply chains will demand different transport modes running at the same time in the same industrial cluster (Oliveira, 2009). In the case of PIM, this implies investments on port and airport infrastructure and a strategic focus on air transport mode, due to (1) short life cycle of products, (2) distance from suppliers, (3) quick response to demand and (4) the fact that even PIM's standard products use, in average, forty per cent of air transport at inbound logistics.

J	Park, KB; Park, MJ				Park, Kyoo Bae; Park, Min Jae			Does the interactive quality of premium asset management service promote customers' referral intentions? The moderating effect of customer's asset size	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING			English	Article						Consumer behaviour; Measurement; Marketing communications; Customer surveys; Assets management	SATISFACTION; LOYALTY; COMMITMENT; BEHAVIOR; FUTURE; DETERMINANTS; EQUITY; MODEL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the asset size regarding how the level of a bank's premium asset management service interaction quality influences the referral intention using performance expectation and customer satisfaction as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs data collected from an anonymous survey on 185 customers who visited the PB centers. The study employs confirmatory factor analysis methods following a path analysis and structural equation modeling for testing research hypotheses with stepwise moderating effect test. Findings - The results indicate that superiority in interaction quality of premium asset management services has a positive influence on customer satisfaction and performance expectations, and these quality factors also show a positive influence on the intent to maintain relationships and even referral intentions. The results also show that customers with larger asset sizes only have mediocre intentions to refer bank services to people around them. Practical implications - Marketing positions, which remain faithful to the asset management obligation to fulfill a stable profit rate through constant interactive processes based on a trusting relationship between the customer and dedicated staff member that forms over time, can be a basis for service quality that can secure mid-to-long-term competition superiority in financial firms that offer asset management services. Originality/value - This study focuses on whether interaction factors that form the quality of services for customized premium asset management through the bank's dedicated staff member have a positive influence on customer satisfaction and referral intentions. Based on this analysis, the authors presented strategic implications on conditions that financial firms must focus on in order to secure competitiveness.

J	Paz-Aparicio, C; Ricart, JE; Bonache, J				Paz-Aparicio, Carmen; Ricart, Joan E.; Bonache, Jaime			Understanding the decision to offshore human resource activities: a coevolutionary perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Outsourcing; Human resources; Offshoring; Drivers; Administrative activities; Coevolutionary model	ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN; GOVERNANCE MODES; SERVICES; HR; MANAGEMENT; LOCATION; FIRMS; WORK; PERFORMANCE; TALENT	Purpose - Offshoring has been studied widely in the literature on strategic management and international business. However, apart from its consideration as an administrative activity, scant attention has been paid to the offshoring of the human resource (HR) function. Research in this regard has instead focussed on outsourcing (Reichel and Lazarova, 2013). The purpose of this paper is to achieve a better understanding of companies' decisions to offshore HR activities. It adapts the outsourcing model of Baron and Kreps (1999) by including the HR offshoring phenomenon and a dynamic perspective. Design/methodology/approach - While the analysis is mostly conceptual, the authors ground the author's arguments in offshoring data from the Offshoring Research Network, to explore whether the drivers for offshoring HR differ from the drivers for offshoring other administrative activities. The idiosyncrasy of the HR function is supported by the authors' exploratory analysis and also by the descriptive case of a multinational and its experience with offshoring. Findings - A coevolutionary model is proposed for understanding the behaviour of companies offshoring their HR activities. This study contends that companies should address their decision to offshore HR activities from a dynamic perspective, being aware of three processes that are in constant change: the evolution of the HR function, the evolution of service providers, and the evolution of offshoring decisions. Originality/value - This study seeks to make a threefold contribution to the international business, strategy, and HR management disciplines.

J	Pisapia, J; Townsend, T; Razzaq, J				Pisapia, John; Townsend, Tony; Razzaq, Jamila			Strategic change in the academy: controlling and/or enabling strategies	JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic change; vertical and horizontal leadership; controlling and enabling strategies; social networks; university leadership	UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES; ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; LEADERSHIP RESEARCH; PERSPECTIVE; SENSEMAKING; FAIL	This study describes the strategic change efforts of a university in the United Kingdom which changed its form and resource deployments to focus on the production of interdisciplinary research. A problem-oriented case study method was used to chronicle and analyse the leadership strategies and tactics employed and their consequences. We found that the reliance on a vertical leadership (controlling) strategy led to external legitimization but not internal legitimacy. We also found instances these strategies created unintended consequences which inhibited the strategic change initiative. In particular, horizontal leadership (enabling) strategies that spoke to the academic heartland were muted. We concluded that in universities undertaking major strategic change efforts controlling influence actions may be necessary but they are insufficient to levers of strategic change. The study is particularly important because it contributes to an understanding of strategic change in universities at a time when most such efforts fail to meet their objectives and there is a limited empirical literature to draw upon.

J	Puolokainen, T				Puolokainen, Tarmo			Reforming fire and rescue services: a comparative study of Estonia and Georgia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance indicators; Public sector reform; Fire services; Performance (public administration)	PUBLIC MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the systems of fire and rescue services (FRS) in Estonia and Georgia with respect to recent centralization reforms, especially with performance measurement and management in mind, and analyse their prospects for successful implementations. Design/methodology/approach - A desk study, covering all the main publicly available strategic plans of both countries relevant to FRS was conducted by the author. In addition, a meeting with the Georgian officials from the Emergency Management Agency was held in May 2016 and follow-up inquiries to specify certain aspects were made in the following two months. Findings - This study demonstrates that Estonia is using performance indicators widely to set the target levels and manage the fire and rescue system, whereas Georgia is still under the process of introducing performance indicators. Therefore, since the systems of both countries are under centralized management in contrast to the typical European system, it would be suitable to learn from the reforms of each country to further understand the best practices. Research limitations/implications - Since Georgia was in the process of reform in 2016, it does not have many performance indicators or impact evaluations of the reform readily available, which makes the possibilities of comparison limited. Practical implications - The last reform of the FRS in Estonia and Georgia was similar: the centralization of services to increase the potential of cooperation and standardize the level of service provision. Estonia's FRS system is eager to implement the reforms based on a data-driven analysis, whereas Georgia, still in the process of reform, does not have many performance indicators. As a result, Georgia and other countries aiming to centralize their FRS system in the near future would have the perfect opportunity to learn from Estonia's reforms as well as predict and adapt to the possible bottlenecks of the reforms. For a wider audience, an analysis of the possible challenges of centralizing public agencies in transitional countries are of interest. Originality/value - The public service provision is not widely analysed in the context of transition countries. As the reforms are to some extent the result of the accession process of joining the EU, it is crucial to understand whether the reforms have the planned impact on public services. The current paper analysed the reforms and implementations of public management techniques in the FRS, based on two transitional countries: Estonia and Georgia. FRS has seen relatively few studies analysing and comparing the reforms of different countries.

J	Qu, YP				Qu, Yaping			A robust approach to the two-level humanitarian relief operation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						humanitarian relief operation; robust approach; two-level model; relief distribution; transportation plan	RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; EMERGENCY RESPONSE; LOGISTICS; OPTIMIZATION; LOCATION; MODEL	During the initial disaster response phase, an important issue in humanitarian relief logistics is to tackle the complexity of decision-making that covers the appropriate relief allocation and the associated transportation plan. We propose a two-level modelling methodology to alleviate that challenge, where the upper-level model focuses on the strategic relief distribution policy among the recipients whereas the lower-level model deals with the transportation routes, vehicle deployment and loading problems at the operational level based on the upper-level solution. Furthermore, in view of the demand uncertainty in impacted areas, a robust model is developed to guarantee the feasibility of relief distribution solutions. Also, a case study is conducted to illustrate the benefit of the presented robust framework, which is not only favourable in terms of the reliability and equity level relative to the deterministic one but also capable of offering advice on the vehicle arrangement.

J	Ran, C				Ran, Chang			Robust analysis of inventory management	JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Inventory; EOQ; Robust		The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is a simple starting point for modeling inventory and resupply. We will explore models and quantitative approaches for making a variety of strategic, tactical, and operational decisions related to inventory planning and control. In real life, the assumptions of our models often do not hold, and we have to estimate the values of model parameters. So, we should consider how robust our models are to failed assumptions or misspecified parameter values. We will cover both relatively fundamental EOQ models, as well as advanced models that build on this robust knowledge.

This study examines the effects of ERM and performance measurement systems (PMS) on organizational performance. In addition, this study also examines the effects of a linked ERM-PMS tool on organizational performance. The research method involved administering an online questionnaire survey to 196 public listed firms. The respondents were the head of risk management department of the firms. In the case of ERM and PMS effects on organizational performance, the result of simple linear regression supported the research hypotheses. However the results from the moderated multiple regression which was employed to test the joint effect of ERM and PMS on organizational performance did not support the research hypothesis. Based on the study results it is recommended that firms may practice ERM and PMS separately rather than linking them together, since their integration may complicate the PMS framework.

J	Renukappa, S; Alosaimi, H; Suresh, S				Renukappa, Suresh; Alosaimi, Hanouf; Suresh, Subashini			Key knowledge management strategies implemented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia construction industry: an empirical study	MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; knowledge management; tacit knowledge	CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; SYSTEMS; STATE	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) construction sector is an important industry and contributes approximately 20% of the gross domestic product (GDP). However, uncertainty, complexity, sustainability and Saudi Arabia National Policy Plan 2030 are among the most important features of the current construction business environment in the KSA. Therefore, for the KSA construction organisations, the creation of economic value by addressing the above issues now increasingly poses real profound strategic challenges. This paper focuses on key knowledge management (KM) strategies that the KSA construction organisations implemented en route to organisational competitiveness. The findings are in the main, based on semi-structured interviews with 46 professionals from 30 construction organisations. The data analysis revealed that, the key initiatives implemented broadly under the umbrella of KM are knowledge sharing initiatives, knowledge capturing initiatives and knowledge mapping initiatives. The scarcity of knowledge and expertise is, and will continue to be, a huge challenge for many construction organisations in the KSA.

J	Rezaie, S; Mirabedini, SJ; Abtahi, A				Rezaie, Salah; Mirabedini, Seyed Javad; Abtahi, Ataollah			Identifying key effective factors on the implementation process of business intelligence in the banking industry of Iran	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE STUDIES IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Banking industry; business intelligence; fuzzy Delphi technique; implementing business intelligence; key factors	SUCCESS; SYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; MATURITY; MODEL; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT	Though many organizations have turned to developing and using business intelligence systems, not all have been successful in implementing such systems. These systems have social-technical dimensions with many elements and are very complicated. Numerous studies have been carried out on implementation and employment of business intelligence, but in the past studies only specific aspects and dimensions have been addressed. The aim of this study is to identify key factors in the implementation process of business intelligence in the Iranian banking industry. The present research is objectively applied as a survey study in implementation strategy. Also it is a descriptive study in terms of the research plan and data collection where two documentary and field study methods have been used for collecting data. The statistical population of this study comprises experts and professionals in information technology who are active in implementing solutions for business intelligence in the banking industry of Iran. In this study, 16 people were chosen based on non-random judgment sampling combined with targeted and snowball sampling as a statistical sample and their viewpoints were extracted and refined using the Fuzzy Delphi Technique. First through studying past research records and reviewing literature of effective factors in implementing business intelligence process, 37 factors were identified. Then by implementing five rounds of the Fuzzy Delphi Technique, 39 factors were confirmed as significant among 37 factors affecting the business intelligence implementation process in past studies and 10 factors proposed by experts. Also, these 39 factors were classified in nine main groups including organizational, human, data quality, environmental, system ability, strategic, service quality, technical infrastructure, and managerial factors. Managers and executives of business intelligence projects in Iran's banking industry can achieve the given objectives and results by considering such significant factors in planning and taking measures related to effective implementation of business intelligence.

J	Rheaume, L; Gardoni, M				Rheaume, Louis; Gardoni, Mickael			Infocom business models innovation with the development of corporate universities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						infocom; business models; strategy; innovation management; corporate universities		Since the mid-90s, the infocom industry has gone into a period of sustained disruptive innovations which, combined with deregulation, led to a lot of turbulence and a sometimes difficult redefinition of business models. A Schumpeterian wave of innovation enhanced by competition leads to creation of wealth as an unprecedented investment boom occurs in the infocom sector sustained by overly optimistic and sometimes fraudulent forecasts of internet traffic. We provide a strategic framework by explaining which types of infocom business models are better adapted to cope with the challenges of the new developments related to the digital economy, in order to shape the corporate innovation strategy. We also analyse how the development of a corporate university must be linked to the development of such innovation strategy. The first section of the article deals with the wave of disruptive innovations in the communications industry over the last few years and pinpoints the ubiquity of IT in all aspects of the economy and society. The next section focuses on the search for profitable business models for infocom providers. The links between business model innovation and the development of corporate universities is analysed in the next section. It is followed by a discussion section.

J	Roy, S; Mohapatra, S				Roy, Subhadip; Mohapatra, Subhalaxmi			Female, married and endorsing: integrating celebrity marital status, role congruence and credibility	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						Female celebrity endorsers; marital life stage; role congruence; credibility; experimental design; India	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; MATCH-UP HYPOTHESIS; PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS; PRODUCT TYPE; ENDORSEMENTS; SPOKESPERSON; ATTITUDE; BRAND; TRUSTWORTHINESS; PERSPECTIVE	In this study, we investigate the effect of marital status and perceived role congruence (RCN) of a female celebrity endorser on consumer attitudes incorporating the role of credibility in the Indian context. The research hypotheses were tested using a series of experimental designs. The main study had a 4 (Celebrity: Unmarried/Just Married/Married but Endorsing/Married and Comeback) x 2 (Product: Role Congruent/Role Incongruent) full factorial design. Non-student samples were used in this study. Major findings implied a significant effect of celebrity marital status, RCN and the interaction term on consumer attitudes. The three source credibility dimensions were found to have differential effects on consumer attitudes when they were included as moderators. This study finds evidence in support of diminishing effectiveness of female celebrities over time/marriage. In this study, we explored a new dimension of congruence (RCN) and found the same to influence consumer attitudes favourably towards the endorsed product.

J	Ruehl, CH; Ingenhoff, D				Ruehl, Christopher Hendrik; Ingenhoff, Diana			Communication management 2.0 The development of three socio-cognitive models for brand page usage	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social media; Public relations; Communication management; Communication strategy	SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES; COGNITIVE APPROACH; INTERNET USAGE; GENERATION Y; MEDIA; GRATIFICATIONS; CONSUMERS; ONLINE; FACEBOOK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how and why individuals use corporate pages on Facebook with the aim of developing a usage-specific inventory of incentive factors which describe brand page utilization for consumption, participation and production behavior. Design/methodology/approach - A combined perspective of uses-and-gratifications (U&G) and social cognitive theory (SCT) was applied to develop three models of brand page behavior. Based on a literature review, an online survey (N = 215) was conducted. Exploratory factor analyses identified motivational factors based on SCT incentive dimensions, which were cross-validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Findings - Results indicate that consumption behavior can best be explained by activity, self-reactive-novel and monetary incentives. Status incentives, practical-novel and self-reactive-idealistic incentives drive participation. Production behavior is best explained by social, self-reactive and status incentives. Practical implications - The models' strategic implications for integrated communication management are discussed. Originality/value - The results suggest interconnections of incentive dimensions unique to brand page usage, which have not yet been explored in any research.

It helps managers to create new opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to measure strategic thinking and its affecting factors at Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences. Design/methodology/approach - This is a descriptive-analytic as well as a cross-sectional study which was conducted in 2016. Its statistical community included 300 managers and personnel of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences. The sample size was equal to statistical community. Data were collected using a standard questionnaire. Data were then entered into SPSS20 and were analyzed using statistical tests such as Freedman, Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis. Findings - Overall, strategic thinking was evaluated "good" and "somewhat good" among managers (5.0 +/- 72.28) and personnel (6.0 +/- 25.48), respectively. Moreover, among the elements of strategic thinking, conceptual thinking obtained the highest score among both managers (6.0 +/- 06.32) and personnel (5.0 +/- 53.52), which was evaluated in a "good" level. There was a significant difference between managers' and personnel's strategic thinking score (p = 0.001). Different education groups of managers and personnel were different in terms of strategic thinking (p < 0.05), but strategic thinking score of managers and personnel were not significant based on the work experience and type of employment. Originality/value - Although both managers and personnel received a good score in terms of strategic thinking, improving the level of strategic thinking especially for future trends and opportunities can lead to enhanced strategic thinking among managers and personnel of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences.

An empirical assessment of administration and planning activity and their impact on the realization of sustainability-related initiatives and programs in higher education	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Strategic planning; Sustainability plans; AASHE STARS; Archival study; Climate action plans	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CAMPUS; UNIVERSITY; SYSTEMS; REDUCTION	Purpose - Administrators in higher-education settings routinely create planning documents that help steer the organization in mission-centric ways. In the area of sustainability planning, strategic plans, sustainability plans and climate action plans are the most common methods used. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if specific forms of planning predict sustainability outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - This question was evaluated via an empirical archival study of the AASHE STARS database in relation to planning, administration and governance credits and criteria to determine if specific forms of planning were predictive of sustainability implementation outcomes in the categories of Education and Research, Operations, Diversity and Affordability, Human Resources, Investment, Public Engagement and Innovation. Findings - Findings support the notion that climate action plans were most predictive of achieving sustainability outcomes, and strategic plans were best able to predict educational outcomes. Practical implications - These findings have important implications for the design and execution of sustainability planning processes in higher-education institutions. Originality/value - The academic literature contains relatively few empirical studies that demonstrate the capacity of planning on the realization of sustainability outcomes.

J	Sungatullina, LB; Neizvestnaya, DV				Sungatullina, Liliya Bagramovna; Neizvestnaya, Diana Valerievna			PERSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF PERSONNEL COMPENSATION LEVEL	AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH			English	Article						compensation; analysis; stochastic analysis; correlation; regression; management decisions; ANCOVA-model		The paper substantiates the need for a perspective assessment of personnel compensation in accordance with the strategic goals of doing business since the information set of an analytical system is the basis for decision-making. The scientific and practical aspects of the compensation modeling for employees in the oil industry have been studied: the goal has been set, and the tasks for the perspective assessment of the compensation level have been determined. The possibility of applying the regression model for revealing the dependence of the level of compensation to corporate personnel on quantitative and qualitative factors is estimated. The following indicators were identified for their inclusion in the regression model: the number of employees, length of service, and the index of labor distribution. The factors that have the strongest impact on the compensation to employees are highlighted. Qualitative indicators have been introduced in order to take into account qualitative variables that have an impact on the amount of personnel compensation in the future: possession of a higher vocational education and knowledge of foreign (English) language. A linear multiple regression equation is derived taking into account the specified qualitative factors. As a result, it was concluded that the most significant factor in the growth of the compensation to personnel of an oil company developing oil deposits not only within the Russian Federation but also abroad is command of English. Consequently, this factor serves as a basis for introducing incentive types of compensation for personnel in oil industry.

J	Thakur, N; Chaudhuri, M; Patel, GN				Thakur, Nidhi; Chaudhuri, Manosi; Patel, G. N.			Analysing the pattern of learning organisation dimensions in public and private banks in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						learning organisation; banking industry; public banks; private banks; ANOVA; India	DEVELOPING-COUNTRY; CONTEXT; PERFORMANCE; CAPABILITY; DLOQ	The idea that 'organisations which do not learn will cease to exist' has led scholars to investigate the presence of learning dimensions in various industries. This paper attempts to provide an empirical study on the presence of learning dimensions in public and private banks in India. The respondents for the study comprise different managerial levels and age groups with different tenures of service. The study highlights that public and private banks in India differ significantly from each other on the basis of the learning dimensions present in them. The managerial level of the respondent does not affect the perception of employees regarding the bank as a learning organisation. The analysis highlighted that 'connection with external environment' and 'strategic leadership' are considered as the most important dimensions in public and private banks in India. Thus, it implies that the need to keep pace with the changing global trends, customer preferences and technological advancements in the Indian banking sector is viewed as the most important parameter to become a learning organisation.

J	Tostes, M; Motta, C; Villavicencio, A				Tostes, Marta; Motta, Claudia; Villavicencio, Alfredo			The Plan of Action of the Agriculture and Irrigation Sector against Climate Change: An Opportunity to Articulate Efforts	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Agriculture; irrigation; climate change; articulation; mitigation; adaptation; disasters risk management		The participation of the Peruvian greenhouse gasses emissions in the agriculture sector in the total emissions grew from 13% in 2005 to 15% in 2010 and 2012 (MINAM, 2016). However, do the global increase in Peruvian GHG emissions and the raising participation of the agriculture and livestock sector from 2005 to 2012 result from a lack of action around climate change? There are more than 25 strategies, plans and programs that exhibit actions about mitigation, adaptation and disasters risk management on the agriculture and irrigation sector. This investigation aims to demonstrate that these policies were made with a soft integration among them. For these matters, a density, weight and intermediation analysis through Gephi's software, which constructs nets based on the proposed measures on all those documents for adaptation, mitigation and disasters risk management, will be made. Preliminary results show that the most articulated document for adaptation is the National Strategy against Climate Change, for mitigation the iNDC, the coffee's and oil palm's NAMAs and the Plan of Action for Adaptation and Mitigation against Climate Change, for disasters risk management the Budget Program 068, and in general the Ministry of Agriculture's Multiannual Sectorial Strategic Plan.

It is an indispensable strategic management model since it offers controlling materials, information and money according to customer satisfaction. The concept of sustainable supply chain has emerged with increasing public awareness on exhaustion of the natural resources. According to this phenomenon, companies maintain their existence with ongoing supply chain operations under economic, environmental and social dimensions. In this study, a supplier selection problem in a healthcare company is analyzed with utilizing Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach under sustainable supply chain management concept in order to measure suppliers' sustainability performance& By the help of this multi criteria decision-making method, the most efficient performance criterion is selected among the criteria in order to improve sustainable supply chain performance.

J	Ulbrich, F; Borman, M				Ulbrich, Frank; Borman, Mark			Extended dependency network diagrams: adding a strategic dimension	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SOURCING			English	Article						Dependence; Collaboration; Strategic management; Resource dependence theory; Strategic alliance	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; RESOURCE DEPENDENCE; CONTROL MECHANISMS; PARTNER SELECTION; BUSINESS; ALLIANCES; DESIGN; SYSTEMS; INTEGRATION	Purpose - Organizations increasingly form or join collaborations to gain access to resources paramount for achieving a sustained competitive advantage. This paper aims to propose an extension to the established dependency network diagram (DND) technique to better facilitate analysis, design and, ultimately, strategic management of such collaborations. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the resource dependence theory, the constructs of power and secondary dependency are operationalized and integrated into the original DND technique. New rules and an updated algorithm for how to construct extended DNDs are provided. Findings - The value of the proposed extension of the DND technique is illustrated by analysis of an application hosting collaboration case study from the Australian financial service industry. Research limitations/implications - This study provides preliminary evidence for strategically managing resource collaborations. Future research could further test empirically the usefulness of the proposed extension of the DND technique and how much it contributes to better understanding resource collaborations. Practical implications - The proposed extension of the DND technique enables managers to perform a broader analysis of dependencies among participants in a collaboration, helping them to more accurately comprehend the relationships between the entities in their collaborative environment and, thus, being in a better position of strategically managing resource dependencies. Originality/value - The proposed extension of the DND technique makes a central contribution to the extant literature by adding a strategic dimension to a visualization technique used to represent collaborative environments.

This article aims to understand the learning outcomes in international volunteer placements. It was possible to show, by means of a transversal qualitative study, the learning reported by Brazilian international volunteers. We found 119 distinct learning events in a sample of 25 volunteers, and personal development was the learning area with the highest number of incidents. We also found incidents related to the following learning outcomes: decision making and problem solving, cultural sensitivity, communication, strategic perspective, self-knowledge, managerial skills and domain specific knowledge. Results characterize international volunteering as a rich means of learning and identifies the main areas of learning.

J	Barbosa, JLV; Sempe, BK; Mota, B; Dini, LI				Victoria Barbosa, Jorge Luis; Sempe, Bruno Kucera; Mota, Bruno; Dini, Leandro Infantini			An Anesthesia Alert System Based on Dynamic Profiles Inferred through the Medical History of Patients	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Anesthesia Information Management System; Trails; Profiles; Alert Systems	INTELLIGENT MODEL; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE	Anesthesia Information Management Systems (AIMSs) have existed for many decades. However, how to turn patient records into strategic information to improve the anesthesia process is still a research challenge. We did not find systems that use data from previous procedures for issuing alerts. This data can prevent errors during procedures and aid on medical staff evaluation. We propose SaneWatch, an alert system guided by the medical history of patients. SaneWatch uses configurable rules to continuously review the patient's history and automatically generate an anesthesia profile. This dynamic profile allows the emission of strategic alerts during the anesthesia procedures. We have implemented and integrated the system in an AIMS that has been used the past four years by more than 40 anesthesiologists in several hospitals in the city of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil. We applied the integrated system in a practical experiment. Twenty doctors tried it and filled out a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). An overall strong agreement of 96% was obtained in perceived usefulness acceptance assessment. In addition, 86% of users indicated that the system was easy to use. The results were encouraging and demonstrate the potential for implementing SaneWatch in anesthesia procedures. However, 12% of doctors disagreed with regard to ease of use, showing that the system needs improvements in interface related aspects.

J	Wang, B				Wang, Bin			Evaluation of Sports Visualization Based on Wearable Devices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING			English	Article						wearable; school sports; sports simulation; visualization management; Markov process	TECHNOLOGIES	In order to visualize the physical education classroom in school, we create a visualized movement management system, which records the student's exercise data efficiently and stores data in the database that enables virtual reality client to call. Each individual's exercise data are gathered as the source material to study the law of group movement, playing a strategic role in managing physical education. Through the combination of wearable devices, virtual reality and network technology, the student movement data (time, space, rate, etc.) are collected in real time to drive the role model in virtual scenes, which visualizes the movement data. Moreover, the Markov chain based algorithm is used to predict the movement state. The test results show that this method can quantize the student movement data. Therefore, the application of this system in PE classes can help teacher to observe the students' real-time movement amount and state, so as to improve the teaching quality.

Energy-efficient HVAC system through chillers' capacity sizing for a library building	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY			English	Article						Energy modeling; eQuest; energy saving; chiller sizing; field measurement	COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS; SIMULATION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; WINTER; CHINA	Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings consume the largest amount of energy. Recent surge in energy cost necessitates constant re-evaluation of HVAC system for most of the buildings. The objective of this study is to present the strategic approach on energy saving analysis of the HVAC system and chiller sizing optimization for a library building. Energy modeling code (eQUEST) for buildings simulation has been applied to verify and predict the long-term energy consumption of HVAC systems. To improve the accuracy of simulation results, the actual performance curves of the chillers and pumps were the inputs of curve fitting data from on-site field measurements data. Energy consumption data acquisition from the building energy management system (BEMS) for one year has been conducted comprehensively to calibrate energy modeling and to quantify energy saving results. The results revealed good agreement between energy modeling and BEMS data with the error of less than 10%. Besides, energy savings through the chillers' sizing based on cooling load profile could be achieved satisfactorily by utilizing energy modeling by using the actual chiller performance curve. The energy saving for HVAC system can be obtained satisfactorily at the saving of 110,362 kWh per year. It is expected that the study will stimulate a more robust investigation of energy-efficient and cost-effective HVAC system specific for library buildings.	[Wang, F. J.; Shiau, C. H.; Hung, Y.

How do these two factors affect the competition and pricing strategy of food firms that separate GM food and conventional food conforming to consumer's right to know? We explore the issue of pricing strategies between two firms producing horizontally and vertically differentiated foods in the context of asymmetric information and scientific uncertainty. The theoretical results show that there are two separating perfect Bayesian equilibria in which the prices of the conventional food and GM food are strategic complements and the profits of two types of firms are both increasing in the price of GM food. The numerical example shows that a decrease of the expected potential net damage as the most sensitive parameter leads to an increase of the profits of the two firms. Additionally, an increase in product differentiation helps to increase the two firms' profits. Finally, the decrease in risk aversion as the second sensitive parameter helps to increase both products' prices and quantities and both firms' profits. This paper contributes by combining food safety regulation with market mechanisms and competition.

J	Zhytchenko, G; Kovalenko, M; Shvorob, G				Zhytchenko, Ganna; Kovalenko, Mykola; Shvorob, Ganna			MANAGEMENT OF FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL OF THE ENTERPRISE	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			Ukrainian	Article						intellectual capital; human capital; knowledge economy		The subject of this research is the external and internal relations of the enterprise regarding the formation of its own intellectual capital. Methodological approaches to capital formation are revealed: principles of accounting for development trends of the modern world and national economies, macro and microeconomic conditions for the formation and use, methods of operational and strategic management of capital, economic and social instruments for accounting, regulation, and stimulation of its development. Some ways of formation and use of an intellectual capital of the enterprise in the modern business environment are proposed. The article reveals the essence and formulates the concept of the enterprise's intellectual capital, its structure. The main approaches to the formation of a corporate organizational and economic mechanism for managing intellectual capital are proposed. The results of research on the conditions for the formation and use of intellectual capital at a number of enterprises in the Kherson region of Ukraine are presented. Based on the results of the study of issues of formation and development of the intellectual capital of enterprises, the following conclusions are made: intellectual capital of the enterprise is considered by the authors as a system of relations between different economic entities regarding rational sustainable reproduction, output of products, goods, services on the basis of progressive development of engineering, technology, production organization, increase in corporate incomes and living standards of employees on the basis of personified economic interests of participants in production. These are the materialized and non-materialized resources of the enterprise, formed on the realized knowledge, experience, skills, abilities of employees, relations with consumers, suppliers and other market partners, on the relations between employees and departments of the enterprise, which together determine its possibilities for obtaining value added and rising income. In the structure of the enterprise intellectual capital, human, social, structural, and market capital are distinguished. On the understanding of the essence of these groups of capital - productive, generating human, uniting, mobilizing social, providing with information structural and linking, stimulating market capital, it is proposed to form a corporate system for managing the intellectual capital of an enterprise. To achieve the tasks of managing intellectual capital, it is suggested to adhere to the principles of strategic partnership of enterprise owners, management, and hired professionals, workers; partnership relations between all participants in the production process; formation and application of criteria for assessing the individual contribution of employees, formal and informal groups in the final results of the enterprise; organization of an all-encompassing network of forms of mass participation of workers in the identification and implementation of reserves to improve the efficiency of production and the quality of products, goods, and services.

J	Abbas, K				Abbas, Khaled			DEVELOPING OPTIMUM KPI SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT ORGANISATIONS	SIGMA JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND NATURAL SCIENCES-SIGMA MUHENDISLIK VE FEN BILIMLERI DERGISI			English	Article						KPI; public transport; sustainability		In order for public transport organizations to move forward and to quantify effects occurring as a result of changes in strategic objectives, policies, decisions or lines of action, it is imperative to assess their performance. Key performance indicators (KPI) provide quick, adequate and reliable barometers assisting decision makers in identifying success stories, lessons learnt as well as problems and potentials, selecting courses of action, monitoring improvements, and evaluating results. Accordingly, choosing the right mix of KPIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to an organization. Various frameworks can be employed to categorise and select required set of KPI. In this paper 3 frameworks are utilised to ensure an optimum categorization, selection and development of a KPI system for a public transport organisation. These are balanced scorecard framework, sustainability framework and input output analysis. The research employs the 4 perspectives of balanced scorecard (BSC) namely financial, customer, internal and learn and growth. Furthermore each of these and in a similar fashion is divided into another 4 sub perspectives of balanced scorecard ensuring coverage of 16 dimensions including public transport sustainability dimensions. Finally, input output analysis is conducted where four types of resources are required as input to a public transport organisation namely financial, staff, time, and physical (fleet & assets). The management of a public transport organisation is responsible to utilize these resources through operation of fleet, hence providing passenger transport services & financial outputs. Produced service outputs once used become consumed service outputs. These include: carried passengers, passenger. kilomtres & passenger hours. As a result of utilization of produced service, financial output is generated as operational revenue obtained through fare collection.

On the Chatham Islands, these colonists achieved settlement permanency after the thirteenth century AD to become the indigenous Moriori in the absence of all Polynesian domesticates. We test the thesis that edible and storable seeds of introduced New Zealand karaka or (in Moriori) kopi trees (Corynocarpus laevigatus J.R. Forst. & G. Forst.) replaced tropical crops in the Moriori economy. Archaeologicalmidden sites associated with kopi are dated by radiocarbon (C-14) from Rekohu (Chatham Island), the largest island of the Chathams group. We examine new accelerator mass spectrometry ages for individual kopi seeds and twigs <10 years old and review extant standard ages. A local marine C-14 value is determined to improve confidence in mollusc dates. Our results include the earliest reliable C-14 age on a kopi seed from Rekohu (cal yr AD 1450-1620, 95% probability). Strategic tree plantings in sheltered locations and initial if not ongoing forest management are indicated. Archaeological evidence of comparable, later, leeward and windward island Corynocarpus use suggests that kopi production supported the permanent Moriori settlement of Rekohu. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Higashino, A				Higashino, Atsuko			A partnership postponed? Japan-EU cooperation in conflict resolution in East Asia	ASIA EUROPE JOURNAL			English	Article								This paper explores reasons for the (un)willingness of the European Union (EU) to cooperate with its external partners such as Japan in promoting regional integration and conflict resolution outside of Europe. One of the key arguments made in the paper is that the EU has demonstrated a strong preference for independently promoting regional integration and conflict management. Moreover, it has evidenced little inclination to cooperate with partner countries in attempting to address regional problems. Furthermore, until now, the EU's concept of a 'strategic partnership' may not have functioned sufficiently well to enable it to play any constructive role in conjunction with its partners in East Asia. Such tendencies have been strengthened by the problems currently affecting the Japan-EU relationship such as the EU's preference of not 'taking sides' with respect to complex regional problems, Japan's ongoing 'expectation deficit' towards the EU and the EU's ever-worsening perception of Japan.

J	Liu, FG; Yang, YY				Liu, Fagui; Yang, Yingyi			A Two-Tier Replication Framework and Its Consensus Protocol for Big Data Storage of Internet of Things	JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Internet of Things; Big data storage; Fault tolerance; Replication; Consistency	DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS; IOT	Big data generated from the Internet of Things (IoT) brings enormous challenges to data management. In this paper, we focus on fault tolerance and replication, especially consistency in IoT big data storage. A two-tier replication framework is presented for replication across multiple data centers in the context of big data storage. A consensus protocol with batching and logical pipelining optimizations, which is called L-Paxos, is introduced to achieve high throughput and to provide good scalability. An analytical model is developed to provide a good approximation to optimal batch sizes when L-Paxos reaches maximum throughput. Finally, we evaluate L-Paxos's performance and validate the analytical model experimentally.

J	Marcel, IH; Ioan, BS; Alina, BF				Marcel, Ionescu Heroiu; Ioan, Burduja Sebastian; Alina, Burlacu Florentina			IMPROVED PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA FOR ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE			English	Article						prioritization; infrastructure projects; PNDL; public investment management; project selection criteria; coordination of investments; EU structural funds		This report's main aim is to propose a methodology for assessing state-budget-funded projects based on a rigorous selection model, including clear and effective prioritization criteria. This report first argues that project prioritization and selection should be optimized against four dimensions: absorption, impact, legitimacy, and capacity. Second, it provides a diagnostic of the National Program for Local Development (PNDL), managed by the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA), as the most significant source of state-budget funding for local infrastructure projects. The PNDL's current design and implementation leaves room for improvement, as reflected by the lack of strategic direction in allocating funds and the continued rise in the number of projects that get started without a feasible timeline for their completion. Further, this report makes recommendations for improvement of project evaluation and selection procedures for local infrastructure development projects, with a special focus on prioritization criteria and viable funding sources for each type of investment. The practical purpose is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed investments, maximizing impact in the context of inherently limited available financial resources. A complementary focus is on opportunities for harmonizing and better coordinating investments across various sources of funding, in the context of nearly EUR 40 billion available to Romania from the EU for the 2014-2020 programming period.

An assessment index of 49 indicators is developed measuring these functions based on the literature review and a survey of expert panel. Analytical hierarchy process method was applied to determine the importance weight of the indicators. Two cities in China, Beijing and Shanghai, were selected to empirically test the assessment index and compared with the tourism hub functions. The results indicate that Beijing has stronger functions on gathering and distributing tourists, as well as management and services, while Shanghai exceeded on transferring function due to its tourist distribution center.

Given the rarity of these tumors, the information regarding prognostic factors involving recurrent cases is limited and conflicting. Materials and Methods: The records of all patients with vulvar cancer who underwent primary surgery from January 2007 to December 2014 were analyzed. Information regarding each patient's demography, clinical findings, treatment given, complications, and follow-up details was collected for this retrospective study. Results: Seventy-eight patients were included in this analysis. Seventeen patients (21.7%) had recurrent disease after a mean interval of 15 months. Nodal status, tumor classification, depth of invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, and resection margin were statistically significant prognostic factors for disease-free and overall survivors according to a univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, only tumor size, nodal positivity, and margin status appeared to be statistically significant. Conclusions: Clinicopathologic patterns could help stratify patients for adjuvant radiotherapy of the vulva. Intensified vulvoscopic follow-up is needed to prevent multiple local recurrences, especially those with high-risk prognostic factors. This study suggests the value of giving local vulvar radiation to patients in high-risk groups to prevent local recurrences. Customized and strategic management of recurrences is needed according to the pattern of recurrence.

Applying Corporate Climate Principles to Dental School Operations	JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article						dental education; dental school; dental school management; organizational culture; planning techniques; organizational models; organizational climate; strategic planning	ORGANIZATIONAL-CLIMATE; PERFORMANCE	Decades of research have shown that organizational climate has the potential to form the basis of workplace operations and impact an organization's performance. Culture is related to climate but is not the same. "Culture" is the broader term, defining how things are done in an organization, while "climate" is a component of culture that describes how people perceive their environment. Climate can be changed but requires substantial effort over time by management and the workforce. Interest has recently grown in culture and climate in dental education due to the humanistic culture accreditation standard. The aim of this study was to use corporate climate principles to examine how organizational culture and, subsequently, workplace operations can be improved through specific strategic efforts in a U.S. dental school. The school's parent institution initiated a climate survey that the dental school used with qualitative culture data to drive strategic planning and change in the school. Administration of the same survey to faculty and staff members three times over a six-year period showed significant changes to the school's climate occurred as a new strategic plan was implemented that focused on reforming areas of weakness. Concentrated efforts in key areas in the strategic plan resulted in measurable improvements in climate perception. The study discovered that culture was an area previously overlooked but explicitly linked to the success of the organization.

FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES IMPLEMENTATION WITHIN THE COMPANY: AN ESG RATINGS ANALYSIS AND ITS APPLICABILITY TO COMPANIES' ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL			English	Article						ESG ratings; environmental scores; social policies; environmental policies; firm performance	INFORMATION; CITIZENS	In order to move towards a more environmentally oriented economy, society needs to be aware and able to recognize environmental friendly practices. Firms are increasingly relying on environmental scores ratings to make strategic decisions. In this context, understanding how day-to-day company's decisions affect environment scores is crucial. This paper examines the impact of social policies on the environmental scores of companies. Using data on for 3895 firms from the ASSET4 database between 2006 and 2010, we report on how employment quality, health and safety, training and development and diversity policies affect firms' environmental scores. An ANOVA test, followed by a regression analysis, was ran to test differences between the major markets. Also, the interaction between the selected variables and environmental scores, was tested in order to investigate the individual effects of social policies and location on environmental performance. Results show that environmental scores increase with the presence of social policies, and that the location of the company is a differentiating factor. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for future environmental promotion within companies.

Specifically, the objective of this paper is to analyse the mediating and moderating effects of innovation and the protection of information assets in the relationship between business intelligence (BI) and international competitiveness of SMEs based on export intensity. To do this, we rely on the approach of Baron and Kenny (1986). The Moderator Mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51(6), 1173-1182 and Ping (1995). A parsimonious estimating techinque for interaction and quadratic latent variables. The Journal of Marketing Research, 32, 336-347 to identify respectively, the mediating and moderating roles of innovation and protection of information assets, and we focus on a sample of 180 North African companies. The results of this paper show that the relationship between BI and international competitiveness is both mediated by innovation and moderated by the protection of information assets. The originality of this research lies in the design of a CI model that integrates BI, mediation of innovation, moderation of the protection of information assets and the international competitiveness.

J	Tucker, DA; Hendy, J; Barlow, J				Tucker, Danielle A.; Hendy, Jane; Barlow, James			The dynamic nature of social accounts: An examination of how interpretive processes impact on account effectiveness	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Organizational change; Social account; Time; Communication; Interpretation	STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY; SENSEMAKING; EXPLANATIONS; STORIES; OFFERS; POWER	Social accounts are a powerful tool in influencing the behavior of organizational members during major change. Examination of their effectiveness has largely focused on the design of accounts to influence behavioral and affective responses. However, when used in real life practice, more individualized, interpretive and agentic responses to social accounts have been found to influence effectiveness. Using an example of large-scale organizational change, moving from one hospital facility to another, we explore the dynamic and contextual interpretation of social accounts over time. Our findings expand social account theory by examining how potentially successful change communications are derailed by the relevance of the account in relation to an individual's past, by the individuals' ability to express agency and by temporality; how over time, lived experience can alter the perceived truthfulness of an account and alter its potency.

Strategic management is known as an efficient solution for institutes in dynamic environments. Strategic marketing management determines and plans marketing strategies and implements them with a clear understanding of the organization's mission, the assessment of environmental factors, checking the organization's situation, and exploring opportunities in the market. Strategic management process is a guidance to execute organization activities besides organization type or size. This process can be used by organizations in terms of marketing. The basic steps of strategic marketing management are similar for all types of organizations like organizations related to manufacturing industries, while importance of each step is different to others depending on effective environmental factors on the institute. In the present paper, these steps and some examples of their application are explained.

J	Bolton, G; Ockenfels, A; Werner, P				Bolton, Gary; Ockenfels, Axel; Werner, Peter			Leveraging social relationships and transparency in the insider game	JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMIC SCIENCE ASSOCIATION-JESA			English	Article						Transparency; Rent extraction; Social ties; Reciprocity		We exhibit a mechanism by which two parties leverage their social relationship to ratchet up the rents they collect from a third party residual claimant. Specifically, in a laboratory environment, we study a novel three-person insider game in which 'insiders' decide how to distribute profits among themselves and an 'outsider' who is the residual claimant. We find that the distribution of payments is largely determined by an informal quid pro quo among the two decision makers at the expense of the outsider. We then manipulate pay transparency and the competition to keep interaction partners, thereby improving the strategic position of one insider. Pay transparency increases the profit share that goes to rent seekers. In addition, rent extraction from the third party persists when competition for interaction partners is introduced. As a result, we find that payments both affect and reflect the influence of social relationships.

Lunatics at the fringe: Teaching expository documentaries with Beer Wars	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						Management education; Documentary; Industry evolution; Entrepreneurship		As students grow up in the digital age, management professors seek new material which both educates and engages. Recent studies record the benefits of using feature films in the classroom, increasing student attention and learning. But expository documentaries from filmmakers like Michael Moore present the unique challenge of teaching with a biased informant. This article examines the use of one such documentary, Beer Wars (Baron, 2009), as a substitute for written cases on industry evolution. We argue that, through documentary techniques, Beer Wars effectively details the growth and maturity of U.S. beer-market niches. We've shown the documentary to undergraduate and graduate Strategic Management classes, with positive feedback. Rather than hindering learning, the bias inherent in the documentary offer opportunities for students to develop critical thinking skills. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Strategic Policies for Increasing the Competitive Powers of Indonesian Horticultural Products in ASEAN Markets	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Policies; Competitive advantage; Horticulture; Indonesia		The objectives of this study were to: (1) analyse the competitiveness of Indonesian fruits featured in ASEAN markets, (2) understand the marketing distribution of featured fruits from Indonesia, (3) analyse the policies and the strategies of the Indonesian government in relation to horticultural products, and (4) suggest a bill aimed at increasing the competitive power of Indonesian featured fruits. The Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and the Specialized Trade Index (STI) show that there are five Indonesian featured fruits that possess good competitiveness, namely avocadoes, mangoes, mangosteens, watermelons and melons. The Intra-Industry Trade (IIT) index shows that bananas, watermelons, melons and durians are good for imperfect market competition due to the existence of greater returns to scale. The IIT also shows that avocadoes, mangoes and mangosteens are more suitable forperfect market competition, where the abundance of a product constitutes a very important factor, and trading is mainly determined by comparative superiority. Further, this research found three patterns of marketing distribution for these featured fruits: (1) farmer -consumer, (2) farmer - trader - outlet - consumer, and (3) farmer - distributor - outlet - consumer. This study also found that continuous supply of Indonesian featured fruits very uncertain, and suggestions have been made to increase R & D. Finally, it recommended that the Indonesian government develop integrated and efficient production centres for the distribution of these featured fruits. Such production centres might then reinforce institutionalisation at the level of farmers.

The Importance of Managing Strategic IT Project Contracts Using a Business Process Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contracts; Information Technology; Project Management; Strategic Alignment	FORMAL CONTRACTS; TRUST; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; DISTRUST	Much has been written about managing information technology (IT) project contracts and their ultimate effect on fulfilling an organization's strategy. The integration of managing IT projects, contracts and firm strategy, however, continues to capture the attention of scholars and practitioners. This paper discusses the integration of these issues while providing a necessary process framework of how project contracts become strategic to firms when repeated transactions, increased risk identification, enhanced trust over time, and improved exploration and learning are present. IT project management has been and continues to be a growth profession, and the use of IT project contracts to outsource work has been increasing in importance as well. The authors have found that IT project management is collaborative when work is administered through information technology contracts that respond to organizational objectives. Because of the variance in how IT contracts are managed, they develop a strategic process model and discuss two lessons learned to better facilitate managing IT contracts. The proposed model and lessons learned provide insight so that the achievement of organizational strategy can be improved through simultaneous IT project and goal alignment.

In this paper we extend the applicability of one such method - integer programming - to exploratory blockmodeling. Specifically, leveraging the work of Brusco and Steinley (2009), we use the isomorphic properties of the image matrix to develop a minimal, representative set of image matrices with P positions. Not only does this drastically reduce the total number of image matrices the researcher must fit, but it also simultaneously solves all blockmodels with less than P positions. We demonstrate and prove the latter using the structural equivalence of positions, and we subsequently develop a minimal set of image matrices for four or fewer positions. These developments are illustrated using Fine's well-known Sharpstone Auto Little League Team network (1987), and we use the results to discover new structural features. In our account, competing, globally optimal alternatives are embraced as equally compelling, coexisting representations of a complex culture. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Eaves, J; Williams, J; Power, GJ				Eaves, James; Williams, Jeffrey; Power, Gabriel J.			Do traders strategically time their pledges during real-world Walrasian auctions?	JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE			English	Article						Auction; Strategic bidding; Market microstructure; Tatonnement; Tokyo Grain Exchange	TATONNEMENT MECHANISM; MULTIUNIT AUCTIONS; PRICE DISCOVERY; MARKET GAMES; EQUILIBRIUM; INFORMATION; EFFICIENCY; EXCHANGE; PRIVATE; REVELATION	Experimental research suggests the Walrasian tatonnement auction encourages traders to under-reveal preferences, even encouraging initial pledges contrary to true desires, because pledges are not binding. We analyze the timing and characteristics of individual pledges and trades during 9604 auctions for redbeans conducted by the Tokyo Grain Exchange. We find no evidence of contrarian pledging and little evidence of under-revelation - as many traders over-reveal as under-reveal. Most traders pledge seriously from the beginning. Despite the considerable heterogeneity in pledging behavior across individual traders, these differences appear to have no relationship with traders' profits, nor do they appear to affect the achievement of equilibrium.

This vehicle, i.e. fees-for-seed swap, specifies that a strategic partner (seeder) provides a critical amount of capital in exchange for participation in the funds revenue. Our results indicate that the new swap not only solves the serious problem of widespread financing constraints for new and early-stage funds (ESFs) managers, but can be highly beneficial to both the manager and the seeder if structured properly.

The study first validates the curvilinear relationships of external search breadth and depth with innovation performance, as first established by Laursen and Salter (2006) [Laursen, K and A Salter (2006). Open for innovation: The role of openness in explaining innovation performance among U.K. manufacturing firms. Strategic Management Journal, 27(2), 131-150] controlling for a number of country-specific factors including culture and the institutional environment. The study then draws on Hofstede's cultural framework to theoretically and empirically investigate the influence of a country's culture on the effectiveness of firms' search strategies. The results show that cultural factors not only directly impact innovation performance, but also interact with search breadth and depth, thereby moderating the success of inbound open innovation strategies.

Efficiency Analysis of Airports in India in a Changing Environment A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS AND POLICY			English	Article							OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; BENCHMARKING	The strategic importance of airports in the economic development of any country is well recognised. However, the literature is deficient as far as the operational efficiency of Indian airports is concerned. This paper attempts to examine the efficiency of 46 Indian airports between 2012 and 2014 using the BCC model and the Malmquist productivity index methods of DEA technique. The results indicate that international airports and those lying in the southern region of India are performing efficiently. It is also found that the airports managed through joint ventures are more efficient than others.

J	Sommer, C; Krebs, I				Sommer, Christoph; Krebs, Isabelle			Market orientation in news media: How learning about and responding to readers and competitors impact success	JOURNAL OF APPLIED JOURNALISM & MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						media management; marketing; strategic orientation; market orientation; news media; success	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; PRODUCT ADVANTAGE; 2-SIDED MARKETS; NEWSPAPER; STRATEGIES; INNOVATION; AUDIENCE	Because of technological developments, it has become easier for media outlets and their actors to collect data, which facilitates the gaining of knowledge regarding customers and competitors. We apply market orientation theory and investigate through standardized interviews with high-level media representatives whether market-oriented news outlets are more successful in terms of circulation change. The results of this exploratory study show that dailies, which emphasize reader orientation and a swift reaction to competitors' initiatives, are rewarded with success. For weeklies, the opposite is true. Rating means of researching the readership and responsiveness to the competition low is associated with an increase in circulation. These findings call for different media management strategies depending on the type of news outlet.

The role of gold bullion in South African balanced portfolios	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						Gold Bullion; Asset Allocation; Efficient Frontier; Mean-Variance Optimisation; Non-Parametric Optimisation; Tactical Asset Allocation; Economic Regimes		The objective of this paper is to establish the structural features that gold bullion brings to South African global-balanced portfolios and to establish a strategic weight for this potential asset. We consider two methodological approaches based on a 40-year history to establish a strategic allocation weight for gold bullion. Our first approach considers the strategic role of gold bullion in South African global-balanced portfolios by using a mean-variance efficient frontier framework. We also implement a second assessment methodology that utilises a non-parametric optimisation procedure. We find from our efficient frontier analysis that the primary strategic role of gold bullion in a South African multi-asset portfolio is to add diversification and reduce portfolio risk (rather than enhance return). Whilst our mean-variance results differ slightly from our non-parametric results we ultimately find evidence in support of an allocation of 4% to gold bullion for South African balanced portfolios. This finding is consistent with findings in the international literature.

In our AMC, we undertook a collaborative approach to achieve better vertical and horizontal integration of our QI education efforts. This article provides a case example describing our organizational context, what was done, and with what effect and makes our example and lessons learned available to others. Methods: We developed a new educational QI program that was jointly planned and implemented by a group comprising major QI stakeholders. This project was intended to create horizontal organizational linkages between continuing professional development, clinicians, the hospital, and QI department and produce QI activities that aligned with the strategic objectives of senior management. Results: The group developed and implemented a curriculum based on Lean methodology and concepts from the Institute for Health Care Improvement Model for Improvement. Two cohorts (27 teams) completed the training and planned and implemented QI projects. All projects were aligned with organizational quality, safety, and patient experience goals. The majority of projects met their aim statements. Discussion: This case description provides an example of successful horizontal integration of an AMCs' QI functions to disseminate knowledge and implement meaningful QI aligned with strategic objectives (vertical integration).

Development of engineering ceramics 100% from lignite fly ash and steelmaking EAFC mixtures	JOURNAL OF CERAMIC PROCESSING RESEARCH			English	Article						Ceramics; Fly ash; EAFC; Sintering; diametral tensile strength; Thermal conductivity	SINTERED CERAMICS; WASTE; BRICKS; DUST	In the present work, the development of ceramics is examined by using two industrial solid by-products as 100% the raw material mixture, a challenge with technological, environmental (sustainable waste management and earth mineral resources conservation) and economic benefits (utilization of largely available industrial secondary resources). Specifically, fly ash derived from lignite-fed power station and electric arc furnace-carbon slag (EAFC) from steelmaking plant, were used as secondary resources. These powdery materials were mixed in various proportions (0-70% wt. EAFC content), cold compacted at 20 tn load using an automated hydraulic press to form a series of 5 cm diam. disc-shaped specimens, and then sintered at three different peak temperatures (1000, 1100 and 1140 degrees C) for 3 h. The microstructures produced were studied via SEM-EDS, and specimen physico-mechanical properties were evaluated. For a 50-50% wt. fly ash-EAFC mixture, the experimental data show that as the firing temperature is increased from 1000 degrees C up to 1140 degrees C, the produced specimens hopefully are not deformed during the sintering process. For that mixture, the diametral tensile strength (DTS) increases from approx. 1.5 MPa at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C up to 7.4 MPa at 1140 degrees C. The coefficient of thermal conductivity also remains practically constant up to 1100 degrees C, attaining its max. value at 1140 degrees C. At this peak temperature, max. DTS was recorded for the 100% fly ash specimens (11.6 MPa). Nevertheless, mixtures containing up to 60% wt. EAFC (at 1140 degrees C) seem to maintain satisfactory physico-mechanical properties.

Intermittent At-Home Suctioning of Esophageal Content for Prevention of Recurrent Aspiration Pneumonia in 4 Dogs with Megaesophagus	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Esophagostomy; Regurgitation	OWNER EXPERIENCES; SURVIVAL-TIME	BackgroundMegaesophagus carries a poor to guarded prognosis due to death from aspiration pneumonia. Options for medical management of regurgitation are limited to strategic oral or gastrostomy tube feeding. ObjectivesTo describe the use and efficacy of intermittent esophageal suctioning to prevent regurgitation and associated episodes of aspiration pneumonia in dogs with megaesophagus. AnimalsFour dogs with acquired idiopathic megaesophagus and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. MethodsRetrospective review of medical records of dogs with megaesophagus in which intermittent suctioning of esophageal content was employed for management of recurrent aspiration pneumonia. ResultsIntermittent suctioning of the esophagus was initiated in 4 dogs after failure of strict gastrostomy tube feeding failed to prevent regurgitation and repeated episodes of aspiration pneumonia. Suctioning was accomplished by esophagostomy tube in 3 dogs and per os in 1 dog. After initiation of esophageal suctioning, dogs survived for a median of 13.5 additional months (range, 10-30 months) during which time 2 dogs had no additional episodes of aspiration pneumonia and 2 dogs had infrequent episodes of pneumonia, but aspiration was suspected to be a contributing factor in their death. Complications included clogging of the esophagostomy tube, esophagostomy site infections, and esophagitis. Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceUse of intermittent esophageal suctioning in dogs with megaesophagus that continue to regurgitate despite gastrostomy tube feedings can reduce or abolish clinical episodes of aspiration pneumonia.

J	Mitra, N				Mitra, Nayan			Community engagement models in real estate-a case study of Tata Housing Development Company Limited	ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Community engagement model; Strategic partnership; CSR budgeting; Real estate; Tata Housing Development Company Limited (THDCL)		According to the Economic Survey of India, 2012-2013, the real estate sector contributed 5.9 % of the India's total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Financial Year (FY) 2011-2012, while remaining the second largest employment generator after agriculture in India. The urban population in India is projected to touch 600 million by 2030, from 377 million in 2011, thereby fuelling a housing shortage (at the current pace of housing growth) of around 26 million. However, the perception of Construction industry, like other sectors of the economy, is that of creating "human habitat in a manner generally focussed on profitability without consideration of its long-term impacts." Under such circumstances, Tata Housing Development Company Limited (THDCL), a closely held Public Limited Company under 99.86 % subsidiary of Tata Sons, is the first Indian real estate company to have reported the triple bottom-line Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines in its Sustainability Report FY 2013-2014. THDCL aims to volunteer its resources to the extent it can reasonably afford, to sustain the environment and to improve the quality of life of the people of the area in which it operates. This Situational Case Study, targeted towards management students and practitioners, and social and developmental workers in the areas of Corporate Governance, Strategic Management, Business Environment, Business Policy and Community Welfare, aims to identify the community engagement model of THDCL; analyse it in terms of its implementation and impact; and initiate discussion about the role of strategic partnerships under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in an emerging economy. This work may be used for developmental related workshops/training programmes for students and working professionals of innovation, CSR, sustainability, social and developmental sectors and shared, among others, in various Chambers of Commerce and Academic forums on the same.

J	Olsen, DS				Olsen, Dorothy Sutherland			Are There Learning Agents in Innovative Firms? A Study of the Potential Role of Human Resource Managers in Learning and Innovation	JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY			English	Article						Learning; Innovative firm; HRM; Knowledge activist	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; HRM	This article takes the link between learning and innovation as its starting point and explores how this relationship might be managed within the innovative firm. In order to gain a better overview of the kinds of activities, which might be involved in managing and promoting the kind of learning, which will result in innovation, some criteria have been developed. These criteria are based on a review of the key theoretical and conceptual studies on organisational learning, particularly where these studies relate organisational learning to innovation and change. Thereafter, a close analysis of empirical studies of the relationship between human resource management (HRM) activities and innovation has been carried out. The conclusion is that HRM is already contributing in various ways to learning within innovative firms, and these activities have been linked increased innovation. However, there was no evidence suggesting that HRM is making a strategic connection between learning and business strategy or if they are facilitating connections between pockets of creativity in the organisation, as we might expect from knowledge activists. A better understanding of how HRM works in practice as well as an overview of their aims and strategies would be necessary in order to understand if their activities are explicitly aimed at improving innovation. This article adds to our understanding of HRM activities relating to innovation and provides a systematic overview of how the various HRM activities are linked to theories of learning in innovative organisations.

Guadalupano Hospital: Looking for sustainable growth	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Sustainable growth; Institutional systems and processes; Human capital needs; Financial analysis; Emerging market; Emigration; Canvas business model		Guadalupano Hospital is a teaching case study geared toward understanding the factors shaping the sustainable growth of hospital administration and operations that focuses on the need for a professional management team and for the establishment of institutional processes that accompany growth. The case describes a situation in which the protagonist must redeploy resources to deal with strategic guidelines of the board of director and the shifting market demand. The case illustrates business conditions in a small, densely populated economy recovering from civil strife that is experiencing massive emigration to the US. This case has two fundamental objectives: illustrate the complex nature of hospital management where long-term sustainable growth goals must be reconciled with short-term interests of the shareholders and emphasize the importance of a long-term strategy and the need to adapt over time to the changing demands of the business environment.

J	Romanova, R				Romanova, Regina			Firm Performance: How to Define it, What Affects it and How to Deal with Measurement Challenges	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY-EKONOMICHESKAYA SOTSIOLOGIYA			Russian	Article						performance; effectiveness; resource-based view; strategy; performance measurement; network approach; ecological approach; institutional approach; strategic management	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; POPULATION ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENT; CHOICE	How do some firms achieve superior performance and others fail? Much research has been devoted to this question in management, economic theory, and sociology. Nevertheless, due to the absence of a universal approach for conceptualizing firm success and differences in methodological assumptions, numerous studies have produced divergent findings. This has led to continuous debates on the meaning of market success, performance indicators, and measurement techniques. First, this paper addresses conceptual problems with application of the term "effectiveness" and analyzes the potential and limitations of an alternative construct-"performance." In addition, we attempt to systematize current theoretical implications in the field of strategic management and sociological theories of organization. We focus on strategic management because performance-related questions are central in this academic discipline. Contrary to their intellectual ancestors in industrial economics, strategists pay closer attention to firm-level internal factors affecting firm performance. This paper examines two concepts central to strategic management: firms' strategies and resources. We analyze strategic choice theory and contingency theory first, then turn our focus to core notions for a resource-based view-a dominant framework in strategy research. This article also addresses a sociological approach to the interpretation of firms' high performance. A sociological understanding of the mechanisms behind performance variety concentrates on external factors (environmental effects). Firm survival and successful adaptation practices are studied in network, ecological, and institutional traditions in sociology. Finally, we discuss methodological challenges in performance research that require a combination of theoretical implications from both fields. In order to build an adequate theory about sources of performance variance, one should include micro-and macro-indicators and explore synergetic effects.

Attributes of migratory goat and sheep farming and impact of some improved management strategies en-route migration in adopted flocks of Western Himalayan region of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Characterization; Genetic improvement; Improved management; Migratory pastoralist		Migratory pastoralism is common in Himalayas, practiced by Gaddi tribe of Himachal Pradesh. Understanding migratory system is relevant as >90% of state sheep and around 70 % goat populations is reared under this system. The study was undertaken to analyse characteristics, trends, constraints and impact assessment of improved managemental strategies enroute migration. After generation of base data, for studying the impact of improved practices and breeding management, these flocks were monitored and strategic managemental and breeding inputs were provided to these flocks throughout the year for next 3 years. Majority of the farmers belonged to medium flocks (50%), followed by small flocks (40.2%) while very few were with larger size flock (9.8%). On an average, these farmers derived more than 60% of their income of migratory goat and sheep husbandry. Farmer's own flock was the primary source (68.4%) of breeding buck and they practice selection of male buck based on indigenous knowhow. Diseases, predators, environmental extreme, veterinary aid in high hills and marketing infrastructure were major constraints. The result of adopted flock over period of 4 year revealed that there was significant improvement in body weight, reproductive parameters and pre-weaning mortality. The study concluded that the migratory system is an integral part of hill farming and is sustainable since it is a very low input system which effectively counterbalances its constraints and makes it profitable. There is need to address concern of management during migration, develop effective extension messages and breeding plans.	[Sankhyan, Varun; Thakur, Y.

Since an appropriate evaluation of these innovations is rather complex, companies often choose fixed investment strategies that neglect effects of organizational learning through continuous innovating. Hence, we develop a dynamic optimization model that determines the optimal budget allocation to mature and fashionable IT innovations by considering organizational learning. Furthermore, we evaluate various investment strategies both from an ex ante and an ex post perspective. Thereby, we focus on a company's innovativeness and draw conclusions about the superiority of different investment strategies regarding expected NPV and its volatility.

J	Han, YJ				Han, Yingjun			Improved BIRCH Clustering Algorithm and Human Resource Management Efficiency: An Organizational Learning Perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						BIRCH clustering algorithm; data mining; strategic HRM; organizational learning	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS	With the popularity of large data network, data mining technology can be used in human resource management and provide strong decision support. In this paper, the author put forward the application of BIRCH clustering algorithm in HRM database, and analyze the associated reasoning methods. Based on the multiple regression analysis, the result shows that strategic human resource management effectiveness has significant positive correlation with organizational innovation (p<0.01). At the same time, the model M6 show that the nature of the enterprise has a significant negative impact on organizational learning, and the industry has positive impact on organizational learning. The conclusion shows that organizational learning plays a complete intermediary role between strategic human resource management and management innovation.

J	Robson, J; van der Heijden, H				Robson, Julie; van der Heijden, Hans			Senior management perceptions of aspirational groups: A study of the UK general insurance market	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategic groups; Aspirational groups; Reference groups; Insurance	STRATEGIC GROUPS; MOBILITY BARRIERS; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; CONVERGENCE; DECISIONS; RIVALRY; MODEL	This study examines the concept of aspirational groups: a reference group that a firm wishes to associate with. A desire to belong to an aspirational group may provide an important source of strategy formulation. Drawing from insights from consumer marketing on aspirational groups, the study explores the composition and structure of aspirational groups compared to strategic groups in a market setting. Using qualitative data from senior managers in the UK general insurance market, this study arrives at the following findings. First, aspirational groups do not necessarily share the same composition or structure as strategic groups. Second, selection of aspirational firms is driven by attribute association. Third, aspirations can be conflicting and reversed. Fourth, firms do not seek membership of the aspirational group but isolate key attributes they aspire to.

With the technological revolution, computerization made the information systems evolve in emergency departments, especially in developed countries, with improved performance in terms of care quality, productivity and patient satisfaction. This study analyses the situation of Benin in this field, through the case of the Academic Clinic of Emergency Department of the National University Teaching Hospital of Cotonou, the national reference hospital. Methods: The study is cross-sectional and evaluative. Collection techniques are literature review and structured interviews. The components rated are resources, indicators, data sources, data management and the use-dissemination of the information through a model adapted from Health Metrics Network framework. We used quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: The absence of a regulatory framework restricts the operation of the system in all components and accounts for the lack and inadequacy of the dedicated resources. Conclusion: Dedication of more resources for this system for crucial needs such as computerization requires sensitization and greater awareness of the administrative authorities about the fact that an effective health information management system is of prime importance in this type of facility.

We propose a MILP model that includes relevant business aspects and possibilities, some of which are only partially or not at all found in the literature. Specifically, we consider decisions on expansion, reduction and renewal of production capacity, and acquisition of storage capacity. In addition, we model aspects such as (a) maintenance costs and unit variable costs depending, respectively, on age and characteristics of facilities, (b) seasonality of the demand and (c) cash flow management, including taxes and, therefore, depreciation of assets. The model maximises the after-tax cash balance at the end of the planning horizon. We also present a computational experiment with 54 instances to show that the model can be solved for a wide range of sizes in a reasonable computing time using comercial software.

(2001), what enablers are present at the creation of organizational knowledge of the swine Granja DF Pork Company, from the perspectives of its managers and employees. The research is characterized as descriptive, qualitative, and the case study as the chosen method. There were nine representative interviewed subjects of strategic, managerial and operational company, selected by convenience sample, via semi-structured, and the use of participant observation technique. The results indicate the existence of four of the five enablers proposed by Von Krogh et al. (2001) in the context of DF Pork: 'to instill the vision of knowledge', 'managing conversations', 'creating the appropriate context' and 'globalize local knowledge', and detected the absence of enabling 'mobilize knowledge activists'. However, the existence of these enablers happens at the level of individuals the company researched through isolated knowledge conversion practices, not as conditions for the creation of knowledge at the organizational level. Such considerations may serve as a basis for structuring and implementation of knowledge translation practices at the organizational level in DF Pork.				professorfrederico@yahoo.com.br; eloisa.guimaraes@fpl.edu.br	Pereira, Frederico Cesar Mafra/AAB-8366-2020	Pereira, Frederico Cesar Mafra/0000-0002-1971-8069; Guimaraes, Eloisa Helena Rodrigues/0000-0001-7050-0105			Alencar Jurandyr Da Cruz, 1990, Acta Amazonica, V20, P145; ALVARENGA NETO R.

J	Kheyroddin, R; Razpour, M				Kheyroddin, Reza; Razpour, Mehdi			INFORMAL ECONOMY AND URBAN SPATIAL CHANGES IN THE BORDER TOWN BANEH. A CASE STUDY FROM THE IRANIAN-IRAQI BORDER	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ECONOMICS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES			English	Article						Informal economy; border regions; commercial tourism; urban and regional spatial changes; strategic analysis		Considering the various economic and political contexts in different parts of the world, economic relations and integration are performed with different intensity in regions such as the EU or the Middle East. One of the main reasons for the emerging of informal economy at the border regions in the Middle East is the strong barrier function of boundaries in Middle East countries. The Tourism consumption has extended recently in Baneh County, one of the western border regions of Iran neighboring with Iraq. The specific situation of informal economy, low price of smuggled goods, commercial tourism and massive flows of financial capital, all together have caused unpredictable changes in micro and macro levels of the Iran & Iraq border region and specially in Baneh County. The future growth of Baneh County is despite emerging positive spatial changes in Baneh city, doubtful. Unclear policies of local and national government regarding decision making, unclear management of the informal economy and currency instability create an uncertain future. Conventional methods of planning will not have necessary enough impact and effects in order to influence those issues in border regions. The paper is based on the examination of recent spatial changes and economic trends, which were done by descriptive and analytical methods in Baneh city. The research was documented through face to face and video interviews with local stakeholders, photography, field works and visits to the border region. As a result, some strategies were determined which steer recent trends. Further on threats towards a sustainable regional development had been described.

J	Kong, QJ				Kong, Qingjiang			The "state-led-economy" issue in the BIT negotiations and its policy implications for China	CHINA-EU LAW JOURNAL			English	Article						China-US bilateral investment treaty; Negotiation; State-owned enterprise; State-led economy		The state-led-economy provisions in the U.S. model BIT, which was released in April 2012, aims to impose strict regulations on the SOEs and exert great influence on state-led economy model. China and the U.S. are now in the midst of negotiating aBIT, and the U.S. government insists on negotiating on the basis of its 2012 model BIT. If China is to accept the 2012 U.S. model for the proposed BIT between the two nations, unprecedented international obligations will be placed in the field of international investment. In this context, in order to provide a reference for the BIT negotiation, the author will analyze, from the perspective of normative jurisprudence, which economic activities are included in the scope of state-led economy provisions, whether China should accept the clauses and the possible impact of accepting it. China's economy has indivisible relationship with State-owned enterprises (SOEs). At present, most of these SOEs have clustered in those sectors that play crucial roles in the national economy such as energy, telecommunication and finances. Despite several rounds of reform on the SOEs aiming at a separation of governmental functions from corporate management, and a modern market-oriented governance structure, Chinese SOEs remain monopolies or de facto monopolies with exclusive access to many important industries relevant to national economy and people's livelihood. Further, SOEs can enjoy a lot of privileges in their operation, some even have certain regulatory authority which is supposed to be exercised by the government. This kind of economic model is called State-led economy. The 2012 U.S. model for bilateral investment treaties (BIT) is characterized by the inclusion of the state-led economy provisions, which means that there are more restrictive regulations governing SOEs and their special treatment, and countervailing their competition implication in the host country and their home country. Apart from creating a fair and impartial environment for the investors, this international investment regime, represented by 2012 U.S. BIT model, is in some way, intended to alter the host country's economic governance regime. In accordance with the decision of the 5th round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, both parties are dedicated to proceeding the BIT negotiations (The 5th Round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue: broad consensus achieved and positive progress made, People's Daily, p 3, 2013). The U.S. government has insisted that they would base its 2012 model as a blueprint of BIT text negotiation. Seemingly to illustrate, the 6th round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue has reached a consensus that an earlier launch of negotiation on the negative list will be expected in 2015 (The 6th Round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue: broad consensus achieved and positive progress made, People's Daily, p 3, 2014; Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China, The 14th Round of the U.S.-China Investment Treaty Negotiation is Held in Washington, D.C., 2014). If China is to accept the new BIT model, it will bring China a bundle of increasing obligations under this system and an unprecedented impact on China's mode for economic development. As a contracting party, China will have to carry out a comprehensively economic reform to comply with the disciplines specified in the BIT. It is also understandable that the incorporation of the state-led economy provision in the China-U.S. BIT will in turn accelerate the domestic economic reforms. In this context, research on the issue of state-led economy in the BIT negotiation will be of significance to China's dealing with the core issue in the BIT, China's fulfillment of treaty obligations and its promotion of domestic economic reform via BIT negotiations. In order to provide a reference for the BIT negotiation, the author will identify from the perspective of normative jurisprudence, the economic activities that fall within the scope of state-led economy provisions, project the possible impact of state-led economy provisions and how China should handle negotiation surrounding the state-led economy issue.

The switching behaviors in all the dots used in this study are considered to be of the nucleation type from the angular dependence of the switching field. However, detailed analysis of the thermally activated magnetization switching reveals that there is a critical diameter (d(c)) of 400nm above which the switching process changes. For d < d(c), the switching behavior of the dot is well explained by the nucleation process based on the single-energy barrier model. On the other hand, the switching behavior for d >= d(c) obviously deviates from that for d < d(c) and can be plausibly explained by the multi-barrier model.

J	Luo, WH				Luo, Wenhong			The Inclusion of CIOs in Top Management Teams: A Longitudinal Study of the Strategic Role of IT	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Chief Information Officer; IS Leadership; IT Governance; Longitudinal Study; Top Management Teams	CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER; FIRM PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATIONS; ANTECEDENTS; CONSEQUENCES; TECHNOLOGY; DIFFERENCE; AUTHORITY; IMPACT	The inclusion of the CIO in the top management team (TMT) is one indicator of how top executives view the role of IT within their firms. This study draws upon the upper echelons theory to examine the organizational factors contributing to the CIO inclusion. A panel data set is used to empirically test the hypotheses. The results show that TMT age and firm diversification are found to be linked to the CIO inclusion. The study contributes to an understanding of the relationship between the CIO and TMT and provides a potential measure of IT importance within firms.

The procedure is driven by a focus, the main quantity we want to estimate well. It represents the statistical translation of a research hypothesis into parameters of interest. Given a collection of models, the procedure estimates for each model the mean squared error of the estimator of the focus. The model with the smallest such value is selected. We present focused model selection for (i) exponential random graph models, (ii) network autocorrelation models and (iii) network regression models to investigate existing relations in social networks. Worked -out examples illustrate the methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shih, TY; Liu, ZA				Shih, Tsui-Yii; Liu, Zhi-An			Wrong Gallery: A New Paradigm for Art Space	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Art Gallery; Cultural and Creative; Designer Toy Strategic Management; Wrong Gallery		This case gives a depiction of how the founder of Wrong Gallery, Ron, when facing the competition and operational mode of the traditional art gallery industry in Taiwan, capitalizes on the latest trend of emergent social media, and leads his team to break through the shackles or consumers' stereotypical impression. Ron has set up a brand-new age of art space with the brand thinking and innovative approaches, becoming a practical case in regard of the new-pattern art space. In an era where the total value of output from cultural and creative industries worldwide is rapidly increasing, this case's rich materials give readers a better understanding of the operation of an art gallery amongst the cultural and creative industries. This case allows readers to understand how an innovative enterprise's founder starts by analyzing industry situations, incorporates his/her personal strengths, and further determines the strategy application and implementation for the company's market position and business operation model.

J	Siengthai, S; Udomphol, A				Siengthai, Sununta; Udomphol, Aroonlod			The Impact of Human Resource Information System (HRIS) on Organizational Effectiveness: A Case Study of the Textile Industry in Thailand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						HRM Practices; Human Resource Information System (HRIS); Organizational Effectiveness; Questionnaire Survey; Survey Instrument; Textile Industry; Thailand	MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; BUSINESS	Human resource information system (HRIS) has potential benefits to improve organizational performance. The purpose of this exploratory study is thus to investigate the impact of HRIS on organizational effectiveness. The textile industry in Thailand is taken as a context of the study as it faces many challenges in this globalization era. One of the industry's dilemmas is about worker conditions and the scarcity of workforce. A questionnaire survey was conducted during December 2012-March 2013. About 354 questionnaires were mailed to the random sample drawn from the Textile Directory (2006). A total of 63 usable returned questionnaires were obtained. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the obtained data. The findings reveal that the sample respondents perceived that HRIS has a positive impact on organizational effectiveness with respect to human resource processes, time savings, cost savings, information effects, decision making and strategic impact of HR role.

J	Tschang, FT; Ertug, G				Tschang, F. Ted; Ertug, Gokhan			New Blood as an Elixir of Youth: Effects of Human Capital Tenure on the Explorative Capability of Aging Firms	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						exploration; exploitation; innovation; inertia; creative industries	PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FIRMS; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; ESTABLISHED FIRMS; TECHNOLOGICAL DISCONTINUITIES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; STRATEGIC CHANGE; TECHNICAL CHANGE; EMPIRICAL-TEST; DYNAMIC-MODEL; FILM INDUSTRY	The relationship between firm age and innovation has been an enduring topic of interest. We contribute to this research by studying how the effect of firm age on the quality of explorative and exploitative innovations is affected by the firm-specific and industry tenure of the talent resources ( employees) that the firm utilizes. We start with the baseline predictions that firm age is related to the development of better exploitative innovations and worse explorative innovations. However, the tenure of employees intervenes in these relationships, by way of bringing in new knowledge, mental models, and beliefs. We predict that longer firm-specific and industry tenure of employees enhances the positive effect of firm age on the quality of exploitative innovations, while amplifying the negative effect of firm age on the quality of explorative innovations. In addition, for both the baseline and the moderating effect, we also formulate a prediction comparing the quality of explorative innovations with those of exploitative innovations. We find support for the moderating effects of human capital tenure for the quality of explorative innovations, but not for the quality of exploitative innovations. We reason that the latter may be due to the need for some level of exploration even in exploitative innovations, at least in the setting we study-the video game industry. Our results suggest that the negative effects of firm age on the quality of explorative innovations can be mitigated by talent resources ( employees) the firm uses who have lower firm-specific and industrywide tenure.

CULTURAL DIMENSIONS IN GLOBAL HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: IMPLICATIONS FOR NIGERIA	INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION			English	Article						Transcultural; Cultural dimensions; Cultural globalization; Hofstede; Transferability; Visible culture; Dangote		As enterprise operations continue to be globalized through overseas expansions, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions as well as strategic relationships and partnerships transnational organizations need to give attention to issues of culture in human resource management practices as a panacea for prosperity. The global organization is competent if only it is able to bridge the gap between management and culture so that personal relationships with other peoples in the organization and society become in harmony. This is critical because cultural relativity and reality in organizations influence operations. The study was designed to explore possible relationships between cultural dimensions and global human resource management. The survey research design was employed and data generated through primary and secondary sources. The participants comprised of 385 respondents from a cross-section of the population in Nigeria. By Chi-Square test, it was found that culture has a significant positive relationship with global human resource management.	[Ugoani, John N.

J	Williams, SB				Williams, Savanna B.			Strategic Plan for Maximizing Shared Savings in Accountable Care Organizations	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								One of the major benefits to a provider beginning or joining an accountable care organization (ACO) is the potential for achieving shared savings from the Medicare Shared Savings Program. This essay provides a strategic plan for ACO participants to maximize their shared savings through a physician-led structure and the creation of a high-value referral network. Physician-led ACOs are generally more flexible than those affiliated with a hospital and can implement more effective cost-saving initiatives, focus more intently on lowering the cost of delivering primary care, and achieve higher shared saving rates. Combining the strategies presented in this essay allows ACOs, no matter their size, to maximize their shared savings and become a model for future ACOs.

Remote sensing has great potential in these areas, but its use is still limited. This study analyzed the impacts of grazing on biophysical properties of vegetation and suggested using biomass to quantify GI because of its stability and interpretability. In comparison to a single spectral index, such as the red edge index (REI), combining REI and a cellulose absorption ratio index calculated from hyperspectral data performs better for biomass estimation. Further, an auxiliary spectral index, called the grazing monitoring index (GMI), was developed based on differences in spectral reflectance in the infrared range. Experiments in a grazing area of the Inner Mongolia grassland indicated that GMI can identify GI, with three range intervals (GMI <0, 0-1, and >= 1) used to describe the biomass distribution. The results showed that combining GMI and biomass was more successful than existing approaches for identifying the grassland variability resulting from the spatial heterogeneity of grazing behavior. The thresholds of biomass for four GI levels (ungrazed, lightly grazed, moderately grazed, and heavily grazed) could be determined by the intersections of biomass distributions. In addition, the approach developed at the on-ground canopy scale was extended to remotely sensed Hyperion data. The results showed that the approach could successfully identify the grazing treatments of blocks in the experimental grazing area.

Frontline clinical staff in mental health often lack confidence in recognition, assessment and management of such 'medical' problems. Simulation provides one way for staff to practise these skills in a safe setting. We produced a multidisciplinary simulation course around recognition and assessment of medical problems in psychiatric settings. We describe an audit of strategic and design aspects of the recognition and assessment of medical problems in psychiatric settings course, using the Department of Health's 'Framework for Technology Enhanced Learning' as our audit standards. At the same time as highlighting areas where recognition and assessment of medical problems in psychiatric settings adheres to these identified principles, such as the strategic underpinning of the approach, and the means by which information is collected, reviewed and shared, it also helps us to identify areas where we can improve.

J	Borisov, DA				Borisov, Denis A.			"THE GREAT GAME 2.0" IN CENTRAL ASIA (THE BEGINNING: 1990-2000)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						Central Asia; geopolitics; foreign policy of regional states; Turkey; Iran; Saudi Arabia		The article deals with the development of the Central Asian sub-system of international relations in the first decade after the end of the bipolar confrontation. The growth of state interest to Central Asia of such countries as Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia is specially noted. This work studies the formation of the Central Asian direction of foreign policy among Islamic actors through the prism of geopolitical analysis. The focus of the work is on the identification of the idealistic and pragmatic determinants of the foreign policy of Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia during the implementation of the Central Asian vector of foreign policy. It may be noted that in the last decade of the 20th century geopolitical motives occupied a dominant position in the foreign policy of Islamic countries interested in the CAR. During the 1990s Saudi Arabia formed two lines of cooperation with Central Asian countries. The first line is "geo-religious",which in the public diplomacy sphere started to promote the development of the religious revival of the peoples of Central Asia and their accession to the global Muslim community led by SA. The second line is economic, where the share of Arab capital and business in the regional markets increased in order to advance the interests of Saudi Arabia. Iran's foreign policy in Central Asia received three major reasons: a) "geo-economic", the development of economic projects in the field of transport and energy for the unification of markets of Central Asia and the Persian Gulf; b) "civilizational", the reactualization of the historical involvement of the peoples of Central Asia in the Persian cultural and historical values;.) "real-political", the formation of a loyal regime of interaction with Russia and China in the region as a counterweight to the Western anti-Iranian policy. Turkey formed its own foreign policy motivations in Central Asia which combined both economic interests to the Caspian and Central Asian hydrocarbons and strategic ethnolinguistic projects for the establishment of a regional center of power headed by Turkey on the basis of the Turkic peoples kinship. Among all international actors in Central Asia, the Muslim powers have shown the greatest activity and consistency in the implementation of the Central Asian direction. Because of this renewed Islamic interest of Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the problems of Central Asia firmly fixed in the forefront of the international agenda by the beginning of the new millennium. The dynamics of this competition between the states in the region gives reason to draw parallels with the historical events called "The Great Game".

SMEs play a significant role in national economies worldwide. Research on SME growth and influence of management accounting on decision making is evolving. This study examines qualitative and quantitative data collected from 54 SMEs through a series of interviews held in conjunction with consultative programs. Contemporary SME life cycle literature, the use of accounting information and the implications of financial knowledge in the growth of small-to medium-sized businesses are considered. The study concludes with the proposition that central to the growth of SMEs is the embeddedness of knowledge into organisational motor cognition.	[Catto, M.

Implementation of specific initiatives preferred by patients with lower HRQoL may be a strategic approach to enhancing care for potentially vulnerable patients. Methods English-speaking adults were recruited from five outpatient chemotherapy clinics located in New South Wales, Australia. Using touch screen devices, participants selected up to 25 initiatives that would improve their experiences and completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) survey. The logistic odds of selecting an initiative according to FACT-G scores were calculated to determine whether preferences were associated with HRQoL after controlling for potential confounders. Results Of the 411 eligible outpatients approached to participate, 263 (64%) completed surveys. Commonly selected initiatives were up-to-date information on treatment and condition progress (19.8%), access to or information on financial assistance (18.3%), and reduced clinic wait times (17.5%). For those with relatively lower FACT-G scores, the adjusted odds of selecting five initiatives illustrated an increasing trend: convenient appointment scheduling systems (+23% [P = .002]), reduced wait times (+15% [P = .01]), information on medical emergencies (+14% [P = .04]), access to or information on financial assistance (+15% [P = .009]), help to maintain daily living activities (+18% [P = .007]). Conclusion Two areas of improvement were commonly selected: easily accessible health services and information and support for self-management. Although the results suggest an association between a few quality improvement preferences and HRQoL, a wider spectrum of patient characteristics must be considered when targeting quality improvement to patient subgroups.

J	Schlebusch, G; Mokhatle, M				Schlebusch, Gawie; Mokhatle, Masese			Strategic Planning as a Management Tool for School Principals in Rural Schools in the Motheo District	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Planning; School Management; School Governing Body; School Reform		Strategic planning basically includes a group of instruments, operations and concepts structured to help managers, leaders and planners think and act strategically. The planning process comprises a definition of the goals, a valuation of the resources available for meeting the goals, and the definition of definite plans or initiatives that are intended to achieve the goals. The process usually includes a classification exercise that identifies the highest priority initiatives. The study indicates how strategic management fits into the management process. Strategic planning ensures that the school is associated with the changing internal and external environment. This planning is formulated by top management and focuses on the entire organization. A qualitative design was followed in which the opinions of principals were sought through the use of semi-structured interviews. The findings of the study indicate that strategic planning does not occur in many schools in the Motheo district. If a form of strategic planning does occur, School Governing Body (SGB) chairpersons are often excluded in the drafting and implementation of these plans. Collaboration between School Management Teams (SMTs) and SGBs is needed to ensure the successful drafting and implementation of strategic plans.

Data on HRM competencies were collected from South African human resource (HR) practitioners (N = 189; females = 49.2%, blacks = 91.2%). Exploratory factor analyses resulted in three distinguishable HR competency dimensions: Professional behaviour and leadership (i.e. leadership-personal credibility, organisational capability, solution creation, interpersonal communication, and citizenship); Service orientation and execution (i.e. talent management, HR governance, analytics and measurement, and HR service delivery); and Business intelligence (i.e. strategic contribution, HR business knowledge, and HR technology).

We show that if some conditions are satisfied, the predator-extinction boundary periodic solution of the investigated system is the globally asymptotically stable. We also show that if one certain condition is satisfied, the investigated system is permanent. Finally, the numerical analysis are also employed to illustrate the results. Our results provide a strategic decision for the biological economics management.

J	Fanti, L; Buccella, D				Fanti, Luciano; Buccella, Domenico			Passive Unilateral Cross-ownership and Strategic Trade Policy	ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL			English	Article						Export subsidy; prisoner's dilemma; unilateral cross-ownership; Cournot duopoly	MARKET; ARRANGEMENTS; DELEGATION	In a Cournot duopoly model in which exporters compete in a third market, this paper revisits the classical issue (dating back to the pioneering work of Brander and Spencer, Export Subsidies and International Market Share Rivalry, 1985) of the strategic trade policy choice in the presence of the passive participation of one firm in the rival. Passive cross-ownership dramatically alters the participating and participated firms' governments' choice to apply the strategic trade policy instrument, the equilibria typology and their efficiency properties. In fact, if the share of cross-ownership is sufficiently large, the participated firm's government finds optimal to tax export. Moreover, beyond an adequately high threshold, cross-ownership modifies the equilibrium from the activist regime for both countries to an asymmetric regime in which only the participating firm's government intervenes. In addition, in the case of the traditional common activist regime equilibrium, the classical prisoner's dilemma game structure may disappear.

Study of the VMM1 read-out chip in a neutron irradiation environment	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Electronic detector readout concepts (gas, liquid); Front-end electronics for detector readout; Radiation-hard electronics; Gaseous detectors	MICROMEGAS	Within 2015, the LHC operated close to the design energy of root s = 13-14 TeV delivering instantaneous luminosities up to L = 5 x 10(33) cm(-2)s(-1). The ATLAS Phase-I upgrade in 2018/19 will introduce the MicroMEGAS detectors in the area of the small wheel at the end caps. Accompanying new electronics are designed and built such as the VMM front end ASIC, which provides energy, timing and triggering information and allows fast data read-out. The first VMM version (VMM1) has been widely produced and tested in various test beams, whilst the second version (VMM2) is currently being tested. This paper focuses on the VMM1 single event upset studies and more specifically on the response of the configuration registers under harsh radiation environments. Similar conditions are expected at Run III with L = 2 x 10(34) cm(-2)s(-1) and a mean of 55 interactions per bunch crossing. Two VMM1s were exposed in a neutron irradiation environment using the TANDEM Van Der Graaff accelerator at NSCR Demokritos, Athens, Greece. The results showed a rate of SEU occurrences at a measured cross section of (4.1 +/- 0.8) x 10(-14) cm(2)/bit for each VMM. Consequently, when extrapolating this value to the luminosity expected in Run III, the occurrence is roughly 6 SEUs/min in all the read-out system comprising 40,000 VMMs installed during the Phase-I upgrade.

A questionnaire was administered to 50 producers during a farm visit in which concurrently, 20 randomly selected, lactating animals over the age of 2 years underwent sampling for paratuberculosis testing. Only 1 of 50 farms (2.0%) was closed to animal movement, whereas 96.6% of dairy goat farms and 94.1% of sheep farms purchased livestock from other producers. Only 10.3% of dairy goat, and no dairy sheep farms used artificial insemination. Manure was spread on grazing pastures by 65.5% and 70.6% of dairy goat and dairy sheep farms, respectively. Because of the high true-prevalence of paratuberculosis infection detected, no risk factor analysis could be performed. This study demonstrates that biosecurity practices conducive to transmission of PTB are highly prevalent in Ontario small ruminant dairy farms.

J	Han, TC; Sung, A; Chou, CC				Han, Tzeu-Chen; Sung, Arthur; Chou, Chien-Chang			Application of analytic hierarchy process to choose the optimal transport mode of army logistics between Taiwan and offshore islands	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART M-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR THE MARITIME ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Expert system; knowledge discovery; analytic hierarchy process computing; shipping industry; defense logistics management	EXTENT ANALYSIS METHOD; FUZZY-AHP; SERVICE	In the past, although many researchers used analytic hierarchy process to various fields, few applied analytic hierarchy process to solve the military problems. In this article, an application of analytic hierarchy process to choose the optimal transportation mode in the military logistics is explored. The results show that the transportation by the Army's warships takes priority because the self-reliant transportation provides offshore islands a good shipping service in a short transit time, on a reliable schedule and by the professional armed forces. In respect of the measuring dimensions, related literature, expert groups and offshore island military units give priority to the timing because the timing is the key to either the civilian commercial economy or the military transportation. Moreover, this article also finds that related literature, experts and basic-level military units have different perspectives on the evaluative criteria owing to their different views of economy (strategic planning), resources (military budget), hierarchies (managers, planners and demanders) and port facilities (military investments). Finally, this article also analyzed and compared the commercial logistics and the military logistics and then summarized some major differences between the commercial logistics and the military logistics. It not only provides an important basis for future academic studies on the logistics but also provides a useful reference for the logistics practices.

J	Perepelitza, M; Petterson, L; Turpin, K				Perepelitza, Mark; Petterson, Lisa; Turpin, Kate			Performance validation case study: Federal office building with an integrated facade	JOURNAL OF BUILDING PHYSICS			English	Article						post-occupancy evaluation; integrated facade; building performance; occupant satisfaction		The General Services Administration Edith Green Wendell Wyatt building has undergone an extensive retrofit and is distinguished by its new integrated facade. 1 It has been transformed from a poorly performing office building into a highly efficient Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED) Platinum facility. The unitized curtain wall includes fixed exterior shading tuned for each solar orientation. The new interior environment optimizes daylight and electric lighting, thermal comfort, and air quality. This article reports on post-occupancy evaluations to validate and fine-tune the performance of Edith Green Wendell Wyatt building. The focus is on post-occupancy evaluation studies that relate to the integrated facades. Overall, post-occupancy evaluations address three categories: ( 1) resource use and generation-energy and water, ( 2) occupant satisfaction, and ( 3) indoor environmental quality measurements. During design, the impact of building enclosure measures and internal loads was linked directly to the selection of the mechanical system. The team determined that strategic use of glazing and exterior shading would support highly efficient hydronic radiant heating and cooling. Post-occupancy evaluation methods include installed data sources ( from the building management system and other installed measurement and verification systems) and proposed field testing. Occupant satisfaction has been evaluated with an on-line survey from the Center for the Built Environment. The results have been filtered by solar orientation, floor, and other criteria to understand the facades' impact on occupant satisfaction. Pre-occupancy results and additional benchmarking compare the results with government and other general office buildings. As of January 2015, many of the post-occupancy evaluation studies have been completed, but some are still on-going. Post-occupancy evaluation objectives include: demonstrating federal energy compliance, refining building performance, and providing feedback for future work.

J	Tang, KH; Chen, ST; Tsai, YT				Tang, Kuo Hao; Chen, Shih Ting; Tsai, Yu Ting			Assessment of the subjective perception of music quality using psychoacoustic approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS			English	Article						Psychoacoustics; Roughness; Music quality; Subjective perception; Prediction model	NOISE	It is generally agreed that sound quality is one of the most difficult to measure characteristics of an electroacoustic products such as an earphone or a loudspeaker. A conventional approach used to measure people's subjective perception of these sound reproduction products is to conduct a jury test on a group of experiment participants; however, jury tests require considerable costs, including those of effort and time. As development speed and cost become strategic competitive dimensions, electroacoustic industry needs a more efficient approach to assess their newly developed products for subjective sound quality. This study developed and validated a quantitative model, the tonal harmony level (THL), that can effectively predict people's subjective perceptions of music quality. Participants' subjective perception and preference was measured for four music genres by listening to short music excerpts (8 s) in both ordinal and interval scales. The purpose of using two scales is to examine the consistency between subjective perceptions and to determine the robustness of the subjective measurements. The experimental results were very stable over the two assessment procedures, and the objective THL measure is highly correlated to subjective preference. The analysis suggests that the construction of subjective music quality prediction models should also consider music genre. Among four types of music, musical solos consisted of human vocals accompanied by a few instruments has a distinct pattern from the other three types. Thus, while R-2 value of the overall regression model is 0.707, the R-2 values are 0.955 and 0.901 when four music genres are categorized into two groups according to their patterns. When efficiency and accuracy were simultaneously considered, according to the results of this study, the approach of two group categorization can be adopted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gavious, I; Lahav, Y; Russ, M				Gavious, Ilanit; Lahav, Yaron; Russ, Meir			Changes in the value implications of compensation costs throughout the economic cycle: an examination of high-tech versus low-tech industries	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING & ECONOMICS			English	Article						M41; E32; J24; O34; M54; economic cycle; human capital; compensation cost; economic trends; valuation	MARKET VALUATIONS; RETURN; RISK	This study explores whether and how the value implications of compensation costs change throughout the economic cycle. Given that we are dealing with the human aspect of the intangibles that drive the value created by a company, it is not obvious what impact the 'boom' and 'bust' phases of the economic cycle will have on investor valuations of this primary component of a company's investment in human capital (HC). Our results reveal that economic cycles have a substantial immediate impact on the value implications of compensation costs. Specifically, these value implications increase significantly during upticks in the economy and decline in the downturns, in high-tech as well as low-tech firms. Notwithstanding, the value implications of compensation costs are consistently higher for high-tech firms. Furthermore, the changes in value implications for high-tech firms throughout the economic trends are more volatile than those observed for low-tech firms. When differentiating between investors on and outside the exchange, we find consistently stronger value implications of compensation costs for the latter. It seems that throughout the economic cycle more informed and sophisticated investors have a higher assessment of the role of a firm's investment in HC in value creation. Another important implication of our results is that, in response to economic changes, investors modify their valuations of HC quickly rather than gradually, which is unexpected given the strategic value and complexity of the human aspect of the firm's intangibles.

J	Cassenti, DN				Cassenti, Daniel N.			A robotics operator manager role for military application	JOURNAL OF DEFENSE MODELING AND SIMULATION-APPLICATIONS METHODOLOGY TECHNOLOGY-JDMS			English	Article						Robotics; network science; cognitive modeling; decision making		Due to the increasing use of robots in US military operations, a new role may help to manage and coordinate multiple robotic assets, especially when considering the high mental workload requirements for robot control. The role of a robotics operator manager (ROM) was formed to study a path forward in solving this problem. An experiment with human test participants acting as ROMs showed that the ROM role as constructed is a workable solution to the robot management problems and also showed that time limits and bandwidth limitation affected engineered explosive detection performance, assessments of trust, and ratings of mental workload. Some of these results and others showing preferences for image stimuli and ground robots were simulated in an Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational model of the ROM experiment. The experimental and model results reveal that the ROM is not just a workable solution to the robot coordination problem, but that it may also be a preferred solution. I conclude with notes on how to field the role with personnel of specific skill sets.

It is generally agreed that the development of innovation performance facilitates such sustainable management among inter-organization in supply chains. This paper presents a research model comprises five research hypotheses with four constructs, including transactional orientation, moral orientation, dynamic capability and innovation performance. The constructs are measured by well-supported measures in the literature. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze survey data collected from 260 manufacturing firms that were among the top 1,000 Taiwanese manufacturing firms of 2012 listed by Business Weekly. The results of the empirical study suggest that transactional and moral orientation is critical in ensuring the inter-organizational innovation performance as it promotes the dynamic capability in the process.

J	Nguyen, HTN; Enderwick, P				Ha Thanh Nhan Nguyen; Enderwick, Peter			The Perceptions and Responses of Vietnamese Firms Towards Deeper Regional Economic Integration Case Studies from the Food Processing Industry	JOURNAL OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN ECONOMIES			English	Article						Regional economic integration; ASEAN Economic Community; business strategies; Vietnam	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; DETERMINANTS; COMMUNITY; LESSONS	Increasing regional economic integration amongst ASEAN member countries, and the creation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will bring both opportunities and challenges for local firms. This research investigates the perception and understanding of five Vietnamese food processing companies towards the AEC as well as their planned responses towards deeper integration. Case study interviews revealed that respondents had a limited understanding of the AEC, which moderated their strategic responses. Opportunities identified include access to new markets, the possibility of exploiting regionwide resources, and access to regional value chains. Increased competitive pressure, particularly from foreign investors, was the key anticipated challenge. Business responses focused on increasing intra-regional exports, cooperating with potential partner organizations, improving products and processes, and revising marketing strategies. Respondents also believed that the Vietnamese government could do more to support their businesses in the face of deepening economic integration.

J	Jespersen, KR; Bysted, R				Jespersen, Kristina Risom; Bysted, Rune			IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: A STUDY OF PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS AMONG MANAGERS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategy implementation; competence traps; strategic gap; managers' characteristics; innovation	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; DECISION-MAKING; FIRM PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION; INNOVATION PERFORMANCE; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; ESTABLISHED FIRMS; MODERATING ROLE; KNOWLEDGE; ORIENTATION	Strategy implementation is an important aspect of innovation, as only 30% of planned strategies are matched by realised innovation outcomes. The present study investigates this in a setting of strategic implementation of New Product Development (NPD). In the implementation process, the managers' characteristics are what lead to successful implementation of NPD. Managers' characteristics affect the decision outcome. This study incorporates curiosity as a personal trait and NPD experience as a personal characteristic of the manager as moderating effects of the strategy implementation process of NPD. 131 NPD managers of Scandinavia SBUs participated in the study. Data were analysed using partial least squares regression. The study finds that managers influence the realised NPD strategy. NPD managers impose competence traps on strategy implementation. Curious NPD managers implementing aggressive strategic intentions create information overload in the NPD process, which decreases the new product novelty. In contrast, realisation of defensive strategic intentions makes experienced NPD managers focus on known NPD competences, thereby decreasing the new product novelty of NPD efforts. The study identified inadequately developed information competences among NPD managers. The result shows the importance of analysing how personal characteristics facilitate or hinder NPD strategy implementation. The competitive advantage of NPD efforts relies on such an analysis.

J	Suykens, B; Stein, D				Suykens, Bert; Stein, Danielle			"Whoever Has the Stick Guides the Buffalo': Neutrality, Party Politics and Authority Formation in Community Mediation in the Central and West Terai, Nepal	JOURNAL OF SOUTH ASIAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						mediation; party-politics; neutrality; post-conflict; Nepal	CONFLICT-MANAGEMENT; POWER; DELUSIONS; CONSENSUS; ILLUSIONS; CRITIQUE; AFRICA	This article examines the relationship between the concept of neutrality in community mediation and partisan party politics in Nepal. Focusing on one donor-sponsored, US model-based community mediation programme in the Terai, this article contributes to a growing literature on authority formation and the role of party politicians in post-conflict Nepal. It argues that both neutrality and bias in dispute settlement are constitutive of building (Weberian) authority, allowing for the legitimate exercise of power by politicians. Neutrality is not only highly valued in mediation ideology, but is also a crucial legitimizing register in dispute settlement in Nepal. Although resolving disputes neutrally enhances the local legitimacy of (political) mediators, our research finds that there are cases when showing political favouritism also helps maintain power. We find that these contradictory incentives and the need to balance them guide the arena in which politicians choose to resolve disputes and how they choose to resolve them. These strategic decisions made by politicians in order to balance neutrality and bias thus guide outcomes of dispute settlement, and mediation in particular. This raises questions about the proclaimed ability of community mediation to overcome power imbalances and provide justice to disadvantaged communities.

Therefore, the impacts of climate change on rice yields have garnered considerable attention. In this study, meteorological and rice yield records during 1951-2011 from the Reclamation area (RA) and general agricultural area (GAA) in the Heilongjiang province of Northeast China were used to assess the impacts of climate change on rice yield trends using multiple regression models during the pre- (1951-1981) and post- (1982-2011) Household Responsibility System Reform (HRSR) periods. The results demonstrated an observable warming, but the precipitation and solar radiation changes were not statistically significant in the Heilongjiang province. The temperature during the growing season positively correlated with the rice yields in the RA and GAA over the past six decades. The rice yields increased by 4.69% in the RA and 6.85% in the GAA for each degree increase in the growing season (GS) minimum temperature from 1951 to 2011. The positive effects of warming on the rice yields decreased significantly in the RA from the pre-HRSR (1951-1981) to the post-HRSR (1982-2011) period but increased in the GAA from the pre-HRSR to the post-HRSR period. This result indicated that the increased RA rice yields may benefit more from non-climatic factors than GAA yields. Our findings uncover the potential impacts of climate change on rice production under different crop production modes and thus provide evidence-based suggestions for government policy on adaptive strategies.

It is important to identify patients with PAD because of the increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death and impaired quality of life because of a profound limitation in exercise performance and the potential to develop critical limb ischemia. Despite effective therapies to lower the cardiovascular risk and prevent progression to critical limb ischemia, patients with PAD continue to be under-recognized and undertreated. The management of PAD patients should include an exercise program, guideline-based medical therapy to lower the cardiovascular risk, and, when revascularization is indicated, an "endovascular first" approach. The indications and strategic choices for endovascular revascularization will vary depending on the clinical severity of the PAD and the anatomic distribution of the disease. In this review, we discuss an evidence-based approach to the management of patients with PAD. (C) 2016 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

J	Alexandrov, A				Alexandrov, Alexei			COMPETING FOR CONSUMERS WITH SELF-CONTROL PROBLEMS	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							TIME INCONSISTENCY; MARKET; GOODS	I examine strategic implications of competing for consumers with self-control problems. For investment goods, like health clubs, I find that the equilibrium sign-up (lump-sum) fees decrease when competition intensifies, similarly to prices in standard oligopoly models. However, the equilibrium attendance (per-unit) price increases due to firms' deteriorated ability to take advantage of consumers' self-control problems. Moreover, firms earn less profit due to consumers' self-control problems-the firms have a unilateral incentive to charge per-unit fees lower than the marginal cost; however, they cannot make up the lost margins by increasing the lump-sum fee, due to competition. I also show that for plausible parameter regions the market adjusts to consumers' self-control problem in such a way that firms play the standard equilibrium strategies that they would have engaged in with fully rational consumers, with identical market outcomes. Most of the results are qualitatively the same for leisure goods (for example, credit cards); however, some results are reversed: the per-unit fees are higher than marginal cost and decrease as competition intensifies.

J	Atoum, I; Otoom, A				Atoum, Issa; Otoom, Ahmed			Holistic Performance Model for Cyber Security Implementation Frameworks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cyber Security Implementation Frameworks; Performance Measurement; Balanced Scorecard	BALANCED SCORECARD; MANAGEMENT	The performance measurement process identifies if an implementation process is within acceptable thresholds. Performance measures for cyber security implementation frameworks are considered strategic controls because it can guide the implementation process. Consequently, corrective or predictive actions could be applied to resolve a security issue early in the implementation process. However, to our knowledge, there are no performance measures designed to function at the country level for cyber security implementation frameworks. As a result, cyber security strategy implementation process is left uncontrolled. To resolve this issue, this article proposes a new holistic performance model that is based on the well-known balanced scorecard. It aggregates performance measures from various entities involved in executing cyber security strategies. The inception of the proposed model draws its applicability to address performance measurement of holistic cyber security implementation frameworks.

Construction Organizational-Level Information Management Framework	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Information management; Information management (IM) framework; Key performance indicators; Construction organization	PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT; SUCCESS; ISSUES	Comprehensive organizational-level information management (IM) performance assessment has the potential to improve IM performance in construction organizations. However, the organizational-level IM components and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure each component are not adequately developed in construction IM literature. This paper proposes an organizational-level IM framework, which identifies the IM components, IM activities, and KPIs required for comprehensive organizational-level IM performance measurement in construction-owner organizations. The eight IM components (IM processes, ICT resources, practice resources, people resources, IM inputs, IM outputs, IM constraints, and IM objectives) are developed and defined on the basis of the analysis of 55 documents related to IM frameworks published from 1990 to 2010 inclusive. In addition, a total of six IM activities and 40 lagging and leading KPIs are developed and defined on the basis of the analysis and synthesis of IM characteristics and issues in 381 IM journal articles published from 2000 to 2011 inclusive. A structured validation is used to capture the IM conditions and needs of construction-owner organizations. This was achieved by evaluating the appropriateness, comprehensiveness, accuracy, and relevance of the IM activities and KPIs for use in IM measurement through seven construction IM researchers and 11 industry practitioners (strategic managers) in eight large case study construction-owner organizations in Canada. The researchers' validation results show a 92% agreement with regard to the appropriateness and comprehensiveness of the IM activities and KPIs for use in organizational-level IM performance measurement, as the definitions developed for several KPIs did not fully encapsulate the requirements for those IM activities and KPIs. The subsequent practitioners' validation confirms the appropriateness, comprehensiveness, appropriateness, and relevance of the IM activities and KPIs for organizational-level IM performance measurement. The proposed IM framework provides a better understanding of organizational-level IM and the KPIs needed to comprehensively measure the IM performance through strategic managers in construction-owner organizations.

J	Chen, CH				Chen, Cheng-Hung			Role, Legal Foundation, and Implementation Controversy of the NCLB Waiver	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION SCIENCES			Chinese	Article						NCLB; education policy; NCLB Waiver		The performance of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) has decreased gradually as the concerns of its opponents have been realized. Although NCLB's advocates have painstakingly collected data for its defense, they are highly frustrated by the fact that NCLB's ultimate goal of all students reaching 100% proficiency in reading and math in 2014 has failed. To address the problems of NCLB, President Obama proposed the NCLB Waiver in response to congressional partisanship, which has prevented the Elementary and Secondary Education Act from being reauthorized. Because the NCLB Waiver provides states the flexibility for circumventing the flawed provisions of NCLB, nearly all states would apply for the waiver for evading NCLB's sanctions. The results of this study revealed that the dual purpose of the NCLB Waiver is releasing states from the mandates of NCLB and matching NCLB with Race to the Top; NCLB's legal foundation is Section 9401 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and NCLB's implementation controversy is multidimensional. Finally, this paper proposes five recommendations: (1) precisely citing and interpreting the legal foundation for education change policy; (2) comprehensively considering the integration of enactment and region of education change policy; (3) cautiously coping with the political intervention with and confrontation over education change policy; (4) systematically planning the strategic matching and transition in education change policy; and (5) addressing the quality and social justice of education change policy.

J	Ruihley, BJ; Pratt, AN; Carpenter, T				Ruihley, Brody J.; Pratt, Angela N.; Carpenter, Tiffany			The Role of Public Relations in College Athletics Identifying Roles, Tasks, and Importance of Public Relations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						public relations; roles; athletic director; college athletics; PR in college athletics		Public relations (PR) is becoming increasingly important in college athletics as the frequency and severity of controversy, legal issues, and crises heighten. With many stakeholders concerned about college athletic programs, coupled with an increased media presence and skyrocketing budgets, it is imperative that athletic programs communicate effectively and efficiently in times where clarity is needed. With that, the purpose of this research is to continue learning about the roles and perceptions of PR within an athletic department, as seen through the lens of athletic directors. Building on the work of (Ruihley & Fall, 2009), this research seeks to discover more about the following PR areas: tasks, stakeholder reach, benefits, and roles of PR staff. With mixed-method findings from NCAA Divisions I-A and I-AA athletic directors (n = 49), results indicate top responsibilities of the primary PR staff member as maintaining media contacts and working with coaches and athletes. The top stakeholders indicated were student athletes, media, and the university. The top perceived role was problem-solving process facilitator. Lastly, the top indicated benefits of PR were identified in themes of communication and message, relationships, and strategic planning. The results of this research assist in understanding more about the fit of PR in college athletics.

Based on a study of 762 organizations, we explore the modus operandi underpinning architectural change and argue that the interplay between social and historical aspiration levels: (i) constitutes a benchmark against which organizations measure current performance; and (ii) defines the scope of architectural change. While a small performance gap leads organizations to implement minor architectural changes (adaptation strategy), a large performance gap requires major change (reorientation strategy).

J	Rese, A; Kutschke, A; Baier, D				Rese, Alexandra; Kutschke, Anke; Baier, Daniel			ANALYZING THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF SUPPLY SIDE, DEMAND SIDE AND REGULATORY FACTORS ON THE SUCCESS OF COLLABORATIVE ENERGY INNOVATION PROJECTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supply side factors; demand side factors; R&D subsidies; success factors; collaborative innovation projects; energy innovation projects	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATIONS; ECO-INNOVATIONS; TECHNOLOGY-PUSH; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; TEAM PERFORMANCE; GREEN INNOVATION; MARKET SUCCESS	The analysis of the importance of supply side and demand side factors with regard to innovative behavior is quite old. In this paper, these two categories are used to distinguish and examine the relevance of several success factors for collaborative innovation projects on the firm level in the German energy sector. The literature emphasizes that solving environmental problems requires extensive technological change. On the other hand, due to higher prices the market push is weaker. Regulatory factors are therefore designed to stimulate environmental innovations. The relative influence of these three categories on project performance is investigated on the basis of a sample of 128 German collaborative energy innovation projects in the development phase using a scale-based approach and structural equation modeling at the firm level. The results confirm the importance of supply side factors followed by demand side factors. In contrast to literary assumptions, R&D subsidies played no significant role.

J	Areal, A; McIntosh, B; Sheppy, B				Areal, Andreia; McIntosh, Bryan; Sheppy, Bruce			Hope and glory: an expanded social strategy diagnosis model to incorporate corporate social responsibility within business strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business strategy; corporate social responsibility; CSR; shared value; bottom of the pyramid		Corporate social responsibility has been seen by corporations as a practice to adopt as an act of philanthropy. There have been attempts to expand the role of social responsibility to business problems however there has never been an attempt to consider the strategic alignment of social outcomes to strategy. This article analyses the role of strategy by providing a review of strategy using Whittington's generic strategies model and expanding the same model to incorporate a social strategy model that supports the anecdotal idea that social responsibility can be potentially strategic. The paper centres its argument within the Indian context.

J	Arvand, N; Baroto, MB				Arvand, Nader; Baroto, Mas Bambang			How to implement strategy more effectively	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategy implementation; strategy formulation; McKinsey's 7S; resource-based viewpoint; industrial organisation viewpoint; management control system		To execute a strategy more effectively, this study develops a model modifying the resource-based 'McKinsey's7S' through the industrial organisation point of view. To do so, the 'comprehensive strategic management model' and the article on 'how the balanced scorecard complements the McKinsey's 7S model' are employed. The model was tested on a transformer manufacturer, and findings prove that neither viewpoint is independently effective. Indeed, combining both views, this study employs the strategy formulation and management control system to contribute to resolving the most difficult stage of strategic management (implementation).

J	Babin, R; Quayle, A				Babin, Ron; Quayle, Adrian			ISO 37500 - Comparing outsourcing life-cycle models	STRATEGIC OUTSOURCING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Risk management; Life cycle; ISO; Managing outsourcing; Outsourcing standards		Purpose - This paper aims to illustrate the value of the outsourcing life cycle, as described in several industry models, including ISO 37500. Design/methodology/approach - The authors present a comparison of outsourcing life cycles to provide an overview of current practices in the global outsourcing industry. Findings - Several outsourcing life cycles have been defined by industry associations such as the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) and the National Outsourcing Association (NOA). Academic research has created several outsourcing life cycles, notably the model from the London School of Economics (Cullen and Willcocks, 2005). Finally, commercial models have been defined, for example the Vendor and Sourcing Management model from IDC (2014). Research limitations/implications - Researchers will find the overview of different life cycles useful in assessing maturity of outsourcing organizations. Practical implications - Practitioners will find the detailed description of ISO 37500 and the comparative life cycles to be illustrative of different approaches to managing outsourcing transactions. Both buyers and providers will be able to compare their own life cycle to industry standards. Originality/value - Little or no research has been conducted on how outsourcing life cycles contribute to effective outsourcing. This paper provides a foundation for such research.

The need to improve strategic management of the enterprise is confirmed by a series of bankruptcies of travel companies of Russia: "Neva", "Ideal tour", "Expotour", "Wind Rose. World", "Labyrint"and others. By March 2015, according to the Association of tour operators of Russia (ATOR), the number of tour operators in outbound tourism in The Unified State Register decreased for 30% in comparison with March 2014. For tour operators specializing in outbound tourism, the annual turnover of which does not exceed 250 million rubles, the amount of financial guarantees is 30 million rubles. If the turnover is more than 250 million rubles, the financial guarantee shall be not less than 12% of the total sales. For domestic and outbound tourism financial guarantees amount to 500 thousand rubles. Thus, for most of the tour operators with small volumes, set low thresholds of financial security. This is the first reason of bankruptcy. Russian tour operators have the ability to dump at any time of the year in the expectation that in peak season they will cover losses incurred.

In addition, methods of statistical analysis, analytical spread sheet tabulation method, and method of scientific hypothesis modelling for studied processes. Results. The effectiveness of introduction of the proposed perspective trends of the entities of Ukrainian oil and gas complex is estimated. It is proved that their comprehensive implementation will improve the competitiveness of their operations, and energy independence of Ukraine. The necessity of introduction of the innovative technologies and new approaches to solution of the management problems at oil and gas complex entities is proved. Implementation of prospective mechanisms for the development of effective activity of oil and gas entities shall be based on economic competition between the entities with simultaneous implementation of the measures of state support for the promising modernization technologies reflecting the public interest to the energy security improvement. Practical significance. A study of the current state of oil and gas complex of Ukraine and challenges of development of the complex entities contributes to the identification of areas for balancing and substantiation of the development prospects of the oil and gas sector of economy in order to ensure its energy security, taking into account the strategic orientations of Ukrainian economy development. Implementation of the promising modernization mechanisms referred in study into practice is one of the priorities of oil and gas entities for increase in their production activities and profitability. The main sources of funds for the functioning of economic mechanisms for encouragement of the modernization programs and projects can be: funds of the state and local budgets received from the established taxes, penalties and increased payments for energy resources; own funds of the entities; credit facilities; internal and external investments. The implementation of the strategic objectives of development of oil and gas entities, introduction of large-scale measures for the development, technical upgrading and modernization of the fixed assets, as well as the consistent introduction of competitive relations on the domestic and external markets shall be fulfilled through improving the pricing and tariff policy by the introduction of the economically justified level of prices and tariffs for energy resources. Value/originality. The current state of the oil and gas complex of Ukraine is analyzed and its problems are identified, upon which its development prospects are substantiated. The main challenges inhibiting the stable development of oil and gas entities and their solutions are considered. The challenge of modernization and technical re-equipment of the oil and gas complex entities and the possibility of their organizational and economic reforming are covered.

J	Caro, D				Caro, Denis			The nexus of transformational leadership of emergency services systems Beyond the Wu-Shi-Ren (WSR)-Li paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SERVICES			English	Article						Transformational leadership; Qualitative research; Emergency services systems; Key informants; WSR-Li systems model	RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; ETHICS	Purpose - In the face of diverse national and international threats, the purpose of this paper is to explore the transformational leadership challenges in emergency services systems in Canada. These adaptive complex systems respond to critical mass emergencies, disasters and catastrophes. Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative research study uses grounded theory to examine the phenomenology of emergency services leadership from systems perspective. Using the theoretical Wu-Shi-Ren (WSR)-Li systems paradigm, this key informant study of 103 emergency leaders from 81 organizations focusses on the systemic challenges that transformational leaders face in emergency services systems. The response rate was 83.5 percent using a semi-structured and open-ended questionnaire. Findings - This key informant study underscores the competencies for transformational leadership and identifies 12 key leadership challenges in the context of the future evolution of emergency services systems. From the use of a grounded theory methodology, the new theory of transcendental transformational emergency leadership is posited. Research limitations/implications - Qualitative studies such as this key informant study underscores the relevance of the WSR-Li systems paradigm and grounded theory approach in discerning leadership challenges that are specific if not unique to emergency services systems. Practical implications - This study underscores the theoretical and pragmatic implications of the transformational leadership challenges for leadership paradigms, innovation and inter-sectorial collaborative networks and possible future emergency services research. Social implications - This study stresses the importance of addressing leadership challenges of emergency services systems as instrumental in ultimately saving lives, minimizing injuries and assuring complete health and social recovery from the scourges of emergency events nationally and internationally. Originality/value - Qualitative studies of the perspectives of strategic emergency leadership of systemic emergency services systems has not hitherto been done in Canada nor internationally. This key informant study underscores the relevance of the WSR-Li systems paradigm and grounded theory approach in discerning transformational leadership challenges that are specific if not unique to emergency services systems. Moreover, from the use of a grounded theory approach, a new theory of transcendental transformational emergency leadership emerged.

J	Choe, JM				Choe, Jong-min			THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN IT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategic Performance Measurement Systems (SPMS); Information Systems (IS) strategic alignment; Information Technology (IT) infrasturcture for Knowledge Management (KM); organisational learning; competitive applications of knowledge resources	STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATIVE VIEW; CONSULTANTS; AGILITY; SYSTEMS; IMPACT	This study empirically investigated the relationships among the use of strategic performance measurement systems (SPMS), organisational learning, information systems (IS) strategic alignment, the information technology (IT) infrastructure for knowledge management (KM), competitive applications of knowledge resources, and organisational performance. The empirical data were collected from questionnaires and interviews with 117 sample firms. The collected data were statistically analysed with the statistical package for social science (SPSS). The results of this paper show that SPMS significantly and positively influences organisational learning and IS strategic alignment. The strategic communications and dialogues between the employees of an organisation, which are the mechanisms provided by SPMS, enhance the degrees of the IS strategic alignment. According to the results, it was observed that organisational learning and the IS strategic alignment have significant and positive effects on the construction of IT infrastructure for KM. Thus, the clear directions of IT development, which are formed with the integration between IS strategy and business strategy, seem to shape the goal orientations of the members in a firm and to enhance their collaborations in the construction of the IT infrastructure.

This approach helps to clarify Reagan's achievements and shortcomings in what is still a somewhat conflicting historiography of his time as president. When woven together, generally, although not always, the three produced effective strategies for achieving clear objectives.

J	Dusoye, IC; Oogarah, K				Dusoye, Indravidoushi C.; Oogarah, Kavi			Is Mauritius ready to become the HRD leader in Africa? An assessment of strategic human resource development in Mauritius	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Africa; Mauritius; Sub-Saharan Africa; Conceptual framework; High HDI; Strategic HRD	GOVERNMENT	Purpose - This paper aims to explore the applicability of Strategic HRD in Mauritius. Additionally, it assesses if Mauritius, with a high HDI factor, can take the lead on Strategic HRD in Africa. Design/methodology/approach - This paper used a mixed-approach questionnaire. A sample of 21 managers was contacted and received a response rate of 67 per cent. Findings - Most organisations in Mauritius do not practice human capital development at a strategic level but rather at a tactical one. Strategic HRD is mostly practiced at the implementation level of the business strategy rather than at the formulation stage of the mission, vision and strategy itself. However, the practice of strategic human resource development stays a minority within some very few organisations, as they acknowledge the benefits that Strategic HRD brings along. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of the sample considered for this research is a relatively small one to be representative of the Strategic HRD practices in Mauritius as a whole. It identifies implication for improving the current Strategic HRD state in the island. Practical implications - The paper directly impacts on the Strategic HRD practices of organisations and reveals loopholes to be remedied within the present HRD systems. Originality/value - This paper not only proposes a first research in terms of Strategic HRD in Mauritius but also assesses the island's position as being an HRD leader in Africa. Simultaneously, it provides a tailor-made conceptual framework for Strategic HRD in Mauritius.

J	Dwivedi, R; Chakraborty, S				Dwivedi, Rishi; Chakraborty, Shankar			DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT TOOL IN A THERMAL POWER PLANT USING ABC AND BSC MODELS	SERBIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						activity based costing; balanced scorecard; thermal power plant; cost; strategy; electricity		In today's dynamic, uncertain and highly competitive business environment, the long term success of an organization critically depends on the perceptions, choices and actions of its managers regarding their strategies. Activity based costing (ABC) and balanced scorecard (BSC) are the modern day management approaches acknowledged as reliable tools for strategy formulation and implementation in an organization. In this paper, ABC and BSC models are separately proposed and applied in the merry-go-round (MGR) department of an Indian thermal power plant. The results elicited from adoption of these two models in the said power plant provide more accurate, timely, and reliable operational and financial information at different activity levels of the organization, which would help in effective strategic and tactical decision making. Even though, there are limited published research papers related to application of ABC model in power plants, none of them has adopted ABC and BSC techniques in an Indian contextual environment. Additionally, an integrated ABC-BSC model is designed to harness the complementary synergies of both ABC and BSC models.

J	Fotinatos, N				Fotinatos, Nina			The role of an academic development unit in supporting institutional VET learning and teaching change management	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE			English	Article						Change management; Leadership; Vocation Education Training; academic development unit	HIGHER-EDUCATION; ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; LEADERSHIP; UNIVERSITY	The aim of this paper is to examine the role and impact of a central academic development unit (ADU) within an institutional strategic and operational change management project. The primary goal of this project was to improve vocational education and training (VET) learning and teaching practice in an Australian dual-sector regional university. This driver of this change management project was in preparation for an external accreditation audit with the Australia Skills Quality Authority (ASQA). This paper presents perspectives from the ADU director and a specific ADU team (six senior educators and nine administrative staff) employed for 16 months to enact partial project goals. The ADU director utilises narrative methodology to describe the enactment of the project at the ADU level within the context of Kotters 8 Step Change Model (Kotter, 2012). An open and closed item survey approach was used to capture the perceptions of the ADU team regarding demonstrated leadership, management and team functionality throughout the duration of the project. The survey data also captured their perceptions regarding the value placed on change management requirements and indicators and their most rewarding experiences throughout the project. This paper highlights challenges and key lessons for ADUs associated with change management in a dual-sector environment. It also highlights the importance of utilising a suitable change management framework to initiative, lead and support meaningful, sustained changes in the dual-sector education environment	[Fotinatos, Nina] Federat Univ Australia, Ballarat, Vic, Australia		Fotinatos, N (corresponding author), Federat Univ Australia, Ballarat, Vic, Australia.	n.fotinatos@federation.edu.au					Alhazemi AA, 2013, INT J PUBLIC ADMIN, V36, P972, DOI 10.1080/01900692.2013.773036; Andrade M S, 2016, DISTANCE ED NEW DIRE, P31; Beaudoin MF, 2013, HANDBOOK OF DISTANCE EDUCATION, 3RD EDITION, P467; Bianchini S, 2014, INNOV EDUC TEACH INT, V51, P556, DOI 10.1080/14703297.2013.786582; Blaschke S, 2014, HIGH EDUC, V68, P711, DOI 10.1007/s10734-014-9740-2; Bolden R, 2009, EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD, V37, P257, DOI 10.1177/1741143208100301; Cahill J, 2015, EDUC RES-UK, V57, P272, DOI 10.1080/00131881.2015.1056640; Calma A, 2015, ASIA PAC J EDUC, V35, P55, DOI 10.1080/02188791.2013.860006; Cameron E., 2012, MAKING SENSE CHANGE; Caton J, 2016, COMMUNITY COLL J RES, V40, P615, DOI 10.1080/10668926.2015.1125813; Chowthi-Williams A, 2016, NURS EDUC TODAY, V36, P133, DOI 10.1016/j.nedt.2015.08.023; Davis H, 2014, J HIGH EDUC POLICY M, V36, P371, DOI 10.1080/1360080X.2014.916467; Davis H, 2014, J HIGH EDUC POLICY M, V36, P367, DOI 10.1080/1360080X.2014.916463; Drew G, 2010, AUST EDUC RES, V37, P57, DOI 10.1007/BF03216930; Drugus D, 2014, B TRANSILVANIA U B 5, V7, P125; Griffioen D M E, 2015, INT J LEADERSHIP ED, DOI 10.1080/13603124.2015.1066867; Hashim M, 2013, INT J ACAD RES BUSIN, V3, P685; Hechanova RM, 2013, ASIA-PAC EDUC RES, V22, P11, DOI 10.1007/s40299-012-0019-z; Heckmann N, 2016, J BUS RES, V69, P777, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.07.012; Howells JRL, 2014, CAMB J REG ECON SOC, V7, P251, DOI 10.1093/cjres/rsu005; Jones S, 2011, LESSONS LEARNT IDENT; Kotter J., 2012, LEADING CHANGE; Kotter J P, 2005, LEADERSHIP EXCELLENC, V22, P3; Kotter JR, 2007, HARVARD BUS REV, V85, P96; Kotter JP., 2002, HEART CHANGE REAL LI; Mallon W, 1999, ON CHANGE; MIDDLEHURST R, 2007, NEW DIRECTIONS HIGHE, V137, P45, DOI DOI 10.1002/HE.245; Palmer Ian, 2002, STRATEGIC CHANGE, V11, P243; Sarin S, 2010, J PERS SELL SALES M, V30, P143, DOI 10.2753/PSS0885-3134300205; Snowden DJ, 2007, HARVARD BUS REV, V85, P68	30	1	1	0	5	UNIV WOLLONGONG	WOLLONGONG	NORTHFIELDS AVE, WOLLONGONG, NSW 2522, AUSTRALIA	1449-9789			J UNIV TEACH LEARN P	J.

We study the evolution of the groups between the years 2006 and 2011, i.e., before and during the economic crisis. We also attempt to identify those competitive variables which act as mobility barriers in the industry. The results reveal that although the number of groups remains the same, some of these groups change in their internal composition and characterisation. A low level of firm mobility is found. Mobility was higher between similar groups than between dissimilar ones. The main mobility barriers between groups are the size and the economies of scale. The mobile operators have not changed their strategy throughout the periods, and consequently the economic decline has not influenced their generic competitive strategies.

J	Gonzalez, S; Erogul, MS; Barragan, S				Gonzalez, Santiago; Erogul, Murat Sakir; Barragan, Salvador			SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN TEACHING CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: EVIDENCE FROM MEXICO AND CANADA	JOURNAL ON EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIBILITY IN EDUCATION AND SCIENCE			English	Article						Corporate Social Responsibility; Stakeholder theory; case study; education and business; Mexico; Canada		The need to incorporate and develop Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) within university programs is necessary for future leaders, managers and entrepreneurs. Within the framework of CSR and stakeholder theory the paper contributes a comparative case study that utilizes curriculum and in-depth interview analysis to illustrate not only the similarities and differences in the CSR programs, but how social responsibility is taught in a Mexican and Canadian University context. The main findings are: the CSR program in Mexico is perceived as a strategic management tool that adds value to the organization and does not pay any special attention to the globalization phenomena. Whereas in Canada, social responsibility is founded on ethics, attention to the different stakeholders in a globalized environment is emphasized and the strategic importance of CSR is widely accepted. The paper provides academics and researcher insight into exploring how universities can further facilitate students as stakeholders in considering social responsibility as important and necessary to ensure CSR sustainability in practice.

J	Goto, Y; Gemba, K				Goto, Yoshimasa; Gemba, Kiminori			Implicit patent alliance acquiring the appropriability of innovation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						appropriability of innovation; inkjet printer; essential patent; cross-license; strategic alliance	POOLS	This paper proposes an innovation management scheme, an 'implicit patent alliance', to support the appropriability of innovation. A case study on inkjet printer companies is conducted to examine its potential effectiveness. In many markets, essential patents may not help patentees achieve dominance because products consist of many essential patents distributed among multiple companies. This distribution allows many companies to enter the market and limits the appropriability of innovation. A collection of essential patents and cross-licenses held, both formally and informally, by only a few companies among themselves could function as a virtual alliance. This 'implicit patent alliance' can occupy the licensing of essential patents and provide a basis for the appropriability of innovation. Three inkjet printer companies -Canon, Epson, and Hewlett-Packard -formed an implicit patent alliance and dominated the market.

Ya; Simonenkov, M., V			Current Status of Modeling and Optimization of Forest Roads	LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						forest roads; road network; logging; forest transport infrastructure planning; forest road design; modeling and optimization method		The paper presents the achievements and opportunities of using modern modeling and optimization methods in the automated design of road networks and forest roads. The selection of optimization techniques will improve the efficiency of decision-making for the planning and organization of road construction. The survey includes both domestic and foreign developments with the general trends and distinctive features. The paper considers the existing approaches, design stages and the levels of forest road planning. Vector and raster spatial data models, which are the base of road networks modeling, are introduced. The main highways design optimization problems are highlighted depending on the process phase. Solution methods are listed in two categories - the exact and heuristic along with problems-solving examples. The most common methods of transport networks optimization are the shortest path method and the minimum spanning tree algorithm. They form the base of the search process of optimal transport network on graphs, successfully implemented in solving transport problems in the medium and short terms, and for small areas. On the basis of the analysis the classification of forest roads models are highlighted. It is concluded that the use of multi-criteria optimization methods and spatial analysis based on the geographic information system is actual for strategic planning problems. The paper proposes the creation of forest roads management system with four main units: informational, modeling, optimization and visualization. The effectiveness of the system will depend on the development of long-term strategy and optimization of the main forest roads, as well as the supporting of the selection relationship of cutting fund and prospective schedule of putting into operation of road sections projected by the general scheme. Several optimization techniques depending on the level of planning can be used.	[Gromskaya, L.

J	Guo, CQ; Wang, Y				Guo, Chiquan; Wang, Yong			Market orientation, distributor relationship, and return on assets Optimizing distribution performance for industrial firms	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Distribution management; Customer satisfaction; B2B marketing	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIC ORIENTATION; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; PROFITABILITY; DETERMINANTS; ANTECEDENTS; DEPARTMENTS; ENVIRONMENT; INNOVATION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how market orientation is related to relationship building outcomes in the downstream distribution process. The authors examine the role of distributor satisfaction in mediating the association between market orientation in distribution and return on assets. Design/methodology/approach - Market orientation in distribution was measured by distributor orientation, competitor orientation, and interfunctional coordination. Findings - Results showed that the positive relationship between market orientation in distribution and distributor satisfaction was strongly supported. While distributor orientation and competitor orientation were both positively related to distributor satisfaction and return on assets, interfunctional coordination was not related to either distributor satisfaction or return on assets. However, interfunctional coordination lessened the positive relationship between distributor orientation and distributor satisfaction. Originality/value - This study fills research void in downstream relationship building in the distribution process in a business-to-business context.

This plenary session, part of the 2015 COPD9USA conference, examines how the diagnosis and management of COPD has become more individualized as new phenotypes have been identified. In addition, new diagnostic and management tools are evaluated and the importance of including the patient perspective when designing a treatment plan is discussed. Finally, the future integration of technology in research, clinical communication, and disease education is introduced, including how the COPD Foundation is encouraging and facilitating these efforts.

J	Hui, ECM; Ng, IMH				Hui, Eddie C. M.; Ng, Ivan M. H.			ACCESS TO MORTGAGE CREDIT AND HOUSING PRICE DYNAMICS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mortgage lending; Property price; Mass residential market; Luxury residential market; Hong Kong	MONETARY-POLICY; BUSINESS-CYCLE; CONSTRAINTS; CONSUMPTION; MARKET; MODEL	In real estate studies, arguably the most important topic revolves around what actually affect the price of properties. In addition to various macroeconomic factors, the mortgage industry is also believed to play a major role. Nonetheless, despite its profound implications on the banking sector, the property market, and the economy as a whole, there is no consensus as to the relationship between property price and bank mortgage lending. In light of this, this paper aims to investigate the relationship between property price and mortgage lending, along with other macroeconomic variables, in two housing sub-markets of Hong Kong (i.e. the mass housing market and the luxury housing market). The findings illustrate that one-way directional relationships are discovered 1) from mass housing price to mortgage lending; 2) from luxury housing price to mortgage lending; and 3) from mass housing price to luxury housing price. Macroeconomic factors such as GDP, inflation rate, and interest rate are also found to play a major role in influencing the prices of both property markets and the amount of outstanding mortgage loans. Implications based upon these findings are also discussed.	[Hui, Eddie C. M.; Ng, Ivan M.

J	Jones, C; Livingstone, N; Dunse, N				Jones, Colin; Livingstone, Nicola; Dunse, Neil			The changing nature of transactions activity and liquidity in UK commercial property	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Liquidity; Investment; Urban change; Information; Transactions; Volatility	INSTITUTIONAL REAL-ESTATE; HODRICK-PRESCOTT FILTER; BUSINESS CYCLES; INVESTMENT	This paper examines changing transactions activity and liquidity over thirty years in the UK. It reviews the multi-dimensional concept of liquidity analysis and demonstrates that it is not just a function of the time necessary to sell an asset, a typical real estate perspective. Instead liquidity is defined in terms of transactions activity. The paper then hypothesises that urban change and an increased information base has contributed to a more active management of real estate portfolios and increased liquidity. Superimposed on this long term trend it is also hypothesised that property cycles create rise and falls in liquidity. The empirical core quantifies the changing nature of liquidity and transactions activity over thirty years from 1981 based on the IPD database. It confirms the hypothesised substantial rise in liquidity but increasing variability in the level of transactions activity from one year to the next queries the cyclical liquidity hypothesis. This is supported by causality tests. Over the last two decades a short term opportunity driven real estate investment culture appears to have emerged stimulated by the increased churn of properties, partly the consequence of the pace of urban change. It has brought greater volatility to the commercial real estate market.

J	Katzler, S				Katzler, Sigrid			METHODS FOR COMPARING DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES ON THE SWEDISH REAL ESTATE MARKET	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk reduction; Property type; Region; Efficient frontiers; Correlation	PORTFOLIO; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; BENEFITS; TESTS	This paper compares the effectiveness of different property portfolio diversification strategies using five methods; (1) correlation matrices, (2) efficient frontiers, (3) Sharpe ratios, using three different sub methods, (4) coefficients in equations explaining total returns and (5) R-square values in equations explaining total returns. The evaluation methods are applied to both value weighted and equally weighted indices based on Swedish real estate return data. All methods show that, if any, diversifying over property types is a better strategy on the Swedish market than diversifying over regions. No test yields significant support for regional diversification. The support for the property type strategy is stronger when using equally weighted indices.

By using the threat appraisal model and contingency theory, this study advances theories and practices of strategic conflict management by analyzing the effects of an attack on a group's essential identity due to hypocritical behavior. This work seeks to revise and extend theories concerning the distinction between internal and external threat and the linear perspective in stance predictions on the contingency continuum.

Empirical analysis of sellers and buyers in biotechnology alliances	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technology market; technology alliance; pharmaceutical; bargaining	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; JAPANESE FIRMS; LABOR-MARKET; INFORMATION; CAPABILITY; CREATION; PATENTS; IDEAS	This paper empirically investigates factors affecting the relative bargaining strength of sellers and buyers in biotechnology markets, using transaction-level data for alliances between 1993 and 2008. Specifically, a two-tier stochastic frontier model is applied to our dataset for estimating the advantage of sellers and buyers, separately, and the advantage difference between them is regressed on possible determinants, such as scope of technology, stage of pharmaceutical R&D process, previous experience forming technology alliances, seller and buyer characteristics, and financial market conditions at the time of agreement. The results show that buyers were greatly advantaged over sellers in many alliances. However, a seller's bargaining position tended to improve significantly after the clinical research phase, as did repeating transactions with previous partners. US sellers also enjoyed an advantage over non-US buyers.

REAL AND NOMINAL COLLISIONS IN THE ARSENAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION	RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA			Russian	Article						public administration; forms of governance; management methods and practices; regulation; territorial principle; sectoral principle; competence; authority; legal resource		The article examines forms and methods of public administration in the transitional society in terms of the adequacy of its arsenal to the goals and objectives of social modernization. The authors assess strategic and tactical capabilities of the established management practices to meet the challenges of organization and self-organization of social life; analyze the resources and legal sufficiency of the administrative-territorial unit of power for operational and creative management. The authors believe that there is a serious barrier for effective relations of the federal center and the subjects - uncertainty of the integrated system of uniform and permanent principles, which does not allow both levels to function as a single social institution and prevents establishing a stable and productive power "vertical". It is difficult to increase the manageability of regions as administrative-territorial forms without establishing the whole complex of relations between different levels of administration. The author describe the main control mechanism at the current stage of Russian reforms - regulation, its nature, functions and technological basis; define the basis for implementing two leading principles of regulation in the social and economic life of the country and its regions - territorial and sectoral; underline the need for the subjects of management (authorities) to overcome the existing imbalances within their competence, or by the coordination of administrative nominality and reality.

Different types of soil surface management such as clean cultivation, intertillage management, intertillage with bark compost application, sod culture, and zeolite application were employed. The radiocesium concentrations in soil were higher in the surface layer (0-5 cm) than in the other layers. The radiocesium concentration in the surface layer soil with sod culture in 2014 increased non significantly compared with that observed in 2011. The radiocesium concentration in the mid-layer soil (515 cm) managed with intertillage was higher than that in soil managed using other types of management. The radiocesium amount in the organic matter on the soil surface was the highest in sod culture, and was significantly lower in the management with intertillage. The radiocesium concentration in fruit decreased exponentially during the 4 years in each types of soil surface management. The decrease in radiocesium concentration showed similar trends with each type of soil surface management, even if the concentration in each soil layer varied according to the management applied. Furthermore, intertillage with bark compost application did not affect the radiocesium concentration in fruit. These results suggest that the soil surface management type that affected the radiocesium distribution in the soil or the compost application with conventional practice did not affect its concentration in fruit of apple trees for at least 4 years since the nuclear power plant accident, at a radiocesium deposition level similar to that recorded in Fukushima City.

The model used for the analyses is the Ferdows 'strategic role of the plant' model. The operations of Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Finland were analyzed for the study. The data used was gathered in interviews and from general sources. The results indicate that special roles can be found and, furthermore, that there are huge possibilities in this area. The idea of roles is important to improve their productivity.

J	Ledin, P; Machin, D				Ledin, Per; Machin, David			Strategic diagrams and the technologization of culture	JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND POLITICS			English	Article						New Public Management; marketization; discourse; multimodality; performance management		Strategic diagrams are becoming ubiquitous across all forms of social practices, used to map out core elements and processes in private and public institutions and also for more localized and individual activities - where, for example, so that it reads: where, for example, early years school children can manage attitudinal goals. These are easy to produce with cheap software providing templates and tools to do so. This paper shows how these diagrams must be placed in the ideological shift to neoliberal governance with its emphasis on the market, flexibility and competition. All things and processes, however intangible, are viewed as assets with simple cause-effect relations, to be converted into tangible outcomes and maximised outputs. Taking a multimodal critical discourse analysis approach, we analyse two cases, from a university and an early-years school.

The spectral graph partitioning method complements existing methods, especially, when external architectural artifacts do not exist or are less than certain. We illustrate this methodology using a U.S. airline's production system. We highlight some useful metrics and show how researchers can apply this method to generate additional architectural insights.Managerial summary: We describe a method for analyzing the architecture of complex systems that contain directed and weighted component interactions, and in which each component is interdependent (directly or indirectly) on every other component. Using the spectra of a complex system, the method is not only tractable but also provides good and predictable groupings. We illustrate this method using the firm-level production task system of a firm found in the U.S. passenger airline sector. The method is useful if the system architecture is hidden, in flux, or both. The method may also permit a holistic comparison of different systems and their architectures.

J	Leyer, M; Kronsbein, D; Rosemann, M				Leyer, Michael; Kronsbein, Daniel; Rosemann, Michael			Individual process management: a first step towards the conceptualisation of individual activities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						individuals; process management; business processes; individual activities; individual processes; conceptualisation; classification scheme; business environment; business strategy; innovation development		Understanding activities of individuals is of major importance because their actions are the main foundation of economic activity. However, there is a lack of understanding with regard to how individual activities are characterised. Thus, we develop a first conceptual classification for individual activities extending the view on business processes. The classification scheme contains personal care, education, professional work, domestic work, leisure and travel as primary activities and individual organisation, procurement, information gathering and self-expression as secondary activities. We extend mainly prior literature on customer management by structuring processes of individuals independently from their status as customer. This enables new theoretical insights in the way companies can design their offers from a strategic point of view. Companies can use IPM to systematically analyse individual processes independent from specific products and services which is assumed to foster the development of innovative product and service offers.

J	Lin, TT; Hekkala, R				Lin, Tingting; Hekkala, Riitta			Governance structure in IT outsourcing: a network perspective	STRATEGIC OUTSOURCING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Qualitative; Mixed methods; IT outsourcing; Social network analysis; Outsourcing governance	RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; RISK MITIGATION; CONTRACTS; SUCCESS; BUSINESS; FUTURE; COMPLEMENTARITY; SUBSTITUTION; FLEXIBILITY	Purpose - The governance of information technology outsourcing (ITO) has been identified as an essential determinant for ITO success. Prior studies have shed light on effective governance structures in different organizational contexts. This study aims to advance this prior knowledge by exploring how interpersonal networks, as an important aspect of such context, reflect and influence ITO governance. Design/methodology/approach - A single case study was conducted from a vendor's perspective in an ITO dyad. Social network analysis was leveraged to reveal the interpersonal networks, with whole-network analysis on 24 team members in an ITO vendor company. In addition, open-ended interviews with six selected team members were utilized to identify the perceived governance structure. Findings - The findings of this study suggest certain features of interpersonal networks, i.e. network density and cross-network comparison, can reflect governance structure in multiple aspects. Meanwhile, the authors also argue that interpersonal networks can influence the form of governance structure. Research limitations/implications - As a single case study, the context of the research site cannot be ignored in the inference of findings. To increase the confidence for further generalization, future empirical studies are needed especially in contrasting sites, such as ITO relations based on network governance. Originality/value - This study associates intra-organizational characteristics of the vendor to the inter-organizational governance structure of the ITO relationship.

Development of a Consumer Engagement Framework	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						employability skills; generic skills; health services management; graduates; higher education		Objective: The purpose of this project was to develop a Consumer Engagement Model to plan for effective baby boomer engagement to inform policy makers in the healthcare system. This is the first stage of that process. Design: Initial model development for healthcare systems based on literature review and author group experience in evidence-based practice and research, and consumer advocacy and engagement. Setting and population: South Australian health and community service systems, and healthcare professionals that work with baby boomers. Findings: To develop an evidence-based Consumer Engagement Plan, it is recommended that policy makers undertake the four steps outlined in this document to design a question, determine consumer and community segments and scope of engagement, determine the breadth and depth of engagement and address the implications, assess risk and develop strategic partnerships to ensure the Plan is evidence-based, reasonable and achievable. Conclusions: We believe this process provides a framework for planning consumer engagement and for implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review of consumer engagement for policy excellence. We propose to undertake a validation of the model thus populating the model with examples of practice-based strategies and revising the model accordingly.

J	Rivas, JL				Luis Rivas, Jose			Board composition and subsidiary risk: an explanatory study	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Boards; International experience; Risk; Government experience	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS; INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; POLITICAL RISK; IPO FIRMS; DIRECTORS; EXPERIENCE; GOVERNMENT; MODEL	Purpose -This paper aims to explore the association between firm subsidiary risk and the board composition attributes of international experience, government experience and independence (outsiders). Design/methodology/approach -We sample the directors of the 104 largest European and US service and industrial firms by market capitalization as listed in the Financial Times (FT) Global index of 2008 using a cross-sectional design with data from 2009-2011. Findings -International experience increases and government experience decreases firm subsidiary risk. Research limitations/implications -Our subsidiary data are limited to the number of subsidiaries per country and not to other potentially valuable information like size, number of employees or even board composition at the subsidiary levels. Additionally, the use of a diversified US and European firm could add unnecessary variance due to different contexts involved in 104 firms. Practical implications -The desired level of firm subsidiary risk could be influenced by modifying the profile of board members. Originality/value -This is one of the first studies to analyze the influence of board composition and risk at the firm level. Risk is a variable closely associated to internationalization.

J	Malmstrom, M				Malmstrom, Malin			Cognitive micro-foundations at work: how organizations resist change in work practice	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational change; Qualitative research; Management challenges	RATIONALITY; TACTICS; LOGICS; MODES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the essence that is, the nature of organizational responses to efficiently resist enforced change in institutionalized work practice destined to address poor organizational performance. The micro-foundations of the cognitive logic that are activated when organizations face change are hereby conceptualized. Design/methodology/approach - Using a case study design, the study focusses on narratives of a failure to implement a regulatory enforced change in work practice at a military academy established in the 1600s. The interviews are complemented by secondary data. Findings - The analysis reveals a cognitive framework by which the members of the organization shaped their responses. By building on micro-foundations for mobilizing resistance (i.e. the essential substance at a micro level), this study shows how the cognitive logic is activated to respond to change. To show how the cognitive logic is used to mitigate and compensate for incongruences with the regulatory logic, this study outlines a set of strategic resistance maneuvers and cognitive resistance forces that restrict regulatory influence on change in work practice. This study thus provides insights into maneuvers and resistance forces that members may activate to resist change efficiently. Originality/value - To the author's knowledge, this is the first study to attempt to conceptualize the essence of the cognitive logic activated to resist organizational change.

J	Manikas, A; Kroes, J				Manikas, Andrew; Kroes, James			Improved forward buying of commodity materials	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						heuristics; purchasing; forward buying; commodities	SUPPLY CHAIN; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; INVENTORY CONTROL; HEURISTICS; RISK	This research presents the Enhanced Commodity Forward Buy (ECFB) heuristic, a new method for commodity purchasing, which allows strategic forward buying of commodities for products that include commodity components or materials. The ECFB addresses limitations of existing methods by considering stochastic demand and stochastic commodity prices for products that contain both commodity and non-commodity materials. We conduct a simulation test of the new heuristic on 10 commodity indices using actual historical market prices, over a range of holding costs, markup margins, commodity percentages of the product's cost of goods sold and demand distributions. The results of the simulation show that compared with five other buying methods, the ECFB heuristic's ability to adapt to variations in both demand and commodity prices allows it to generate higher profits when demand is uncertain and commodity prices are volatile.

J	Manral, L				Manral, Lalit			The customer-centric logic of multi-product corporations	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Customer-centric strategy; Multi-product corporations; Multi-product customers	PRODUCT VARIETY; NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; OPPORTUNITY COSTS; DIVERSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; FIRM; TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; INDUSTRY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to articulates a customer-centric logic to explain the strategic behavior of multi-product corporations whose portfolio of complementary product offerings belong to diverse industries. Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the heterogeneity in multi-product corporations' motivation and ability to leverage the demand-side strategic assets developed in their home-markets to enter new markets and thereby improve their long-run corporate performance. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for strategic behavior of multi-product corporations in various industrial sectors such as telecommunications, financial services, consumer discretionary and staples, real estate, and so on. Originality/value - The profitable applicability of demand-side strategic assets to new contexts should be explained both by the motivation of multi-product consumers (to purchase a portfolio of complementary products from a diversified seller) as well as the motivation of multi-product corporations (to leverage their demand-side strategic assets to enter new markets).

J	Marenichenko, V				Marenichenko, Valerii			MECHANISMS OF STATE REGULATION OF SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						state regulation; small and medium businesses; direction of activity; mechanisms; quality development		Subject of research is the mechanisms of state regulation of small and medium businesses in Ukraine. The purpose of the research is effective mechanisms development of state regulation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Methodology. The article uses general and special methods of investigation: empirical research methods (observation, comparison); methods used empirically and theoretically study (abstraction, analysis and synthesis); methods of theoretical research (ascent from the abstract to the concrete, systemic and structural approach). The article highlighted the priority areas of activity in Ukraine, such as agriculture, IT-sector and tourism. In particular, we have analyzed data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and international surveys such as Enabling the Business of Agriculture, DOU, Deloitte (Global Survey of R&D Incentives 2015), International SOS and Control Risks, WTTC, UPS, Consulting integrated, Organic Monitor and other. We determined that agriculture must use consistent increasing areas under food crops; introduction of modern technology and innovation; gradual increase in the level of mechanization of agricultural production. Scientific research preparation and training of local staff employed in the agriculture and food industry must become the main aspects of quality development. The article defines that IT market requires quality of the state regulation in readiness for a permanent dialogue with government and comprehensive support for sector as a strategic development of the country; development strategy and projects for development of the sector; effective fight against corruption at all levels. The relevance of government regulation in the development of green international tourism is determined. Modern historical and cultural features of Ukraine can allow providing a range of services for international tourism community. There is analyzed an impact of export orientation for small and medium business in the article. Export agribusiness areas that are not yet wide developed are identified: the supply of organic products (use of fertilizers over many years significantly reduced the possibility of growing organic products in the EU, Ukraine has a a lot of land that is not processed); bean cultures export (For example, provision of population with bean cultures is only 8%, 92% -import in Turkey. The production of bean cultures have high indicators in Ukraine); selling of honey (Ukraine takes 3rd place in Europe on manufacture of of honey, and only a small part is realized abroad). As a result of research we have created own Index of business quality development (IBQD), which includes the negative tendencies of development in international rankings and current state of socio-economic environment in Ukraine. Index of business quality development considers the practical significance and is formed directly on the SMEs questionnaire and includes the following blocks: general information about the company; contemporary business issues (the study of actual practical problems of business); providing state functions to support the business development. Thus, the Index of business quality development shows efficiency of mechanisms of state administration in the SMEs sphere in dynamics.

All station and sampling metadata as well as biodiversity data regarding calcareous rhodophytes, pelagic polychaetes, and fish (families Engraulidae and Clupeidae) obtained during these expeditions were digitized within the activities of the LifeWatchGreece Research.nfrastructure project and presented in the present paper. The aim was to safeguard public data availability by using an open access infrastructure, and to prevent potential loss of valuable historical data on the Mediterranean marine biodiversity. New information The datasets digitized here cover 2,043 samples taken at 567 stations during a time period from 1904 to 1930 in the Mediterranean and adjacent seas. The samples resulted in 1,588 occurrence records of pelagic polychaetes, fish (Clupeiformes) and calcareous algae (Rhodophyta). In addition, basic environmental data (e.g. sea surface temperature, salinity) as well as meterological conditions are included for most sampling events. In addition to the description of the digitized datasets, a detailed description of the problems encountered during the digitization of this historical dataset and a discussion on the value of such data are provided.

J	Mehta, A; Tajeddini, J				Mehta, Arpita; Tajeddini, Javad			Proposed integrated CRM magic quadrant and readiness matrix model for Indian SMEs	MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						customer relationship management; CRM; integrated CRM; iCRM; Indian SMEs; innovation; strategy; relationship marketing	CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS; LEARNING ORIENTATION; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIC DECISIONS; USER ACCEPTANCE; SERVICE QUALITY; ADOPTION; INNOVATION	The objectives of an integrated CRM (iCRM) is to help organisations in their marketing, service and support function by integrating strategy, relationship, process and management systems of the Indian SMEs. With this paper we attempt to explore the relationship between Indian SMEs and integrated CRM concept. We suggest that Indian SMEs employ a multi-layer strategic approach in an integrated CRM process with the help of a proposed CRM magic quadrant and readiness matrix model that may help to increase involvement and ownership by stakeholders in their decision making processes. The proposed model can help Indian SMEs to check where they stand and where they can go as far as CRM readiness is concerned. This readiness will be checked at four level/criteria process innovation level, strategic management level, relationship marketing level, and last but not the least, at integrated management system process level. There are five phase of readiness maximum, optimum, developing, neutral and unaware with different points on scale. On the basis of readiness criteria readiness phase can be determined.

Jahmal; Nolfo, Tamu			Promoting Health and Behavioral Health Equity in California	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						California; health disparities; mental health; state offices of minority health		Behavioral health disparities are not usually considered part of the same system of health disparities. However, the California Department of Public Health focused its health equity strategies on reducing behavioral health disparities through its California Statewide Plan to Promote Health and Mental Health Equity. This statewide plan was developed through a community-wide stakeholder engagement and outreach process. In addition, the California Reducing Disparities Project is a prevention and early intervention effort to reduce mental health disparities in underserved populations. This strategic plan represents the voice of several racial/ethnic communities, such as African American, Asian and Pacific Islander, Latino, Native American, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and questioning communities in California, through 5 strategic planning workgroups. The workgroups were composed of a broad range of stakeholders, including community leaders, mental health care providers, consumer and family members, individuals with lived experience, and academia. This case example highlights the various efforts of California's Office of Health Equity in eliminating behavioral health disparities and promoting mental health equity, as well as discusses the unique statutory and regulatory role of the Office of Health Equity's deputy director.

Design/methodology/approach - It discusses the policy context nationally, the origins and implementation of the initiative, the authors' experiences and viewpoint highlighting key challenges and learning, as well as examples of new work undertaken. Findings - In all, 12 health and care organisations have participated in this project. The ability for local commissioners and providers of services to now understand "flow" both between and within services at a granular level is unique. Costs are modest, and the opportunities for refining and better targeting as well as validating services are significant, thus demonstrating a return on investment. Key learning includes how organisational development was equally as important as the implementation of innovative new software, that change management from grass roots to strategic leaders is vital, and that the whole system is greater than the sum of its otherwise in-silo parts. Practical implications - Data linkage initiatives, whether local, regional or national in scale, need to be programme managed. A robust governance and accountability framework must be in place to realise the benefits of such as a solution, and IT infrastructure is paramount. Social implications - Organisational development, collaborative as well as distributed leadership, and managing a change in culture towards health and care information is critical in order to create a supportive environment that fosters learning across organisational boundaries. Originality/value - This paper draws on the recent experience of achieving large-scale data integration across the boundaries of health and social care, to help plan and commission services more effectively. This rich, multi-agency intelligence has already begun to change the way in which the system considers service planning, and learning from this county's approach may assist others considering similar initiatives.

An ecological paradigm in the traditional and postmodern context refers to a strategic approach to solving the outstanding controversies of human society in different stages of its existence. Globalization of the environment is the oldest example of this process, which in the contemporary world has gained a special significance. Negative trends in addressing ecological problems at all levels of organization of the planetary community oblige the international participants to apply more adequate measures to preserve the ecological safety of humankind.

They typically collect and distribute environmental data in near real-time using different types of web services. These services are consumed by users and applications that expect appropriate quality of service (QoS) levels. However, acceptable and stable QoS levels are difficult to maintain in environmental sensor networks due to limited computing resources and hostile deployment conditions. We developed a new approach to efficiently manage QoS levels in these networks using two separate tasks: online QoS estimation and QoS-aware service composition. This paper presents our first prototype of a web service composition system that leverages Bayesian classification techniques to perform online QoS estimation by constantly monitoring key environmental and network performance parameters. This system has been tested in a live noise pollution environmental sensor network deployed in the Flanders region in Belgium.

J	Onyango, V				Onyango, Vincent			Enhancing environmental integration in strategic environmental assessment (SEA): insight from sensitivity analysis	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic environmental assessment; environmental integration; process improvement; process elements; sensitivity analysis; cybernetics		This paper explores the potential of sensitivity analysis to improve the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) process and enhance environmental integration. It applies the Sensitivity Model Prof. Vester (R) to the England SEA process, following two objectives: (1) establishing how different strategic environmental assessment (SEA) elements affect environmental integration; and (2) establishing the sensitivity of the SEA process in terms of response to change. The findings showed that no single element was critical to enhancing environmental integration. Several elements, acting as sources of uncertainty, leverage or stability in the process, were also identified, highlighting their potential as priority targets for process improvement. It is concluded that sensitivity analysis can supplement current expert-led approaches to SEA improvement by (1) identifying elements likely to influence environmental integration and (2) testing the likely performance of recommendations for process improvement.

A total of 4 dimensions (criteria) and 21 critical success factors (subcriteria) are identified precisely with the experts' opinions and by literature review. Identifying mall strategic factors for a segmented market gives a better understanding about patronage motives than when it is applied to the market as a whole. This enables mall managers to develop the appropriate retailing strategies to satisfy each segment. This study reveals four shopping mall target marketing factors from the managers' perspective: mall brand mix, consumer behaviour, company attributes and market structure. These four dimensions of the best strategy for shopping mall marketing management are analyzed to predict the best targeting strategy in terms of 21 subcriteria. Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (ANP) is used to determine the priority weights of the considered criteria and the best shopping mall strategy.

Consumer shopping orientation: identification and characterization of outshoppers	JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Retailing; Segmentation; Outshopping; Multiple discriminant analysis; Shopping orientation	DECISION-MAKING STYLES; RETAIL; UTILITARIAN; MOTIVATION; SHOPPERS; BEHAVIOR; MOTIVES; SEGMENTATION; PATRONAGE; TYPOLOGY	Purpose - Despite having strategic inflection, retail set-ups in India have been continuously raising a challenge for suppliers of retail products aiming to all to target the right consumers in accordance with their ever-changing preferences. This adds a complexity to retailers offering services who seek valued information to devise a retail strategy by segmenting markets on the basis of consumer shopping orientations. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop and validate the consumer profile of out shoppers based on the shopping orientations. Design/methodology/approach - The study has used descriptive research design. A total of 298 consumers from urban and rural areas of North Gujarat, India, were selected through quota-based sampling method and contacted personally to fill the self-rated structured questionnaire. Findings - Collected data were edited and processed for first exploratory factor analysis to exactly know the factor structure of consumer perceived shopping orientation. Thereafter, cluster analysis was performed to identify consumer groups which were validated through multiple discriminant analysis. Three groups, namely, outshoppers, community-oriented in-shoppers and time-effective in-shoppers were cross-tabulated with consumers' socio-demographics to extract the profile through chi-square analysis. Results were fairly consistent with the past studies. Practical implications - The results of this study indicate consumers' profiles based on shopping orientation to provide an input to retail services markets to devise strategy for targeting and positioning emphasising on outshoppers segment. Marketers do not consider them as an identical segment. Henceforth, more specific approach can be used for consumers who are frequently reflected through their psychographic portrait. Originality/value - At macro level, study reveals some opportunities to retailers for penetrating into other segments of outshoppers. Furthermore, segmenting for retail services marketers has been ignored in past literature; the study addresses this gap by proposing bases in outshopping context for Indian businesses.

J	Pati, N; Lee, J				Pati, Niranjan; Lee, Jooh			Benchmarking presidents' compensations in institutions of higher education relative to sustainability and other institutional practices	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Benchmarking; OLS; Economic sustainability; Social sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Institutions of higher education	UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS; WAGE DIFFERENTIALS; LIBERAL-ARTS; EXPERIENCE; SUCCESS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the strategic effects of academic institutional factors including environmental, social, and economic sustainability indices on the compensation of the president of an institution of higher education (IHE). The objective is to build relationships among variables to benchmark compensation measures for IHE presidents across US universities to proliferate sustainability initiatives. Some of the variables of the study were environmental sustainability, social sustainability, cost efficiency as a measure of economic sustainability, tenure, institutional control of the university such as public or private fundraising reputation, endowment and professor's salary. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 236 universities have been included in the study. The data for various dependent variables were studied to see the relationship between the independent and select dependent variables. The OLS regression approach was used to ascertain the relationships between the president's salary, and a selected set of independent variables that includes the measures of sustainability. Findings - The key findings of this study is that variables such as environmental sustainability, tenure, classification, endowment, and professor salary were significantly and positively associated with the IHE president's salary. Research limitations/implications - The current study is limited to the IHEs within the USA. Thus, the study cannot be generalized or extrapolated to other countries or contexts or cultures. Practical implications - The results of the study show that the trustees rarely use proliferation of sustainability as a criterion to compensate IHE presidents. The study concludes with the plea to trustees to benchmark sustainability across IHEs in evaluating and compensating IHE presidents. Originality/value - This paper extends the compensation study of IHE presidents to include environment, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability. These variables are important in this age where IHEs have been challenged to do more to make our planet sustainable.

We employed the BDS test and analogy inference method to infer the strategic configurations and strategic configuration matrix of the hotel industry based on the chaos theory. The strategic configurations and configuration matrix of the hotel industry were identified through the Ice Bucket Challenge and Butterfly Effect, which correspond to the chaotic and deep regularities/attractors of the chaos theory. The implication for hotel operations is to survive and surpass this complex system and dynamic competition under the strategic configurations and configuration matrix, which entails cooperation in the industry structure and pursuit of the blue-ocean strategy, a way to work in a marketplace that is free of competitors, through a strategy of service innovation.

J	Petersen, SI; Kim, JE; de Mozota, BB				Petersen, Soren Ingomar; Kim, Ji Eun; de Mozota, Brigitte Borja			Comprehensive Capability Model for Managing Business Driven Innovation through the use of Design Quality Scorecards	DESIGN JOURNAL			English	Article						business management; design management; innovation management; design metrics; strategy; balanced scorecards		Identifying business opportunities by matching an organization's internal capabilities with its external environment is to a large extent about applying the right framework to risk and return. This paper first proposes a new framework, the Market-Technology Risk Matrix (MTR matrix) and a Design Balanced Scorecard method based on Design Quality Criteria (DQC), a set of nine criteria derived from auditing design awards and design briefs worldwide for matching an organization's capabilities and its strategic environment to innovation type. By following a four-step process the connection between an organization's cultures, strategic environment, innovation strategy and design metrics can be established and communicated through Design Balanced Scorecards. We then outline the design opportunities available, corresponding to Incremental and Breakthrough Innovation strategies, as well as relevant metrics for managing their implementation. Finally, we illustrate both types of innovation strategies with examples from two corporations - Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics with contrasting capability. In conclusion, an organizations' risk-attitude is at the core of building competitive advantages and informs the relevant design metrics for managing innovation performance. The paper thus contributes to the domain of decision-making and in particular to decision-support literature.

This paper was an applied research adopting a descriptive-correlational method and survey design. The statistical population of this study consisted of all 60 employees of Payame Noor University of Sari which are working since 2015. Due to the limited size of the target population, the total population was considered as the sample. Two questionnaires were used in order to collect data and information. Karl Albrecht's standard questionnaire with 49 items with five-point Likert scales which included seven dimensions or components of organizational intelligence namely strategic vision, shared fate, appetite for change, alignment and congruence, spirit, knowledge deployment, and performance pressure. Cronbach's alpha was used as an estimate of reliability. The second questionnaire contains 16 items that assess specific organizational agility. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient were used. The results of the study showed that there was a linear relationship between two variables of organizational intelligence and organizational agility of employees in Payame Noor University of Sari.

Methodological and practical aspects of improving the management of intensive interstate and inter-regional migratory processes, negative consequences of which threaten national security of the country because of hybrid war in Donbas, illegal migration, worsening of the demographic situation, departure of scientists and specialists abroad are described in the article too. The main strategic objective, which consists of maintenance of state sovereignty, territorial integrity of Ukraine, and also integration in European and migratory space, ensuring close to the world standards of quality and length of life, realization of rights and freedoms of citizens, is formulated. Actions and tasks of the state migratory policy, ways and methods of regulation of external migrations of the population are considered. Principal reasons of external migrations of population are identified and analysed. The inwardly-regional, interregional and intergovernmental migrations of population of Ukraine in the years of its state independence (19912014) are analyzed in details. The results of analysis showed that migratory activity goes down on inwardly-regional and interregional levels. Also intensity of exchange of population went down between the regions of country. At the same time Ukraine for years state independence through depopulation processes lost 6,5 million persons, and in the external migratory moving of population of loss made over 1 million persons. The problem of illegal external labour migration is considered. It is noted that illegal migration from Ukraine to the threats to national security in the Law of Ukraine "On the National Security of Ukraine" is not included, and a threat to national security posed by illegal migration from Ukraine state authorities and management of both central and local underestimated. Attention is accented on that adjusting of migratory processes at the macrolevel must become to the ponderable component of socio-economic policy of the state, and the measures of migratory policy consist of that to obtain organization of migratory space of country and take under effective state control those migratory processes that take place in it. Proposals concerning perspective and effective actions of the state migratory policy of Ukraine in regulating migratory movement of the population from the positions of national priorities and regional peculiarities, and also personal needs of migrants and prevention of migratory threats to national security of Ukraine are formulated. It is determined that the decisive role in the regulation of labour migration processes, as a whole in Ukraine and its regions, belonging to the management of social-economic factors, such as living conditions and employment of people who can change as a result of redistribution of the state budget, wage-fund, public forms of consumption.

J	Samuelsson, P; Storm, P; Lager, T				Samuelsson, Peter; Storm, Per; Lager, Thomas			Profiling company-generic production capabilities in the process industries and strategic implications	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategizing; Capability; Configuration modelling; Process industries; Production system	MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; TAXONOMY; ORDER; INTERFACE; CUSTOMER; STOCK	Purpose - A robust description of the material transformation system is fundamental for understanding its capabilities and thus for communicating, prioritising and changing the system. Deploying a previously developed configuration model the purpose of this paper is to test the industrial usability of the model as an instrument to gain a better understanding of the material transformation system through externalising the generic production capabilities of the system. Design/methodology/approach - In a multiple case study approach and using a prior conceptual configuration model of the material transformation system in the process industries as a research instrument, company-generic production capabilities were investigated in three companies representing the mineral, food and steel industries. Findings - The empirical results supported the utility of the model as an instrument in providing a coherent set of elements that define operations and thus serve as a platform to model company-generic production capabilities and serve as input to strategizing though implicating needed change to the material transformation system. The theoretical contribution was mainly the empirical validation of the previously developed conceptual model as a tool in knowledge formation of the capabilities of the system and to outline the concept of "production capabilities configuration". Research limitations/implications - Three sectors of the process industries were studied but it is recommended that the results should be replicated in complementary case studies or a survey of larger samples from the process industries. Those studies should not only be limited to increase the empirical knowledge base, but possibly to identify additional new variables, further refine the set of variables in the present model and investigate their relationships. Practical implications - It is argued that the model can already be used as a tool to support both horizontal and vertical communication on production capabilities, thus facilitating, e.g. manufacturing strategy development. Originality/value - The validated conceptual model supported by the empirical evidence is new knowledge to be used in the analysis of company-generic production capabilities in the process industries.

J	Savage, BM; Sreevathsan, SK				Savage, Barbara M.; Sreevathsan, Sampath Kumar			Enhancing Black Belts via academic mastery	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Sustainable development; Lean Six Sigma; Academic development		Purpose - In May 2010, a new collaborative initiative was launched between the Portsmouth Business School and Hewlett Packard, wherein trained Black Belts (BB) were enabled to pursue an MSc in strategic quality management. Five years on from its commencement, the purpose of this paper is to explore the development and impact of this initiative. Design/methodology/approach - Inductive, exploratory, multi-viewpoint participant-observer case study that triangulates the academic, student and employer reactions to the programme. Findings - The paper evaluates how the academic dimension provided by the MSc has impacted on candidates' work as BB. Practical implications - Employee engagement and enthusiasm has been increased, as has the depth and breadth of the knowledge base among the participating BB, who are then applying these new skills in their improvement projects to make them more sustainable as well as financially valuable. They have been able to transfer knowledge to team members. Originality/value - This approach provides a model for accelerated development of groups of quality professionals within larger organisations. There is evidence that the community spirit that grows within and across cohorts has a multiplying effect that enhances the impact for the sponsoring organisation beyond the simple sum of the performance and skills improvement on a student by student basis.

As part of a study of investigating how the housing needs can be effectively addressed in post conflict housing reconstruction, this paper identifies the gaps in managing housing needs in post conflict housing reconstruction within the context of Sri Lanka and presents the recommendations to minimise such gaps. Data was collected through un-structured interviews conducted with 37 participants, comprising policy makers, practitioners, academics and beneficiaries who engaged in post conflict housing reconstruction in Sri Lanka. Gaps were mainly found in conflict sensitivity, measures related to physical housing, performance of implementing agencies, policy and practice issues. On the job training, application of 'do no harm' principles, enhanced beneficiary participation, enhanced accountability, effective monitoring, enhanced knowledge sharing, adequate drinking water facilities, irrigation development and initiatives for material manufacturing were suggested as recommendations to minimise these gaps. Identification of gaps in managing housing needs in post conflict housing reconstruction and recommendations to minimise them inform policy makers to address the housing needs effectively through incorporating these aspects into the related policies. This in turn enhances the sustainability in housing development after conflicts.

J	Shakina, E; Barajas, A				Shakina, Elena; Barajas, Angel			Intangible-intensive profiles of companies: protection during the economic crisis of 2008-2009	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL			English	Article						Performance; Strategy; Intangibles; Crisis	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; FINANCIAL CRISIS; INNOVATION; FIRMS; PRODUCTIVITY; DESTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY	Purpose - This study explores the strategies adopted by companies during the economic crisis of 2008-2009. It investigates whether it is reasonable for companies to intensify their investment in intangibles during recession periods. The purpose of this paper is to find empirical evidence that companies with clear intangible-intensive profiles are likely to outperform those without a clear strategy. Design/methodology/approach - This paper explores the intangible-intensive strategies of companies in terms of their dynamics during the pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis periods. Through dummy regression applied to data from more than 1,600 European companies involved in the empirical analysis, the paper aims to show moderating effects from intangible-intensive strategies on company performance, expressed in terms of economic value added and market value added. Findings - The results established in this study shed some light on the global economic crisis in 2008-2009. The findings of this study demonstrate that companies with a conservative profile towards intangibles outperform both those without a defined profile and those with an innovative one. However, an innovative profile enables faster recovery after a crisis. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature on the strategic management of companies, and highlights the particular importance of intangible-intensiveness when markets experience systematic distresses. It is emphasized that lessons learned during the recent global economic crisis must be taken into account in the strategic vision of any company.

J	Tam, S				Tam, Steven			From understanding business guanxi to practising it: a golden rule for MNCs in China	JOURNAL OF CHINESE HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; MNCs; Ethics; Firm performance; Corporate governance; Guanxi	MODEL	Purpose - This article reveals a managerial issue that multinational corporations (MNCs) in China are at a strategic crossroad where their employees are competing with the same sources of guanxi networks for different business deals simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach - Triggered by a real company case in China and guided by a literature review on business guanxi, the author bridged them into a specific inquiry, as little was known and should be further examined. Findings - The author identified a paradoxical/applied scenario in MNCs between the use of guanxi and overall firm performance damaged by overusing it. Research limitations/implications - Empirical studies are deemed necessary to seek more understanding between the role of guanxi and MNCs in China. Practical implications - Guanxi is not a straightforward guarantee of business achievements in China. Management should note the influence of its actors - own employees - who can potentially diminish the positive returns of guanxi on overall firm's achievements because of non-obvious interplays among employees and "contacts" on the overlapping guanxi networks. The larger the organisation, the higher the risk is. Originality/value - This article proposes a new line of thoughts for practitioners about the effect of business guanxi on overall firm performance and serves as a starting point for academics to explore empirical research. The concept of overlapping guanxi networks is institutionalised and discussed. A three-step rule is also suggested for MNCs as a basic solution.

Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical basis of this study are the types of clusters found in literature and the research. A survey with several types of actors were performed with companies from footwear production chain in the region of Franca, Brazil. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics techniques as well as multivariate exploratory methods. Findings - This study highlight multiple characteristics derived from different cluster typologies within the same productive chain. Originality/value - From a theoretical standpoint, the research results extended the perspective about the strategic role played by the local cooperation and also offer tomanagers and representative institutions a possibility to reflect on different types of governance principles adopted in collective actions.

J	Wang, CS; Van Fleet, DD				Wang, Chao-shih; Van Fleet, David D.			Reconceptualizing the US strategic food safety system	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Food safety; Social networks; Consumer protection; Knowledge warehouse; Strategic inspection; Hazard communication; Constructive engagement	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION; INTELLIGENCE; CAPABILITIES; EXPLORATION; INTEGRATION; REGULATORS; CONSUMERS; DYNAMICS; CHOICE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce an innovative communicative platform to be constructed to facilitate food hazard communications as new policy initiatives shift the direction of food safety management from reaction to prevention. Design/methodology/approach Literature from economics and management is examined for concepts that would yield potential solutions to accomplish the purpose. Findings An innovative synthesis of four interrelated structural elements resource, identity, standard, and knowledge is proposed as the framework for hazard communication. Practical implications Exchanges of food hazard knowledge and information among diverse stakeholders (consumers, suppliers, public agencies) in a complex environment requires an information architecture, a "knowledge warehouse," that explicitly organizes interactive elements in social networks to facilitate knowledge communication among those stakeholders. Social implications - Social networks facilitated by new communication technologies drive cooperation, consumer interactions, and improved coordination with more efficient regulatory intervention to assure food safety. Originality/value - Drawing upon the management literature and merging it with concepts from economics yields unique perspectives, creating value, and contributing to a more effective and efficient market-based food safety system.

Since its initial construction in the Zhou Dynasty (486 B.C.), the Canal had played great role in transportation and regional economic development. However, those historical functions of the Grand Canal have been almost abandoned during the past century in part due to problems like water pollution and ecological deterioration. While the environmental and ecological functions of China's Grand Canal have been severely damaged, its socio-economic functions have been crippled. The Xianghe Segment of China's Grand Canal (XSCGC) is the north end of China's Grand Canal. Connecting Beijing and Tianjin, XSCGC is an important component of China's Grand Canal. With the implementation of China's Strategy for Promoting Ecological Progress and Beijng-Tianjin-Hebei Integration Development Strategy, the restoration of environment, ecosystems, and socio-economic functions of XSCGC has become an urgent task for national ecological security and regional development. This paper reviewed historical evolutions in XSCGC and pointed out the requirements, potentials and orientation of XSCGC restoration from the perspectives of environment protection, ecosystem regeneration and socio-economic development. Based on the field investigation, the key problems in the environment and ecosystems and their causes were analyzed and identified. Then, using landsenses ecology methods of ecological restoration and planning, the strategic measures for restoration of XSCGC were proposed, including ecological pattern optimization, ecological corridor construction, and aquatic environment improvement, riparian and wetland ecosystem restoration, acoustic environment improvement, local microclimate regulation, biodiversity protection and modern environmental management framework through the technical support of Environmental Internet of Things (EIoT).

TAXATION IN REFORMS OF PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT	JOURNAL OF TAX REFORM			English	Article						Public finance management (PFM); tax administration; reforming; decision-making process; change agents; fiscal burden; management mechanisms; structure of organization; tax behaviour; economic crises; function; Taxpayers; institutions		Generally, standard theoretical approaches to reforming national economy are quite usable for goals of managing changes of taxation systems and their components. In particular, of most problematic issue for tax administration is all-round provision of implementing principles of horizontal justice, as well as introducing the approaches which allow the execution of commitments on making payments by taxpayers to be more profitable than evasion. In many developing countries, due to political reasons the government's inability to implement their declared programs is frequently the main obstacle to improving the socio-economic progress. Implementation of many reform initiatives is not always successful due to absence of clear strategies in governmental policy of structural transformations. There are wide known models of applying new approaches in systems of public finance management (PFM), particularly, in regard of formation and dynamics of revenues, expenses, debts. The standard analysis of tax systems ignores, as a rule, the efficiency of tax administration connected with transaction costs and shadow economy influence: the issue is about the expenses, on one hand, for payers of obligatory payments and levies, and on the other hand, for taxation authorities, as well as about the other taxation components, non-subject to quantitative assessment, including motivation of breaching legislation. Of great significance is tax behavior, prevention of opportunism, regulation of not only tax rates and taxation basis but also of ways of public information accessibility, application of systemic toolkits of tax collection. While developing detailed plans of reforming, it is necessary to strain after maximum efficiency of continuous cycles of financial resource movements in terms of revenues and expenditures, as well as to consider challenges for interruption of the budget processes. At that, one of the main issue is, obviously, selection of targets and priorities. There are known cases, when the donor community and international organizations insist on "the best practices" introduction, especially if the reforming is carried out with their financial support. In justice to numerous positive examples, it should be borne in mind that each taxation system of every country is characterized by their specific traits, so the efficiency of its reforming will at large depend on considering local features. On the whole, the task of managing changes in the public finance systems is getting more complicated in the context of external and internal factors of uncertainty. Thus, in any circumstances it is vital to ensure continuity of the budget process, as well as execution by the state of its constitutional obligations. The regulatory potential of economy should be focused on implementing sustainable economic development goals. Accordingly, in the taxation system framework, as a strategic tool for governmental regulation, there must function efficient mechanisms of taxes and levies, as well as benefits and preferences in coordination with expenditure items, transfers and subsidies.

By local actors, the study refers to retailers and maintenance workers such as security guards, cleaners and facility managers. The study is based on extensive empirical research being conducted in the Kamppi Centre, located in the heart of the city of Helsinki, Finland. The Kamppi Centre consists of a complex of commercial shops, offices, residential housing and public transportation terminals. It is a hectic urban milieu in a Finnish context and operates 24/7. The study identifies critical locations in the Kamppi Centre, particularly entrances, as well as the central indoor shopping plaza and the corridors where local actors are constantly negotiating the social space with the public. These places provide endless challenges to local actors' everyday dealings with people and to the material flows and stopovers at the site.

J	Yu, GD; Yang, Y; Zhao, X; Liu, AJ				Yu Guodong; Yang Yu; Zhao Xi; Liu Aijun			Evolution model of collaborative production task responding to unplanned perturbations	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Collaborative production task network; evolution; unplanned perturbations; cellular automaton; SIS		Inevitable perturbations have a significant impact on collaborative production (CP) cause that the complexity are greatly increased. In order to assess the impact accurately enterprises to make precise decisions, it is prerequisite to master the dynamic behaviour of CP when changes occur. Accordingly, in this paper, an evolution model for simulating CP task state to perturbations is proposed. Regard CP tasks as a directed weighted complex network (DWCPTN) firstly, and statistical properties of DWCPTN are analysed. Two perturbation cases and two modifications policies are defined followed. Based on above mentioned, evolution model based on cellular automaton (CA) and SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) is presented to reveal the varying process by three indices (friction of resolved nodes, convergence time and economic behaviour). Finally, analytic results from a case of a chemical product CP network (CPNCP) are used to illustrate the model and method proposed in this paper. Simulation results shows that unplanned perturbations promote a negative role to CP but the improvements of self-healing can decrease the negative effects efficiently. With the analysis, it can provide insight into ways of improving the strategic and operational decision making for enterprises.

J	Yu, MJ; Zhang, F				Yu, Miaojie; Zhang, Fan			The potential impact of China-US BIT on China's manufacturing sectors	CHINA ECONOMIC JOURNAL			English	Article						BIT; manufacturing; China-US22	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; EXCHANGE-RATES; UNITED-STATES; TAX POLICY; FDI; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; CORRUPTION; EXPORTS; TRADE	This article finds that the overall effect of the foreign direct investment (FDI) and thereby the China-US bilateral investment treaties (BIT) on Chinese manufacturing sector is positive, which raises the productivity and profitability of the firms, using various econometric models and other evidence. The manufacturing sector as a whole has already opened up to the world economy and needs to continue this process. The industries in the manufacturing sector do not need to be protected, except for in limited fields related to national security, scarce natural resources and well-defined strategic sectors. Gradual lifting of the protection may be needed in the short-run for a small number of vulnerable sectors. A moderate relaxing of the current restrictions will increase FDI in manufacturing from all countries by 4-8% under different assumptions. This effect will be small when only considering FDI from the USA. Domestic firms need to update their technology, reduce costs and learn management skills from their foreign competitors, while using the national treatment terms in BIT to enter the fields that are not open to domestic firms under current regulations. Domestic firms also need to set up firm-level global strategies and reallocate firms' resources according to the changing investment environment, taking advantage of profit opportunities outside the domestic markets.

Specifically, to decrease the climate change effects as energy requirement increases day by day poses a serious dilemma. It can be adequately reconciled with innovative data management in (renewable) energy technologies. The new environmental-friendly planning methods and investments that are discussed by researchers, governments, NGOs, and companies will give the basic and most important variables in shaping the future. We use modern data mining methods (SOM and K-Means) and official governmental statistics for clustering cities according to their consumption similarities, the level of welfare, and growth rate and compare them with their potential of renewable resources with the help of Rapid Miner 5.1 and MATLAB software. The data mining was chosen to make the possible secret relations visible within the variables that can be unpredictable at first sight. Here, we aim to see the success level of the chosen algorithms in validation process simultaneously with the utilized software. Additionally, we aim to improve innovative approach for decision-makers and stakeholders about which renewable resource is the most suitable for an exact region by taking care of different variables at the same time.

J	Elentably, A				Elentably, A.			Strategic and Operational Plan Implementation of Seaports (Utilization Jeddah Port)	TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								The Port of Jeddah (Port) released the initial version of this Strategic Plan in 2006. It was developed by Port staff, along with input, as a five-year rolling plan designed to guide the Port's future development while keeping in mind the needs of our tenants, local community members and stakeholders, and the nation. This is the second update to the Strategic Plan since its initial release. While the Port's overarching principles - commitment to environmental stewardship, addressing tenant needs, goods movement, economic development, and security - have remained largely unchanged, it is important for us to adapt our strategies to meet the challenges of an ever changing local and global environment. The Port is among the world's premier ports and is a critical hub for global trade. This prominence brings with it responsibilities and expectations for the highest possible standards for efficiency, safety and security, and environmental leadership. The Port is the nation's busiest container port and part of the world's busiest port complex, handling 3.7 million twenty-foot equivalent units in 2013. Global trade and goods movement is Western kingdom of Saudi Arabia's strongest industries in terms of jobs and economic activity. The Port of Jeddah powers these industries, handling almost more than a quarter of the cargo that enters the kingdom of Saudi Arabia annually. Through the Port's activities, a lot of jobs are created in western kingdom of Saudi Arabia and over five hundred thousand nationwide. In order to maintain our position among the world' the kingdom of Saudi Arabia premier ports, the Port is continually addressing the demands for providing modern and efficient cargo handling terminals as well as transportation and infrastructure projects. Protecting one of the nation's most vital economic hubs is also an ongoing challenge. Finally, promoting a sustainable "grow green" philosophy and ensuring that we are the leader among ports in promoting environmental stewardship is a strategic objective of the Port. A strategic plan is a management tool used to improve the performance of an organization and outlines the organization's direction and priorities. This plan identifies the Port's twelve strategic objectives for the next five years. Each of the objectives identifies a series of an act or strategy intended to resolve a difficulty or improve a situation; a fresh approach to something that the Port will undertake to accomplish that objective. While these objectives are organization-focused and require the coordination of resources throughout the Port, each one will be championed by a bureau, and the divisions within that bureau, as this paper will contain.

J	Law, KK; Kamoche, K				Law, Kuok Kei; Kamoche, Ken			Re-conceptualising knowledge transfer approach A two-dimensional framework	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Knowledge transfer approach (KTA) denotes how knowledge is transferred from the source to the seeker in a typical sender-receiver communication framework. The selection of an appropriate KTA largely determines the success of knowledge transfer. However, the existing literature fails to provide managers and employees with a clear conceptualisation of what constitutes a KTA and how different KTAs are distinguished. This paper aims to address this inadequacy by developing a two-dimensional framework for constructing the KTA. A clearer conceptualisation of KTA can help managers and employees improve their knowledge transfer efficacy as they will know how to better plan the knowledge transfer process. Hence, this paper creates value for both researchers and organisations. Theoretically, the framework enhances our understanding of the construct of KTA as well as its operationalisation and reinforces the role of KTA in knowledge transfer studies. In practical terms, the framework can inform organisations of the strategic considerations they need to take into account when planning knowledge transfers, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different KTA choices.

One of such functions is the choice of intermediaries (carriers, freight forwarders, suppliers, service enterprises etc.) and, according to some specialists, it is a major strategic decision in management supply chains. The methods of choosing the logistic intermediaries are considered in many works, however, some questions remain debatable. The article discusses the analytical and expert approaches which serve as a basis to choose the intermediaries; along with it, in the article a comparative evaluation of choice expert methods is done: point-rating assessment, analytic hierarchy process and the general algorithm for selecting; the conclusions have been drawn about the applicability of each method.

J	Mahdjour, S				Mahdjour, Sarah			SET UP FOR GROWTH? - AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF GROWTH INTENTION AND BUSINESS MODELS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Business models; growth intention	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; WOMEN	What do growth-oriented business models look like? While several economic theories, such as the theory of the firm, are based on the assumption that firms aim to maximise their profits, past research has shown that growth intention is heterogeneous among firms and that many business owners prefer to keep their firm at a size that they can manage with few resources. This paper explores the relationship of growth intention and business models, based on a sample of 135 German ICT businesses. Following an exploratory approach, Mann-Whitney U tests are applied to analyse how different business model designs correspond with different levels of growth intention. The results indicate that growth intention relates to business owners' decisions regarding the provision of consulting services, the level of standardisation in offered products and services, the choice of addressed markets, the implementation of competitive strategies based on cost efficiency and of revenue streams based on one-time- and performance-based payments. Furthermore, the results show that growth oriented firms are no more likely than non-growth oriented firms to adapt their business models dynamically to changed internal or external conditions.

With production from fisheries unable to meet the demand, aquaculture is set to play an increasing role in seafood supply. Aquaculture started booming in the 1990s, just when the capture fisheries showed distinct signs of stagnation. The rapid growth of aquaculture and the rising demand have created challenges which researchers and the seafood industry must address through collective action to enable this sector to grow at the rate needed for a sustainable food future. Malaysia has identified aquaculture as a key economic area under its new economic model and developed mechanisms to achieve the targets. This requires knowledgebased developments and cultivating links between the academia and the farming sector in an environment that seeks solutions through innovation. It makes a great difference when institutions of higher education decide to spearhead interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research that has ingredients for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. This provides a platform for a link-up with the aquaculture industry and the traditional fish-farming community. The blending of modern and traditional knowledge and diversification of approaches with new perspectives focused on solutions will probably yield positive outcomes from a policy that supports new pathways for achieving seafood security for socio-economic welfare.

Development and application of a screening model for evaluating bioenhanced dissolution in DNAPL source zones	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY			English	Article						PCE; DNAPL; Enhanced dissolution; Reductive dechlorination; Modeling; Remediation	NONAQUEOUS PHASE LIQUID; SATURATED SUBSURFACE SYSTEMS; ENHANCED MASS-TRANSFER; REDUCTIVE DECHLORINATION; TETRACHLOROETHENE DNAPL; QUANTITATIVE-EVALUATION; CHLORINATED ETHENES; POOL DISSOLUTION; NAPL DISSOLUTION; TRANSFER RATES	In-situ bioremediation, a widely applied treatment technology for source zones contaminated with dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), has proven economical and reasonably efficient for long-term management of contaminated sites. Successful application of this remedial technology, however, requires an understanding of the complex interaction of transport, mass transfer, and biotransformation processes. The bioenhancement factor, which represents the ratio of DNAPL mass transfer under microbially active conditions to that which would occur under abiotic conditions, is commonly used to quantify the effectiveness of a particular bioremediation remedy. To date, little research has been directed towards the development and validation of methods to predict bioenhancement factors under conditions representative of real sites. This work extends an existing, first-order, bioenhancement factor expression to systems with zero-order and Monod kinetics, representative of many source-zone scenarios. The utility of this model for predicting the bioenhancement factor for previously published laboratory and field experiments is evaluated. This evaluation demonstrates the applicability of these simple bioenhancement factors for preliminary experimental design and analysis, and for assessment of dissolution enhancement in ganglia-contaminated source zones. For ease of application, a set of nomographs is presented that graphically depicts the dependence of bioenhancement factor on physicochemical properties. Application of these nomographs is illustrated using data from a well-documented field site. Results suggest that this approach can successfully capture field-scale, as well as column-scale, behavior. Sensitivity analyses reveal that bioenhanced dissolution will critically depend on in-situ biomass concentrations. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However there is a paucity of studies that investigate this topic with the lens of resource advantage (R-A) theory. In order to fill this gap, this study utilizes the under-developed aspects of RA theory to offer a conceptual framework that explores the antecedents of strategic stance of management team towards NPD, and consequences of this stance on the new product performance (NPP). This study also inspects the effects of environmental turbulence. The implications of this framework for future research on the subject of NPD are addressed.

Surgical interventions for nephrolithiasis in ankylosing spondylitis and the general population	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						Ankylosing spondylitis; comparative study; lithotripsy; nephrolithiasis; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; ureteroscopy	KIDNEY-STONES; MEDICAL-MANAGEMENT; PREVALENCE; REGISTER; CALCULI; TRENDS	Objective. The aim of this study was to estimate rates and type of definitive surgical interventions for nephrolithiasis in Swedish patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) compared to the general population. Materials and methods. This national prospective cohort study linked data from Swedish population and healthcare registries. Incidence rates and interventions for nephrolithiasis during follow-up in patients with AS were compared to general population comparator (GPC) subjects. Results. In total, 8572 AS patients were followed for 49,959 person-years and 39,639 matched GPCs were followed for 225,221 person-years. Mean age at study entry was 46 years [interquartile range (IQR) 36-56 years] and 65% were male. In AS patients with a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis during the study period, 29% (72/250) underwent similar intervention for nephrolithiasis compared to 24% (114/466) GPCs (p = 0.21). The incidence rate ratio (RR) in overall AS patients was 2.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.8] during a median follow-up of 6.2 years (IQR 3.2-8.6 years). With prior diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, the RR for AS patients compared to GPCs was 3.7 (95% CI 1.8-7.7); without prior nephrolithiasis the RR was 2.1 (95% CI 1.5-3.0). Increasing age [odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03], prior nephrolithiasis diagnosis (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.97-5.62) and atherosclerotic cardiac disease (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.03-3.91) were identified as predictors of intervention for nephrolithiasis. Conclusions. Patients with AS have an almost three-fold increased risk of surgical intervention for kidney stones, with similar management, compared to the general population.

J	Khoroshilov, Y				Khoroshilov, Yuri			An experimental study of signaling in auctions with a flexible reserve price	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE			English	Article						Takeover auction; Preemptive bidding; Jump bidding; Signaling		This paper presents the results of an experimental study of pre-emptive jump bidding in English auctions with a flexible reserve price. While one of the possible explanations for jump bidding is based on signaling arguments, the ability of the seller to adjust his decision to accept an offer based on the bidding history makes the existence of a signaling equilibrium questionable. This paper shows that the seller's ability to set the reserve price after observing the opening bid reduces both jump bidding behavior and the use and interpretation of opening bids as a signaling device.

J	Kokinou, E				Kokinou, Eleni			Magnetic properties of soils in a designated Natura area (GR4310010, Giouchtas Mountain)	INTERPRETATION-A JOURNAL OF SUBSURFACE CHARACTERIZATION			English	Article							HEAVY-METAL POLLUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL MAGNETISM; INDUSTRIAL-POLLUTION; FOREST SOILS; FLY-ASH; SUSCEPTIBILITY; FIELD; COMPONENTS; MINERALOGY; TOPSOIL	The magnetic behavior of the geologic formations around the Giouchtas or Juchtas Mountain (Mt.) in Central Crete, Greece, has been studied. The magnetic parameters (magnetic susceptibility [MS] and temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility) of 160 surface soil samples were interpreted based on available information (e.g., topographic, geologic, and historical) for the area of study. The soil samples have been collected from the low- and high-elevation regions of Giouchtas Mt. The low-elevation region, surrounding a north-south asymmetric ridge (strongly affected by the tectonic activity), is mainly covered by Miocene and recent sediments, whereas the high-elevation region is dominated by limestones. Differences in the spatial distribution of the MS and the thermomagnetic behavior of the soil samples indicated the strong influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on the geologic formations.

J	Steinbauer, R; Rhew, ND; Chen, HS				Steinbauer, Robert; Rhew, Nicholas D.; Chen, H. Shawna			From Stories to Schemas: A Dual Systems Model of Leaders' Organizational Sensemaking	JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP & ORGANIZATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						sensemaking; dual systems; intuition	AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP; STRATEGIC CHANGE; INTUITION; BEHAVIOR; COGNITION; JUDGMENT	Today's leaders face unprecedented complexity and dynamism in the external environment. Sensemaking provides a useful framework for understanding how leaders extract meaning from that environment; however, its focus on purely conscious processes limits its applicability. We revisit and overcome major epistemological and ontological arguments against reconciling sensemaking with other decision-making models. This allows us to propose a dual systems model of sensemaking by introducing unconscious sensemaking as a complementary process that supports conscious sensemaking. We propose that the plausible stories that result from conscious sensemaking lead to schemas over time through which leaders can unconsciously make sense of their environment. This dual systems model holds important implications for leadership scholarship, in both describing leaders' cognitive processes and how those leaders can utilize this improved model to better effect change.

J	Wang, CH; Lee, YD; Chou, HL				Wang, Cheng-Hua; Lee, Yuan-Duen; Chou, Hui-Lin			An Importance-Performance Analysis of Human Factors for Patient Safety Management Strategy	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION			English	Article						patient safety management; human factors; importance-performance analysis; medical quality	ENGINEERING APPROACH; CLIMATE; IMPACT	This study was undertaken to identify factors affecting perception of the importance and practice of patient safety management strategies among hospital employees in Taiwan. Importance-performance analysis enables management to evaluate and identify the major strengths and weaknesses of a hospital's key success factors. This work attempts to show the usefulness of an importance-performance analysis grid in evaluating hospital patient safety from employee perspectives in Taiwan. The authors identified a list of 19 items from patient safety literature reviews, and each item was rated using a 5-point Likert scale. Responses were obtained from 236 usable questionnaires. The importance-performance grid showed that nine items fell into the "Keep up the good work" quadrant, two items fell into the "Concentrate here" quadrant, six items fell into the "Low priority" quadrant, and two items fell into the "Possible overkill" quadrant. The findings suggest that the vision of the supervisor is necessary in order to better match organizational characteristics and enhance medical quality. The results are useful in identifying areas for strategic focus to help hospital managers develop patient safety strategies.

Using detailed qualitative and quantitative managerial data, we find persuasive evidence of the strategic use of performance information obtained from franchisor-operated outlets to reduce information asymmetry and enhance contracting efficiency for franchisee-operated outlets. We test whether the proximity of franchisor-operated retail outlets to franchisee-operated retail outlets reduces underpricing of quasi-franchise contracts. Our results accord with the proposition that information asymmetry reduces contracting efficiency and are consistent with our prediction that a manufacturer can reduce intrinsic information asymmetry by maintaining franchisor-operated outlets that are geographically proximate to the franchisee-operated outlets, and that this improves the franchisor's pricing of franchising contracts. We conclude that dual distribution reduces the franchisor's information asymmetry and increases their contract pricing efficiency.

This increased use is accompanied with several challenges requiring uniformly understood and accepted regulations. Developing such regulations requires the engagement of all stakeholders. In this manuscript we explored the priorities of various eHealth stakeholders in Uganda to inform the eHealth policy review process. Methods: We used a Delphi approach during the initial programmed plenary of a consultative workshop in which participants were asked to identify and post their topmost priority related to eHealth under one of the seven components of the eHealth environment as described in the WHO national eHealth toolkit. We used an additional qualitative analytical method to further group the participant sorted priorities into sub clusters to support additional interpretation using the toolkit. Results: The components of the eHealth environment ranked as follows with respect to descending number of postings: information services and applications (36 postings), information and technology standard (31 postings), leadership and governance (22 postings), strategic planning (21 postings), infrastructure(14 postings), financial management (2 postings) and others (6 postings). Conclusion: Uganda's eHealth environment is in the developing and building up stage (II). In this environment the policy and implementation strategy should strengthen linkages in core systems, create a foundation for investment, ensure legal certainty and create a strong eHealth enabling environment.

J	Bajracharya, B; Hastings, P				Bajracharya, Bhishna; Hastings, Peter			Public-private partnerships in emergency and disaster management: examples from the Queensland floods 2010-11	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Numerous international studies have corroborated the value of public-private sector partnerships in reducing vulnerability and building resilience to emergencies and disasters. This paper proposes a simple conceptual framework for public-private partnerships in emergency and disaster management that could be applied to research and policy analysis in Australia. The framework proposes three dimensions: sector types (public, business and community), partnership arrangements (legislated and formal to informal agreements), and partnership roles (strategic and resilience-building and response and recovery). This paper describes how the three sectors can work together under various partnership arrangements for preventive or responsive measures in emergency and disaster management. Public-private partnerships during and after the Queensland floods of 2010-11 are used to illustrate the relationships presented in the framework and to give a snapshot of these partnerships in Queensland.

Corporate strategy is plan by which organizations aspire to achieve organizational business goals. In recent times, project management is also used to achieve organizational goals by aligning project management with business strategy of an organization. This research is carried to explore the effects of aligning project management with business strategy on projects and organizations. Case studies were carried out in three organizations; one from public sector; one from private and one from semi-government organization. Results of this research revealed that alignment of business strategy with project management is beneficial for both organization and projects especially in terms of organizational growth and project success.

This recombination task, which we call integration, is a fundamental feature of many methods, both those based on mathematical formulations such as Dantzig-Wolfe or Benders and those based on heuristics. Integration may be implicit in mathematical decompositions, but in heuristics this critical task is usually managed by ad-hoc operators, e.g., operators that combine decisions and heuristic adjustments to manage incompatibilities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for integration, which is viewed as a problem in itself with well-defined objectives and constraints. Four different mechanisms are proposed, based on well-known concepts from the literature such as constraining or giving incentives to particular characteristics of partial solutions. We perform computational experiments on the multi-depot periodic vehicle routing problem to compare the various integration approaches. The strategy that places incentives on selected solution characteristics rather than imposing constraints seems to yield the best results in the context of a cooperative search for this problem.

This paper addresses the issues of how to effectively use a computer database system to communicate disaster management information and how to apply natural language processing technology to reduce the human labor for databasing a vast amount of information. The database schema was designed based on analyzing a collection of real-life disaster management information and the specifications of existing standardized systems. Our data analysis reveals that our database schema sufficiently covers the information exchanged in a local government during the Great East Earthquake. Our prototype system is designed so as to allow local governments to introduce it at a low cost: (i) the system's user interface facilitates the operations for databasing given information, (ii) the system can be easily customized to each local municipality by simply replacing the dictionary and the sample data for training the system, and (iii) the system can be automatically adapted to each local municipality or each disaster incident through its capability of automatic learning from the user's corrections to the system's language processing outputs.

J	Kudic, M; Pyka, A; Guenther, J				Kudic, Muhamed; Pyka, Andreas; Guenther, Jutta			TAKING THE FIRST STEP - WHAT DETERMINES GERMAN LASER SOURCE MANUFACTURERS ENTRY INTO INNOVATION NETWORKS?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						German laser industry; innovation networks; timing to cooperate; event history	INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; EVOLUTION; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; ADVANTAGE; SYSTEMS; ASSETS; REGION	Early access to technological knowledge embodied in an industry's innovation network can prove an important competitive advantage for firms. Surprisingly, not much is known about the determinants of their initial entry into such networks. We analyze the propensity of firms for entering the industry's innovation network and their timing in doing so. More precisely, we seek to shed some light on the factors affecting the length of the time-span between a firm's founding and its first cooperation event. We apply a unique longitudinal event history dataset based on the full population of German laser source manufacturers. Innovation network data stem from official databases providing detailed information on the organizations involved, the subject of joint research and development (R&D) efforts, as well as the start and end times of all publicly funded R&D projects between 1990 and 2010. Estimation results from an event history estimation model indicate that micro firms enter the network later than small or large firms. An in-depth analysis of the size effects for medium-sized firms provides some unexpected but highly interesting findings. The choice of cooperation type makes no significant difference to a firm's timing in entering the network. Finally, the analysis of geographical determinants shows that cluster membership can, but does not necessarily affect the timing of a firm's decision to cooperate.

J	Ngene, NC; Moodley, J				Ngene, Nnabuike C.; Moodley, Jagidesa			New drug regimens for HIV in pregnancy and a national strategic plan to manage HIV: A South African perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Antiretroviral; HIV; Mother-to-child transmission; Pregnancy; South Africa; Strategic planning	TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION; PROGRAM	In South Africa, new drug regimens (WHO treatment Option B) used to manage HIV infection in pregnancy and the national strategic plan on HIV have resulted in improved health outcomes. Among these outcomes are reductions in the following: mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV to 2.4%; maternal deaths attributable to HIV; and adverse reactions due to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The present article describes these new drug regimens and the national strategic HIV management plan, as well as their challenges and the implications of improved health outcomes. Such outcomes imply that further decreases in MTCT of HIV, and HIV attributable maternal deaths are possible if potential challenges are addressed and treatment option B + offered. A confidential enquiry into each case of MTCT is advocated to reduce vertical transmission rates to zero levels. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Schlenker, G				Schlenker, Gerry			The Discourse of Local Public Broadcasting Managers and Producers: The Speech Act in the Midst of Organizational Transition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES AND CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Habermas; Universal Pragmatics; Ideal Speech Situation; Public Sphere; Culture; Democracy		South Dakota Public Broadcasting (SDPB) under went significant structural and organizational transition in the 1990's. This historical study provides a description of the discursive activity of SDPB managers and producers in the midst of that change. It also discusses a number of structural and historical arrangements that appear to have caused contradiction and conflict. What follows is the transcribed discourse and speech act activity of a number of individuals involved in South Dakota Public Broadcasting including those in management, programming and production. It describes interaction during activity such as departmental strategic planning meetings, network reorganizational sessions, production meetings, interviews and Educational Telecommunications Board (ETB) meetings, as well as hallway conversation over the course of many months. Since Universal Pragmatics encourages attention to the representation of the external, internal and social worlds through language in the context of everyday life as it is lived (the lifeworld), these transcriptions provide substantive evidence for analysis of how reality is constructed by these local public broadcasting managers and producers in the midst of conflict and change. Universal Pragmatics assumes that the presence of such "de-linguistified steering media" as power and money can replace language as a mechanism of social integration and therefore have a "disintegrative effect on the lifeworld (Habermas, 1984, 343). My previous article (IJHCS 1(4), 2015, pp. 469-490) held that various steering mechanisms can exist within institutions like South Dakota Public Broadcasting and can influence the relationships within them. It suggested that Universal Pragmatics could be used as a methodology for analyzing institutional cultures. This work is the second of three articles in a process that will put that methodology into practice. The following historical analysis includes three segments concerning a time period during a year in which there was a resignation and replacement in the Executive Director position at South Dakota Public Broadcasting. This became a catalyst for total network reorganization. The three segments include (1) a six-month period following the resignation of the Executive Director, (2) the arrival of the new Executive Director, and (3) a three-month period following the arrival of the new Executive Director.

On the Sidelines: Social Sciences and Interdisciplinarity in an International Research Centre	WATER ALTERNATIVES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON WATER POLITICS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Social sciences; interdisciplinary research; international agriculture research organization; IWMI-International Water Management Institute; coupled human-natural systems; water resources management		This paper reflects on the notion of interdisciplinarity in the research for development sector from a specific vantage point, that of social science researchers at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). Drawing from first-hand experiences of doing research at IWMI, a member of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, and a series of interviews with former and current staff, we highlight the disputed nature of social science research within the institute and link it to major challenges to interdisciplinary research practice. For research managers and non-social science researchers, social science research has always been, and still is, central to IWMI's mission and current activities. Social science researchers, on the other hand, tend to think their work has progressively been sidelined from a core to a peripheral concern; they feel they are underrepresented in management and hence have little influence on strategic orientation. This reinforces a tendency to work in isolation and not engage in the unavoidable negotiations that characterise the workings of an organisation. The uneasiness felt by IWMI social science researchers is largely grounded in the fact that many do not share the view that IWMI's objectives and research practices are value-neutral and that the purpose of social science research is to add human dimensions to natural science projects rather than lead to knowledge creation.

High temperature oxidation kinetics of dysprosium particles	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Dysprosium; Oxidation; Kinetics; Gas-solid reactions; Rare earth alloys and compounds; Corrosion	RARE-EARTH; TB; DY; ER	Rare earth elements have been recognized as critical materials for the advancement of many strategic and green technologies. Recently, the United States Department of Energy has invested many millions of dollars to enhance, protect, and forecast their production and management. The work presented here attempts to clarify the limited and contradictory literature on the oxidation behavior of the rare earth metal, dysprosium. Dysprosium particles were isothermally oxidized from 500 to 1000 degrees C in N-2-(2%, 20%, and 50%) O-2 and Ar-20% O-2 using simultaneous thermal analysis techniques. Two distinct oxidation regions were identified at each isothermal temperature in each oxidizing atmosphere. Initially, the oxidation kinetics are very fast until the reaction enters a slower, intermediate region of oxidation. The two regions are defined and the kinetics of each are assessed to show an apparent activation energy of 8-25 kJ/mol in the initial region and 80-95 kJ/mol in the intermediate oxidation reaction region. The effects of varying the oxygen partial pressure on the reaction rate constant are used to show that dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3) generally acts as a p-type semiconductor in both regions of oxidation (with an exception above 750 degrees C in the intermediate region).

The employed instrumentarium is critical systems thinking, with its commitments to the critical awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each research instrument for tackling problems in enterprises, the improvement of managing complex problems, and pluralism - respecting different interpretations of problem situations and enabling the combined use of research instruments. The main finding is that SI can underpin the process of structuring complex management problems in enterprises in a scientifically based and practically useful manner. In a scientific sense, the important implication of the conducted research is that it contributes to holistic understanding, conceptualizing and managing problem situations in enterprises.

J	Allard-Poesi, F				Allard-Poesi, Florence			Dancing in the dark: Making sense of managerial roles during strategic conversations	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sensemaking; Strategic conversation; Managerial roles; Contradictions; Discourse	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; MIDDLE MANAGERS; IDENTITY; SENSEMAKING; DISCOURSE; POWER; DISPOSITIONS; REFLECTIONS; RESISTANCE; AMBIGUITY	This article explores how managers make sense of their strategic roles when confronted with contradictory expectations from top management. Relying on Edwards and Potter's version of discourse analysis (DA), we analyze extracts of conversations between a director and a team of managers as they strive to elaborate a strategic project for a large association within the social sector. Our research complements prior research on managerial roles in (1) showing that the sensemaking of managerial roles relies on the construction and contestation of scripted descriptions of the organization and its environment, (2) demonstrating how the managers and the director both contribute to the fabric of contradicted versions of the managerial roles and (3) how participants' will to power contributes to the "dance" observed.

J	Dasgupta, M				Dasgupta, Meeta			Middle level managers and strategy: exploring the influence of different roles on organisational performance	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The purpose of this paper is to explore how middle level managers contribute to the formulation and implementation of strategic decisions and to measure the influence of different roles on organisational performance. Discussions with around 15 middle level managers in an Indian Power Transmission Company helped to present a narration of various roles of middle level managers. 200 middle level managers from a few Indian public sector organisations completed a survey assessing their involvement in various roles. Central tendencies were identified and regression analysis was undertaken to understand the influence of different roles on organisational performance. It was found that the most prominent role of the middle level managers is that of an implementer and the role has a strong influence on organisational performance. The role of an entrepreneur emerged strong with respect to influence on organisational performance, hinting at the entrepreneurial mindset that is present in public sector employees. The study fills a gap in literature by measuring the influence of different roles of middle level managers on organisational performance in public sector organisations. The extant literature lacked similar mixed-method research.

J	Ganguly, R				Ganguly, Rajat			India's Military: Evolution, Modernisation and Transformation	INDIA QUARTERLY-A JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article						Military; India; evolution; modernisation; transformation		The Indian military is the world's fourth largest after the US, Russia and China. In the immediate aftermath of India's independence from British rule, however, it was hard to imagine that in the span of six decades, a poverty-stricken, fragmented and deeply traumatised country would emerge as a military powerhouse. How and why has this transformation taken place? Has India's growing military prowess resulted in a more robust and adventurist foreign policy, particularly within the South Asian region? What does India's rapid military transformation, particularly the Indian Navy, in the twenty-first century say about India's perception of threats to national security? In this article, I argue that the Indian military's expansion and modernisation has happened in phases, mainly as a reaction to threatening developments within the surrounding region, the evolving global strategic environment and the perceptions and decisions taken by India's political elites. I argue, further, that as India's military prowess and self-confidence have grown, Indian leaders have at times felt tempted to flex the military muscles, particularly in low-intensity regional conflicts, but not always with expected results. I conclude that in the twenty-first century, the Indian military, particularly the Indian Navy, is undergoing rapid expansion and transformation. This suggests that in addition to threats coming across the western and northern land borders with Pakistan and China respectively, India's security planners envisage a growing threat to national security emanating from the deep waters of the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.

It enables managers with the discovery and collection of facts resulting from both internal and external analysis. This analysis then becomes the foundation for strategy formulation. The process is not without flaws. It does not include any means of analytically determining the importance of factors or assessing the fit between SWOTS factors and decision alternatives. It is based mainly on qualitative analysis. This research's aim is to prioritize strategies by the integration of the SWOT and the factors analysis. The first phase consists of determining the SWOT matrix. The second phase consists of weighing and prioritizing the SWOT strategies. A two steps process is proposed; step 1, using factor analysis (Rotated Component Matrix) and step 2, creating a statistical method. The proposed is simple to use and applicable for organization. This method is applied to Avid Food Industry (a Persian food manufacturer) starting with 34 strategies that are consequently reduced to 13 applicable ones.

J	Kipsaina, C; Ozanne-Smith, J; Bartolomeos, K; Routley, V				Kipsaina, Chebiwot; Ozanne-Smith, Joan; Bartolomeos, Kidist; Routley, Virginia			Mortuary based injury surveillance for low-mid income countries: process evaluation of pilot studies	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Fatal injury; Surveillance; Mortality; Mortuary; Evaluation; Low-mid income countries; Injury prevention	ROAD TRAFFIC INJURIES; DEATHS; SYSTEM	Objective: Globally, injury is the fourth major cause of death and the third leading contributor to Disability Adjusted Life Years lost due to health conditions, with the greatest burden borne by low-middle income countries (LMICs) where injury data is scarce. In the absence of effective vital registration systems, mortuaries have been shown to provide an alternative source of cause of death information for practitioners and policy makers to establish strategic injury prevention policies and programs. This evaluation sought to assess the feasibility of implementing a standardised fatal injury data collection process to systematically collect relevant fatal injury data from mortuaries. The process evaluation is described. Methods: A manual including a one page data collection form, coding guide, data dictionary, data entry and analysis program was developed through World Health Organization and Monash University Australia collaboration, with technical advice from an International Advisory Group. The data collection component was piloted in multiple mortuaries, in five LMICs (Egypt, India, Sri-Lanka, Tanzania and Zambia). Process evaluation was based on a questionnaire completed by each country's Principal Investigator. Results: Questionnaires were completed for data collections in urban and rural mortuaries between September 2010 and February 2011. Of the 1795 reported fatal injury cases registered in the participating mortuaries, road traffic injury accounted for the highest proportion of cases, ranging from 22% to 87%. Other causes included burns, poisoning, drowning and falls. Positive system attributes were feasibility, acceptability, usefulness, timeliness, and simplicity and data field completeness. Some limitations included short duration of the pilot studies, limited injury data collector training and apparent underreporting of cases to the medico-legal system or mortuaries. Conclusion: The mortuary has been shown to be a potential data source for identifying injury deaths and their circumstances and monitoring injury trends and risk factors in LMICs. However, further piloting is needed, including in rural areas and training of forensic pathologists and data-recorders to overcome some of the difficulties experienced in the pilot countries. The key to attracting ongoing funding and support from governments and donors in LMICs for fatal injury surveillance lies in further demonstrating the usefulness of collected data.

Platform-Integrated Cap and Trade with Renewable Energy Technologies	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						renewable energy technologies; cap and trade; green competitiveness	CONSUMPTION; TAIWAN; POLICY; INVENTORIES	Taiwan is an island country that is technological-innovation-oriented but has scant natural resources. Taiwan addressed the emerging policy and strategic issues in renewable energy development and carbon reduction. Those themes regarding how to enhance green competitiveness for enterprises were also emphasized in particular. In this study, we looked at the related concerns, at a country level. The Delphi method was applied to select the renewable energy that meets the requirements of the environmental, economic, and energy policy goals of Taiwan. Conversely, a cooperation platform was designed to integrate the mechanism of C&T and suggested renewable energy technologies. Besides, a SWOT analysis was used to elaborate on and verify the empirically functioning aspects of the platform design. The goal of this platform is to create a new and appropriate energy business model to commercialize suitable renewable energy technologies and provide incentives in facing its energy and economic dilemmas.

IOKSS in the health sector can be very crucial and results in several operational, strategic, social and economic benefits for healthcare providers and physicians. Previous research on inter-organizational systems (IOS) has focused on organizational adoption, particularly on vertically-linked organizations. Identifying major issues that are critical to physicians, the end users and key stakeholders, is crucial for IOKSS deployment. Based on data collected from physicians in Oman, results indicated that peers, the sector and knowledge workers, are critical factors to physicians' attitudes toward IOKSS. The study also indicated that physicians' attitudes were positively associated with their intention to share implicit, explicit, exploratory and exploitive knowledge. These results are valuable for organizational designing, planning and decision-making regarding their adoption of IOKSS in the health sector.

Exploration of D1/D2 domain of large-subunit ribosomal DNA for specific detection of Sclerotium rolfsii by polymerase chain reaction assay	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Early detection; Molecular diagnosis; Phytopathogen; Elephant foot yam	PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; ATHELIA-ROLFSII; DIVERSITY	Collar rot disease of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius caused by Sclerotium rolfsii is an important disease existing in all Amorphophallus growing areas. The pathogen propagules present in soil and planting material form key basis of inoculum. This study presents the aptness of D1/D2 domain of large-subunit ribosomal DNA (rDNA-LSU) for PCR based detection of S. rolfsii. The detection limit of conventional PCR was 10 pg and that of nested PCR was 100 fg of pathogen DNA. The designed primer was found to be highly specific and could be used for accurate identification of pathogen up to the species level. The protocol was standardized for detection of the pathogen in artificially and naturally infected field samples. The PCR-based method developed here could be used for both disease diagnosis and pathogen monitoring, as well as in guiding plant disease management.	[Pravi, V.; Jeeva, M. L.; Archana, P.

J	Wang, DQ; Tang, O; Zhang, LH				Wang, Daqin; Tang, Ou; Zhang, Lihua			A note on the rationing policies of multiple demand classes with lost sales	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Inventory rationing; Multiple demand classes; Lost sales		We study inventory rationing in a system with multiple demand classes and lost sales. It is assumed to have at most one outstanding order, resulting in two periods in an order cycle separated by the time of order release. We review the most related work by Melchiors (2001,2003) (Ph.D. thesis, University of Aarhus, Int. J. Prod. Econ. 81-82, (11), 461-468), and find that the existing approximated and optimal policies are not easy to obtain due to computational complexity. Also as the rationing issue before order release is not well addressed in literature, in this paper we prove the static rationing being optimal. Furthermore in such a system with two distinct periods, the optimal rationing policy is a combination of a dynamic policy during the replenishment lead time and a static policy before order release. In order to make the rationing policies to be readily used in practice, we introduce two approximated methods for calculating the rationing levels in two periods, respectively. The results, in particular the combination of static and dynamic rationing, outperform the existing approximations in literature. In addition, the computation is obviously simplified due to the efficient algorithm of dynamic rationing and the explicit expressions of static rationing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The prevalence of allergen sensitization and allergic diseases in Zhejiang Province of China is high and improving the medical services for these diseases is critically needed. Objective: To investigate the working status of the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases, including doctor resources, diagnostic methods, and allergen-specific immunotherapy in patients of Zhejiang Province, and to provide instructions for the strategic development of subspecialties of allergic diseases. Methods: First we defined the doctors who treat allergic diseases, and designed a comprehensive questionnaire to collect personal and hospital information for these doctors. The questionnaires were distributed to hospitals with different ranks and from different areas in the province. The general condition of doctor's resources, carryout of diagnostic methods, and allergen-specific immunotherapy were described and variations in the different specialties, hospitals, and areas were further analyzed. Results: Doctors in their thirties with bachelor's degrees were the mainstream for diagnosing and treating allergic diseases. The main specialties of the doctor resources were the specialties of Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT), Respirology, Pediatrics, and Dermatology. The Pediatrics specialty had a more reasonable infrastructure of doctor resources with more young doctors working in this subspecialty. The development of allergy subspecialty varied within hospitals at different levels or from different areas. The carryout of the skin prick test (SPT), serum specific IgE (ssIgE), and subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) was best performed in provincial hospitals, while sublingual imnnunotherapy (SLIT) was prescribed most commonly in municipal hospitals. The performance of SPT and ssIgE in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Wenzhou areas was much better than that in other places. The performance of SCIT and SLIT was best in Wenzhou. Conclusions: Our survey revealed a very initial and unbalanced development for the allergy subspecialty in Zhejiang Province. Doctor resources for allergic diseases were mainly from the specialties of ENT, Respirology, and Pediatrics, and the performance of diagnosis and treatment was mainly focused on provincial and municipal hospitals. Continuous education of allergies could be extended to primary healthcare centers and more efforts should be directed to those areas with poor medical resources.

Effective and faster separation of impurities from the drug products was achieved on a sub-2 mu m fused core particle C8 column (150mmx4.6mm i.d.) using water and acetonitrile as mobile phase in gradient pump mode. Flow rate was selected 1.0mL/min with a detection quantification wavelength of 230nm. The calibration curve obtained from linearity data (r>0.995) in the relevant ranges (up to 150% of the expected concentration of the analytes in the test concentration), accuracy (>95% recovery for the impurities of respective analytes), method precision and intermediate precision (RSD<5.0%), specificity (purity is less than purity threshold for all potential impurities present in respective drug components), and method robustness parameters were evaluated, and system suitability parameters were determined. The validated HPLC method was successfully applied to the quantification of impurities in Norgestimate and Ethinyl estradiol tablets helping to improve quality control and to assure therapeutic efficacy.

J	Papulova, Z; Papula, J				Papulova, Zuzana; Papula, Jozef			Conscious Thinking as an Approach to Strategic Analysis	JOURNAL OF ORGANISATIONAL STUDIES AND INNOVATION			English	Article						Strategic Analysis; Conscious Thinking; Creativity; Intuition		This article deals with the area of strategic management and strategic analysis. The main focus of our study is to find the links between the theory of human thinking and improvement of thinking and theory of strategic analysis. We try to examine how approach to thinking can support better performance and outcome of strategic analysis. In strategic management as well as in strategic analysis, the key elements are future orientation and preparation for the future. However, to perform a strategic analysis is not an easy subject and in the current dynamic environment it is very difficult to predict and forecast future developments. As a research team at our faculty, we have been studying development of strategic analysis and its possibilities for improvement. Our main aim is not only to develop new analytical methods and techniques, but more importantly, to search for the possibilities and the capabilities of human thinking involvement in strategic analysis. The main purpose of this article is to understand and examine the ways of thinking and approaches to thinking in relation to strategic analysis. In the research we examined the behaviour and the thinking of managers while they perform strategic analysis and make strategic decisions. We used interviews and questionnaires within a qualitative approach to understand and identify approaches to thinking of managers and find the approach to thinking that can ensure success in current praxis. The results of research point out that conscious thinking and creative thinking are necessary approaches to strategic analysis in current praxis. The outcome of research also shows the need of current managers and also the space for improvement of strategic management theory in strategic analysis.

Perceptions of international strategic moves: Saudi Arabia versus the United States	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							NATIONAL CULTURE; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; ORIENTATION; CHOICE; IMPACT	Competitive strategy is one of the most important activities that top management team members can undertake. In the global marketplace perceptions of strategic moves and plausible foreign markets to enter can vary based on cultural differences, economic conditions and past experiences. In this study we match the Miles and Snow strategic orientations with possible entry into different foreign markets. An in-depth survey of strategic orientation perceptions is developed and, based on a two-country research design, we obtain responses from 89 individuals from The United States and Saudi Arabia. A review of literature related to strategic orientation and cultural differences is performed and results suggest differences in perceptions of strategic preference and rating of promising foreign markets between the two national cohort groups. Three salient hypotheses are tested and supported related to topics such as where individuals prefer to invest, cultural distance and economic systems. Our differentiating contributions are (a) methodological, we use survey data rather than archival firm data as well as vignettes, and (b) theoretical, we assess managerial perceptions of foreign entry choice as opposed to firm level decisions. Managerial and future research implications are also discussed.	[Robertson, C. J.] Northeastern Univ, Int Business & Strategy Grp, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yaghmour, M.

J	Adetiloye, T; Pervez, G				Adetiloye, Taiwo; Pervez, Gul			A Macro and Micro-Level Evaluation of Stakeholders' Collaboration for Sustainable City Logistics Operations	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						city logistics; collaboration planning; goods distribution; sustainability; stakeholder		City logistics involves movement of city goods in urban areas respecting the municipal and administrative guidelines. The key goals of city logistics planning are maximizing vehicle movement and utilization, while minimising vehicle emissions and traffic congestion. Collaboration is vital to managing city logistics operations efficiently. Collaboration can take place in the form of goods consolidation, sharing of resources, information sharing, and so on. Two categories of models are proposed to evaluate these collaboration strategies. At the macro level, we present the collaboration matrix model; and at the micro level, we present the operational level model. The macro-level model focuses on the strategic decision making process necessary for stakeholders' collaboration given the socio-cultural characteristics, economic, and environmental constraint factors, while the micro-level model applies the collaboration decision-making criteria derived from the macro-level analytic result to improve the activities of the city logistics operators. Results of the computational testing of our methodology on vehicle selection, goods to vehicle assignment, goods distribution and environmental impact assessment are discussed, showing that the collaboration strategies of stakeholders, if optimized, can improve city logistics operations. The proposed work is novel and has strong practical applicability for logistics planners and decision makers in planning right collaboration strategies for sustainable city logistics operations.

J	Lehmann, TC; Rolfsen, JA; Clark, TD				Lehmann, Todd C.; Rolfsen, James A.; Clark, Terry D.			Predicting the trajectory of the evolving international cyber regime: Simulating the growth of a social network	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Cyber security; Regime theory; Constructivism; Agent-based models	CONFLICT; ORGANIZATIONS; SELECTION; INTERDEPENDENCE; CONSTRUCTIVISM; COOPERATION; COEVOLUTION; ALLIANCES; SECURITY	This paper presents an agent-based model of regime growth. States and the relations comprising a regime are conceptualized as social networks. Regime growth is understood as the addition of ties between states as they agree to work with one another. These ties are added as a result of the interaction between state behavior and the structure of their relations. We apply the model to the emerging cyber security regime. Based on reasonable assumptions of the nature of the current international system, the model predicts a bi-polar structure pitting two distinct blocs led by the two states with the greatest capacity to conduct cyber conflict. However, if states either place increasing emphasis on the benefits of trade or if the more materially powerful seek greater cooperation among themselves, linkages will develop across the two blocs.

J	Moreira, MF; de Vargas, ER				Moreira, Marina Figueiredo; de Vargas, Eduardo Raupp			Innovation Induction in Services: Public Procurement for Innovation or Procurement of Innovations?	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Innovation in services; Public procurement; Procurement for innovation; Innovation induction; Software services		This study aims at investigating the connection between public hiring of software services by federal government and the emergence of innovations in developing companies under the theoretical premise of procurement for innovation. We adopt an integrated approach to the study of innovation in service economies and use the Chain-Linked-Model to understand the induction process. It consists of a multiple cases study with ten units of analysis. Data has been collected by semi-structured interviews carried out with strategic and technical professionals. Innovations have been identified in three stages: pre-sales, service provision and after-sales. Thematic coding has been used to build categories for the analysis evidences. The results indicate the emergence of innovations despite the lack of governmental intentionality for its induction, contrary to the theoretical premise of using procurement for innovation. The identified innovative solutions proved to be more focused on meeting client's bureaucratic parameters than on creating economic benefit or on generating unprecedented solutions. Such fact restricts innovations dissemination on the market and limits its application to the governmental sphere.				marinamoreira.adm@gmail.com; raupp.vargas@gmail.com	de Vargas, Eduardo Raupp/C-7901-2013	de Vargas, Eduardo Raupp/0000-0001-7510-2560			BARRAS R, 1986, RES POLICY, V15, P161, DOI 10.1016/0048-7333(86)90012-0; Binks J., 2006, USING PUBLIC PROCURE; BIRKLAND TA, 2005, INTRO POLICY PROCESS; BRASIL, 2003, DIRETRIZES POLITICA; Buera FJ, 2012, AM ECON REV, V102, P2540, DOI 10.1257/aer.102.6.2540; Diegues A.

EVALUATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 39 SUBJECTS DEFINED BY THE GLOBAL FORUM FOR MAINTENANCE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The Global Forum on Maintenance and Asset Management (GFMAM) was formed in 2011 to bring together various experts, practitioners, academics, and other professionals who are active in the field of asset and maintenance management. The primary mission of GFMAM is to develop and promote knowledge, standards, and education for the maintenance and asset management professions. To fulfil this mission, GFMAM developed an 'Asset Management Landscape' document, which defines 39 subjects on asset management, grouped into six main subject areas. This paper reports on two surveys that were conducted to determine the importance of the 39 asset management subjects. Respondents were requested to rate the importance of each of the 39 subjects on a five-point scale. Results from the survey indicated that the five most important subjects are 'asset management strategy and objectives', 'asset management policy', 'strategic planning', 'asset management planning', and 'asset management leadership'.

Web-Based Decision Support for E-Business Strategies: A Balanced Scorecard Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Decision-making support system; e-business strategic management; balanced scorecard; e-business balanced scorecard framework; DMSS	SYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; TECHNOLOGY; EVOLUTION; DESIGN; MODEL	This paper describes the design and proof of concept of a web-based e-business decision-making support system (EBDMSS), to deliver a balanced scorecard (BSC)-based modeling and analysis in support of e-business strategic management. EBDMSS is designed, built and validated through a conceptual design research method. Its design is theoretically underpinned in three DMSS design schemes: an e-business BSC (EBBSC) framework for decision-making process (DMP), a DMSS architecture, and a DMSS design-evaluation framework. The EBBSC scheme aims to support e-business managers during the business strategy making process in a comprehensive, integrated, and continuous manner. The DMSS architecture and the DMSS designevaluation frameworks help to deliver the expected design capabilities of an integrated DMSS. The paper reports related literature review, conceptual design methodology and principles, EBDMSS design and prototype implementation, and illustrates how practitioners can use this system to deliver a valuable range of embodied e-business strategy expertise in support of real-time decision making. The paper concludes with limitations of design, implementation and validation, recommendations for further research, and conclusions.

Reflecting on the efficacy of cognitive mapping for decision-making in intellectual disability care: a case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						resource planning; stakeholder participation; cognitive mapping; SODA; intellectual disability care	SYSTEMS THINKING; MAPS; SERVICES; DYNAMICS; ISSUES	The central aspect of this study is a set of reflections on the efficacy of soft operational research techniques in understanding the dynamics of a complex system such as intellectual disability (ID) care providers. Organizations providing services to ID patients are complex and have many interacting stakeholders with often different and competing interests. Understanding the causes for failures in complex systems is crucial for appreciating the multiple perspectives of the key stakeholders of the system. Knowing the factors that adversely affect delivery of a patient-centred care by ID provider organizations offers the potential for identifying more effective resource-allocation solutions. The authors suggest cognitive mapping as a starting point for system dynamics modelling of optimal resource-allocation projects in ID care. The application of the method is illustrated via a case study in one of the ID care providers in the Netherlands. The paper discusses some of the practical implications of applying problem-structuring methods that support gathering feedback from vulnerable service users and front-line workers. The authors concluded that cognitive mapping technique can assist the management of healthcare organizations in strategic decision-making. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Needless to say that education goes identical with development. We have a large number of marginal people in different sector and region. Tea garden workers are one of them who are working silently for the improvement of the nation but they are not getting any educational degree in spite of their noble intention. Most of them are illiterate. Even they cannot make simple calculation of their household. Moreover, tea garden worker are low paid. About 56 percent labor work six days and 23 percent in seven days in a week but most of them are paid monthly less than 2500 taka for each. Yet they (63 percent) want to study again though they face financial problem (77 percent) and rest of them say about communication problem, unavailability of schools, adjustment problem with the schedule of the school, unwillingness of the authority and limited scope for the aged and dropped. Few of them claim against the management authority who often reluctant to give any chance for their betterment. It is impossible for them to avail conventional education. Resultantly it seems that only education through open and distance learning will be effective for them. In this study, it will endeavor to explore strategic issues and prospects of Open and Distance Learning (ODL) provided by Bangladesh Open University for the tea garden worker in the different regions of Bangladesh.

J	Shih, MS				Shih, Mei-Shu			Roles of contract research organizations in translational medicine	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRANSLATION			English	Article						collaboration; CROs; EBIS; paradigm shift; translational medicine	CHINA	Transitional medicine/science is shifting the medical research paradigm from compound-based to evidence-based drug/device discovery. It is increasing interdisciplinary collaborations, enhancing usage of advanced technologies, and facilitating therapeutics reaching patients faster. The fundamental theme of evidence-based discovery is to apply what is revealed in preclinical experimentation and to bring the resulting safety and efficacy to clinics. In the medical fields, a contract research organization (CRO) works like a hired agent who has corresponding knowledge and experience to conduct and complete tasks for a sponsor. The relationship is business, and the contract is for deliverables. The increasingly high volume of sponsored outsourcing work has made this for-profit business boom in the past decade. Location boundaries are being blurred under globalization in the sciences and cross-border regulatory reviews. Getting from bench to bedside is a winding road with many obstacles and high hurdles. Efficient teamwork becomes essential to materialize ideas and bring them to the market. The professionals within team communities include drug/device makers and CROs. It has become increasingly obvious that CROs play pivotal roles in the chain of discovery/design, developing product to market through in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo testing during preclinical experimentations and clinical trials. Project management teams are responsible for nurturing the materialization in a collaborative manner and enhancing the productivity of the pipelines. CROs have many functional aspects and specialties, and no one organization is fully capable of serving, i.e., integrated services, with expertise in each step of the chain to the needs of a variety of sponsors. Instead of competition among the CROs themselves, the continuously expanding market demands can be shared by Expertise-Based Integrated Services among allied CROs, in contrast to the few large CROs. Empirically, the data generated from the chosen CROs should meet the regulatory requirements for approval. A quality assurance unit from the sponsor should be vigilant in performing audits and inspections of the candidate CROs prior to contracting. Subsequently, close monitoring and well-organized project management guard the path to the successful filing of the applications. A strategic alliance of translational medicine with CROs ensures proven therapeutics for disease treatment and prevention to be connected with patient populations in a timely and cost-effective manner. The unbiased data generated through CROs' services can be used for a patient-driven approach in drug discovery and device control design. Thereafter, findings from the merged efforts can promote and complete the feedback loop for refining existing medicines and exploring new medicines. A matchmaking business may emerge and evolve from the procurement department of the inventor in translational medicine and the business development sector of the CROs to generate a new landscape in translational medicine.

Crowd-sourcing delivery system innovation: A public-private solution	HEALTHCARE-THE JOURNAL OF DELIVERY SCIENCE AND INNOVATION			English	Article						Innovation; Public sector; Private sector; Crowd-sourcing		We propose the establishment of a public-private approach which creates and maintains a "delivery systems innovations knowledge management system" to define, describe, and assess novel delivery approaches. The public sector could provide the foundational technology, resources and convening power for this innovations database. The private sector would contribute practical innovations that could guide annual strategic planning and implementation. A crowd-sourced effort would jump start delivery system reform.

To develop something that no one else can or do something on the cheaper, more economical way, it is a great competitive advantage. Innovations are being built and reviewed until the final product. Therefore, the management of the development of products is an extensive, continuous process that unites all people in the company to create a better and more comfortable new product that will be with its characteristics far better than the competition. If the new product has a good quality, it can be assumed its social recognitionand, and in product development a big role plays International norm ISO 9001: 2008, which aims to increase customer satisfaction by fulfilling its requirements.

The research is contextualized in the hotel sector in Spain using a corporate social responsibility approach as a theoretical framework of reference. The paper adopts an exploratory perspective and employs a qualitative approach. In particular, a multiple case-study is used to gain deep insights into a contemporary and complex issue within its real-life context, and three case studies are purposefully selected in order to be able to conduct cross-case comparisons. There are similarities and differences that reflect the status of implementation and formalization of the relationship with stakeholders in the three cases studied. There is agreement on the strategic impact of the relationship; however, at the operational level, the integration of stakeholders in corporate governance is found at different stages.

Business Strategy for the Technology Revolution: Competing at the Edge of Creative Destruction	JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY			English	Article						Business strategy; Corporate exemplars; Technology Revolution		This article presents an overview of the Technology Revolution and how corporations compete in an era of economic transformation. We draw on a state-of the- art forecasting system to outline strategic technological advances that are likely to enter the mainstream and their expected impacts. To better understand how to navigate this wave of change, we examine three corporate exemplars that have thrived by surfing the leading edge of the technology tsunami-Netflix, Apple, and Toyota. Then we integrate what can be learned from these cases into guidelines for technology strategy. Collectively, the forecasts, exemplars, and guidelines should help improve understanding of the rising wave of creative destruction and advance research on forecasting, technology, and strategy.

By using a structured questionnaire, the authors discuss perceptions of the banking sector representatives in BH regarding SME banking and their future plans for the management of credit risk associated with financing the SME sector. One of the main findings of this research is that the SME sector is becoming a strategic sector for BH banks and banks are willing to increase their involvement with SME clients. Authors also present results on current level of banks' exposure to SMEs, types of financial services offered to SME clients by BH banks, drivers of banks' involvement with SMEs, obstacles to further development of banks' involvement with SMEs. Based on the banks' responses and results of research conducted, suggestions to policy makers are given, such as tax reforms, interest rate subventions to SMEs, improvement of judiciary, simplifying administrative procedures. Also, some recommendations are given to banks, such as the need for better understanding the requirements of SME clients providing them more personal approach and creating a partnership, as well as lobbying the government bodies to change regulations governing SME sector.

In addition, we advance the empirical literature by integrating the managerialism of four strategic functions of prisons, employment and accommodation, capacity utilization, quality of life in prison and the rehabilitation and re-offending of prisoners. We find that by estimating multiple models focussing on these different areas some prisons are more efficient than other establishments. In terms of policy, it is therefore necessary to consider not just an overall performance metric for individual prisons, as currently undertaken annually by the UK Ministry of Justice, but to look into the administration and managerialism of their main functions in both a business and public policy perspective. Indeed, it is further necessary to view prisons together and not as single entities, so as to obtain a best practice frontier for the different operations that management undertakes in English and Welsh prisons.

Strategic management of discordant rapport in an African small business context	JOURNAL OF POLITENESS RESEARCH-LANGUAGE BEHAVIOUR CULTURE			English	Article						Linguistic ethnography; discordant; rapport management; agency; structure; small business discourse	HUMOR	This study demonstrates how and why interactants at a tyre fitment centre in Grahamstown, South Africa, manage discordant interpersonal relationships in strategic ways. Individuals in a post-apartheid small business respond to their social and economic context and exercise agency to their advantage in doing so. This study draws on linguistic ethnography (Rampton 2007) and the Rapport Management Framework (RMF, Spencer-Oatey 2000b, 2011), itself a development of politeness theory (Brown and Levinson 1987). An initial RMF analysis ran into difficulties around interactions that at first glance appeared to be oriented toward Rapport Challenge and Neglect. Upon closer examination, it appeared that discordant rapport was being actively maintained in this business. This led us to address underdeveloped areas of RMF that were not responsive enough to describe naturally occurring small business interactions, and propose an Enhanced Rapport Management Framework to overcome its inadequacies. We conclude that people may deliberately maintain discordant relationships when it is in their best interests to do so. Thus, contrary to a common-sense belief that harmonious social relations are an intrinsic good, we found that promoting discordant social relations can be understood as a rational response to individuals' social and economic contexts, particularly in conditions such as those in many postcolonial African societies.

For this purpose, a configuration theory logic is applied to the context of the political market; in particular, we develop strategic profiles (i.e. strategic postures and political market orientation) of four Belgian political parties represented in the Flemish Parliament. By comparing the strategic profiles derived from a questionnaire administered to 3148 party members with those of `theoretically ideal' profiles, we uncover the `strategic misfit' (or `misalignment') for each party and then relate this misfit to party performance. Results indicate that there is a strong, negative relationship between the misalignment of actual and perceived strategic profiles on the one hand and performance on the other. However, the `ideal profiles' differ with the strategic posture of a party. Thus, our findings show that it is not so much the strategic posture itself that will determine superior performance, but it is the strategic posture that the party aligns with implementing a particular political market orientation that is the most important factor.

J	Schilliger, LK; Seele, P				Schilliger, Laura; Seele, Peter			Company level localization and public affairs officers' educational background in Switzerland	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS			English	Article								As corporate public affairs officers have only rarely been researched in Switzerland, this study contributes a situation analysis of Swiss public affairs officers, their work processes, and biographical background to further fill this empirical gap. First, the existing public affairs research regarding Switzerland is reviewed, and research questions are derived. The research was conducted by sending out a survey to the members of the Swiss Association for Public Affairs, followed by personal in-depth interviews with 11 public affairs officers. The findings show that respondents work in organizations that employ 1 to 82,100 people are all Swiss nationals, and their departments are mostly called `public affairs'. The responsibility of public affairs is predominantly for senior or top management level, and the majority of public affairs officers report to the director of their department. The respondents are highly educated. Moreover, the paper asks whether public affairs is conducted in a strategic way by taking Fleisher's 10 elements as a conceptual basis. Results show that strategic involvement of their activities is rather low. Recommendations are discussed in order to increase the strategic involvement and advance professionalization of public affairs in Switzerland with specific regard for the political system.

J	Blundel, RK				Blundel, Richard K.			Beyond strategy: A critical review of Penrose's 'single argument' and its implications for economic development	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT			English	Article						growth; firms; Edith Penrose; economic development	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; FIRM; GROWTH; KNOWLEDGE; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; GLOBALIZATION; EVOLUTION	This paper offers a critical review of the 'single argument' that underpins Edith Penrose's, The Theory of the Growth of the Firm, which was first published in 1959. (TGF). It aims to complement and counterpoint recent examinations of Penrose's influence on strategic management, and on the resource-based view in particular. The paper examines six components of the argument, tracing their interconnected journey towards TGF's relatively neglected final chapters, which address the economic consequences of the growth of large firms. It also reflects on the implications for economic development research, with reference to Penrose's later critique of contemporary liberalisation policies.

J	Shi, S				Shi, Song			House price indices using assessed values statistics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						SPAR method; House price indices; AV method; Vertical and horizontal inequities; Assessed values	PROPERTY; TAXATION; MARKETS	This paper investigates tax inequities in assessed values and how these inequities in tax assessments affect house price indices using assessed values statistics. Using the unique rating valuation data from the top 10 cities of New Zealand during the period 1994-2009, it finds that house price measurements using the Sale Price Appraisal Ratio (SPAR) method have performed well compared to the repeated sales method suggested by Case and Shiller (1989) and the assessed values (AV) method proposed by Clapp and Giaccotto (1992). The presence of systematic estimated errors (both vertical and horizontal inequities) in assessed values posts a concern for house price measurements using assessed values statistics. In this situation, both the SPAR and AV methods benefit from the law of compensation of errors by using all transaction data. A policy implication is that the SPAR model is a good choice when using assessed values to measure house price movements at frequent time intervals, in particular for small countries.

J	Adomah-Afari, A				Adomah-Afari, Augustine			The challenges to performance and sustaining mutual health organisations/health institutions An exploratory study in Ghana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Efficiency; Risk management; Quality health care; Effectiveness; Patient perception; Finance/economics	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; INSURANCE SCHEMES; CARE; SYSTEMS; AFRICA; IMPACT; BARRIERS; COVERAGE; ILLNESS; SENEGAL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore challenges to the performance and sustainability of mutual health organisations (MHOs) and health institutions towards enhancing access to quality health care (HC) in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered through interviews and documentary review. Findings - Problems with late release of reimbursement funds for discharging with claims by the central government has impacted heavily on the financial and strategic management and decisionmaking processes of the MHOs and health institutions. Research limitations/implications -The lack of in-depth analysis of the financial viability of the MHOs; and the limited number of schemes selected. Practical implications -Recommends the need to ensure prompt release of reimbursement funds by government to enable the MHOs to reimburse claims to health institutions. Social implications - There is a perceived tension between the MHOs and HC institutions due to late release of reimbursement funds by the government. Originality/value - Contributes to understanding of how the NHI Act influences the operations of MHOs and health institutions towards increasing access to quality HC and financing.

J	Arthur, J; Rensleigh, C				Arthur, Joel; Rensleigh, Chris			The use of online technologies in the small church	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Background: The lack of consideration of the developmental opportunities that online technologies offer small churches in the 21st century forms the foundation of this research article. This article reports on a master's study which seeks to investigate whether small churches are aware of the opportunities generated by the use of online technologies. Objectives: This study was done to identify the current online technology usage and seeks to create awareness as to how these technologies are impacting congregation members in the small church environment. Method: A quantitative study was conducted in the form of a survey of four small churches in the Johannesburg metropolitan area to identify the current usage and the potential impact online technologies could have upon the small churches. Results: The study indicated that online technologies have a large role to play in the development of small churches and have the ability to increase the involvement of members in church programmes. Conclusion: It is clear that online technologies offer substantial benefits. Small churches should incorporate the opportunities associated with online technologies in their strategic plans.

J	Banerjee, PK				Banerjee, Probir Kumar			IT Pay-Off: Tracing the Antecedents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTERACTION			English	Article						Business Process Quality; Firm Performance; IT-BusinessAlignment; IT Pay-Off; Organizational Motivation	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY PAYOFF; STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT; QUALITY MANAGEMENT; FIRM PERFORMANCE; TQM; ORGANIZATIONS; MOTIVATION; INNOVATION; VARIABLES; INDUSTRY	In-spite of intense research, the link between IT investment and IT pay-off in firms is still not well understood. Differences in ontological assumptions and inconsistent measures of IT pay-off are observed in prior research, leading to fragmented and inconclusive findings on return from IT investment. Difficulty in controlling for confounding factors of time lag between IT investment and availability of IT systems and IT enabled business processes, effects of non-IT managerial efforts such as marketing and finance, convolute findings from prior research. This research draws from stakeholder theory, goal-setting and expectancy theories of motivation, IT/Business alignment and IS success theories, and quality management literature and proposes a model of IT pay-off that partly controls for some of the stated confounding effects. Attempt is made to empirically demonstrate through the model that IT pay-off is better understood by shifting focus from dollar value of IT investment to the motivation for and qualities of systems and IT enabled business processes structured with the IT investment, and investigating their impacts on process quality, operational efficiency and specific firm performance measures that can be related to IT investment. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

J	Basher, S				Basher, Syed			Regional initiative in the Gulf Arab States: the search for a common currency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						GCC countries; Fiscal policy; Monetary economic		Purpose - This paper aims to make two main additions to the literature on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) monetary union. First, it emphasizes that the creation of a fiscal union is necessary for the GCC monetary union to succeed. Second, it proposes some alternatives to pegging to the dollar, which would allow the GCC countries to absorb large swings in global commodity prices (oil, food) in the short to medium run. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses exploratory research to shed light on the feasibility of a common currency for the proposed GCC Monetary Union. Findings - Given the challenges associated with creating a GCC fiscal union as a requirement for a successful monetary union, the GCC countries could easily set up an "anti-crisis fund" to partially protect themselves from the economic and social costs of unforeseen crises. A basket, band and crawl (BBC) currency system, at an individual country level or a regional level, would allow the GCC countries to cope with not just large swings in global commodity prices, but also as an effective instrument for the governments to promote their economic diversification. Practical implications - This paper offers a template for the GCC central banks to consider the BBC currency system as an alternative to their existing dollar peg regime. Originality/value - This is the first paper that attempts to provide a formal argument in support of the BBC currency system as an alternative exchange rate arrangement for the GCC countries.

The effect of burnt soils on growth of Xanthorrhoea glauca subsp angustifolia (Xanthorrhoeaceae) seedlings in box-ironbark ecosystems, northern central Victoria	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; RESOURCE PULSES; FIRE; GERMINATION; FOREST; WOODLAND; ECOLOGY; SMOKE; HEAT	Seedlings of Xanthorrhoea glauca subsp. angustifolia D.J. Bedford (Xanthorrhoeaceae) were grown in burnt, unburnt and ash-rich soils from the box-ironbark ecosystem, northern central Victoria. Analysis of root architecture and the chemistry of leaves and roots demonstrate that burning improves seedling biomass development and acquisition of nutrients. An increased uptake of zinc by seedlings after fire is thought to be ecologically important and may infer vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. The early development of a secondary root system is likely to contribute to seedling survivorship. Given the observed high adult mortality after managed fuel-reduction fires, the importance of understanding and manipulating recruitment dynamics through an adaptive and strategic fire management of the remaining populations is likely to define the long-term survival of the species in Victoria.

J	Calantone, R; Molina-Castillo, FJ				Calantone, Roger; Molina-Castillo, Francisco-Jose			A search for theoretical plurality in new product launch	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						product launch; launch timing; new product development; cluster analysis; resource-based view; institutional theory		A previous absence of academic focus on new product launch behaviours and effects has been replaced by a spate of activity in the NPD commercialization process - always an eminent topic among practitioners, since it is the only NPD stage that actually returns cash. Naturally, academics seek theories and law-like generalizations to help understand new product launches in a research sense, as well as to use theories to help explain, predict and teach outcomes and concepts useful to managers, students of management and other researchers. The present manuscript reports the search for a theory base to explain some interesting results of new product launches in the biochemical industry. It has long been known that competing hypotheses lead to better conclusions; thus we attempt competing theories to try to contemplate better strategic thinking about product launches. Competing theories reveal that some may be superior in explaining results in this particular context, for this particular sample. Yet this study, with a single sample, really only demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. The adventure should continue from a meta-analytic basis to discover something of more universal value to the strategic thinker.

J	Cevher, E; Yuksel, H				Cevher, Ezgi; Yuksel, Hasan			In Regards to Higher Education Strategy, Assessment of Educational Activities in Public Universities: The Case of Turkey	EURASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Instruction; Organization; Strategic Planning; University SWOT Analysis		Problem Statement: With the increasing importance of information and research, the importance of education and training has also increased. Especially in higher education institutions, educators have started to instruct students in accordance with the requirements of the modern era, and universities have influenced the international and national competitive powers in the educational domain. Nowadays, universities in developed countries are not only the organizations that execute education and training services, but they are also the institutions that produce more academic studies to enhance their environments, contribute to society through their projects, and integrate with business and industry organizations. In connection with these goals the higher education sector can improve the performances of many universities and reconstruct them by changing and improving conditions. These changes can only be possible with appropriate strategies. Purpose of the Study: This study reveals the present situation regarding education in public universities and aims to determine strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Within the framework of Turkey's higher-education strategy, the current state of the universities is discussed and certain suggestions were made. Method: Considering that the main field of activity in universities is "training and education", the public universities in Turkey have been evaluated in this study via a content analysis of the strategic plans of "training and education activities". In total, the plans of 90 out of 103 state universities were analyzed according to a qualitative analysis. The dataset obtained was converted into numbers by means of the SPSS 15.0 program using frequency analysis. Results and Findings: Assessing the dataset obtained, one third of the universities stated that "maintaining a diversity of programs, enhancing social activities, achieving a close interaction between the students and academicians, and increasing quality and accreditation" were among their strengths. As for their weaknesses, "inadequacy of interaction with graduates; inadequacy of social fields; inadequacy of health, culture, and sport facilities; inadequacy of foreign language education; inadequacy of library opportunities; scarcity of graduate programs; inadequacy of psychological counseling and guidance services; inadequacy of scholarship support; scarcity of application-oriented studies; and inadequacy of educational material" were listed. Nearly half of the universities regard "exchange programs" as opportunities, and they focus on the "Bologna Process and Exchange". On the other hand, "increasing the number of public and private universities" is seen as a threat. Conclusions and recommendations: As a result of the study, the categories for strengths in the higher education strategy include "education field, social activity, life culture, and communication". The weaknesses mentioned by the universities, as stated in the higher-education plan, can be strengthened with the strategies involving "physical opportunities, communication, social activities, life culture, scholarship and part-time work opportunities, student satisfaction, and educational implementations".

J	Changchit, C; Klaus, T				Changchit, Chuleeporn; Klaus, Tim			An Exploratory Study on Small Business Website Creation and Usage	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN ORGANIZATIONS			English	Article						Demographics; E-Commerce; Electronic Commerce; Small Business; Website Presence		This study aims at exploring the factors related to the implementation of E-commerce websites by small business owners. While large organizations often consider E-commerce as a fundamental piece of their business strategy, small businesses place varying degrees of importance on E-commerce as a strategic tool to business success. Through a survey of small businesses, this study examines the creation and usage of E-commerce websites for small businesses. For companies with only a web presence, as well as for companies with an E-commerce website, the top two reasons for an E-commerce website identified by respondents of this study are to increase the profits of the company and to increase the market share. The study also found that factors such as lack of management support and costs greater than benefits were not detrimental to the decision to implement an E-commerce solution. Additional factors motivating small businesses to create and use E-commerce websites include the ability to better respond to customer demands and increased profits as a result of having E-commerce websites. This study contributes to the E-commerce literature by highlighting motivations of small business owners as they consider implementing E-commerce solutions.

J	Charlebois, S; Hughes, JC; Hielm, S				Charlebois, Sylvain; Hughes, Julia Christensen; Hielm, Sebastian			Corporate philanthropy and channel impact in food security The case "Nourish" by Campbell's Canada	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Canada; Food security; Channel relationships; Food manufacturing processes; Channel relations	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MARKETING CHANNELS; GOVERNANCE; INTEGRATION; SELECTION; ALTRUISM; BUSINESS; SUPPLIER; VALUES; CSR	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss how corporate philanthropy influences channel behaviour in the context of food security. Design/methodology/approach - The authors chose an exploratory case-study design to guide the investigation, based on Yin's (1994) argument that case studies are the preferred strategy when "how" or "why" questions are being posed, and when the focus is on a modern phenomenon within a real-life context. A survey study was focused on formal interviews onsite where product development and marketing occurred. Findings - It is known that the concepts of power and dependency are central to channel relationships. In food distribution, it has been argued that food distributors hold more power than food processors due to end-user proximity (Ruyter et al., 1996). For corporate altruism acts to have an impact when generated by functions other than distribution and retailing, one can only argue that channel members would require a significant number of antecedents to be successful. In Campbell's case, as shown in Table I, many became enabling to a successful outcome while others arguably made the project more challenging. Research limitations/implications - With food security, the authors would need to consider other relationships within the marketing channel. The macro-environment of the marketing channel could also be incorporated in a future study. This study also does not compare other campaigns related to a similar product. In fact, it is believed that Nourish is unique in that it is the first ready-to-eat, ready-to-ship food product which was developed with the intent to serve the greater good. Practical implications - Philanthropic acts by one company can influence other channel members when intent is driven by clear altruistic and politically strategic motives, and reflects individualistic and paternalistic attitudes. Campbell's was paternalistic but attempted to serve many causes at once. Committing to only one cause in the future may help consolidate resources and corporate energy around one single cause. Social implications - Corporate philanthropy describes the action when a corporation voluntarily donates a portion of its resources to a societal cause. Nourish's case is different in that it is not just a linear transactional gift between a corporation and an organization actively involved in the cause. The project relies on the active participation of other channel members, including consumers, to support the campaign led by Campbell's. It was a form of an extendable altruistic venture which allowed all channel members to contribute to the cause. Originality/value - Food processors that want to address the issue of food security or any other societal causes, domestically or abroad, will not cease. The challenge for food processors lies in the functional nature of their role within marketing channels. Since they do not transact with consumers directly, they depend on distributors and retailers to relay their philanthropic convictions to consumers. Based on the Nourish case, this study set out a series of antecedents which would support similar initiatives.

An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach was used to examine the critical factors affecting strategic collaborations in the container terminal context. Results reveal that cost is the most important factor, followed by efficiency, service, risk, and compatibility factors. The findings suggest that joint venture is the best strategic collaborations pattern in container terminal operations. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings for container terminal operators are also discussed.

J	Dasgupta, M				Dasgupta, Meeta			Role of middle managers in strategic decisions - a triad perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategy formulation; strategy implementation; strategic decisions; middle level managers; case study; middle management role; triad perspective; organisational performance; strategy process		Previous research has tried to bring out the critical role played by middle managers in formulation and implementation of strategic decisions. The current research builds and extends the typology of middle management role proposed by previous research. No previous study has tried to present a triad perspective to these roles. This research through an in-depth case study of an Indian power solution company has tried to present three perspectives, of top, middle and operational level management, of the role of middle level managers in strategic decisions. Although the paper suffers from the limitation of reporting findings from a single case study, it contributes to literature by bringing out similarities and differences in the mentioned perspectives. It also presents the relative importance of the different roles of middle level managers. The study serves as an indicator to the top management of the efforts to be made to include middle managers in different strategic decisions. It can also serve as a motivator to the middle managers by bringing out clarity in roles played by them.

J	Devine, A; Devine, F				Devine, Adrian; Devine, Frances			Government-funded event organisations - good and bad practice	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EVENT AND FESTIVAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Northern Ireland; Event tourism; Industry development; Institutional arrangements	RESPONSIBLE FESTIVALS; POLICY; INSTITUTIONALIZATION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how the structure of government-funded event agencies affected the development of the events industry in Northern Ireland. The institutional arrangements for two agencies which operated at different times in Northern Ireland were analysed. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 62 in-depth interviews were conducted with event organisers and public officials who had worked directly with these two organisations. Findings - The standalone National Events Agency which began operating in 1999 was found to be more hands-on and worked closely with event organisers to develop the quality of their event. As a quango it worked at arms length from government. Unfortunately it abused this freedom and used public monies to manage its own events, highlighting the need for transparency and accountability when managing this type of agency. In 2008 it was replaced by an Events Unit which was set up within the National Tourism Organisation. Under this structure event tourism and not event development was the priority. For the events industry this created development issues and reduced its clout at government level. Originality/value - This paper addressed a gap in the literature and found that the institutional arrangements did affect how a government-funded events agency operated and what it regarded as a strategic priority. This in turn had repercussions for the development of the events industry.

A Model of Global Cooperation to Enable Intelligent Metrology Applications by Means of an Integrated Teleoperation System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Advanced production industry; high precision metrology; teleoperation; telepresence		Today's advanced production industry faces challenges of increasing quality and competition requirements in the global market. The new aspects of cooperation between the production industry and metrology laboratories enable a development capacity providing an information highway and expertise exchange by accommodating rising demand of services. This paper proposes a novel approach to develop a global network on two different continents that will moreover be a model for the industry without any limits of location, time difference or facility. Due to the high cost of special infrastructure, equipment and expertise for production of complex components, this study also proposes a strategic approach to develop a remotely controlled high precision metrology system with high accuracy as well as with the smallest measurement uncertainties for the micro- and nanotechnologies and intelligent integrated management system applicable in advanced manufacturing industry. This will provide a roadmap for the industrial applications as well as in educational organizations with the developed and integrated low-cost telepresence and teleoperation system.	[Durakbasa, N.

J	Engberg, R; Horte, SA; Lundback, M				Engberg, Robert; Horte, Sven-Ake; Lundback, Magnus			Strategy implementation and organizational levels: resourcing for innovation as a case	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS-PEOPLE AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						Human capital; Innovation; Human resource management; Strategy implementation; HR strategy; Organizational levels; Strategic centre of gravity		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to further the understanding of the link between human capital and strategy across hierarchies. Design/methodology/approach - Using data on personality traits as a proxy for strategy implementation success, empirical data included 1,738 Operational Personality Questionnaire personality traits assessments in one large multinational firm. Respondents spanned from top-management to white-collar employees. Besides personality traits, measures include employment level and employment status. In addition, a total of 43 interviews were performed on the employee-level, with middle managers, with senior managers, and with executive-level managers. Findings - After a strategic shift, successful implementation of a human resource management (HRM) strategy decreased down through the hierachies. This has implications for a firm trying to realign its resources to a new strategy. If the strategic shift is large, this will pose a great problem as human capital further down in the hierarchy will not be aligned to the new strategy, but rather be aligned to the old strategy. Research limitations/implications - The findings are discussed using the concept of the strategic centre of gravity. The authors elaborate on the concept in terms of the origin, mass, and inertia of the strategic centre of gravity. Practical implications - A successful strategic shift in this sense will to a great extent depend on how successful the implementation is at lower levels of hierarchy, thus pointing to the importance to considering this when designing and pursuing strategic change. Originality/value - The research contributes to the HRM literature by furthering the understanding of aligning human capital on different organizational levels to strategy and by developing the concept of the strategic centre of gravity.

J	Gao, RZ; Zhang, ZJ; Li, A; Ran, C				Gao, Ruize; Zhang, Zhenji; Li, Ang; Ran, Chang			Gains and Losses from Collusion: an Empirical Study on Market Behaviors of China's Power Enterprises	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						power generation market; market power; regional market; collusion; cartel	PROFIT RATE; MONOPOLY; INDUSTRY	Purpose: Collusion is a common behavior of oligarch enterprises aiming to get an advantage in market competition. The purpose of the research is to explore positive or negative effects from the electricity generation manufacturers' collusion through statistical analysis approach. To be exact, these effects are discovered both in market economy at a macro-economic level and in enterprise behaviors at a micro-economic level. Design/methodology/approach: This research designs a model as an extension of Porter's model (Green & Porter, 1984). In this model FIML is applied. Taking price bidding project launched in China's power industry as an example, this paper conducts an empirical research on its relevant price data collected from subordinate power plants of China's five power generation groups in the pilots. Findings: It is found in this paper that power generation enterprises are facing collusion issues in the market. To be exact, it is such a situation in which non-cooperative competition and collusion alternate. Under the competition, market is relatively steady, thus forming a lower network price. It is helpful to the development of the whole industry. However, once Cartel is formed, the price will rise and clash with power enterprises and transmission-distribution companies concerning the interests conflicts. At the same time, a higher power price will form in the market, making consumers suffer losses. All of these are bad for industry development. Not only the collusion of power enterprises affects power price but also the market power that caused by long-time Cartel will reduce the market entrant in electricity generation. Market resources are centralized in the hands of Cartel, causing a low effective competition in the market, which has passive effects on users. Implications: The empirical research also indicates that collusion undoubtedly benefits the power enterprises that involved. As a cooperation pattern, collusion can lead to the synergy between relevant companies. However, collusion harms the benefits of other market entities. During the process of enterprises creating common interests cooperatively, collusion may bring harm to the outside industry. Originality/value: Using empirical research method, the paper takes China's power industry as an example to show the gains and losses of collusion from two aspects, namely market economy and strategic management.

J	Goben, A; Raszewski, R				Goben, Abigail; Raszewski, Rebecca			The data life cycle applied to our own data	JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION			English	Article							HEALTH-SCIENCES LIBRARY; USAGE	Increased demand for data-driven decision making is driving the need for librarians to be facile with the data life cycle. This case study follows the migration of reference desk statistics from handwritten to digital format. This shift presented two opportunities: first, the availability of a nonsensitive data set to improve the librarians' understanding of data-management and statistical analysis skills, and second, the use of analytics to directly inform staffing decisions and departmental strategic goals. By working through each step of the data life cycle, library faculty explored data gathering, storage, sharing, and analysis questions.

J	Gurel, B; Sari, IU				Gurel, Burcu; Sari, Irem Ucal			Strategic Planning for Sustainability in a Start-Up Company: A Case Study on Human Resources Consulting Firm	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Sustainable strategic planning; Start-ups; Balanced Scorecard; SWOT analysis	SWOT-ANALYSIS	With the increasing globalization, companies try to be more specialized on the market to become prominent among their competitors. This fact leads managers to recruit qualified and experienced personnel, which is an expensive and effortful process. Recruitment process has critical importance to find out the most adequate personnel. The most significant difficulty in that process is to find the right person in a short time period with a relatively small budget which requires a rich portfolio. Due to the difficulties in creating a rich portfolio and eliminating the candidates, companies prefer outsourcing human resources processes. Therefore human resources consulting firms have become more widespread to meet the needs of the companies on the experienced and qualified human resources. The purpose of this paper is to find out the primal growth strategies for a start-up human consulting firm to make sure the sustainability of the company. The paper utilizes extended SWOT analysis to determine primary strategies and balanced score card (BSC) approach to determine the best growth strategy with a real case study.

Beyond solar radiation management - the strategic role of low-cost photovoltaics in solar energy production	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						renewable energy sources; low-cost PVs; solar energy production		This paper examines the role of renewable energy sources (RES), especially the sun, as a potential solution for solar radiation management concerns. It states how photovoltaic (PV), especially low-cost PV and other thin film technology, can be applied and what impact and share they can have on the European market using the Cyprus market as an example of strategic implementation. The Energy Service of the Ministry of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism currently reports a 7.5% share (as at end of 2012) of RES in overall final energy consumption and suggests ways in which that share can increase. In the near future, PVs will be the most significant electricity source if the cost per kWh produced is further reduced, as was proven recently during the award procedures for PV systems.

J	Hidayat, R; Akhmad, S; Mu'alim				Hidayat, Rachmad; Akhmad, Sabarudin; Mu'alim			Effects of Environmental Factors on Corporate Strategy and Performance of Manufacturing Industries in Indonesia	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						environment; corporate strategy; performance and manufacturing industries	COMPETITIVE STRATEGY	Purpose: the purpose of this study was to examine and obtain empirical evidence of the effects of external and internal environmental factors on the strategy and performance of manufacturing companies. Design/methodology/approach: This study used primary data obtained by distributing questionnaires to 150 respondents of manufacturing companies in Indonesia spreading over six major cities in Java such as Jakarta, Banten, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Semarang and Surabaya. Samples were taken by using the systematic random sampling technique. The technique was used since those major cities had different numbers of manufacturing companies. Subsequently, the feasibility of the model was tested. Several indices of model feasibility would be used to test the model developed in this structural equation model. In case of a sub-optimal model, a model modification was to be performed by adding or removing paths so that the chi-square values would decrease by the values of the index. Findings: Results showed that internal and external environmental factors, through the operating environments and the remote environments of manufacturing industries, jointly affected the companies' understanding of the condition of the industrial environments to establish strategic goals in order to achieve optimal performance of manufacturing industry. Practical implications: The internal and external environmental factors through the operating and remote environments had effects on the strategy of manufacturing companies in Indonesia. However, both internal and external environments did not affect the performance of manufacturing companies in Indonesia. There was a tendency that manufacturing companies were to observe the occurring macro-economic conditions. Manufacturing industries were faced with the pressures from competition, customers and suppliers that affected companies' revenue. Performance of manufacturing industries was more influenced by macro-economic conditions that have not recovered from the global crisis. Originality/value: This study was conducted to determine the effects of environmental factors on the corporate strategy and performance. The effects of the industrial environments are crucial since the more complicated changes in the industrial environments the greater the impacts it has on the resources, structures and processes in the company. Environmental factors of the industry present both organizational strengths and weaknesses, which would affect the strategy and performance of the industry.

J	Hogan, R; Evans, JD				Hogan, Robert; Evans, Jocelyn D.			Does the strategic alignment of value drivers impact earnings persistence?	SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL			English	Article						Customer satisfaction; Corporate strategy; Earnings persistence; Employee relations; KLD	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MANAGEMENT CONTROL-SYSTEMS; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; STOCK RETURNS; PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; INTANGIBLE RESOURCES; ACCOUNTING EARNINGS; INFORMATION-CONTENT; MARKET VALUE	Purpose - This paper aims to advance the literature by extending the empirical relation between a firm's strategy and socially responsible value drivers (customer/employee relations) beyond firm performance to the impact on earnings persistence. Although existing research demonstrates that management's effective implementation of a specific strategic orientation such as cost focus or product differentiation leads to better financial performance, no studies, to the authors' knowledge, directly address the effect of strategic orientation on the persistence of earnings. Design/methodology/approach - This paper utilized the evaluation of a firm's focus on employee and customer relations through the rating provided by Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini. It uses linear regression analysis to identify statistically significant relations. Findings - The findings demonstrate that simply focusing on socially responsible employee and customer relations alone does not result in higher earnings persistence. But rather, higher earnings persistence is associated with firms whose strategic orientation is aligned with the firm's socially responsible value drivers. Additionally, we find that the capital market understands the importance of alignment between a firm's strategy and its value drivers. Research limitations/implications - The analysis was based on a large-scale sample, and the authors concede that as a consequence of this decision, the results are based on indirect assessments of the firm's actions rather than direct feedback from the firm. However, the authors believe the large-scale, external assessment that they use increases the generalizability of the results. Practical implications - The results provide guidance to management and boards of directors regarding the critical nature of disclosure regarding firm strategy and corporate social responsibility (CSR) as well as inform financial statement users as to useful relations beyond the actual reported accounting numbers. Originality/value - Existing research has explored the relation between CSR and improved financial performance, but no studies, to our knowledge, examine the relation a firm's strategy and value drivers (customer/employee relations) has on earnings persistence. Earnings persistence is worthy of study, as it captures the non-transitory nature of earnings, which is a useful attribute for both internal and external users of financial reporting.

This paper focused itself on the connotation and the fundamental causes of food security in food manufacture. Besides, it also established the food security guarantee system based on scientific outlook on development. Study on food security is related to economic development, political stability and improvement of people's well-being. At present, there are quite a number of potential problems within threatening the food security, including a lack of morality in food manufacturers, ineffective food supervision, and a lack of security awareness of consumers. The solution of these problems in food security lies in enhancing the sense of social responsibility for manufacturers, enhancing the government supervision, improving consumers' awareness of security and building a scientific safeguarding system and mechanism.

J	Hou, HY; Ho, DCW				Hou, Huiying; Ho, Daniel Chi Wing			RAPPORT AND ITS MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS IN FM SERVICE OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						FM service outsourcing; Outsourcing relationships; Rapport; Social relations; Relational governance	MAINTENANCE SERVICE; GOVERNANCE; OPERATION; FIRMS; LAW	In Hong Kong, client companies tend not to renew contracts with relationship partners and may change facilities management (FM) service providers on a frequent basis. This phenomenon is common in the FM industry. Inspired by the phenomenon of changing service providers, this study sheds light on a social relations perspective in outsourcing relationships and aims to investigate the factors that affect FM service outsourcing relationships. Open interviews with 20 FM managers were conducted, and the interview results were analysed with content analysis and coding methods. The empirical findings were interpreted on two levels. First, FM managers believe that rapport is an influential factor that affects FM service outsourcing relationships. Second, the courses in which the interviewees explain the manifestation of rapport and its significance reveal that common goals, shared values, trust, openness, and coordination are the factors that not only nurture the formation of rapport, but also have significant influences on social relations in the process of outsourcing. A framework has been developed to describe the conceptual relationships found in the empirical findings from the interviews. Eight guidelines have been outlined to indicate the managerial implications of this study.

J	Huang, S; Chen, GC; Ma, YA				Huang, Song; Chen, Guocan; Ma, Yanan			Online Channel Operation Mode: Game Theoretical Analysis from the Supply Chain Power Structures	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						supply chain management; power structures; online channel; game theory	PRODUCTION DECISIONS; DEMAND DISRUPTIONS; STRATEGIC ANALYSIS; PRICING POLICIES; FIRM PERFORMANCE; COORDINATION; ENCROACHMENT; MANUFACTURER; INFORMATION; CONTRACT	Purpose: Dual-channels have been widely used in practice, and the pricing decisions and the online channel operation mode choice have been the core problems in dual-channel supply chain management. This paper focuses on the online channel operation mode choice from the supply chain power structures based on game theoretical analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilizes three kinds of game theoretical models to analyze the impact of supply chain power structures on the optimal pricing and online channel operation mode choice. Findings: Results derived in this paper indicate that when the self-price elasticity is large, the power structures have no direct impact on the decisions. However, when the self-price elasticity is small and customers' preference for the online channel is low, then in the MS market, it is better for the retailer to operate the online channel, while in the RS market or in the VN market, it is better for the manufacturer to operate the online channel. Research limitations/implications: In this paper, we do not consider stochastic demand and asymmetric information, which may not well suit the reality. Originality/value: This paper provides a different perspective to analyze the impact of supply chain power structures on the pricing decisions and online channel operation mode choice. The comparison of these two online channel operation modes in this paper is also a unique point.

In 1970s, it begins to give emphasis on aspects such as land use pattern, infrastructure, Central Business District, Recreational Business District and impact studies. The literature expands to the aspects of socioeconomic, hotel development and resort lifecycle in the 1980s. Later in 1990s, it was extended to politic and investment, tourist behavior, transportation, Tourism Business District and environmental management. Following 2000s, the discussion move into change in land use intensity and restructuring resort strategies. All these aspects are still relevant in the existing literature today. However, it was argued that existing issue from these literatures cannot escape from too much emphasis on the physical aspects. Limited study given to the aspect of non-physical than theoretical components of space management for physical and strategic planning purposes. For example, the aspects of business expansion and entrepreneur growth, and as to how this is able to influence resort morphology. The Small tourism firm manages to sustain their present from generation to generation with increasing skills relevant to financial, personal attitude, business resources and networking, and abilities in terms of operational, managerial and strategic. Therefore, the characteristic of resort morphology should be seen in a different context in which the competitiveness and survivability of these small tourism firms is vital to explore.

J	Jia, WP; Li, WM				Jia, Weiping; Li, Wanming			Measuring China's industrial energy efficiency, both DEA and directional distance function approach at the provincial level	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						total-factor energy efficiency; data envelopment analysis; DEA; directional distance function; DDF; energy intensity; energy intensity efficiency	UNDESIRABLE OUTPUTS; EMISSIONS; REGIONS; PRODUCTIVITY; INTENSITY	Evaluation of the provincial industrial energy efficiency has recently attracted an increasing interest. A lot of previous researches were conducive to the evaluation of regional energy efficiency employing various types of DEA model. Using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and directional distance function (DDF) approach, this article constructs two models based on the total factor framework and analyses the energy efficiency and the energy-saving potential in China during 2008-2012; meanwhile, it combines partial factor energy efficiency and the total factor energy efficiency based on two models, and introduces the target energy intensity indicator measures the energy intensity efficiency of each province. The empirical study results show that in the target course of the study, east China is more effective than west and central China, thanks to the higher energy saving and emissions reduction in east China. The energy efficiency differences are significant among areas, and energy-saving and output expansions also have a great improvement potential. Thus, changing economic growth pattern from 'extensive type to 'intensive type' is still a strategic priority for a very long time in China.

J	Kastrati, V				Kastrati, Valon			Technological Innovation of Small and Medium Enterprises in Kosovo: Challenges and Barriers	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						SME; ICT; confidence; success; transition economy		the ability to innovate, is the main challenge in the fast changing global markets, to maintain a stable economic development in the long term. The ICT can carry strategic incentives to adjust the economic structure and to modify the economic model of a country. This process can build a resource-saving and a environmentally friendly society. The technological innovation can improve the international competitiveness of the economy and the overall employment rate of young generations. The rapid development of SMEs has become a major force to support economic growth of Kosovo. However, small and medium enterprises in transitional economies are not always trusting technological innovation. Several businesses due to multiple internal and external environmental factors, show a low level of confidence over technological innovation. In fact, from an internal point of view, the management can be afraid of security issues, like leak of strategic information, or moreover company secrets. The typical example can be the reluctance to adopt cloud technology platforms to improve the management tasks and operations. Meanwhile the external threat can be an overturn of the management style that threatens positions and hierarchy within the organization. This paper aims to analyze some key factors that prevent the spread of technological enhancement in small and medium enterprises in Kosovo. Some typical case studies will be analyzed and further policy recommendations will be suggested.

J	Keeble-Ramsay, DR; Armitage, A				Keeble-Ramsay, Diane Rose; Armitage, Andrew			HRD challenges faced in the post-global financial crisis period - insights from the UK	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Global financial crisis (GLC); Organisational learning capabilities; Weakened HRD	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FOCUS GROUPS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; EMPLOYEES; SUSTAINABILITY; PARTICIPATION; INVOLVEMENT; CAPITALISM; COMMITMENT; BUSINESS	Purpose - The paper aims to report initial empirical research that examines UK employees' perceptions of the changing nature of work since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) to consider how the financial context may have constrained HRD practice and more sustainable approaches. Design/methodology/approach - Focus group research was facilitated through collective group discussion. Through template analysis of the findings, thematic analysis was undertaken to extend prior research. Themes used by Hassard et al. (2009) in terms of the changing nature of the workplace between 2000 and 2008, were used to provide new data on HRD realities. Findings - Participants reported diminishing personal control over changes within the workplace and a cultural shift towards a harsher work climate. HRD was considered as silenced or absent and associated solely with low cost- based e- learning rather than acting in strategic role supporting sustainable business objectives. Research limitations/implications - Whilst providing only indications from employee perceptions, the research identifies a weakened HRD function. The key contribution of this paper lies with empirical evidence of post-GFC constraints placed upon HRD strategies. It further identifies whether alternative development approaches, mediated by organisational learning capabilities, might emancipate UK HRD. Social implications - This paper engenders a debate around the status of HRD within the UK organisations, further to the global financial crisis (GFC), where HRD might be viewed as at a juncture to argue a need for a shift from a financialised mode for people management towards one of greater people focus. Originality/value - This research provides initial findings of the impact of the economic climate. It considers new approaches which might resolve expiring HRD through more sustainable practices.

J	Khakee, A; Grassini, L				Khakee, Abdul; Grassini, Laura			Understanding multiple aspects of present space with the help of future scenarios: the case of Izmir, Turkey	FORESIGHT			English	Article						Decision-making; Environmental management; Democracy; Creative thinking; Governance; Strategic planning		Purpose - This paper aims to make use of participatory scenarios to assess the multiple aspects of space with the help of future scenarios. Design/methodology/approach - This paper makes an attempt to appreciate multiple representations of space where past and present experiences merge with future desires and concerns. With the help of one case study, Izmir (Turkey), where a vision of democratic city is developed, the paper shows how future scenarios can provide deeper and richer appreciation of present space, thereby challenging existing spatial practices. Findings - The participatory approach used in the development of scenarios suggests interesting implications to operationalise a more relational concept of space in real planning strategies. Research limitations/implications - The use of scenarios in strategic planning to identify future possibilities and to make stakeholders aware of uncertainties has been increasingly recognised in planning research and practice. Practical implications - The appreciation of the multiple aspects of space with the help of future scenarios would enrich the spatial planning practice. Social implications - The use of participatory approach to preparing scenarios enables participants to make use of interactive method in social and political discourses. Originality/value - The use of scenarios to examine various aspects of space that may be relevant in spatial planning has not received similar attention. The latter poses methodological as well as practical challenges for researchers. This paper is an attempt to do just that.

It is performed only in exceptional cases, ie. if this is the only way to save the cultural heritage object from destruction. In the author's opinion, translocation constitutes a specific type of economic project which requires proper management of its subsequent phases. Indication of the main features of such project and specify the stages of implementation, are decisive and perform a vital role in the efficiency and effectiveness of the undertaken translocation operations. Therefore, in this article, author will attempt to identify and indicate the framework of subsequent stages ( phases) and strategic operations in implementing translocation projects of historic objects.

In order to achieve the purpose of the study, an interview was carried out with a manager acting in the private healthcare sector while major political decisions about the future of the healthcare system were waited in the healthcare field. A sensemaking perspective was adopted as a methodological tool for analysing the interview data. Healthcare change is perceived as an uncertain and a constant change environment for the private healthcare sector. The social change is greatly impacting on the changes occurring in the companies. Our paper provides a way of understanding healthcare changes and furthers the empirical use of sensemaking as a method.

J	Lemmerer, A; Menrad, K				Lemmerer, Andreas; Menrad, Klaus			Customers' use of prices and internal reference prices to evaluate new food products	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Perceived quality; Pricing; New products; Customer value; Perceived monetary sacrifice	EXTERNAL REFERENCE PRICES; BRAND CHOICE; QUALITY PERCEPTION; CONSUMER; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; BEHAVIOR; PURCHASE; MODELS; IMPACT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the heterogeneous effects of gains and losses on the perception of new products. It seeks to argue that the heterogeneity in these effects (partly) stems from the price-perceived quality relationship which is more important for quality-seeking customers. Design/methodology/approach - A multilevel logit model was applied to household panel data on purchases of new yoghurt and sausage products in Germany. The multilevel model allowed to estimate heterogeneous price effects and accounted for the nested structure in panel data. Findings - Significant variation in the effects of gains, losses, and promotions were found. Internal reference prices (IRPs), which served as indicator of loss-averse vs quality-seeking customers, were found to moderate these effects. Monetary losses have less negative effects for customers with high IRPs. Negative interaction effects of IRPs with monetary gains and promotions indicate that quality-seeking customers are less attracted by gains and promotions. Practical implications - The heterogeneity in the price effects confirms the strategic importance of new product prices to influence customers' perception of value. The price-quality relationship is an explanatory approach for heterogeneous price effects and should not be neglected in price setting. The inclusion of customer-specific reference price information yields deeper insights into customers' use of prices to evaluate new products. Originality/value - This study is the first to estimate asymmetric gain and loss effects in the analysis of new product trial. A customer-specific view in price setting is emphasized by taking customer-specific reference prices into account.

J	Liu, Y; Yang, WS				Liu, Yang; Yang, Wenshan			Meteorological information service support system in wind park application	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Operations management; Decision support systems; Information management; Service operations; Strategic planning; Condition-based maintenance	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; OFFSHORE WIND; ENERGY; PREDICTION; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES; PROSPECTS; VALIDITY; TURBINES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a holistic decision support system based on condition-based maintenance which utilizes meteorological forecasting information to support decision-making process in services of wind power enterprises. Design/methodology/approach - A pilot conceptual system combining with meteorological information and operations management has been formulated in this study. The proposed system provides benchmarking to support decision making directly and indirectly basing on processing meteorological information and evaluating its impact on service operations. It collects meteorological data to predict failure probabilities in different areas which need corresponding maintenance service and schedule the optimal maintenance periods. In addition, it provides meteorological forecasting and decision support in case of extreme weather events (EWEs). Findings - The conceptual study shows that there is a connection between the meteorological conditions and failures, and it is feasible to make service decisions based on the predictions of weather conditions and their impacts to failures. Research limitations/implications - The research presented at the present phase is not much beyond a conceptual framework. The actual implementation and all possible related practical issues will be dealt with in future research.

The excessive increase in multiple messages copies often exhausts the network resources and deteriorates its performance significantly. To solve this problem, a mobility similarity-based routing (SBR) algorithm is proposed in this paper. On one hand, destination similarity is used to help the message carrier node find the appropriate relay nodes with the higher opportunity to meet the destination node in order to improve the delivery ratio. On the other hand, carrier similarity is adopted to avoid sending the same copy to the nodes with mobility similarity so as to reduce the number of message copies. Furthermore, inspired by the law of diminishing marginal utility in economics, a buffer management scheme based on the message transmission status is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed SBR routing algorithm combined with the buffer management scheme can improve the delivery ratio and has the lower overhead ratio compared to other routing algorithms.

Design/methodology/approach - The research analyzes the e-government strategic plans, based on a content analysis using a rubric consisting of 15 questions. Findings - The findings suggest that of the state information system plans reviewed - Michigan, Virginia, and Massachusetts are the most comprehensive. Overall, the state plans were effective in developing strategies and core beliefs, and assessing their strengths and opportunities, while less successful in recognizing weakness and threats. Research limitations/implications - This study builds on existing research examining strategic information systems plans in US states and assesses the extent to which each plan addresses established criteria for developing strategic plans. This study also attempts to fill the need for more data and empirical evidence in the development of literature in strategic planning and performance measurement. Practical implications - The research employs a public sector approach to strategic planning, and while the process is not specific to information systems it is comprehensive in its approach, grounded in literature, and offers guidance to public sector leaders in planning for investments in information systems and technology. Originality/value - The conclusion offers suggestions for both public administration practitioners and scholars interested in improving state strategic plans for information technology.

The hypothesis that collaboration with competitors has an inverted U-shaped relationship with goods innovation performance was tested using data on new goods introductions from 749 Iranian firms. The results support the balance between competition and collaboration by confirming that collaboration with competitors contributes considerably to successful goods innovation. The positive influences of co-optation certainly seem consistent with the cooperative arguments that collaboration with competitors increases absorptive capacity, improves information exchange and facilitates joint problem solving. The results also show that unnecessary collaboration with competitors can have a negative influence on innovation performance, raising concerns about opportunistic exploitation. The results support the existence of a bell-shaped relationship between co-opetition and goods innovation performance. Technological capability and alliances with universities were shown to weaken the relationship.

In this paper, we review the literature on these approaches, offering a guide for studies about the Brazilian multiparty presidential system.

J	Mohan, MD; Muthaly, S; Annakis, J				Mohan, Mohan Dass; Muthaly, Siva; Annakis, John			Talent Culture's Role in Talent Development among Academics: Insights from Malaysian Government Linked Universities	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT			English	Article						Talent Management; Government Linked Companies Universities; Academics retention; Partial least squares; Talent Identification; Talent Culture; Competencies; Talent Development	PLS-SEM; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the talent development antecedents in Malaysian Government Linked Companies (GLCs) Universities. Four key constructs were identified and analysed from the literature including talent identification, talent culture, competencies and talent development. Design/methodology/approach - The data required for this research were collected using a survey and online surveys sent to the three universities who participated in the study. A questionnaire was developed with 26 items adapted from previously validated scales. A non-probabilistic sampling procedure, i.e. convenience sampling, was utilised owing to the unavailability of a satisfactory sampling frame. Questionnaires were distributed to academics from three GLCs-Universiti Tenaga Malaysia (UNITEN), Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP) and Multimedia University of Malaysia (MMU). A total of 300 questionnaires were submitted to the GLC universities, of which 168 surveys were completed and deemed useable for data processing. Findings - The research findings revealed that talent culture plays a significant mediating role in talent identification and competencies towards talent development in retaining competent academics in Malaysian GLCs universities. The findings also suggest that in order to attract and retain competent academics, GLC universities should institute formal career development opportunities and career orientated strategic plans. Finally, public policy makers should utilise key indicators of talent identification and talent culture such as equitable performance rating systems and rewarding of exemplary contributions in order to stimulate overall talent development. Research limitations/implications - GLC universities should cultivate a Talent Management culture to enhance their talent culture and thereby increase the skills of academics and retain quality academic staff. This research highlights the potential benefits of cultivating a Talent Management culture. The results of this study will benefit the GLC universities specifically, and other educational institutions in general by assisting them to identify, develop and retain competent academics. Originality/value - This is one of the few studies that uses partial least squares to address a multifaceted problem associated with the talent management competency in Malaysian Government Linked Companies universities.

MCDA APPLIED TO PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL OF SHORT-HAUL TRUCK DRIVERS: A CASE STUDY IN A PORTUGUESE TRUCKING COMPANY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Multi-criteria Decision Analysis; Performance Appraisal; Long/Short Haul Trucking; Decision Support Systems	MODEL	Performance appraisal increasingly assumes a more important role in any organizational environment. In the trucking industry, drivers are the company's image and for this reason it is important to develop and increase their performance and commitment to the company's goals. This paper aims to create a performance appraisal model for trucking drivers, based on a multi-criteria decision aid methodology. The PROMETHEE and MMASSI methodologies were adapted using the criteria used for performance appraisal by the trucking company studied. The appraisal involved all the truck drivers, their supervisors and the company's Managing Director. The final output is a ranking of the drivers, based on their performance, for each one of the scenarios used. The results are to be used as a decision-making tool to allocate drivers to the domestic haul service.	[Morte, Raquel; Pereira, Teresa; Fontes, Dalila B. M.

Perceptions of employers and unemployed youth on the proposed youth employment wage subsidy incentive in South Africa: A KwaZulu-Natal study	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Orientation: South Africa has high levels of unemployment and severe problem of youth unemployment. This implies that the country requires a comprehensive strategy to create more jobs for the youth. Policymaking is one of the strategies that have been introduced to encourage job creation for the youth. The youth wage subsidy is just one of the strategies proposed and this article unpacks what employers and unemployed youth say and think about this policy directive. Research purpose: The main aim of the study was to determine the perceptions of unemployed South African youth and employers on the proposed youth wage subsidy incentive scheme. Motivation for the study: Youth unemployment is a very important issue and the reality is that it is a concern of every government globally. South Africa is therefore not an exception as it is a country that has been experiencing high levels of youth unemployment for the last few decades. In an attempt to curb this pressing challenge of youth unemployment, a proposal to introduce a youth wage subsidy policy was made by government; (since its mention), this idea has been met with a lot of opposing opinions from those against it and applause from those who support it. This has motivated this study to probe the perceptions of the subsidy by those who will be affected by its provisions. Method: A triangulated research approach was adopted through the administration of survey questionnaires amongst the unemployed youth and semi-structured interviews with human resource managers and specialists. A sample of unemployed youth was drawn from selected communities within KwaZulu-Natal. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with human resource managers and specialists at selected organisations to determine their perceptions of the proposed scheme and any benefits or limitations they believe it might have. Non-probability sampling was used to sample 100 respondents (N = 100), 90% of whom were unemployed youths and 10% of whom were employers. Main findings: The overall results indicate that more that 93% of the youth surveyed and more than 90% of employers are in support of the youth wage subsidy. In terms of how it should be structured and implemented, about 80% of respondents in the employer survey preferred the tax rebate and incentive option as most of them stated that it will be an easier process to manage and monitor. More than 50% of employers believed that it will ease the wage burden and ensure business sustainability. On the other hand, 88% of the youth surveyed believed it will increase employment for the youth. Findings furthermore reveal that 10% of employers and 28% of the youth were concerned that the subsidy has the potential to exploit older workers (i.e. those who are already in employment) and feared corruption from some employers; otherwise they are in support of its implementation. Contribution: This is one of the areas that have not been sufficiently explored; as a result, there is not much information about it in the current body of knowledge. This study will contribute to current knowledge about a current policy initiative critical to the development of the country. This research also culminates in important recommendations and draws conclusions that could contribute to the formulation of guidelines on how the government could embrace the youth wage subsidy incentive scheme as a strategic intervention that could benefit the employers and the youth and at the same time aid in finding a solution to South Africa's youth unemployment crisis.

J	Pao, HW; Wu, HL; Ho, SP; Lee, CY				Pao, Huei-Wen; Wu, Hsueh-Liang; Ho, Shih-Ping; Lee, Cheng-Yu			From partner selection to trust dynamics Evidence of the cross-country partnership of Taiwanese construction firms	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategic management; Strategic alliances; Taiwan; Cooperative strategy		Purpose - To heed the calls for more inquiries into the tacit behavior in the partnering process and the latent rules underpinning the success of partnerships, the purpose of this paper is to develop a process model that explains when and how partner fit triggers the generation of trust through the sense making of fairness and similarity, and then yields performance by overcoming uncertainties jeopardizing the collaboration. Design/methodology/approach - To develop a comprehensive but parsimonious model for international partnership, the study involves observing and interpreting the accounts of project managers, which suggest the use of an exploratory approach based on case studies. The research setting is six cross-country partnerships operating in East Asian countries during 2005-2009 with each joint project involving Taiwanese construction companies and at least one local partner. Findings - The evidence shows that inter-partner trust conduces to project performance by reducing the threat of behavioral and environmental uncertainty. The findings confirm the general thesis that the performance implication of inter-partner trust is not uniform but contingent on both the types of trust and the uncertainty in the partnering process. Originality/value - Although not the first in the literature of collaborative dynamics, the paper contributes to identifying the latent constructs in the partnering process and highlighting the context-dependent nature of a successful partnership.

Strategic double cropping on Vertisols: A viable rainfed cropping option in the Indian SAT to increase productivity and reduce risk	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						Rainy season fallow; Vertisol Long-term experiment; Crop intensification; Grain legume; Gross profit; Stochastic dominance; Risk assessment	SOIL; MANAGEMENT; TILLAGE; RESIDUE; YIELD; CORN; CLAY	Our study suggests the possibility for transformational change in the productivity and risk profile of some of India's rainfed cropping systems. In the semi-arid regions of Southern India, farmers traditionally crop sorghum or chickpea on Vertisols during the post-rainy season, keeping the fields fallow during the rainy season. This practice avoids land management problems, but limits the potential for crop intensification to increase systems productivity. A long-term (15 year) experiment at ICRISAT demonstrated that cropping during the rainy season is technically feasible, and that grain productivity of double cropped sorghum + chickpea (SCP-SCP) and mung bean + sorghum (MS-MS) sequential systems were higher than their conventional counterparts with rainy season fallow, i.e. fallow + post-rainy sorghum (FS-FS) and fallow + post-rainy chickpea (FS-FCP). Without N application, mean grain yield of post-rainy sorghum in the MS-MS system was significantly greater (2520 kg ha(-1) per two-year rotation) than in the FS-FS system (1940 kg ha(-1) per two-year rotation), with the added benefit of the mung bean grain yield (1000 kg ha(-1) per two-year rotation) from the MS-MS system. In the SCP-SCP system the additional grain yield of rainy sorghum (3400 kg ha(-1) per two-year rotation) ensured that the total productivity of this system was greater than all other systems. Double cropping MS-MS and SCP-SCP sequential systems had significantly higher crop N uptake compared to traditional fallow systems at all rates of applied nitrogen (N). The intensified MS-MS and SCP-SCP sequential systems without any N fertilizer applied recorded a much higher median gross profit of Rs. 20,600 (US $ 375) and Rs. 15,930 (US $ 290) ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, compared to Rs. 1560 (US $ 28) ha(-1) yr(-1)) with the FS-FS system. Applying 120 kg of N ha(-1) considerably increased the profitability of all systems, lifting median gross profits of the sorghum + chickpea system over Rs. 60,000 (US $ 1091) ha(-1) yr(-1) and the conventional system to Rs. 20,570 (US $ 374) ha(-1) yr(-1). The gross profit margin analysis showed that nitrogen is a key input for improving productivity, particularly for the double cropping systems. However, traditional systems are unviable and risky without N application in the variable climates of the semi-arid tropics. Together, our results show that on Vertisols in semi-arid India, double cropping systems increase systems' productivity, and are financially more profitability and less risky than traditional fallow post-rainy systems while further benefits can be achieved through fertilizer application.

J	Rymarzak, M; Trojanowski, D				Rymarzak, Malgorzata; Trojanowski, Dariusz			Asset management determinants of Polish universities	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE			English	Article						Environment; Poland; Management; Universities; Asset; Conditions		Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to offer insights into university asset management (AM) and describe the impact that the various determinants have on the process of university AM. The process of university AM is influenced by a range of determinants. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review and a case study were used to achieve the research objective. The case study involved two data collection techniques - interviews and document analysis. Findings - Changing conditions of state-run universities, such as decreasing number of students and a tendency to increase the proportion of scientific research activities, require flexible adjustments to the size and structure of the universities' facility base. Reductions in government grants and increasing maintenance costs of university assets have made it necessary to manage both existing and future assets more effectively to achieve measured improvement of environmental and social performance, to fulfil strategic responsibilities and to create shared value. Research limitations/implications - The paper was limited to one practice case study. Additional cases could be studied to confirm the findings and increase the usefulness of the methodological framework and improve its application. Practical implications - Identifying the various factors that influence the process of universityAM would be useful for universities and other public building owners and their decisions-makers, such as chancellors and asset managers. The experience of the Polish market also may support the development of university or public building AM in other countries. Originality/value - The process of optimising of university asset structure proposed in this paper can contribute to the better understanding and management of higher education institutions' assets and to the greater competitiveness and efficiency of the Polish universities. The work is novel in that it provides insights into university AM and describes various determinants from an external (macro and micro) and internal (connected with the university itself) perspective.

J	Sastre, JF				Sastre, Juan Fernandez			The effect of national and international R&D cooperation: differences between manufactures and services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						national R&D cooperation; international R&D cooperation; innovative performance; externalities; services innovation	JOINT VENTURES; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; FIRM; CLUSTERS; ECONOMY; COLLABORATION; DETERMINANTS	Using data from the Spanish survey of technological innovation, this paper analyses differences between service and manufacturing firms regarding the impact of national and international R&D cooperation on firms' innovative performance. Results indicate that industrial innovative activity mostly benefits from collaboration at the national level, while international cooperation is crucial for services. Results also show that services are able to combine both national and international partners in an advantageous way, while manufacturing firms that are simultaneously involved in national and international partnerships do not have a greater innovative performance than those that are not involved in R&D collaboration at all.

J	Shi, L; Onishi, M; Kobayashi, K				Shi, Lei; Onishi, Masamitsu; Kobayashi, Kiyoshi			Payoff Externality and Performance-Based Contracts for Transport Infrastructure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						moral hazard; performance-based contract; adverse selection; contract efficiency	TERM-CONTRACTS	This paper examines the adverse selection and moral hazard issues of the performance-based contracts in transport infrastructure projects, which are caused by the pay-off externality between the contracts signed out in the different times and identified by the private agent monitoring. The adverse selection and moral hazard cannot be deterred by the penalty systems and competitive tendering, if the operation is carried out by a sequence of the individual short-term contracts. On the other hand, the adverse selection and moral hazard can be efficiently deterred by the long-term contracts with a single agent internalizing the pay-off externality, as far as the agent is bind to the contract throughout the contract periods. However, the efficiency of the long-term contracts is flawed if the breach of the contract is made by the agent. The paper also investigates the means to deter the strategic breaches of the agent.

Besides, the main tasks of the government in promoting the development of emerging industries are defined clearly. Firstly, to create positive policy environment, basic conditions and social environment that is conducive to the formation and growth of strategic emerging industries, secondly, to create the center of gravity that is suitable for the factors of breeding, germination, transplanting and growth of emerging industries; while it is also keen to find timely signs of growth in emerging industries, to rightly judge the different stages of evolution of emerging industries, and to seize the opportunity to strongly support the growing human, financial, material and information gathering center.

J	Srimai, S				Srimai, Suwit			Performance agreement in Thai public sectors A call for reconsideration at the provincial level	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance measurement; Thailand; Accountability; Diagnostic control system; Performance agreement; Province	STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT; MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; REFORM	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine use of the performance agreement (PA) as well as the diagnostic control system that has been implemented at the provincial level of the Thai government. Design/methodology/approach - This is a qualitative study. Two qualitative methods - focus group and in-depth individual interviews - were employed. In addition, documents such as performance reports, forms, provincial strategic plans, and work manuals, were examined. Findings - Implementation of the PA at the provincial level has encountered some unexpected difficulties. Results of this study indicate that the PA and performance target-setting may contradict the "controllability" principle. In using the diagnostic control system, the two main challenges are: what to monitor and how to report it. Practical implications - This study is intended to be used as a guide in the use of the existing PA and diagnostic control system. The study also points to areas in which improvements can be made to increase the effectiveness of the PA in future use. Originality/value - This study calls for reconsideration in the implementation of the PA at the provincial level of the Thai government. Results show that the notion that "what gets measured gets done" is only half true at best.

EVIDENCE FROM THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY	SERBIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						employees satisfaction; participative management; automotive industry		The effect of participative management on job satisfaction was examined in an automotive sales company in Macedonia. The information was collected from 150 employees. Three components of participatory management was analyzed in the research (1) participatory management style (2) participatory strategic planning process and (3) effective supervisory communication. Results showed that there was a positive relationship between all three components of participatory management and job satisfaction. The relationship between participatory management and job satisfaction was analyzed using statistical methods to determine the correlations and OLS regression model. The study highlights methodological developments in determining the effect of participatory management on job satisfaction in the automotive sales industry. The findings suggest that there is a positive relationship between both and it is therefore important to sustain these factors in order to maintain employees' motivation.

Design/methodology/approach - The potential factors in nurturing innovation in public organizations are identified through the literature review. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to develop the models. Data collection and quantitative analysis were used to explore and understand each determinant. The models were evaluated at the managerial level by both "employee" and "client". Findings - Findings reveal that management commitment is the essential factor that drives strategic orientation to boost innovation. This can be explained using three finalized models. Research limitations/implications - This paper explores only the domestic factors of the classifications. The results may not be generalizable to other countries in the region. Practical implications - Thoroughly understanding the factors influencing successful innovation in public organizations contributes to greater satisfaction of the needs and requirements of citizens. Originality/value - This paper offers novel models of the organizational culture of public organizations seeking innovative policy solutions.

J	Tien, CL; Chen, CN				Tien, Chengli; Chen, Chien-Nan			The power of momentum on firm performance: a myth or a reality?	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Firm performance; Contingency theory; Momentum; Path dependence; Routine	INERTIA	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend research related to a firm's behavioural momentum and its financial performance and to further examine any moderating effect from various perspectives -how firm-level (firm age and size), industry-level, and country-level factors can interact with the power of momentum to affect a firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from the Compustat and Yahoo Finance databases for firms in the USA and the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) for firms in Taiwan. The final sample of US firms is from a panel with 239 unique companies in electronics-related industries across a 22-year time span (1991-2012). The final sample of Taiwanese firms is from a panel with 184 unique companies also in electronics-related industries across a 22-year time span (1991-2012). Findings - The results show that momentum does not significantly improve firm performance, and thus the power of momentum is a myth. However, the relationship between momentum and firm performance can be moderated by firm age, size, capital intensity, and country of origin, respectively, under some circumstances. Originality/value -The originality and value are that this is a multiple-perspective study of firm behavioural momentum and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over path-dependent perspectives with contingent perspectives across the borders to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps, while the evidence-based findings provide top management with practical know` ledge for strategic planning and execution with another avenue for future research on the momentum effect.

The challenge of balanced policy and law for socially responsible water storage management	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Drought; Flood risk; Sustainable agribusiness policy; Water storage responsibility	STRATEGIC RESPONSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DAM SAFETY; ADAPTATION; IMPACTS; GOVERNANCE; RESOURCES	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate what represents "balanced" policy. Drought conditions create pressures on farmers to store excessive water unfairly, creating unsafe structures in flood, which creates a dual-extreme risk with potentially catastrophic social consequences downstream. "Balanced" policy for socially responsible water storage management that accounts for farmers' responses to regulations is a key to minimising this risk. Design/methodology/approach - This study investigated the problem through application of Oliver's (1991) strategic response typology to a survey of 202 agribusiness managers in four different institutional environments. Findings - Evidence of diverse policy in Australia and results of 202 farmers surveyed suggest that "unbalanced" policy that does not infringe on farmer decision-making power will engender lower resistance, but in a "best balance" environment, stronger resistance is evident. Originality/value - The study demonstrates a need to consider more reflexive regulatory mixes for socially responsible water-storage behaviour by agribusiness.

J	Sampere, JPV				Vazquez Sampere, Juan Pablo			How the evolution of science will transform business schools	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						MBA; Management education; Business schools; Causal-based research; Management oath; Scientific discovery; Responsible management education; Actionable research; Executive education	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; EXECUTIVE EDUCATION; RELEVANT; VALIDITY	Purpose - The ambiguous response of business schools to responsible management education (RME) is part of a larger problem which is rooted in how science evolves. The purpose of this paper is to explain how the consolidation of causal-based research in management will produce much more effective theories and teaching materials. Therefore business schools will then have to seriously engage in strong RME practices to prevent scandals from happening and to consolidate management as a profession. Design/methodology/approach - In total, two models are introduced and explained. First, a comprehensive methodology for theory building that controls for causality and delivers clear and actionable results. Second, a model that depicts the three stages of interactions between variables (relationship, contingency and causality). Findings - New causal-based research methods are starting to emerge that explain when a particular event will occur and how to "cause" for it to happen. Social implications - Business schools are not responsible of the current economic crisis. But if they do not find a way to introduce RME practices before the advent of causal-based research their reputation might be severely damaged during the next one. Originality/value - As many other business school innovations, the first group of business schools that pioneer causal-based research will not only deliver on the promise of RME but also introduce the new generation of successful, relevant and actionable new managerial practices.

Among the possible tools to rise above this cut-throat environment is the concept of hotel collaboration. This paper moves towards the understanding of hotel collaboration in China based on the focus group discussions of 22 experienced practitioners in the Chinese hotel and related industries. The data identified several threats, opportunities, and insights into hotel collaboration of domestic with overseas hotels as well as predictions for the future of this practice in China. Based on specific cultural, political, and economic contexts of contemporary China, the results indicate that partial collaboration is likely to succeed in the hotel market of the country.

J	Wicker, P; Soebbing, BP; Feiler, S; Breuer, C				Wicker, Pamela; Soebbing, Brian P.; Feiler, Svenja; Breuer, Christoph			The effect of Porter's generic strategies on organisational problems of non-profit sports clubs	EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR SPORT AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Porter; strategy; strategic management; sports club; non-profit organisation		Non-profit sports clubs face several organisational problems relating to memberships, finances, demographic changes and competition from other organisations, which can be addressed through strategic planning. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Porter's (1980) generic strategies (cost leadership, differentiation, focus) on the severity of those organisational problems. Quantitative panel data from a German sports club survey are used for the analysis (n = 41,343). Regression results show that clubs pursuing a cost leadership or a focus strategy experience smaller problems in all areas. The efficacy of the differentiation strategy depends on the programmatic option and the problem under investigation: Leisure and mass sport, sport for older people, and non-sport programmes lead to reduced problems, while health sport, sport for immigrants, and programmes similar to those of commercial providers have inconsistent effects. The findings have implications for the management of sports clubs.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, we will propose strategy maps for national research institutes (NRIs), so that the managers can describe the strategies of their organisations more clearly, accurately and logically. Also, we will propose a new method to set targets for key performance indicators (KPIs), which is named "Forecasting-Objective Achievement System (FOAS)". Findings - The authors have explored the general rules of the research activity and proposed the strategic map for NRIs, so that the research managers can more clearly, accurately and logically describe the strategy for the organisational development strategy, and build the performance measurement indicators based on it. It allows the managers to transfer the strategy into clear and concrete action initiatives, and the corresponding performance evaluation indicators. Also, this paper proposed a new method for target-setting for performance indicator to drive NRIs do their best to achieve high performance. Research limitations/implications - First, this paper proposes a framework of strategy maps for NRIs to transfer the strategy into clear and concrete action initiatives, and the corresponding performance evaluation indicators. Also, this paper gives a case study of a research institute in the field of physics to derive KPIs based on its strategy maps, which can show the effectiveness of this approach. But this institute conducts mainly the basic research, and there are other NRIs with different types of research, such as applied research, which have different characteristics with the NRI in the case study. Originality/value - The authors propose the specific strategy maps for NRIs and a new method to set targets for KPIs. Further, the example of a national research institute is taken to analyze its strategy map and construct a performance measurement indicator system for it, so that the strategies in research management can be transferred to specific action initiatives. New ideas are provided for the performance measurement of national research institutes.

In the article, the life cycle of residential buildings has been divided into five stages: building materials production period, construction period, operation and maintenance period, demolition period, and solid waste recycle and disposal period. Based on this definition, the authors provide a theoretical model to calculate carbon emissions of residential building life cycle. In particular, the factor of human activities was introduced in the calculation of carbon emissions from the buildings. Furthermore, the authors put forward a model for calculation with the unit of carbon emissions for per-capita living space.

J	Yu-Guodong; Yang-Yu; Zhao-Xi; Liu-Aijun				Yu-Guodong; Yang-Yu; Zhao-Xi; Liu-Aijun			Multi-objective dynamic fuzzy scheduling and its algorithm in product collaborative design considering emergency	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Product collaborative design scheduling problem; fuzziness; dynamic scheduling; emergency; multi-objective optimization; algorithm	GENETIC ALGORITHM; PROCESSING TIMES	Product collaborative design scheduling problem (PCDSP) has received increasing attention in the engineering field for its popularity in manufacturing and supply chain systems. Although many scholars have achieved many useful results in Job-shop scheduling problem (JSP), the research work of PCDSP is still lacking. Moreover, the fuzziness, dynamics and multi-objective of PCD pose a great challenge for enterprises making quick response to unplanned perturbations. Thus, in this paper, multi-objective dynamic fuzzy scheduling and its solution algorithm are presented. Emergencies cases are analyzed and dynamic scheduling procedure based on event-driven and lifecycle-driven is developed firstly. The fuzziness of PCD process is studied meanwhile fuzzy triangular number and fuzzy trapezoid number are used to express the fuzziness. Based on this, a multi-objective dynamic fuzzy scheduling model aiming to minimum the makespan and tardiness penalty is constructed. As a solution, multi-objective dynamic adaptive scheduling algorithm, based on bi-layer coding strategy and self-adaptive double point crossover and self-adaptive mutation, is proposed following closely. Finally, analytic results from a case of a wind turbine are used to illustrate the model and method proposed in this paper. With the analysis, it can provide insight into ways of improving the strategic and operational decision making for enterprises.

J	Zhao, HH; Shu, LJ; Jiang, W; Tsui, KL				Zhao, Honghao; Shu, Lianjie; Jiang, Wei; Tsui, Kwok-Leung			An adaptive CUSUM chart for monitoring poisson rates with increasing population sizes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						adaptive CUSUM; ACUSUM; conditional expected delay; inhomogeneous poisson process; weighted CUSUM; WCUSUM	SURVEILLANCE	The CUSUM control chart is an effective tool for monitoring both variable and count data. However, it often requires the assumption of known process parameters. To get away from this assumption, the adaptive CUSUM (ACUSUM) procedure has been suggested, with primary focus on the monitoring of variable data. This paper extends the idea of ACUSUM control charts from the monitoring of variable data to the monitoring of count data based on an inhomogeneous Poisson model. The study is motivated by a real example of male thyroid cancer data in New Mexico. The comparison results show that the ACUSUM method generally performs better than the traditional Poisson CUSUM charts and other variations for monitoring a wide range of shifts in the Poisson mean.

J	Zhao, J; Mei, SE; Zhong, WJ				Zhao, Jiang; Mei, Shu-e; Zhong, Wei-jun			Bidirectional Role of Accuracy and Recognition in Internet-Based Targeted Advertising	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN ORGANIZATIONS			English	Article						Accuracy; Internet-Based Targeted Advertising; Mass Advertising; Price Competition; Recognition		The effective media strategy in advertising is gradually becoming the premise of company that lives in the competition of marketing. Due to the rapid growth of new advertising media and technologies, it is possible for a firm to precisely target advertising to the potential consumer segment within a market. This research explores the extent to which an advertiser should regulate the quality of its targeting and effect on consumers' surplus and social welfare. The authors present a theoretic model measuring the targeting quality of internet-based targeted advertising with two measures termed accuracy and recognition. Accuracy measures the possibility of correct prediction in the target segment, while recognition is defined as the probability that any member of the targeted segment is identified. The authors demonstrate, within a monopolistic framework, the online targeted advertising might lower or increase both consumers' surplus and social welfare compared with mass advertising, which depends on different range of accuracy and recognition in the social media. The recognition of internet-based targeted advertising plays a positive role on equilibrium price, whereas the accuracy plays a negative role in the regulation of advertising intensity and equilibrium price. Therefore, it is believed that the accuracy and recognition of the online targeted advertising can be used as a lever for the strategic segmentation of a market.

This paper will examine two of the most common types of multi-channel structures. Under Structure 1, a supply chain includes a manufacturer; its online store and its own retail store, like GAP 's business model. A profit maximization model is used to obtain optimal strategies in terms of optimal retail price and level of value-added services provided by manufacturer-owned retailer. Under Structure 2, a supply chain includes a manufacturer; its online store and an independent retail store, like Dell's business model. Stackelberg game is applied to obtain the optimal retail price, wholesale price, and level of value-added services provided by an independent retailer. Furthermore, comparisons between these two business structures are discussed and managerial guidelines are proposed. Finally, numerical examples are provided and real business examples are discussed to illustrate and justify the theoretical results.

J	Bishop, J				Bishop, Jonathan			RETRACTED: Transforming the UK Home Office into a Department for Homeland Security: Reflecting on an Interview with a Litigant Defending Against Online Retaliatory Feedback in the US (Retracted article. See vol. 13, pg. 1, 2016)	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Retracted Publication						community policing; constitutional reform; fake conferences; homeland security; retaliatory feedback		Retaliatory feedback is a significant problem on the Internet, which is not just confined to online auction websites, but other online environments dependent on reputation systems. Explored in this paper are the acts of an Internet troller who spread malicious and false allegations that the series of conferences called WORLDCOMP are "fake." This paper interviews one of the organisers of this conference to ask how they went about dealing with the retaliatory feedback, and in particular their engagement with law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, which now forms part of the US Department of Homeland Security. To reform the UK Home Office to learn lessons from this, the paper proposes making greater use of National Crime Agency and Police and Crime Commissioners to provide a better strategic set-up for law enforcement under the UK Home Office. It also suggest using publicly funded solicitors and community wardens, as opposed to the current set-up of police constables, to deal with community policing. The paper concludes that in order for the promise made by the New Labour Government to be "tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime" to become a reality, encouraging peaceful discourses between community members and former offenders is essential.

J	Buch, A; Andersen, V				Buch, Anders; Andersen, Vibeke			Rationalities in Trade Union Practices: A Discourse Analytic Perspective on The Strategies of Three Danish Trade Unions for Professionals	NORDIC JOURNAL OF WORKING LIFE STUDIES			English	Article						Discourse analysis; Neo-liberalism; Professional societies; Strategy; Trade unions		The ambition of this paper is to analyze the discursive practices of three Danish trade unions for professional and managerial staff as found in their strategy and position papers. Using discourse analytic methods, the paper analyzes, discusses, and compares the strategy papers of the three unions in order to investigate how they problematize their roles and objectives. This investigation clarifies the discursive premises of the unions and it shows how these premises restrain and afford their agendas. The overall purpose of the paper is to investigate and describe the dominant logics and rationalities that shape the documents and to point to their limits and bounds. Through an archaeological investigation, the paper critically examines the implicit and tacit naturalizations made in the documents and reveals the ideological presuppositions of the discursive practices of the authors. The paper documents how "strategic management" has become an integral part of Danish trade unions practices and the paper sets out to discuss this trend in relation to the general neo-liberal decentering of the " social" and promotion of "community" as the locus of governance. Through examples from the practices of the Danish trade unions for professionals, the paper substantiates how new technologies of governance and the subjectification of union members as "customers" tend to transform the role of the trade unions from the position of "political actors" to "service providers" in the advanced liberal societies.

J	Jafari, SM				Jafari, Seyed Mohammadbagher			Strategic Cost-Cutting in Information Technology: toward a Framework for Enhancing the Business Value of IT	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Conceptual Framework; Cost-cutting Techniques; IT Business Value; IT Costs; IT Strategic Role; IT Structure	SYSTEMS; ALIGNMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; ARCHITECTURE; MANAGEMENT; CONTEXT; SUCCESS	The increasing dependency of many businesses with information technology (IT) and the high percentage of the IT investment in all invested capital in business environment ask for more attention to this important driver of business. The limitation of capital budget forces the managers to look for more wise investment in IT. There are many cost-cutting techniques in the literature and each of them has a different impact on the organization. This study is one of the first steps in providing more insight on this issue via proposing a conceptual framework for strategic cost-cutting in IT. The literature review revealed that the strategic role of IT in organizations, IT costs structure, firm's IT structure, senior management support and organizational learning are the important factors that affect the cost-cutting technique selection in IT. The proposed framework focuses on the strategic role of IT in business to suggest which cost-cutting techniques are the best to be applied in an organization in order to save costs while ensuring high-quality service and support for business growth and maximizing business value from IT spending.

J	Su, CJ				Su, Chia-Jui			"Branded or Generic," the Legal Analysis and Strategic Management of Pharmaceutical Patent Disputes-The Taiwan Model	NTUT JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Patent; infringement; pharmaceutics; branded; generic		Because of intensive research and innovation in pharmaceutical industries, legal disputes and strategic management of intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly critical between competing pharmaceutical manufacturers. From specialized IP jurisdiction, industrial capacity and pharmaceutical market prospective, Taiwan is an appropriate research model for industries to elucidate patent disputes between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies. After analyzing recent pharmaceutical patent decisions held in the IP Court of Taiwan, and comparing them with China Patent Act and the U.S. patent laws and precedents, a three-stage model was developed to categorize pharmaceutical patent disputes between global branded and local generic companies. First, in the preparation stage, either branded or generic companies apply different legal strategies to extend or exempt of patent exclusivity respectively. Second, in the injunction stage, this article demonstrates why specialized IP jurisdiction, financial burden for countersecurity and abuse of IP rights affect generics to stay in the market. Third, in the litigation stage, This article illustrates how indirect infringement protection, validity of patents, and physicians' defense play the crucial roles of patent litigations in Greater China area. Finally, to integrate the strategic considerations and commercial effects of these legal battles, this patent dispute model in pharmaceutics provides a useful guideline and some suggestions for both generic and branded companies that intend to develop or sustain their pharmaceutical business in Asia or globally.

J	Kim, H				Kim, Hyunchul			The government's research and development policies and institutions for health technology	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			Korean	Article						Biomedical research; Financing; Organized		Health Technology Research and Development (R&D) national grant system has been progressed by the unique governance of each countries. From this reason, it has historical context and path-dependency. South Korea, also have started their investment from Bio Technology Master Plan of Ministry of Science and Technology (1994) and Korea Health Technology R&D Project of Ministry of Health and Welfare (1995), currently investing around 1.1 trillion won (in the year 2012) into the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (now, Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning), Ministry of Health and Welfare and Ministry of Knowledge Economy (now, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy). This paper focuses on the Health Technology R&D national grant system in the aspect of governance, mid-long term strategic plan, main program, planning-evaluation-management system. And last but not least, implications. First, there would be important to build the effective governance, performance based policy and administration mechanisms of national grant system for the Health Technology R&D. Second, main objective of Health Technology R&D, which is improving the quality of life for the public, could not meet their target practically. Third, R&D investment has been enlarged from treatment based to prevention and care focused and from technology-centered into demand-centered, which based on the unmet health needs. Last, most of Health Technology R&D project could not consider sustainable health system, which would be the most important value in healthcare.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public housing; Maintenance service performance; Resident perception; Malaysia; Communication effectiveness	BUILDING MANAGEMENT; COST; DECISION; SATISFACTION; PARTICIPATE; PROPERTY	Currently, debates on the performance of maintenance services in multi-storey public housing have been matters of great concern. Previous studies have proven that a close relationship between the residents and the management team is vital to enhance the performance of maintenance services, but limited studies have been geared towards the influence of communication on the performance of maintenance services. This study aims to examine the influence of communication between the residents and the management team on the performance of the maintenance services. A survey was conducted with the residents of multi-storey public housing in Penang, Malaysia, who were selected using stratified random sampling. A descriptive analysis, Pearson product-moment correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used to analyse the data. The results show that there is a significant and positive relationship between effective communication and the residents' perceived performance of maintenance services. Two communication attributes, "satisfaction with the feedback" and "accuracy of information", are the determinants for the performance of maintenance services.

J	Altenhoner, R; Junger, U; Schwens, U				Altenhoener, Reinhard; Junger, Ulrike; Schwens, Ute			Innovation as a strategic choice at the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek	IFLA JOURNAL-INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS			English	Article						innovation; digitization; preservation; Petrus; automation; project management; strategy development; cataloguing; subject indexing; German National Library; Deutsche Nationalbibliothek		Like libraries and librarianship in general, the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (DNB) has in recent years been confronted with technology-driven changes in the information environment. These changes mean a considerable challenge in terms of the mandate of the DNB and the way to fulfill it. To cite one important example: how will DNB deal with a collection mandate extended to digital publications of all kinds, including the obligation to record these publications and make them available for current and future generations? How does it manage to remain a highly visible lighthouse in the seas of data and information? This will not happen accidentically, but will be the result of careful planning, determined actions, and continuous monitoring, based on a clear strategy and a systematic approach, and it means that processes and functions will have to be revised, terminated or newly established. The DNB has always considered itself as an innovative institution - the necessity to be open for recurring innovations and to initiate such developments has become more and more urgent. The DNB has, therefore, started a strategic process in 2013 to respond to this requirement. This process is new to the institution and its members and demands a lot of learning and preparation. A major first step was the definition of strategic goals for the years 2013 to 2016, complemented by a project for organizational development. These goals help the DNB to focus itself and they serve as a guideline for prioritizing projects and tasks. Examples for strategic priorities are a substantial increase in the collection of digital and web resources, development and implementation of automated cataloguing processes, stepping up digitization efforts, and building up an infrastructure for long-term preservation of digital content. However, there are other areas to be attended to and other challenges to be met - the strategic process and the organizational development are, for DNB, tools to continuously follow-up on innovation. This article intends to address the topic coming from two directions: On the one hand we describe the process development in DNB, and on the other hand we name examples and working areas, which might be relevant factors to successfully master the future.

We focus on the Markov condition, a key assumption on which causal graph modeling is based, and show why this condition is invariably violated in strategic management in general and the resource-based view of the firm in particular. We then introduce vector space modeling as a quantitative alternative to causal graph modeling, and consider how improved methods of causal inference might enhance our ability to test some of the central propositions of the resource-based view.

J	Giovanardi, M				Giovanardi, Mattia			Mapping Communication along the Supply Chain in a Reputation-Sensitive Environment: Preliminary Insights	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication; Computer-Mediated Communication; Interpersonal Communication; Stakeholder Relationship Management; Supply Chain		This exploratory qualitative study is aimed at depicting communication support to Supply Chain (SC) management, emphasizing how relationships and processes are affected by communication flows. It provides a preliminary comprehensive communication mapping, highlighting key stakeholders involved in SC management, communication roles enhancing logistics performances, and channels supporting information and physical flows among partners. It is based on a literature review, multidisciplinary academic meetings, interviews with SC directors of two global companies operating in a reputation-sensitive environment, and desk analysis of companies' documental flows. Findings reveal that communication accomplishes four basic functions: 1) it helps embedding and spreading cultural values along internal SC units; 2) it supports conflict resolution and compensation among different managerial logics; 3) it encourages development and maintenance of relationships with SC partners; 4) it enhances the fine-tuning among SC phases and activities, supporting alignment and integration of procedures and routines. Finally, the study points out that communication is typically face-to-face when it has to support the strategic SC phases, whereas it is typically computer-mediated when supporting SC operational phases.

Changing inadequate practice is therefore a formidable challenge for mental health-care managers. AimTo explore decision-makers' attitudes and awareness regarding the national guidelines for psychosocial interventions targeting people with schizophrenia. MethodA questionnaire distributed by e-mail to 592 Swedish decision-makers was analysed using descriptive and comparative techniques. ResultsSignificantly more of the top-level mental health-care managers than politicians stated that they knew about the national guidelines (i.e. their release and content) and they considered the guidelines to be a good source of support for planning and allocating resources. ConclusionIf those responsible for allocating resources (i.e. politicians) are unaware of the dissemination of national guidelines or their content, and they do not perceive the national guidelines to be a good source of support for planning and allocating resources, this is likely to have a negative influence on the remit of nurse managers as well as nursing practice. Implications for nursing managementTop-level mental health-care managers have a vital role to play in the implementation of national guidelines. However, our findings indicate that implementing national guidelines in practice could be virtually impossible without strategic government support.

J	An, D; Nam, J; Kwon, S; Suh, Y; Lee, J				An, DeokSoon; Nam, JeongHee; Kwon, SooAhn; Suh, YoungChan; Lee, JaeJun			Threshold Values of Performance Indicators for Asphalt Concrete Pavement to Apply to Pavement Performance Warranty	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION			English	Article						performance warranty; rut depth; crack ratio; roughness		The performance warranty system is quite innovative in requiring a contractor's warranty for pavement performance over a certain period of time. European countries adopted performance warranty systems about 40 years ago. The United States adopted this system in the early 1990s to improve construction quality and performance, as well as to reduce life cycle cost. In Korea, for the purpose of resolving construction management and quality control problems and poor construction, the performance warranty system is considered as part of the solution. The appropriate performance indicators, reasonable threshold values, and warranty periods have to be selected in order to adopt a performance warranty system that requires keeping the pavement performance above a certain level of satisfaction for the warranty period. For this reason, structural, functional, and safety performance were defined first, and then rut depth, roughness, and crack ratio were selected as performance warranty indicators. For the purpose of suggesting performance warranty threshold values that reflect domestic circumstances, pavement management system data were surveyed, a special project was conducted, and a total of 888 sample sections were analyzed. A threshold level at 95 % of each indicator's distress was determined for the threshold value; this prevents the worst 5 % of poor performance cases. A 14-mm rut depth, 3.6 m/km International Roughness Index, and 20 % crack ratio for five years were selected as threshold values. To avoid early deterioration of pavement, three-to five-year warranty periods are suggested.

Effects of an Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blocker on Aortic Valve Sclerosis in a Preclinical Model	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article							CONVERTING ENZYME-INHIBITORS; RABBIT MODEL; STATIN TREATMENT; EARLY LESION; STENOSIS; CALCIFICATION; PROGRESSION; DISEASE; ROSUVASTATIN; THERAPY	Background: Aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) is a chronic progressive disease involving lipid infiltration, inflammation, and tissue calcification. Despite its high prevalence, there are currently no clinically approved pharmaceuticals for the management of AVS. The objective of the current study was to elucidate the effects of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, alone or in combination with statin therapy, on the progression of AVS. Methods: Male New Zealand white rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet for a period of 12 months to induce AVS. Once disease was established, rabbits were randomly assigned to receive no treatment, olmesartan medoxomil, atorvastatin calcium, or a combination of both drugs for a period of 6 months. Disease progression was monitored in vivo using clinically relevant magnetic resonance imaging, and aortic valve cusps were examined ex vivo using histologic and immunohistochemical methods. Results: Cusp thickness significantly increased (0.58 +/- 0.03 vs 0.39 +/- 0.03 mm for cholesterol and control animals, respectively; P < 0.0001) and all classic hallmarks of disease progression-including lipid infiltration, inflammation, and tissue calcification-were observed after 12 months. Unfortunately, neither olmesartan medoxomil nor atorvastatin calcium were able to reverse or delay disease progression during the 6-month treatment period. However, several histologic changes were observed in the valvular microenvironment. Conclusions: The current study suggests that angiotensin receptor blockers, alone or in combination with statin therapy, may not be suitable for management of clinical AVS.

J	Cetinkaya, S; Keskin, BB; Uster, H				Cetinkaya, Sila; Keskin, Burcu B.; Uester, Halit			Characterization of facility assignment costs for a location-inventory model under truckload distribution	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						integrated location-inventory optimization; fixed charge facility location problem; Economic Order Quantity problem under generalized replenishment costs; cargo costs	VENDOR SELECTION; DESIGN; DECISIONS; CAPACITY	We consider a two-stage distribution system, where the first stage consists of potential distribution centres (DCs) and the second stage consists of geographically dispersed existing retailers. Our goal is to determine the set of open DCs and assignment of open DCs to retailers simultaneously with inventory decisions of retailers. In addition to the DC-specific fixed facility location costs, we explicitly model the inventory replenishment and holding costs at the retailers and truckload transportation costs between the DCs and the retailers. The transportation costs are subject to truck/cargo capacity, leading to an integrated location-inventory problem with explicit cargo costs. We develop a mixed-integer nonlinear model and analyse its structural properties leading to exact expressions for the so-called implied facility assignment costs and imputed per-unit per-mile transportation costs. These expressions analytically demonstrate the interplay between strategic location and tactical inventory/transportation decisions in terms of resulting operational costs. Although both the theory and practice of integrated logistics have recognized the fact that strategic and tactical decisions are interrelated, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to offer closed-form results demonstrating the relationship explicitly. We propose an efficient solution approach utilizing the implied facility assignment costs and we demonstrate that significant savings are realizable when the inventory decisions and cargo costs are modelled explicitly for facility location purposes.

The main objective was to discuss the opportunities and challenges that the case study can provide the scientific productions from areas of research in construction. Thus, there was, from an exploratory study with a qualitative approach that works investigated are, for the most part, descriptive, presented by means of literature and discussion of procedures that involve pedagogical and didactic about theme. In that respect, and considering the fact that interest in the study of social management is recent and polysemic, it was concluded that the use of case study methodologies provide a detailed strategic research more meaningful, contributing to the realization of promising results.

J	Korican, M; Barac, Z; Jelavic, I				Korican, Mirna; Barac, Zoran; Jelavic, Ivija			\ Impact of Related Acquisition Strategy on Bidding Company Performance	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STUDIES			English	Article						Merger; Acquisition; Acquisition strategy; Company performance		Strategy researchers believe that the better the strategic fit or relatedness between the bidding and acquired firms, the greater should be the economic gain from the merger. Although merger performance has been widely researched we recognized that empirical results on merger performance are inconclusive and that there are research gaps related to geographical settings, time frame and methodological approach. Thus, the research question examined in our study was to find out if acquisition strategy or relatedness of merging companies increases performance of the bidding company. Also we considered moderating effect of premerger bidder profitability on the performance of the merger. Our study predicts that relatedness between merging companies has a positive impact on the merger's performance. Results of 49 mergers completed in 2008 in EU member countries and Switzerland show that related mergers have better merger scores than unrelated mergers. We also predict that the impact of the related acquisition strategy becomes more positive as bidder premerger performance decreases.

Compared with other subspecies, Sichuan sika deer lives in a special environment which is composed of a mosaic of forest, bush, and meadow located between plateau meadows and alpine valleys. In order to get strategic information about the relationship of Sichuan sika deer and the environment, we conducted our study on habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in the Tiebu Nature Reserve from March to November 2011. Generalized Linear Mixed Models and an information-theoretic approach were used in our data analysis. Our results indicated that all three types of vegetation were necessary for Sichuan sika deer. In forest, Sichuan sika deer preferred the sites with a high density of herbs. In bush, Sichuan sika deer's occurrence was significantly correlated with greater distances from habitations and shorter distances to water. In meadows, Sichuan sika deer preferred the sites with gradual slopes and proximity to water. Water and disturbance could be treated as key factors that influence the habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in meadow and bush habitat. Food availability may affect the habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in forest and bush. Thus, protecting all three vegetation types is one of the important objectives for the conservation of the endangered Sichuan sika deer. Building some wooden water tanks in meadows and bush and controlling areas of human and livestock activity could increase the suitability of areas Sichuan sika deer need.

J	Perez, RA				Alberto Perez, Rafael			Strategy as a field of study. Do we have a new paradigm?	REVISTA MEDITERRANEA COMUNICACION-JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			Spanish	Article						Strategy; paradigm; Communication		This essay aims to answer, twenty years later, the question that in 1994 C.K. Prahalad & G. Hamel asked: Why do we look for a new paradigm? It has been a long way from strategic management to bifurcate in several paths. This approach to new environments applying a transdisciplinarity methodology brings all these paths together to the common place of complexity. As a result, in the last two decades, new ways of think the strategy emerge: systemic, ecologist, biologist, neurocognitives, etc. One of these is the New Strategic Theory (NST - NTE in Spanish). The NTE propose rethink, and even, refound the strategy from the communications and relational approach.				estrategia@rafaelalbertoperez.com					ALBERTO PEREZ R., 2008, COMUNICACION CIUDADA; Alonso Baquer Miguel, 2000, QUE CONSISTE ESTRATE; Ansoff I, 1965, CORPORATE STRATEGY; ANSOFF I., 1972, J BUSINESS POLICY, V2; ANSOFF IH, 1979, STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; BABIAK P., 2006, PISCOPATHS GO WORK; BOSSOLASCO M., 2013, DIRCOM, V101; BOYER L., 1993, HIST MANAGEMENT; CHAKRAVARTHY BS, 1992, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V13, P5, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250131003; COPPOLA G., 2009, ESTRATEGIA COMUNICAC; Damasio A., 1994, ERROR EMOTION REASON; Drucker P., 1954, PRACTICE MANAGEMENT; GALINDO CACERES J., 2013, DIRCOM, V101; GALINDO CACERES J., 2013, LA TRAMA DE LA VIDA; GALINDO CACERES J., 2011, RAZON PALABRA, V75; GRUNIG, 1984, MANAGING PUBIC RELAT; GUMUCIO DAGRON A., 2010, VALIO PENA LARGA ESP; Habermas J., 1973, THEORY COMUNICATIVE, VII; HABERMAS Junger, 1987, TEORIA ACCION COMUNI; HAMEL G., 1997, FORTUNE, V135, P22; Hamel G., 2009, MOON SHOTS MANAGEMEN; Hamel G., 2007, FUTURE MANAGEMENT; HERRERA R., 2007, NTE PARADIGMA EMERGE; HUFF A.

Managing such schema diversity promotes and enables communication and collaboration within these federations. This paper presents a process, model and algorithms to manage the lifecycle, refinement and dynamic combination of semantic mappings using federation context and automated correspondence pattern recognition for complex mappings. Related work is surveyed, key requirements are derived and the system is evaluated through prototyping and experimental results for semi-automated generation of executable groundings for complex mappings.

J	Alonso, AI				Iglesias Alonso, Angel			The Shaping of Local Self-Government and Economic Development through City Strategic Planning: A Case Study	LEX LOCALIS-JOURNAL OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT			English	Article						governance; democratic innovation; participation; administrative modernization; strategic planning	PARTICIPATION; MANAGEMENT	In the contemporary multiplying uncertainties of local governments, politicians and public managers are constantly faced by a recurrent problem: despite financial constraints and with scarce resources, they have to combine the delivery of efficient public services with local economic development and democratic quality. This paper draws on an ethnography concerning the design and implementation of a Strategic Planning process within a Spanish city government and is framed by the proposition that local governments are experimental places for what is usually referred to as democratic governance. Focusing on the way in which the use of Strategic Planning entails a trade-off between urban and economic development and democracy, the article explores how this formal mechanism of citizens' and business' participation serves to establish relational processes to reinvigorate local economic development, democracy and administrative modernization. The paper also argues that, in order to fully implement new urban development practices at the local level, it is necessary to take into account not only institutional issues, but also the communal, social and political resources that frame both formal and informal deliberations propelled by the Strategic Planning process. It is the interaction and combination of these that determine the paths and developments of local government innovations.

J	Lindovsky, M				Lindovsky, Milan			Analysis of Crisis Management Water Supply System	INZYNIERIA MINERALNA-JOURNAL OF THE POLISH MINERAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY			English	Article						water supply system; water sources; hydraulic efficacy; contamination; accident; risk analysis; monitoring and management		The majority of inhabitants in Europe depend nowadays on a supply of drinking water mainly from public waterworks systems. The risk of an emergency situation being created that exceeds the possibilities of a satisfactory solution for emergency water supply for all customers is growing together with the growing number of inhabitants, who depend on water supplies mainly from central sources. In particular subjects of critical infrastructure are threatened, which depend completely by their character and the technologies they use on direct supplies of pressurised water from the water main; for example, medical services and food production, but also some objects of public infrastructure and fire safety of vast built-up areas. In order to minimise the given risks we need to become aware of weak as well as strong parts and properties of the operated system by means of a risk analysis and by applying diagnostic and computer techniques, including accepting the corresponding preventative measures. Preconditions and possibilities are different in different the 28 EU member states. Water mains for public consumption supply potable water for approx. 93% of inhabitants in the Czech Republic. In 2012, 481 mil.m(3) of potable water supplied by public water mains were invoiced, and the value of water supply infrastructure property reached CZK 1000 bil. [1]. Almost 2000 of legal persons are engaged in the production of potable water and its distribution to the users - inhabitants and technical elements of critical infrastructure; however, the decisive role is played by approx. 120 legal persons in Czech water supply [1]. The given strategic importance of water mains must be matched not only by legislative protection, but also by the protection of water supply systems in real practice. For this reason, water supply infrastructure is classified as one of essential elements of critical infrastructure. Considering that the risk of interruption of potable water supply from natural or anthropogenic reasons cannot be prevented, negative impacts on the consumers should at least be minimized. The paper discusses how this complex task can be resolved under the real conditions of water supply systems, and how to ensure, at least for strategic consumers, a minimum amount of water in crisis situations.

A framework for strategic financial risk management	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							PROBABILITY ELICITATION; UNCERTAINTY; EXPERTS	Strategic risks represent the largest challenge for corporate risk management, often due to lack of data or incompatibility with existing financial modeling frameworks. Indeed, industry surveys found that from 2002 to 2012 strategic risks accounted for over 80% of the cases of significant shareholder value loss among Top 1000 companies. To meet the challenge, we propose a practical framework that includes (i) a collaborative environment to build (in an intuitive yet structured fashion) a graph representing the relationships between mitigation actions, risks, and affected drivers of a company's financial model, (ii) a set of rules to transform this graph into a probabilistic model, allowing for the automatic generation of questionnaires to elicit risk information from domain experts, (iii) an aggregation technique to combine opinions of multiple experts, (iv) simulation to quantify the effects of the risks and mitigation actions on key financial outcomes, and to compute, for example, the probability of achieving a given profit target conditional on a portfolio of mitigation actions, (v) an evaluation of mitigation actions in terms of their risk reduction, and (vi) a cost-benefit analysis to help decision makers determine a mitigation investment strategy.

To address such a "large p small n" problem, we have developed a heteroscedastic effects model (HEM) that has been shown to be powerful in high-throughput genetic analyses. Here, we describe how this whole-genome model can also be utilized in chemometric analysis. As a proof of concept, we use HEM to predict analyte concentrations in silage using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy signals. The results show that HEM often outperforms the classic methods and in addition to this presents a substantial computational advantage in the analyses of such high-dimensional data. The results thus show the value of taking an interdisciplinary approach to chemometric analysis and indicate that large-scale genomic models can be a promising new approach for chemometric analysis that deserve to be evaluated more by experts in the field.

J	Sirola, D; Iskra, V				Sirola, Davor; Iskra, Valentina			THE ANALYSIS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP SUPPORT SYSTEM ON EUROPEAN, CROATIAN AND LOCAL LEVEL	ZBORNIK VELEUCILISTA U RIJECI-JOURNAL OF THE POLYTECHNICS OF RIJEKA			Croatian	Article						small and medium entrepreneurship; entrepreneurship support system; efficiency indicators		Small and medium entrepreneurship development is one of the most important commitments of the European Union, already transposed into clear targets embedded in strategic and operational planning documents. The structure of small and medium enterprises in Croatia, the newest member of the European Union, mostly follows the average structures of the other 27 members, which means that the adoption of the European entrepreneurship support system is becoming an imperative for Croatia. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the actual status of the Croatian entrepreneurship support system, in comparison with other member states of the European Union. The results of the research suggest that Croatia has implemented the majority of priorities and targets defined in strategic European documents on the national level, but considerably less on the local one (the City of Rijeka). The analysis of operational targets shows that Croatia has adopted one-third of the EU recommendations. In the field of monitoring the efficiency of entrepreneurship support measures, the system of European indicators has recently been implemented on the national level, but not on the local one where there are still no preconditions for establishing local databases which would ensure control over public spending of cities and municipalities on entrepreneurship support, as well as control over spending of national funds distributed to entrepreneurs locally.

J	Brunetta, G; Voghera, A				Brunetta, Grazia; Voghera, Angioletta		DAFNE REGIS	RESILIENCE THROUGH ECOLOGICAL NETWORK	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Green infrastructures; Landscape and ecological services; Agro-ecosystems; Resilience		The paper explores the strategic role that urban biodiversity and ecosystem services management, natural infrastructure and adaptive governance approaches can play in making our economies and societies more resilient and in linking human societies and the natural environment. Resilience - a concept that entered the debate on urban governance - means the ability of urban systems, considered as linear-systems, to react to external disturbances by returning to some socio-ecological equilibrium steady-state by overcoming a crisis period (Gunderson & al. 2010, Newman & al. 2009). In this view, green infrastructures can assume a strategic role in restoring and enhancing the ecological and environmental livability in urban areas. Starting from the International and European context, the paper discusses innovative programs and interdisciplinary projects and practices (some cases in Turin Metropolitan Area) to demonstrate how green infrastructures can increase the adaptive capacity of urban systems in term of resilience. They can contribute to increase the ability of European cities to adapt to climate change and to reduce their ecological footprints, to enhance security and life quality.

J	Dustin, DL; Schwab, KA				Dustin, Daniel L.; Schwab, Kern A.			Tripping and Falling into the Future: An Eolithic Perspective	JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						creativity; design mentality; eolithic mentality; innovation; opportunism; strategic planning		Thirty years ago, Dustin and McAvoy (1984) published an essay in Environmental Ethics titled "Toward Environmental Eolithism." The article compared and contrasted two distinct orientations to environmental planning and management: the design mentality and the eolithic mentality. The authors concluded that the more popular design mentality lacked sufficient flexibility and adaptability to maximize performance, and that the more obscure eolithic mentality was a superior orientation to environmental planning and management. in this article we extend the logic of that Environmental Ethics essay to criticize a popular offshoot of the design mentality-strategic planning-as it is commonly conducted in park and recreation administration, and then discuss how an eolithic perspective might complement the strategic planning process. We begin by describing the similarities between strategic phuming and the design mentality as well as the shortcomings of strategic planning in a rapidly changing world. We then consider the eolithic mentality's yin to strategic planning's yang. We stress the futility of planning for a future that cannot be predicted, and, consequently, how important it is for park and recreation administrators to keep an open mind, be opportunistic, and take risks in a work world characterized by serendipity-the discovery of valuable but unforeseen opportunities that strategic planning; by its very nature, cannot anticipate. Finally, We conclude the article by discussing the management implications of both the design and eolithic orientations to park and recreation administration. We anchor our thinking in the management writings of Drucker (2001), Mintzberg's critique of strategic planning (1994), the systems thinking of Meadows (2008) and Ackoff (1983, 1979); and the contributions of other forward-looking theorists renowned for their entrepreneurial spirit and proclivity for proactive leadership.

J	Francis, RA; Reyes-Jones, C				Francis, Royce A.; Reyes-Jones, Cassandra			Decision-Analytic Approach for Water Sustainability Definition: A Higher Education Case Study	JOURNAL OF MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS			English	Article						sustainability definition; decision analysis; urban water sustainability; multi-criteria decision analysis; higher education; strategic planning		The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis approach that can be used to circumscribe the definition of sustainability within an organization or institution with multiple operational divisions. Although our overall definition of sustainability is a process, the George Washington University (GW) definition of water sustainability is articulated through construction of an objective-value hierarchy representing GW's strategic objectives and articulation of strength of preference among the attributes in that hierarchy. This study used multi-criteria decision analysis methods, including structured interviews with four individual stakeholders and swing weighting. Three findings are of note. First, our stakeholders' thinking about their objectives was greatly influenced by perceived constraints and mandatory obligations on institutional performance implied by contracts or tradition. Second, in considering the trade-off weights obtained from the swing-weighting portion of the value assessment, all stakeholders placed similar emphasis on each of the fundamental objectives. Third, because of the decentralized nature of the university, the process through which the value assessment will be achieved must be transparent and accepted by each of the stakeholders supporting sustainability decisions. This case study illustrates a decision-analytic sustainability approach that may be applied to large-scale infrastructure systems, stakeholder engagement and negotiation in sustainability investments or alternatives assessments. Although the commitment to reduce climate impacts has been widespread, there have been fewer publicly announced water initiatives at the university level. At the university level, GW is only one of a handful of universities with a cohesive, visible, water plan. In addition, we demonstrate an approach in which explicit structuring of fundamental sustainability objectives may increase transparency for sustainability definition construction.

Sorption kinetics are assumed to be governed by a first-order rate model, and degradation is assumed to occur in the aqueous (i.e.,mobile) phase only. As an extension of a previously published moment analysis of a model with similar assumptions, an explicit analytical solution is presented for the zeroth, first, and second spatial moments, as well as equations that describe the behavior of the first and second moments at long times. Moment simulations show that when the degradation rate is relatively large compared to the sorption rate, there are time periods in which the first and second spatial moments of the solute concentration distribution (the mean and variance, respectively) decrease over time. At long times, it is seen that the first and second moments increase linearly with time, indicating that velocity and dispersion are constant.

This study analyzed reference models for risk management like ISO (International Organization for Standardization), PMI (Project Management Institute) and SEI (Software Engineering Institute), it was possible to observe that the identification and categorization of risks registers are essential for the appropriate risk management, because the risks are manageable only when identified and documented clearly and accurately. 359 risk records were selected from sixteen IT projects of a brazilian bank. Risks were categorized and grouped according to the taxonomy proposed by SEI and, after analyzing the data, it was possible to identify some problems in the organization: (1) lack of clarity in the requirements specification; (2) conflicts between project managers and functional managers; and (3) instability in the integrated test environment and homologation environment. It is possible to conclude that the proper identification and categorization of risks bring benefits to the organization because it allows presenting the recurrent problems in a strategic vision.

This manuscript traces the evolution of e-marketing and demonstrates the relationship between the Web Presence Index (WPI) of the hospitality sector across a set of hotels. Here WPI of a particular hotel brand is a function of the total web presence across the Website, FaceBook Page, YouTube, Twitter and MakeMyTrip.com. Subsequently, a positive relationship is visible between the Web Presence Index (WPI) for each hotel and further, it's Alexa traffic volume indicates the total online user traffic. This manuscript demonstrates the web presence of hotels through WPI, Alexa, traffic volume, and their weighted calculated score on the basis of the above parameters. The Web Presence Index is indicative of the usability, credibility and persuasiveness of a consumer in the context of hotel websites. It further depicts how hotels can build better relations with customers by recognizing their needs, preferences, complaints and so on.

J	Dyer, RAD				Dyer, Ronald			Exploring the Relevancy of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): A Caribbean University Approach	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Content Strategies; Disruptive Innovation; Disruptive Technologies; E-Learning; MOOC; Technology Adoption		The challenge of Information and Communication Technology Management within the Caribbean university system remains daunting. On the surface there exists constant need to revisit infrastructure, system architecture, software and relevant hardware in keeping with the myriad number of changes across the global technology landscape. However, a greater challenge is emerging rapidly forcing universities across the globe to re-evaluate their strategic direction as it relates to course delivery. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) represent the next frontier for open and distance education; allowing for dispersion of courses (free of charge) to participants with a diverse array of digital content spanning the sciences, arts, humanities and business. MOOCs represent a new thinking for content design/delivery rooted in the transformation of production and knowledge sharing Tapscott & Williams, (2007). University systems regionally as traditional gatekeepers of knowledge must now become au courant to ensure currency and competitiveness. This paper examines MOOCs as a new digital content frontier, their relevance to Caribbean higher education institutions and the challenges that universities face as they become more prevalent. It will also provide insights into the potential strategies for adoption of MOOCs within the Caribbean university system.

J	Franck, A; Kerl, A				Franck, Alexander; Kerl, Alexander			The impact of fund characteristics on the use of analyst forecasts	JOURNAL OF ASSET MANAGEMENT			English	Article						mutual fund trading; sell-side analyst reports; consensus forecasts; institutional investors		This article builds on recent empirical studies that document the general impact of analyst recommendations on mutual fund trading. We argue that the use of analyst research might be a strategic decision depending on the type of mutual fund. Therefore, we identify the funds that trade in accordance with and the funds that trade in contrast to analyst information and analyze the impact of fund characteristics on this investment behavior. Thereby, we detect that fund managers using analyst recommendations for most of their purchase decisions seem to disregard analysts' opinions for their sales and vice versa. Furthermore, well-performing funds that owe some of their prior performance to following sell-side research seem to continue to do so with regard to their buying and selling decisions. Finally, we find some funds to be more persistent in their investment behavior with regard to the intensity they follow analyst forecasts.

Cultural influences on global firms' decisions to cut the strategic brand ties that bind: A commentary essay	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Trademarks; Brand strategy; Brand management; Cross-cultural; Managerial styles; Intangible assets	TRADEMARK DILUTION; SHAREHOLDER VALUE; DETERMINANTS	Today's global firms face increasing pressure to protect their brand identity from encroachments of copycat brands that seek to benefit from associations firms have established in the minds of consumers. This essay is a commentary to the article "Marking your trade: cultural factors in the prolongation of trademarks" by Melnyk, Giarratana and Torres that raises several important issues warranting further attention by researchers. This essay comments on the paper's contributions, limitations, and opportunities contributing to future research about trademark practices and strategies. Furthermore, the essay suggests useful extensions relative to the more general strategic issue of prolongation or abandonment of intangible brand assets in global markets and the dynamic interface between firm-created and consumer-created brand meaning.

Challenging Illicit Bulk Cash Flows: Next Steps for US Law Enforcement	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						border security; bulk cash smuggling; contraband; drug trafficking\		This article examines key issues contributing to the limited success of US Federal law enforcement in disrupting illicit bulk cash flows across the Mexico-US border. It highlights the negative consequences of narco-dollars on the Mexican formal economy and social fabric and examines the limitations in federal law enforcement's strategic approach to disrupting these cross-border flows. It illustrates the overwhelming challenge to interdiction efforts on the US-Mexico border and calls for a whole-of-government approach in focusing on disrupting the processes that bind criminal group interactions rather than the current mainstream focus on "kingpin" elimination and singular group dismantlement. The article concludes that law enforcement must be as agile and adaptive as its adversaries, with a continuous need for self-assessment based on the evolving dynamics of the threat landscape.

J	de Colle, S; Bennett, AM				de Colle, Simone; Bennett, Ann Marie			State-induced, Strategic, or Toxic? An Ethical Analysis of Tax Avoidance Practices	BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ETHICS JOURNAL			English	Article						tax avoidance; tax evasion; toxic avoidance; tax policy; multinational enterprises; stakeholder responsibility	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY	Tax avoidance practices by Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Starbucks and others are increasingly under scrutiny both from a legal and an ethical perspective. In 2013, the OECD launched an 'Action Plan' to encourage the G20 countries to address Base Erosion and Profit Shifting through an internationally co-ordinated approach, arguing that tax avoidance represents a risk for tax revenues and tax fairness, potentially "undermining taxpayers voluntary compliance." The analysis of tax avoidance in the existing business ethics literature suffers from a black-and-white approach, contending either that tax avoidance is unethical (e.g. Prebble and Prebble 2010) or that, being legal, tax avoidance is also ethical (e.g. Houghton 1979). However, we believe that within tax avoidance practices there are important distinctions to be made. In this paper, we analyze the ethics of tax avoidance by identifying three different forms of avoidance practices: state-induced, strategic, and toxic avoidance. We develop a more nuanced approach reviewing both the ethical arguments in defense and the ethical issues associated with each form of tax avoidance. Finally, we propose an ethical framework that could assist executives and policy-makers in their decision-making concerning tax avoidance.

One of its aspects of development draws the connection with the all the present endeavours to manage work efficiency of the employees and all the human resources of the company. The work efficiency presumes that the good job is designed using the motivational, mechanistic, biological or peceptual approuch, considering that every employee won't do its best if the design of the operations are not according to its qualifications. Managing the job design, work efficiency and the integral connection of the human resources and strategic management along with the right strategy are the challenges confronting the today's strategic management.

J	Park, KM; Jung, K; Noh, KC				Park, Kyung Min; Jung, Kiwon; Noh, Kyung Choon			Strategic action and customer mobility: Antecedents and consequences of strategic actions in the Korean mobile telecommunication service industry	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic action; Organizational learning; Competitive action; Alliance tendency; Mobile telecommunication service; Customer mobility	COMPETITIVE REPERTOIRES; DYNAMIC-MODEL; LOCAL SEARCH; RED-QUEEN; PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATION; ALLIANCES; NETWORKS; MOMENTUM; INERTIA	This paper investigates the sources and consequences of strategic actions in the Korean mobile telecommunication service industry. Based on competitive dynamics research and an organizational learning perspective, it suggests hypotheses and tests them with monthly data on service providers' competitive and alliance actions, as well as statistics on monthly subscribers during 2002-2007. We show the positive effects of a firm's own experience, other firms' strategic actions, and firms' alliance tendencies on the likelihood of firm-level competitive action and alliance. We also find that negative performance feedback accelerates the mimetic influence of rival firms' competitive actions and that positive performance feedback strengthens the momentum effect of a firm's own alliance experience on the likelihood of alliance. Both competitive actions and alliances appear to influence customer mobility across firms in a complex manner. Based on customer mobility data, this study finds that alliances increase market dynamism, that is, customer mobility. It also shows that competitive actions, in general, serve to effectively attract switching customers from rivals.

Like company, like self: a multilevel argument explaining firms' level of engagement in corporate social responsibility	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article							IDENTITY THEORY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; STAKEHOLDER THEORY; UPPER ECHELONS; MANAGEMENT; MANAGERIAL; POWER; ORGANIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; LEGITIMACY	This conceptual paper examines how managers, acting as organisational agents, can influence their firm's level of engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR). With CSR considered as a strategic choice, this paper undertakes to model the largely under-studied processes through which managers proactively pursue the enactment of their identity - their self and their social role in their position of power in the firm's management team. The study offers a new framework connecting these multilevel influences, suggesting that firms present the highest level of CSR when led by managers who intrinsically value CSR, who perceive their social role as a salient identity, and who have the ability to exercise power in their management team. Implications for managers and researchers complete this article.

J	Robson, K; Trimble, R; MacIntyre, J				Robson, Kenneth; Trimble, Robert; MacIntyre, John			The inhibitors and enablers of maintenance and manufacturing strategy: a cross-case analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Linkage; Manufacturing strategy; Maintenance strategy; Inhibitors; Enablers		This paper concerns the findings from case studies carried out at four North East of England manufacturing plants. The research was part of a wider investigation into the "linkage between maintenance and manufacturing strategies and the effects on manufacturing performance''. The initial study began with a comprehensive literature review, which confirmed a dearth of models and frameworks surrounding the topic. To close this gap, a new conceptual model was developed. This defined the configuration and the key processes and linkages involved. Based on the model, a new diagnostic tool and questionnaire evolved. These were used to measure the status of maintenance and manufacturing strategies at the manufacturing sites. The research produced large quantities of rich data via semi-structured interviews and these were analysed and coded. This generated the information necessary to complete a questionnaire and diagnostic footprint for each site. Importantly, the analysis of the data identified a number of specific inhibitors and enablers to strategic success and these are discussed in detail. A cross-case analysis of the data is also presented, offering five generic recommendations for practitioners to consider.

An Inexpensive Feeding Bioassay Technique for Stored-Product Insects	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Tribolium castaneum; Coleoptera; Tenebrionidae; feeding bioassay; stored-product insect	TRIBOLIUM-CASTANEUM HERBST; ESSENTIAL OIL; FLOUR	We used the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum Herbst ( Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to compare three feeding bioassay techniques using flour disks. The area (scanner or digital photographs) and mass (sensitive balance) of the same flour disks were measured daily for 1 or 2 wk to assess feeding by insects. The loss in mass and area over 4 h was measured, as some variation over time was noticed in the disks with no insects feeding on them. The gravimetric method correlated well with both measurements of the area for the disks held in a growth chamber: scanner (R-2 = 0.96), digital photography (R-2 = 0.96). There was also a high correlation (R-2 = 0.86) between the disk weight and area scanned at normal lab conditions. There were differences in the percentage of the disks remaining over time depending on the temperature and whether they were weighed or scanned. Measuring the mass of the disks resulted in a relatively larger percent of disk remaining compared with the scanned area. Mass measurements required a sensitive balance, handling of the disks and the insects, and appeared slightly more sensitive to humidity and temperature changes over time. Scanning the disks requires flat bed scanner access but less handling of both insects and disks. Digital photographs could be taken quickly, requiring less equipment, although photographs had to be further processed to determine area. Scanning or taking digital photographs of flour disk area was an effective technique for measuring insect feeding.	[Clark, Erin L.; Isitt, Rylee; Huber, Dezene P.

J	Kim, G; Kim, Y; Kang, J				Kim, Gyutai; Kim, Yoonbai; Kang, Jangha			Another way to understand the real options value for engineers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Binomial lattice model; Opportunity cost; Real options value; Strategic net present value; The cost of waiting		This paper is concerned with explaining real options values (ROV) using an opportunity cost concept. Through exploring the opportunity costs embedded in the ROV, we hope that the following presentation will be helpful for engineers to understand the meaning of the terminologies relevant to the ROV. With this belief, we performed the work under which the real investment project was delayed by 1 year only. The three different opportunity costs were explored in this work for the purpose of the paper as follows: an interest earning opportunity, an opportunity loss, and an expected opportunity gain. A short numerical example was demonstrated to show that the real options value derived with the three opportunity costs was equivalent to the value done with the binomial lattice model proposed by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein.

J	Wad, P				Wad, Peter			Solidarity Action in Global Labor Networks. Four Cases of Workplace Organizing at Foreign Affiliates in the Global South	NORDIC JOURNAL OF WORKING LIFE STUDIES			English	Article						Global labor network; industrial dispute; international labor rights; labor campaign; Malaysia; the Philippines; Sri Lanka; transnational corporations; Turkey		Globalization transforms workforces of transnational corporation from predominantly home country-dominated workforces into foreign-dominated, multinational workforces. Thus, the national grounding of trade unions as the key form of labor organizing is challenged by new multinational compositions and cross-border relocations of corporate employment affecting working conditions of employees and trade unions in local places. We assume that economic globalization is characterized by expanding global corporate network of vertically and horizontally integrated (equity-based) and disintegrated (nonequity-based) value chains. We also assume that globalization can both impede and enable labor empowerment. Based on these premises the key question is, how can labor leverage effective power against management in global corporate networks? This question is split into two subquestions: a) How can labor theoretically reorganize from national unions and industrial relations institutions into global labor networks that allow prolabor improvement in global workplaces? b) How and why has labor in a globalized economy secured the core International Labor Organization (ILO) international labor right to organize companies and conduct collective bargaining? The Global Labor Network perspective is adopted as an analytical framework. Empirically, a comparative case methodology is applied comprising four more or less successful industrial disputes where labor achieved the right to organize and undertake collective bargaining. The disputes took place in affiliated factories of foreign transnational corporations located in Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. The conclusion is that the combination of global labor capabilities and global labor strategizing must generate strategic labor power that adequately matches the weaknesses of the counterpart's global corporate network in order to achieve prolabor outcomes. The most efficient solidarity action was leveraged by a cross-border alliance of workplace collectives, national industrial unions, and a global union federation using global framework agreements (GFAs) with key customers of the employer. The least efficient campaign relied primarily on domestic developing country state institutions supported by a foreign labor nongovernmental organization (NGO).

J	Abbas, RZ; Murad, HS; Yazdani, N; Asghar, A				Abbas, Rana; Murad, Hasan; Yazdani, Naveed; Asghar, Ali			Extending "Kahn's model of personal engagement and disengagement at work" with reference to existential attributes A case study of HR managers in Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Pakistan; Existentialism; HR managers; Kahn's model		Purpose - This study seeks to explore the existential meaningfulness of HR managers' work. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of four existential attributes that are death, responsibility, alienation and meaningfulness, on the work of HR managers. The study also asserts that the work of HR managers has an existential dimension to it. It also argues that HR managers have human qualities. They react to human predicament and need emotional identification with their work and organization. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on the responses of HR managers developed on the basis of an interview guide specifically designed for this purpose. The data have been collected through extensive and in-depth field interactions with HR managers working in diverse organizations. The research approach taken here is to focus on the discrete moments of role performance of HR managers that represent microcosms of the larger complexity. Those moments are windows into the multiplicity of factors that are constantly relevant to person-role dynamics. Focusing on specific moments of work role performance of HR managers is like using the zoom lens of a camera: a distant stationary image is brought close and revealed as a series of innumerable leaps of engagement and falls of disengagement. Findings - The study brings out the emotional and human dilemmas of HR managers working in public and private sector organizations. While discussing and linking Kahn's model with Sartrean thoughts can provide unique perspective within the strategic human resource management especially in Pakistani organizations which was missing not only in Kahn's model but also in management literature. Originality/value - The study makes a fresh inquiry into the nature of HRM and the existential realities experienced by the HR managers at work place. The study is unique because of its extensive field interactions based on a well-designed interview guide hitherto unapplied in the organization studies.

S	Acquaah, M		Zoogah, DB		Acquaah, Moses			CONSTRUCT MEASUREMENT IN STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH IN AFRICA	ADVANCING RESEARCH METHODOLOGY IN THE AFRICAN CONTEXT: TECHNIQUES, METHODS, AND DESIGNS	Research Methodology in Strategy and Management		English	Article; Book Chapter							STATISTICAL POWER; PERFORMANCE; ECONOMY	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to review the literature on strategic management in Africa with special emphasis on how strategy constructs have been measured and present a roadmap to help improve strategy research in Africa. Design/methodology/approach - A content analysis of empirical research on strategic management published in journals using data from Africa from 2000 to 2013 is conducted to examine construct measurement practices. Findings - The findings indicate that the average sample sizes in strategy research in Africa is not large as strategy research in general, and have low statistical power. While the studies rely heavily on single-indicator measures, there were also several studies using scale or multiple measures that report reliabilities. Research limitations - Limitations of the research include small number of studies used, inability to examine journal effects' of the findings due to few numbers of papers from many of the journals, and lack of examination of the influence of the context and topical areas of the articles on the use of the construct measurement techniques. Practical implications - The study provides information about the use of construct measurement techniques and power analysis in strategy research in Africa. It further encourages the use of larger sample sizes, the examination of power, and more focus on variables which allow the assessment of reliabilities and validity. Originality and value - Little is known about construct measurement practices of the empirical research in and about Africa in the discipline of strategic management. This chapter builds on extant research on construct measurement issues in strategic management research, but with the unique value-added contribution of focusing on the African environment where the discipline is beginning to take hold.

J	Adejuwon, OO				Adejuwon, Olawale Oladipo			Regulation and strategic group dynamics of the Nigerian telecommunications industry	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Competitive dynamics; Competitive actions; Industry regulation; Nigerian telecommunications Industry; Strategic groups		Purpose - In order to achieve a desirable level of market efficiency, regulators need to identify the strategic groups within an industry and understand the way the constituent groups relate to one another. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In the current study, factors that may lead to strategic group formation were developed and used as clustering variables in a k-means cluster statistical analysis to categorize the firms into strategic groups. The factors used are entry costs, timing of entry, technology type and scope of operations. In addition, the number and type of competitive actions employed by the firms in the industry were identified by structured content analysis of a public source. The competitive actions were used to examine the dynamics of the resulting groups within the context of competitive behavior, resource and scope commitments and corporate social responsibility (CSR) actions. In addition, chi(2) analysis was employed to ascertain the likelihood that actions of a firm will be responded to by firms from the same group or from outside the group. Findings - License fees was found to be the most significant clustering variable. The study also showed that groups with significantly higher license fees carried out considerably more competitive actions, had higher resource and scope commitments and executed more CSR actions. In addition, the study revealed significantly more competition within strategic groups than between groups. Research limitations/implications - The absence of financial records for firms in the sample necessitated the use of CSR activity as a measure of firm performance. Some empirical studies have shown strong links between CSR and firm performance. Practical implications - The study revealed high mobility barriers which prevent ease of movement of firms in the industry from one strategic group to the other. Therefore regulators who wish to promote competition must do so by identifying the strategic groups with significant market power and permitting entry not by lowering entry barriers but by allowing the entry of firms with proven resources similar to the firms in those groups and to stipulate similar commitments in entry conditions. The results also offer management practitioners an insight into competitive behavior in the industry. Originality/value - The study utilized a unique data set (competitive actions of firms in the Nigerian Telecommunications industry as reported in the media) in contributing to empirical studies on competitive dynamics and strategic group literature.

J	Ahmed, ZU				Ahmed, Zahir Uddin			Management control issues in Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs): an evaluation of contingency factors and potential for future research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING			English	Article						management control; contingency factors; not-for-profit; NGOs; non-governmental organisations; development organisations		This study examines how the contingency factors identified by Chenhall impact on the Management Control Systems (MCSs) of NGOs. Based on literature review, it finds that the management controls of for-profit organisations and NGOs do not follow similar paths as the nature and objectives of the two types are different. Common problems in controlling NGOs are the ambiguous organisational objectives, difficulties in measuring performance effectively, the need to discharge multiple accountabilities, and the balancing between voluntarism and professionalism. MCSs of NGOs should maintain transparency, ensure both top-down and bottom-up accountability, link national and organisational strategic planning to day-to day operations, crystallise their objectives and goals, in addition to monitoring plans and acting as a basis for organisational adaptation.

J	Akingbade, WA				Akingbade, Waidi Adeniyi			Competitive Strategies and Improved Performance of Selected Nigeria Telecommunication Companies	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION			English	Article						competitive strategy; performance; lower pricing; customer satisfaction		The influence of globalization in telecommunication companies has greatly increased the level of competition in the industry and they are forced to be competitive to survive. Different types of strategies are put in place in order to be profitable and competitive. All these strategies are directed to attract, retain and maintain customers for continuous profitability. However, majority of them hardly measure the impact of their strategic innovation on their customers. The paper seeks to explore the influence of competitive strategies embarked upon by selected telecommunication companies in Nigeria on their performance. The paper also examines how competitive strategies could be implemented for improved customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty. Three null hypotheses were postulated to test the relationship between lower prices and customer satisfaction, uninterrupted trunk services and customer loyalty, and customer complaint handling and retention. Only customers using telephone service were selected as respondents from Lagos State. The state was stratified in to 20 local government council area and questionnaires were distributed to 125 respondents in each of them. The completion rate of the questionnaire in each of them is between 103 and 110. Survey research design was adopted to carry out the study. A structured questionnaire was designed and validated through the construct validity and tested for confirmation using the KMO measure of sampling adequacy. It was also made reliable using Cronbach's Alpha test. From the study, findings revealed relationship between competitive strategies and customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty. The findings revealed that there is a relationship between competitive strategies, its constituents and performance of telecommunication companies. It is recommended that universal mobile telecommunication services (UMTS) operators should adopt the culture of competitive strategies since it can impact on their performance for achieving competitive advantage.

FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL ADEQUACY: NEW GRANGER CAUSALITY EVIDENCE FROM AFRICAN COUNTRIES	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article						foreign direct investment; Africa's economic development; regulatory framework; multinational corporations	DETERMINANTS; FDI	The strategic importance of foreign direct investment in the contemporary economies has been tremendous. While various countries (developed and developing economies) have benefitted from the direct and spillover effects of FDI, which range from improved technology and knowledge diffusion through to individual and corporate capability enhancement, FDI outflow remains largely channelled to the developed countries, and the rapidly developing countries in Asia and South America. Evidence suggests that the development-enhancing effects of FDI are felt more highly in the developing economies, such as economies in Africa. However, FDI inflow to the developing economies has been very low. Using data generated from the African Development Indicators (ADI) between 1980 and 2008 in econometric estimations, this paper finds that government policies (especially fiscal and monetary policies) play significant roles in facilitating FDI inflow to the African countries studied. The study thereby suggests an improved regulatory framework to make Africa more attractive to inflow of FDI.

J	Arnaboldi, M; Lapsley, I				Arnaboldi, Michela; Lapsley, Irvine			Enterprise-wide risk management and organizational fit: a comparative study	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS-PEOPLE AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						Budgeting; Case study; Enterprise risk management; Managerial control	FINANCIAL RISK; AUDIT; SYSTEMS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse enterprise risk management (ERM), its organizational translation and fit, investigating in particular its impact on a major control process: budgeting. Design/methodology/approach - The research was carried out with a multiple case study approach including three companies in the UK. This approach was chosen to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of ERM within each of the organizations and the factors shaping its achievements. Findings - Three main issues emerged. The first is related specifically to ERM implementations and its variety in practice. Second, ERM champions emerged as central in shaping the managerial usefulness of ERM. Third, the cases showed diversity of practice in term of integration with budgeting which range from a voluntary full integration to an voluntary separation. Practical implications - The cases analysed highlighted that the integration between risk and other control processes is a challenge but also a strategic choice. Although conceding that ERM implementation is not linear, companies should reflect upon the type of relations they would like to have between different processes of control. Originality/value - The results of the paper explored ERM organizational fit, evidencing variety in practice and theoretically discussing how this diversity is linked to organizational and technical issues.

J	Avkiran, NK				Avkiran, Necmi Kemal			Probing organizational efficiency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Organizational efficiency; Peer benchmarking; Network DEA		Purpose - In investigating the performance of multidivisional organizations, ability to account for each division's importance and contribution enhances the deftness of resource allocation and targeting desired outcomes. With this motivation, the author aims to introduce network data envelopment analysis ( NDEA) from operations research in this conceptual article and discuss how two articles from this journal can be extended using this approach. Design/methodology/approach - NDEA was first developed to deliver a more in-depth understanding of underlying sources of operational inefficiency. Thus, NDEA can be viewed as a peer benchmarking method useful in comparing performance of organizations and identifying divisional inefficiencies that may detract from overall performance. NDEA's ability to capture interactions among multiple variables in an objective manner based on actual observed data rather than sample averages is one of its key advantages. Findings - The author discusses how NDEA can be applied in organisational analysis by examining two articles from this journal. Briefly commenting on one of the cases here, the author shows that a network can be defined as the interacting divisions of cultural norms and structural forms. The potential improvements (i.e. horizontal re-alignment) indicated by NDEA can guide management on the extent organisational alignment that could be changed in reaching strategic aims. The author's theoretical model is conducive to assessing the amount and direction of change from the proposed alignment model in a multi-criteria framework - characteristics embraced by NDEA. Practical implications - Given the hierarchical nature of organizations where employees are nested in work groups or teams, groups nested in departments or divisions, and divisions nested in organizations, application of NDEA at various levels of analysis is feasible. Originality/value - NDEA's ability to account for each division's importance or assign desired weights in what-if analyses adds to flexibility in managerial decision-making regarding allocation of resources, or re-alignment of processes and targeting of desired outcomes. Such a method that does not assume independence among multiple performance measures provides additional assurance to those concerned about shortcomings of additive scales in complex organizations.

J	Baaziz, A; Quoniam, L				Baaziz, Abdelkader; Quoniam, Luc			Contribution to reduce risks related to strategic decisions in new uncertain competitive environments: The case of Algerian State-Owned Firms	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE STUDIES IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Strategic Intelligence Information System; Knowledge Management; Competitive Intelligence; Business Intelligence; Decision-making under Uncertainty; Risk	WEAK SIGNALS	The aim of this paper is to show the complexity of the political, legal, social and economic environments where the Algerian State-Owned Firms operate. These environments are qualified by "uncertainty" given the instability of the different parameters cited. Since 1988, Algeria has initiated deeper economic reforms supported by significant legislation and international agreements. In this uncertain environment, Algerian State-Owned Firm cannot rely only on their internal capabilities. They should, create partnerships, both with suppliers, subcontractors, universities and even competitors. There is a need for these firms to: Transform their organization to a new form improved for unexpected events and enough resilience to adapt to uncertain environments. Build a Strategic Intelligence Information System able to facilitate decisionmaking and reduce risks inherent to the strategic choices. Find ways to reverse choice when unexpected events occur. This article shows there is a need to handle the following risks: Inertia against the process of organizational transformation, wrong understanding of the received signals from the environment and poor reaction of the decision-maker to signals and events in the environment.

J	Banerjee, S; Sharma, A				Banerjee, Subhojit; Sharma, Anuj			Improving unsustainable livelihood through marketing interventions A case on rickshaw pullers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategic marketing; Improvement; Income; Intervention; Self-development; Skills training		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe an initiative to improve the daily earnings of a rickshaw puller by training them to retail branded FMCG products based on a "bulk buying retail selling" model. The paper is based on the findings of a survey conducted 112 rickshaw pullers in a semi-urban district of eastern India. It also dwells on the business of rickshaw pulling and the socio-economic status of the rickshaw puller. Critical issues related to the sustainability and the future of such interventions on a large scale has also been discussed. Design/methodology/approach - An initial survey of 112 rickshaw pullers was done using a structured schedule that captured data related to age, literacy level, earnings per day, ownership and working hours. Some additional aspects related to socio-cultural aspects were also collected as an unstructured interview. A secondary survey from 107 respondents representing different sections of the society who frequently use rickshaw as a means for transport was also done to take an opinion on intervention issues. Findings - Findings of the paper suggest that rickshaw pullers have three distinct strategic advantages of literacy, access and mobility, which makes them a potent resource for marketing intervention. Research limitations/implications - The paper reflects on a systematic intervention plan that can change the socio-economic pattern of rickshaw pulling. A possibility of contributory roles from garage owners and wholesellers is also explored. The proposed scheme may also bail-out the small-scale industries and handicraft businesses in villages. Major limitations of the research are long-term sustainability and large-scale implementation of the proposed model. Practical implications - The paper can act as a manual for small entrepreneurs and NGOs working in the social-development area for implementing schemes targeted at rickshaw pullers. The paper also has valuable points for the consideration of policy makers. Originality/value - The research has given insights in to the livelihood aspect of one of the most essential but neglected modes of transport, i.e. rickshaw pulling. The paper has also identified key strengths that rickshaw pulling has, which otherwise is considered purely physical and low-skilled job.

J	Bhattacharya, K				Bhattacharya, Kaushik			Strategic Entry and the Relationship between Number of Independent and Non-Independent Candidates: A Study of Parliamentary Elections in India	ASIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Strategic Entry; Independent Candidates; Election; Cloning; Prisoner's Dilemma; Fragmentation		Elections in developing countries like India have sometimes attracted a large number of independent candidates. As this type of phenomenon is unheard of in developed countries, the article attempts to examine what kind of strategic settings can explain the emergence of such candidates. The article observes that a major factor behind the emergence of independents under first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral systems with weak regulatory checks could be the surreptitious strategic floating of such candidates by major political parties. Accordingly, the article hypothesizes a strong positive relationship between the number of non-independent and independent candidates in such democracies. The article also hypothesizes that the break-up of one or two-party dominance in these democracies and subsequent political churning may trigger such a relationship or strengthen it further. Empirical results for all parliamentary elections in India since 1962 reveal that during the first four elections in the reference period (e.g. during 1962-1977) when political fragmentation was low, the relationship was weak. However, subsequent political fragmentation in India during the 1980s gave birth to a new class of independents whose entries into elections were opportunistic in nature, leading to a strong relationship between the above two variables during this period.

J	Boshoff, C				Boshoff, Christo			THE INFLUENCE OF 'BUFFERING' VARIABLES ON CLIENTS' WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN RETRIBUTION BEHAVIOUR AFTER A SERVICE FAILURE	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article						buffering variables; service failure; service recovery; negative word-of mouth; brand superiority; corporate reputation	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; SWITCHING COSTS; BRAND EQUITY; REPUTATION; MEDIATORS; RECOVERY; IMPACT; MODEL	Much of the current service failure and recovery literature centres on reactive, post hoc measures that managers can take to address service failure. More importantly, much of the reported research has focused on managerial mechanisms under the direct control of service managers. This study shows that by viewing their responsibilities more broadly than only their narrow service-related goals, service managers can do much to prevent disgruntled clients from switching to competing service providers. A thousand clients of a commercial bank who complained about a service failure completed an online questionnaire. Following a thorough assessment of the construct validity of the measurement model, the mediating role of brand superiority and corporate reputation was assessed by means of structural equation modeling. The results reveal that both brand superiority and reputation mediate the relationship between negative word-of-mouth and intentions to switch to a competing service provider, following a service failure. The results show that by enhancing the firm's brand superiority and corporate reputation, service firms can build a 'buffer' that can deter clients who have suffered a service failure from switching to a competing service provider. In other words, service managers should broaden their organisational involvement by participating in activities such as strategic planning, corporate reputation management, and the planning of brand strategies and positioning strategies, as these variables can prevent complaining clients from ending their relationship with the offending service provider. The results, by implication, caution service managers against a myopic view of their role in the service organisation.

J	Botla, L; Kondur, H				Botla, Lakshmaiah; Kondur, Harigopal			Rethinking organisational goals in the context of Indian ethos	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						rethinking; organisational goals; Indian ethos; firm theory		The present organisational goals are examined and evaluated from the perspective of Indian ethos to distinguish organisational goals into causal goals and outcome goals. If organisational strategy focuses on consequences rather than on causes the true potential of an organisation may not be actualised hence, rethinking organisational goals makes an attempt to uncover organisational causal goals so as to focus organisational energy at the strategic points. The strategic points of organisational causal goals are also identified as the intersection points of individual goals and societal goals and that provides the conceptualisation of the organisation from human-perspective to propose four organisational causal goals as knowledge management, competitiveness, corporate entrepreneurship and socio technical systems. These organisational causal goals are interpreted as human goals-based theory of the firm.

Such decisions have to be done often in time pressure without sufficient analysis, regarding the consequences of the decision in terms of plan and efficiency of testing. To support test managers in such situations, we propose a simulation of planned test process before its real run, allowing also monitoring and evaluation of running testing process. The simulation is disclosing hidden rules, consequences and bottlenecks in the particular testing process and brings more information for managerial decisions during the project.

The PDM contributes to the strategic guidance and provides clear direction for designers in the early stage of product development. The GP model helps in making key tradeoffs between both satisfactions of customer and designers during the QFD planning process. Focusing on determining a set of engineering characteristics (ECs) that most effectively meet customer requirements (CRs), our explicit model takes into consideration the customer's preferences(best customer perceptions of CRs on the target market), the designers' preferences (product design strategies of the company, market competition, financial factors and other design restrictions), and the uncertainty of data of the decision-making environment.

J	Cooper, E; Kish, A				Cooper, Elizabeth; Kish, Andrew			Executive compensation and securitization: pre-and post-crisis	JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE			English	Article						Governance; Banking; Securitization; Executive compensation; Financial crisis	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; CEO COMPENSATION; PAY; PERFORMANCE; RISK; MANAGEMENT; INCENTIVES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study bank executive compensation and securitization, two important strategic developments in finance that are central to the debate on the cause of the crisis. Design/methodology/approach - We study the relationship between securitization and executive pay in a sample of US banks from 2001 to 2010, using a series of multivariate regression models to test our hypotheses. Findings - Bank Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay exhibits a positive pay-for-performance relationship. Since the crisis, this relationship is weakened. For banks that securitize, we find that prior to the crisis, higher securitization activity led to higher CEO compensation levels. While we do not find that securitization is related to bank CEO pay gap (the difference between CEO and the next-highest paid bank executive), we do see that bank ratings are a factor in pay gap and compensation level. Research limitations/implications - Bank regulatory ratings influence the relationship between compensation and securitization. Also, the relationship differs pre- and post-crisis. Originality/value - Our study is unique for several reasons. First, we look at the relationship between compensation and securitization over a time period that includes the recent financial crisis. Second, we include an analysis of pay gap. Third, we include bank regulatory ratings, which are proprietary and therefore not available for use in many banking studies.

J	de Salas, K; Huxley, C				de Salas, Kristy; Huxley, Craig			Enhancing visualisation to communicate and execute strategy Strategy-to-Process Maps	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategy execution; Business process; Strategy Maps	DECISION; SIGMA	Purpose - Developing an organisational, business, or corporate strategy is an important process which sets the direction and the scope for the business, over a period of time. While any organisation can create their own strategy, not all strategies are well executed and lead to business success. What is required is a process that provides a holistic understanding of an organisational strategy, and clear links between the elements of the strategy and the organisational processes that will be central to its execution. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes three case studies of medium-sized organisations that were the research context in which the methodology for developing and representing Strategy-to-Process Maps was developed and iteratively refined. Findings - Each of these three case organisations had identified a need to better understand their strategic objectives by a stronger visual representation of the components of their strategy, as well as a need to identify how their daily operational tasks contributed to, or distracted from, the achievement of their strategic goals. These cases assisted in the creation of a method of both facilitating better understanding of strategy through visualisation, and better execution through linking strategy to process. This methodology resulted in the employees of these organisations gaining a much stronger understanding of the strategic directions of the organisation and improved the three elements of effective strategy execution: visibility; leverage and responsiveness. Originality/value - Strategy-to-Process Maps provide a new way in which organisations can communicate without reliance on any specific strategy development methodology; and can execute their strategy more effectively by linking it closely with organisational processes.

J	de Waard, E; Volberda, HW; Soeters, J				de Waard, Erik; Volberda, Henk W.; Soeters, Joseph			Decentralization and decomposability: determinants of responsive crisis deployment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Crisis management; Responsiveness; Defence; Modular design; Organizational sensing	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY; MODULARITY; KNOWLEDGE; PRODUCT; ORGANIZATIONS; EXPLORATION; AMBIDEXTERITY; COORDINATION	Purpose - Crisis management entails among other things developing organizational systems that are capable of reacting to unpredictable and different types of crises. It also involves designing cohesive operational elements to deal with the local dynamics of an actual crisis situation. This challenge of responsiveness - where organizations simultaneously need to react to change demands of different task environments - has hardly been investigated in management theory. The purpose of this paper is to initiate to shed more light on this blind spot. Design/methodology/approach - Modular organizing and organizational sensing are introduced as key drivers of organizational responsiveness. Based on a large-scale survey among 1,200 senior officers the study investigates how these two variables have influenced the responsiveness of the Netherlands armed forces for crisis response deployment. Findings - The findings indicate that the level of modularization is an important facilitator of organizational responsiveness. Organizational systems that are made up of semi-autonomous work groups are in a better position to simultaneously live up to the change demands of different environmental levels than organizations that follow a fine-grained modularization approach. Originality/value - It uses the military crisis response organization as an exemplary case for project-based organzations in general to take advantage of.

J	Elmaci, O				Elmaci, Orhan			A model proposal concerning balance scorecard application integrated with resource consumption accounting in enterprise performance management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP			English	Article						Competitive Power; Resource Consumption Accounting (RCA); Activity-based Costing (ABC); Balance Scorecard (BSC); Matrix Approach; Performance Evaluation Model		The present study intended to investigate the "Balance Scorecard (BSC) model integrated with Resource Consumption Accounting (RCA)" which helps to evaluate the enterprise as matrix structure in its all parts. It aims to measure how much tangible and intangible values (assets) of enterprises contribute to the enterprises. In other words, it measures how effectively, actively, and efficiently these values (assets) are used. In short, it aims to measure sustainable competency of enterprises. As expressing the effect of tangible and intangible values (assets) of the enterprise on the performance in mathematical and statistical methods is insufficient, it is targeted that RCA Method integrated with BSC model is based on matrix structure and control models. The effects of all complex factors in the enterprise on the performance (productivity and efficiency) estimated algorithmically with cause and effect diagram. The contributions of matrix structures for reaching the management functional targets of the enterprises that operate in market competitive environment increasing day to day, is discussed. So in the context of modern management theories, as a contribution to BSC approach which is in the foreground in today's administrative science of enterprises in matrix organizational structures, multidimensional performance evaluation model-RCA integrated with BSC Model proposal-is presented as strategic planning and strategic evaluation instrument.

J	Fonseca, L; Leite, D; Lima, V				Fonseca, Luis; Leite, David; Lima, Vanda			SIX SIGMA METHODOLOGIES: IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPACTS ON PORTUGUESE SMALL AND MEDIUM COMPANIES (SMES)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Six Sigma; Quality Management; Quality Improvement; SMEs		Six Sigma is a disciplined approach for dramatically reducing defects and producing measurable financial results (Anand, 2006; Linderman et al. 2003). It should not be a simple statistical tool, but rather a strategic management approach by supporting key projects aligned with the business goals and customer requirements. Although associated with considerable Return on Investments, there is not enough evidence of Six Sigma application within Portuguese companies. It is the aim of this exploratory research to study Six Sigma utilization by Portuguese Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The descriptive analysis and the statistical tests carried out, point to lack of knowledge with this Methodology (Higher at Top Management level) and a sense of comfort with the existing management systems (mainly ISO 9001). The authors recommend increasing Six Sigma training and education and additional studies to gather further knowledge and contribute to more competitive and sustainable organizations.

J	Gomes, D; Asseiro, V; Ribeiro, N				Gomes, Daniel; Asseiro, Vanda; Ribeiro, Neuza			Socially Responsible Internal Communication? Analysing the Combined Effect of CSR and Internal Communication on Employees' Affective Bond to Organization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARKETING COMMUNICATION AND NEW MEDIA			Portuguese	Article						Internal Communication; Corporate Social Responsibility; Affective Commitment		Positive organizational differentiation between competitors is a critical matter for every organization in current economic scenarios. This "La Palisse" truth is obviously related to the fact that organizations deal with extreme difficulties in what regards valid ways of developing themselves with efficiency and with efficacy, as a natural consequence of integrating widespread competitiveness-based economies. In addition, current economic crisis scenario (notably in the European Union) has brought severe challenges to organizations, which have sped up the necessity of quality, innovation, organizational change or business ethics (e.g. Gomes, Asseiro & Ribeiro, 2013). Internal Communication (IC) is a strategic management area that directly deals with the internal publics of organizations (their workers). IC strategy follows the approach that information within an organization is a relevant resource, in such way, that its proper use when accompanied by inclusion actions regarding the internal publics brings them a relevant sense of awareness (D'Almeida & Libart, 2000). Curiously, this idea of vigilance and of the building of a supportive organization towards its human resources is also present in Corporate Social Responsibility's (CSR) guidelines (e.g. Neves & Bento, 2005). When discussing CSR and its contributions for management, we become immediately alerted to the prospects of understanding its impact on effective IC management practices, notably on the employee-organization relationship improvement issues. In this matter, the existing literature is consistent in associating to both areas, directly or indirectly, several interesting contributions regarding critical indicators of individual performance at work, such as commitment, awareness or satisfaction (e.g. Brault, 1992; Brammer, Millington, & Rayton, 2007). However, despite of the amount of theoretical reasoning accumulated over the years regarding the importance of IC and CSR, these two areas still linger to be associated with the prediction of relevant individual indicators in joint models of analysis, such as employee commitment. Following these considerations, and using a quantitative methodology, this study's main purpose is to investigate how employees' affective commitment can be predicted by IC (considering its different axis), and evaluating if Internal CSR's orientations play a significant contextual role in this relationship. As such, we propose that Internal CSR's orientations will have a moderating influence on the positive association between the IC's axis and employee affective commitment, as we are expecting CSR to strengthen the IC-Commitment relation. With this model of analysis, we will be able to evaluate if Socially Responsible IC brings an added-value to employee commitment purposes. In this sense, the present study aims to explore an answer to the following question: do Internal CSR's guidelines moderate the relationship between IC and employees' affective commitment?.

J	Goncharuk, AG				Goncharuk, Anatoliy G.			Competitive benchmarking technique for "the followers": a case of Ukrainian dairies	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategy; Efficiency; Dairy Competitive benchmarking; Free disposal hull; Ukraine	MANAGEMENT	Purpose - The paper is devoted to develop the methodological technique for the implementation of competitive benchmarking in an industrial company in strategy of "the follower". The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In the research, a non-parametric methodology of efficiency analysis is used. To solve the problem of finding the best competitor, the author proposes to apply the method of free disposal hull (FDH). Findings - The proposed methodological technique for the implementation of competitive benchmarking in an industrial company in strategy of the follower enables to gradually develop and make informed strategic decisions that ensure the achievement of efficiency frontier and a leadership in its market segment. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited by a single industry (dairy products). This is explained by requirement of technology (product, service) homogeneity when using FDH model. Practical implications - By a case of 60 Ukrainian dairies, the paper demonstrates how the author can use the proposed technique in a practice and what steps the author should make to find company benchmark and improve the efficiency. It is possible to use the results of this research to make competitive benchmarking for the other industries. Originality/value - This paper adopts FDH model for competitive benchmarking and implementing the strategy of the followers. The proposed technique enables to improve the various activities of the analyzed dairies.

ENHANCING ASSET MANAGEMENT THROUGH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Asset management; Energy management; Energy consumption prediction	ELECTRICITY; FACILITIES; WEATHER; CLIMATE	Asset management is a systems approach to managing an organization's portfolio of real property assets. Although a range of activities exist to help manage these assets, understanding facility energy consumption is a critical component from a life-cycle decision-making perspective. Since energy consumption is a national concern for most countries, this has resulted in various initiatives regarding energy conservation measures. To better understand the factors affecting energy consumption in facilities, energy and meteorological data covering 22 years were collected for 74 sites located throughout the world. A regression model with an adjusted R-2 value of 81% was subsequently developed to predict energy consumption for each site. Additionally, using trend analysis, we found that the amount of energy used to meet heating load requirements was much greater than the amount used to meet cooling load requirements. The insight gained through the research can help facility managers develop energy initiatives as part of their overall asset management strategy.

Zoo BAPs: biodiversity action plans for conserving native wildlife in and around zoological gardens	JOURNAL OF ZOO AND AQUARIUM RESEARCH			English	Article						CMP Open Standards; conservation evidence; indicator species; in situ; native species; strategic framework	CONSERVATION	Failure by the international community to meet Convention on Biological Diversity targets has heaped added pressure on national and local biodiversity action plans (BAPs). Zoological gardens are playing an increasing role in practical conservation of wild habitats, but zoos have rarely developed formal BAPs. Here we introduce the concept of zoo BAPs, i.e. strategic plans for the conservation of biodiversity in and around zoological gardens. We use the first formal zoo BAP, developed at Flamingo Land Theme Park and Zoo in the UK, to introduce a framework for the establishment, monitoring and re-evaluation of a Zoo BAP. Throughout the framework we emphasise stakeholder participation, particularly involving zoo staff and local government biodiversity representatives. Species and habitats must be selected that are locally relevant, and are either threatened or have value as indicators or flagships for conservation. Each species or habitat must have targets that can be measured, monitored, and then evaluated for annual revision of conservation actions. This kind of "adaptive management" should allow a flexible, evidence-based approach to conservation. Use of national and international frameworks for biodiversity assessment should also help zoos to become increasingly aligned with the international conservation community.

Conscientious Consumerism Project in an Undergraduate Quality Management Class	DECISION SCIENCES-JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE EDUCATION			English	Article						Benchmarking; Complaint Management; Continuous Improvement; Gap Analysis; Quality Management; Role Of Top Management In Quality; and Voice Of The Customer		This article describes a "conscientious consumerism" project that involves the student as the consumer to either commend or complain to a company about a recent product or service experience. This activity and presentation helps students develop an understanding of the commendation/complaint management process within organizations while adding realism with the student as the customer. Students initiate communication with an organization and maintain a timeline of all contacts, calls, e-mails, letters, and visits to the company as they work to resolve or report their issue. The project begins early in the semester and concludes with a final registered, certified letter to the company CEO where students summarize the class project and praise processes or recommend any needed changes. When the project is presented, students learn how organizations manage and process customer feedback and complaints. Students have insightful comparisons of the implementation and execution of such processes within organizations. The project contributes to student learning and understanding of numerous key objectives of quality management including: how quality is managed in organizations, the strategic focus customer feedback can play in organizations, process management, voice of the customer, and benchmarking best compliment/ complaint management practices.

J	Iyamu, T				Iyamu, Tiko			The Interplay Between Human and Structure in IT Strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTERACTION			English	Article						Computing Environment; Information Technology (IT); IT Strategy; Non-Technical Factors; Structuration Theory		In organisations, human actions and structures are inseparable from processes and activities including in the development and implementation of the IT strategy. IT strategy is often intended to be driven by the organisational vision and strategy to achieve its goals periodically. IT has significant impact on an organisation's success or failure. It therefore does not operate in a vacuum. The issue is not just about information technology, rather, it is the strategic application of technology, including management, which is about people and the processes. The research applied Structuration Theory to examine the types of structures that exist during the development and implementation of IT strategy, and the structures that actually emerge as a result of human action in the computing environment of the organisation and through that, identify its impact. The primary aim of the research was to examine how cultural, policy and personal issues enable at the same time constrain activities in the computing environment during the development and implementation of IT strategy.

J	Jun, JK; Hyun, JH				Jun, Jong-Kun; Hyun, Jae Hoon			Anticipation or risk aversion?: The effects of the EU enlargement on Korean trade and FDI activities in Central and Eastern Europe	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						EU; CEEC; enlargement; Korea; FDI; SME	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES; MODE CHOICE; DETERMINANTS; INTEGRATION; COUNTRIES; GRAVITY; LESSONS; FLOWS; EXPORTS	This study attempted to identify how regional integration and spatial enlargement would affect firms' strategic decisions from the outside of an integrated region. By analyzing data sets between 2000 and 2007 utilizing the gravity model, this study examined the specific properties of Korean trade and FDI flows to the participating 5 CEECs and 5 western European states before and after the enlargement of the EU. The initial findings show that the number of new investments increased significantly after the enlargement while the monetary amount of total investment appeared to be negligibly affected. Further examinations by firm size revealed that SMEs were responsible for increased Korea FDI after the enlargement while large companies did not make any contributions. Having different attitudes toward risk aversion and anticipating opportunities for exploitation were suggested as a possible explanation.

J	Kakabadse, NK; Marzec, N; Rose, R				Kakabadse, Nada K.; Marzec, Nicci; Rose, Richard			What next for children's services? Can policy at a local or national level have any significant impact on the outcomes for children and their families?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH			English	Article						child poverty; Children's Act; Every Child Matters; young people; social justice		In England at both strategic and operational levels, policy-makers in the public sector have undertaken considerable work on implementing the findings of the Every Child Matters report and subsequently through the Children's Act 2(X)4. Legislation has resulted in many local authorities seeking to implement more holistic approaches to the delivery of children's services. At a strategic level this is demonstrated by the creation of integrated directorate structures providing for a range of services, from education to children's social care. Such services were generally under the management of the Director of Children's Services, holding statutory responsibilities for the delivery of services formally divided into the three sectors of education, health and social services. At a national level, more fundamental policy developments have sought to establish a framework through which policy-makers can address the underlying causes of deprivation, vulnerability and inequality. The Child Poverty Act, 2010, which gained Royal Assent in 2010, provides for a clear intention to reduce the number of children in poverty, acknowledging that 'the best way to eradicate child poverty is to address the causes of poverty, rather than only treat the symptoms'. However, whilst the policy objectives of both pieces of legislation hold positive aspirations for children and young people, a change of policy direction through a change of government in May 2010 seems to be in direct contrast to the intended focus of these aims. This paper explores the impact of new government policy on the future direction of children's services both at the national and local levels. At the national level, we question the ability of the government to deliver the aspirations of the Child Poverty Act, 2010, given the broad range of influences and factors that can determine the circumstances in which a child may experience poverty. We argue that poverty is not simply an issue of the pressure of financial deprivation, but that economic recession and cuts in government spending will further increase the number of children living in poverty.

J	Khan, MS; Kim, D				Khan, Muhammad Sohail; Kim, DoHyeun			Enhanced Service-Oriented Open Sensor Web Architecture with Application Server Based Mashup	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							NETWORKS; INTERNET	Connecting the sensing devices present in the physical world to detect and measure various physical phenomenon such as temperature, humidity, and pollution into a network and presenting them as web resources to the end users have become the goal of a variety of research activities. As the physical network of these devices inherently possesses a heterogeneous nature thus most of the sensor web studies are based on providing domain specific solutions. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has proven successes to resolve the scalability and evolvability of the web. The present solutions for the SOA based sensor web allows the users to access the sensor data as services but to integrate these services the client must put extra effort to implement the logic. We present an improved SOA based sensor web architecture which offers an easy approach to integrate sensor providers' services with information provider services and enable the users to access it as a single, integrated, and searchable service. This approach offers the functionality present in the existing solutions as well as an integrated data access or service mashup. We discuss in detail an instance architecture for indoor environment monitoring, based on the proposition of this study.

J	Kiehela, S; Falkenbach, H				Kiehela, Sami; Falkenbach, Heidi			MODELLING AND FORECASTING CENTRAL HELSINKI OFFICE RENTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Office rent; Real estate investment; Modelling; Forecasting; Helsinki	MARKET; ADJUSTMENT; DYNAMICS	Office market modelling has attracted a mounting amount of interest among researchers and practitioners during past decades. Growing research activity in the area is not surprising considering the importance of rent on property values. Nonetheless, very little quantitative research on Finnish rental markets has been carried out. The objective of this study is to respond to that lack of research by examining office rent determination in the Helsinki central business district (CBD) in reduced form single equation context. We discover that changes in central Helsinki office rents are subject to variations in new office completions and changes in the added value of services sector. As historical fit does not necessarily translate into a satisfactory predictive fit, the forecasting adequacy of the final model is also tested by constructing out of the sample forecast over 2007-2009. We find that the model outperforms two naive forecasting methods, but fails to perfectly trail the actual index.

EVIDENCE FROM NEWLY INDUSTRIALIZED ECONOMY FIRMS	EMERGING MARKET FIRMS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY	International Finance Review		English	Article; Book Chapter						Corporate governance; institution; foreign direct investment; entry strategy; emerging economy	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION; MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISE; ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICES; EMERGING ECONOMIES; PERFORMANCE; CHOICE; MODE; COMPENSATION	Purpose - This research seeks to understand how shareholder constituencies including controlling family, nonfamily insiders, as well as domestic and foreign institutions in the corporate governance system of emerging economy firms perceive institutional risks in terms of regulative, normative, and cognitive institutions and influence strategic choices in the internationalization of their invested firms. Design/methodology/approach - The sample data are Taiwanese publicly listed companies in the electronics and computer industry. Panel data of the parent firms and their overseas affiliates are available from the annual report and Taiwan Economic Journal database. Country-level data are available from the World Investment Report and the IMD World Competitiveness Report. Statistical regression models including tobit and logistic regression are used to analyze the data. Findings - Controlling family and nonfamily insider shareholders tend to influence their invested firms to enter in institutionally smaller host countries through a shared ownership. Domestic institutional shareholders tend to influence their invested firms to adopt a shared ownership and enter in host countries with larger and smaller institutional distances in terms of regulative and normative institution, respectively. Foreign institutional shareholders tend to influence their invested firms to enter in institutionally smaller host countries through a whole ownership. Originality/value - The strategic choices of foreign market entry made by emerging economy firms are significantly shaped by the different risk perceptions of shareholder constituencies in their corporate governance system toward the institutional distances between the home and the host country.

Sustainable tourism is more considered as a strategic approach. As sustainable tourism needs a complex management of economic, environmental and social resources, sustainable tourism management requires a great variety of financial and non-financial metrics. The article demonstrates how implementation of the strategic map based on Balanced Scorecard can contribute to sustainable tourism management. The designed system will support management of tourism in the broader economic and culture context, a case study is also provided.

J	Lee, YH; Wang, CM; Lee, WT				Lee, Yueh-Hua; Wang, Chin-Mei; Lee, Wen-Ting			Choice-Based Conjoint Model for Evaluating Consumers' Purchasing Preferences for Battery Electric Vehicle Attributes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS & STATISTICS			English	Article						Product attributes; consumer purchasing preferences; choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis		Selective conjoint-analysis studies can utilize pictorial displays to evaluate consumer preferences of various brand-name products and use the results of this evaluation to construct the groundwork for strategic plans of different enterprises. This study adopted choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis and asked car owners and prospective car buyers to select various electric vehicle properties. Then, the logit model was used to assess the consumers' preferences. This study found that the top three consumer purchasing preferences for electric vehicle attributes were battery recharge time, range, and horsepower.

Identifying the current soil quality, the impact of long-term fertilization on crop production, and how to improve crop production in this region are of great concern to scientists and the government. The objectives of this research were to analyze the trends of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) production and fertilizer application using data covering a period of about 25 yr, determine the current soil quality and compare the changes of that with soils collected in the second national soil census, and discuss the impact of long-term fertilization on crop production and soil quality in the YRD. Records indicated that crop production increased 2.1-fold from 1984 to 2008, with an approximate 3.5-fold increase in fertilizer application. A fuzzy comprehensive assessment of soil quality indicated an improvement during this same time period, but the average soil quality was still low relative to national standards, particularly due to low N availability. Although fertilization strategies appeared to have been successful in this region, declines in fertilizer use efficiency and the currently poor soil quality indicate a need for improved management strategies. Effective technology and education programs are required to improve fertilizer application practices and the management of soil quality, which would increase crop production.

Even though this is not a typical field where benchmarking methods are widely used, such an approach can be successfully applied. This article drafts a methodology for strategic benchmarking based on a quality evaluation of development strategies in tourism destinations. These strategies are evaluated by key regional stakeholders. The evaluation of fifteen selected strategies of the Czech, Slovak, and British regions has been made by an on-line application incorporating carefully defined criteria designed to operate with fuzzy data. The best strategies-as an etalon of good practice-are selected by the means of the fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The Region of Vysocina was selected for realization of the benchmarking gap analysis towards all strategies from the etalon with the aim to identify the opportunities for quality enhancement and corresponding good practices.

Accordingly, this article explores literature for strategic management in the public sector, SISP, and digital government and applies a strategic planning framework along with analyzing national SISP plans for information technology or electronic government. The research finds that countries are developing both strategic and operational goals that have managerial and governance implications.

J	Mhatre, N; Joo, SJ; Lee, CC				Mhatre, Nehal; Joo, Seong-Jong; Lee, C. Christopher			Benchmarking the performance of department stores within an income elasticity of demand perspective	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Business performance; Data envelopment analysis; Benchmarking; Service operations	EFFICIENCY; PRODUCTIVITY; TRANSPORT; RETAILERS; FOOD	Purpose - The purposes of this study are twofold: first, the authors attempt to confirm the effect of the income elasticity of demand in the retail industry by investigating the performance of department stores; second, the authors measure and benchmark the performance of individual department stores in order to develop strategic insights. Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ data envelopment analysis for measuring and benchmarking the relative performance of department stores by using pertinent variables collected over a five-year period - 2006-2010. Findings - The results confirmed that the luxury department stores were more sensitive to an economic cycle, and all department stores in this study demonstrated higher performance in recent years, except for one discount department store that showed consistently deteriorating performance over the observation period. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study include the use of financial data from companies' annual reports, along with the limited number of decision-making units and variables. Originality/value - Major contributions of this study include the confirmation of the effect of the income elasticity of demand in the retail industry in general and suggested strategic implications for specific department stores, which are not found in the current literature at the time of this study.

Training and Farmers' Organizations' Performance	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION			English	Article						Transfer of training; Non-financial organizational outcomes; Farmers' marketing organizations; Uganda		Purpose: This study sought to determine the influence of training transfer factors and actual application of training on organization level outcomes among farmer owned produce marketing organizations in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews based on the Learning Transfer Systems Inventory (LTSI) were conducted with 120 PMO leaders trained in partnership management skills by a four year extension project. Data were collected on training transfer factors, transferred training, and training related organization level outcomes. Data were analyzed by OLS hierarchical regression analysis. Findings: The performance of the producer marketing organizations in terms of 'improved inter-organization relations' and 'improved services' was found to be significantly predicted by 'personal capacity to transfer,' 'receiving feedback,' and 'resource availability.' Practical implications: Rural service providers who build capacity of local organizations can use this knowledge to pursue certain strategic human level organizational outcomes by manipulating transfer system factors such as providing feedback and supportive resources to help trainees. Originality/value: The LTSI model has been tested for its role in explaining human level organizational outcomes in a developing country setting. We have also seen that specific training transfer system factors will be responsible for certain elements of the multidimensional outcomes of training.

J	Seco, VMM; Lopes, MP				Monteiro Seco, Victor Manuel; Lopes, Miguel Pereira			Between Compassionateness and Assertiveness: A Trust Matrix for Leaders	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						leadership; trust; self and other trust; compassionateness; assertiveness		Purpose: Construct the structure of trust-building perceived by principals in Portuguese public schools. Design/methodology/approach: A grounded theory approach applied to a survey of open questions answered by school's principals. Findings: (1) self-trust is the single trait common to all respondents; (2) compassion is a striking antecedent in the process of other-trust; compassionateness and assertiveness must combine with one another to achieve leadership based on smart trust, what is outlined in a matrix model built from the data. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation of this study was the impossibility to conduct face-to-face interviews given the limitation of free time alleged by the principals. In order to solve that limitation we decide to use the grounded theory approach. Practical implications: The consideration of a symbiosis category of the behaviors of principals can trigger positive expectations among the players who until now did not understand how it is possible to bring together the best of the worlds of management and leadership in a balanced way, with efficiency in authenticity. Social implications: The aforementioned dyadic model reflects a psychological state based on the belief that others do not take advantage of us, showing that trust is an essential element in positive human relations and becomes a strategic issue. Originality/value: The present study found that "pure" positive behaviors, as being compassionate, might need to be tempered or complemented with other behaviors such as assertiveness, to become really effective.

J	Nakahara, R				Nakahara, Ryuki			Partnership marketing for prevention	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						disaster and accident; avoidance and recovery; efficiency and effectiveness; treatment and prevention; cost and performance; partnership marketing		There is no place in the world that has never suffered a disaster. We cannot escape from disaster in our daily life because we exist in a global setting. Disaster can happen to an individual or an organization on any day and anywhere, at any time. Thus, what we do is consider not how to escape disaster, but how to make an effort to overcome it. We usually consider how to reduce the losses caused by damage, how to reduce the degree of damage, and/or how to increase the speed of recovery after a disaster. This article will not discuss the constitution, the factors, or the causes of disaster. It will discuss the efficiency and effectiveness of avoiding disaster and recovering from disasters as quickly as possible through cases close to us in daily life in the view of partnership marketing. And we will argue the possibility and importance of preventing the occurrence of disaster finally. We believe the best way to overcome disasters is to create a multidimensional partnership network with strategic planning to fundamentally prevent the occurrence of disaster.

J	O'Connor, A; Santos-Arteaga, FJ; Tavana, M				O'Connor, Aidan; Santos-Arteaga, Francisco J.; Tavana, Madjid			A game-theoretical model of bank foreign direct investment strategy in emerging market economies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING			English	Article						Foreign direct investment; Emerging markets; Game theory; Banking; Entry strategy; Cooperation game	TRADE; RISK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a game-theoretical model for commercial bank foreign direct investment strategy, government policy and domestic banking industry interactions in emerging market economies and demonstrate the application of this strategy to the banking system. Government policy and domestic banking industry interactions in emerging market economies and demonstrate the application of this strategy to the banking system. Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops a game-theoretical model to analyze the optimality of the limiting entry strategy followed by a given domestic institutional sector when considering the entry applications of foreign banks in the domestic financial system. The model analyzes the strategic options available to an emerging market country with a relatively underdeveloped banking system when deciding whether or not and to what extent allow for the entrance of better reputed and more technologically advanced foreign banks in its domestic financial system. Findings - The paper shows that the progressive liberalization of entry restrictions would define the perfect Bayesian equilibria of the subsequent set of continuation games and the respective payoffs derived from this liberalization as the domestic economy integrates and competes within the global financial system. Originality/value - Banks operating in the international financial market have incentives to invest directly in emerging market economies and governments have incentives in allowing foreign banks entry to their market. As banking systems in these economies are generally underdeveloped, opening the financial system to foreign competitors could lead to a decrease in the market share of local banks. Eventually foreign banks could control the banking system and could de facto control the money supply.

As the smartphone ecosystem has evolved within the value chain of the ICT industry, smartphone manufacturers can benefit from open innovation, such as by making use of external resources and collaboration networks. However, most studies on smartphones have focused on aspects of product innovation, such as functional differentiation, usability, and market penetration rather than on innovation networks. The aim of this study is to examine how the open innovation approaches and strategic fit of smartphone manufacturers function in delivering innovation outcomes and business performance. This research examines the relationship between seven smartphone manufacturers and their collaboration partners during a recent three-year period, by analyzing four specific areas: hardware components, software, content services, and telecommunications.

J	Puspitawati, D; Nurdin				Puspitawati, Dhiana; Nurdin			Towards Integrated Port Management Systems along Malacca Straits	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Competitiveness; efficiency; intergrated; management; malacca straits; port performance		Paperless transaction offers various comforts that have made the world borderless. However, the finalization of international trade needs the goods to be delivered to certain destinations. Although carriage of goods by air guarantees less time, 90% of international trades are still carried out through the oceans. The strategic location of Indonesia in a cross-road position (posisi silang), that is between two land-masses of the world, Australia and Asia and between two great waters of the Indian and the Pacific Oceans has made Indonesia a centre of international trade routes. This way, the existance of a well-developed and efficiently run port sector is crucial. However, from the user's perspective, Indonesia does not have a port system which performs well enough to compete with the demand of international markets. Previous research has showed that the lack of competitiveness in Indonesia's ports is underpinned by the existence of too many insufficient and inefficient ports, which are rooted in limited private sector participation and competition in the port system. This is mostly due to the deficiencies in the legal as well as regulatory environments in the port management system, which leads to tight competition both within and between ports. This research seeks to analyse the Indonesian legal framework concerning the Ports Management System. While the current Indonesian Act 17/2008 on Shipping has provided the foundation for port system reform, much remains to be done. One of the implementation strategies of the National Ports Master Plan ((NPMP) envisaged within the draft of NPMP is integrated port planning. The draft further divides strategic ports into six economic corridors; and since this research focuses in ports located along the Malacca Straits, only the Sumatran economic corridor will be considered. This paper proposes the integrated planning model in the ports located in the Sumatran economic corridor.

J	Schiele, H; Harms, R; Banerjee, S				Schiele, Holger; Harms, Rainer; Banerjee, Shrestho			A national competitiveness-based portfolio approach for international strategic management: illustrated with the case of the TATA industries	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						clusters; India; international management; national competitive advantage; portfolio analysis; strategic management; TATA	FIRMS; PRODUCTIVITY; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; ADVANTAGE; CLUSTERS; POLICY	International firms with multiple business units are dealing with the question of how to balance the international dimension of their business portfolio. Which business units should go international and where should they contract or expand their international activities? Previous research lacks tools providing a foundation for this decision. Drawing on the concept of national competitiveness, we make a crucial contribution to the BCG matrix. We develop a national competitiveness - market growth matrix to identify business units that are promising targets for internationalisation. The case of TATA illustrates the meaningfulness and viability of this new matrix. Three quarters of the analysed business units of India's most successful conglomerate are active in the country's strongest export industries. This finding substantiates Porter's home base thesis: internationally active firms should capitalise on their geographical advantages. Consequently, we postulate that international managers should take precautions if a business unit of their firm has its home base in a country whose 'revealed comparative advantage' in this industry is less than one, i.e. below average.

J	Shen, CY				Shen, Chun-Ying			Strategic vendor selection criteria discussed in relation to demand and supply perspectives	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING			English	Article						supplier positioning and selection; two-factor theory; supplier integration; total quality management; variance weighting method		Vendor selection (VS) is a decision-making problem involving strategic management. In the VS approach, criteria and importance weights must be carefully selected to meet supply chain competitive strategies. Most existing VS models use buying-firm's perspectives for VS criteria formulation. This study examines the demand and supply views of 108 valid respondents regarding the importance weights of VS criteria under four operations strategies. The multinomial probability distribution analysis and variance weighting method are employed to categorize the individual relative importance weights. This study derives exploratory explanations by conducting in-depth interviews with 12 functional managers focusing on their divergent perspectives on importance weighting of VS criteria. This study also discusses the derived applications of Herzberg's two-factor theory, supplier integration, and the operating philosophy of total quality management to mitigate the influences of the widely used explicit operational criteria in existing VS models. Finally, this study provides recommendations for future research on VS.

J	Singh, S; Paliwal, M				Singh, Sumanjeet; Paliwal, Minakshi			Exploring a Sense of Intellectual Property Valuation for Indian SMEs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Exploitation; Intellectual Property (IP); Licensing; Small and Medium Sized Enterprises; (SMEs); Valuation		As intellectual property (IP) has become an integral part of business strategy, the valuation of these assets has become more and more critical. Consequently, the strategic decisions of Indian SMEs also increasingly depend on understanding the economics affecting the value of these assets and most crucially appraising the approximate value of their IP. In this light, the paper reviews the principal approaches and methods used to evaluate an IP asset and proposes a framework to help the Indian SMEs to select an appropriate approach for effective valuation of their IP. In the background, paper discusses various scenarios where IP valuation is required and needed for SMEs and also explores some problems and issues generally faced/reported by the Indian SMEs in IP valuation. Further, the paper examines the broadening set of channels through which SMEs can exploit their IP. The paper provides five constructive building blocks (descriptions of IP assets, valuation purpose, influencing factors, valuation premise and Standardizing IP valuation) for Indian SMEs to choose a viable approach. The paper concludes that the selection of an appropriate method depends upon the circumstances surrounding the valuation, including the type of IP being valued, the purpose of valuation, the basis of valuation and most importantly the availability of information. The clear understanding of the underlying assumptions and theories behind the various valuation methodologies will assist the Indian SMEs greatly in negotiations for the sales or licensing of their intellectual property.

QUANTIFYING QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This study investigates current methods of measuring quality management system (QMS) performance. It introduces a methodology to quantify QMS performance in order to provide a reference point for improved QMS performance and, in turn, the business's performance. By introducing metadata into historical or current QMS internal audit data, the study shows that it is possible, over time, to extract various levels of value-adding data, ranging from high-level, strategic, direction-oriented insight, to process effectiveness and implementation-level guidance. This is accomplished by a repeatable process of infusing cause and effect theming data and process-consequence severity data into the QMS audit-findings data, and subsequently analysing the additional metadata.

'Diversification: Performance turnaround' (A case of Sarvodaya Hospitals)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Diversification; Performance; Strategic management; Hospital		Diversification is a strategic decision that management practises to improve its firm's performance. It continues to be an important strategy for a sustainable corporate growth. 1 Corporate diversification has been found to have a curvilinear relation with the corporate performance, i.e. related diversified firms outperform unrelated diversified firms and single business firms. 2 Substantiating this concept, the primary purpose of this study is to examine the role of related or with-in industry diversification in the firm's growth. This study shows that diversification has positive impact on financial and organizational performance of Sarvodaya Hospital.

The framework should provide information on strategic pro-/regress in an operational context that justifies the need for organizational adjustments. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts qualitative methods for constructing the framework, subsequently implementing the framework in a Danish magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit. Workshops and interviews form the basis of the qualitative construction phase, and two internal and five external databases are used for a quantitative data collection. Findings - By aggregating performance outcomes, collective measures of performance are achieved. This enables easy and intuitive identification of areas not strategically aligned. In general, the framework has proven helpful in an MRI unit, where operational decision makers have been struggling with extensive amounts of performance information. Research limitations/implications - The implementation of the framework in a single case in a public and highly political environment restricts the generalizing potential. The authors acknowledge that there may be more suitable approaches in organizations with different settings. Practical implications - The strength of the framework lies in the identification of performance problems prior to decision making. The quality of decisions is directly related to the individual decision maker. The only function of the framework is to support these decisions. Originality/value - The study demonstrates a more refined and transparent use of performance reporting by combining strategic weight assignment and performance aggregation in hierarchies. In this way, the framework accentuates performance as a function of strategic progress or regress, thus assisting decision makers in exerting operational effort in pursuit of strategic alignment.

The logical key hierarchy (LKH) is a well-known class of protocols which aims to solve the key management problem and minimize rekeying overhead, using hierarchical structures and taking advantage of multicast communication.

J	van Niekerk, A; Viviers, W				van Niekerk, Antoinette; Viviers, Wilma			PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SOUTH AFRICA THROUGH THE EXPORT OF LOW-CARBON ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article						economic growth; exports; green growth; greenhouse gas emissions; low-carbon technologies; low-carbon environmental goods		Many countries, particularly those in the developing world, are under increasing pressure to improve their growth rates in order to tackle pressing economic problems at the domestic level. Increasing export volumes can make a positive contribution to a country's economic growth rate, but it can also endanger the environment. How to reconcile the often conflicting phenomena of increased export activity, stronger economic growth and a lower carbon footprint is the focus of this study. A core outcome of the study was the creation of a single list using a cross-section of international sources, of low-carbon environmental goods, and their ranking according to their inherent ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, South Africa's capacity to produce them, and their economic benefits, as reflected in the export opportunities they present. These export opportunities were revealed through the application of the Decision Support Model (DSM), an export market selection tool that incorporates a systematic filtering and screening system. The results of the analysis should help guide policymakers in their strategic deliberations on which export sectors to incentivise and support with a view to encouraging more 'green' growth in South Africa in the years ahead.

We establish the visualized strategy map with the logical links to improve the science parks' (SPs') performance. Design/ methodology/approach - Corresponding to the four BSC perspectives (finance, customer, internal process and employee learning and growth), KPIs for CSPs are synthesized and screened in the relevant literature. The application for Zhongguancun Science Park (ZSP) is provided as an example. Findings - The research results show that the presented approach is an objective and feasible way to construct a more justifiable strategy map. The proposed framework can be applied to non-profit organizations, such as SPs. Originality/value - This work provides a systematic method to establish strategy maps for SPs (non-profit organizations), based on the consideration of the intricate causal relationships among KPIs, and the analysis of the important strategic improvement paths and proposes the model of assessment of emphasizing the processes rather than outcomes.

J	Yang, QL; Shao, JM; Scholz, M				Yang, Qinli; Shao, Junming; Scholz, Miklas			SELF-ORGANIZING MAP TO ESTIMATE SUSTAINABLE FLOOD RETENTION BASIN TYPES AND VARIABLES	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						classification; flood storage; modeling; unsupervised learning algorithm; wetland	WATER BODIES; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT	A sustainable flood retention basin (SFRB) is an impoundment or integrated wetland, which has a pre-defined or potential role in flood defense and diffuse pollution control that can be accomplished cost effectively through best management practice in urban or remote regions. A database comprising 372 SFRB, which belong to 6 types and are characterized by 43 variables, has been developed for the central Scotland area. However, the determination of SFRB types and some characterisation variables is difficult or time consuming. To deal with these issues, the self-organizing map (SOM) model was applied to estimate the difficult-to-determine variables by using their highly related and easy-to-determine variables. Furthermore, the SOM model was used to classify the types of SFRB. The assessment of the SFRB types based on 25 key variables outperformed that based on all 43 variables, which suggests that 25 variables are significant and sufficient to classify SFRB. The results indicated that the SOM model provides an efficient approach to characterizing and classifying SFRB.

TRANSFORMATION OF MODELS OF INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT ON THE WAY TO OPENNESS OF INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						models of innovative development; open innovations; intellectual property; Association of innovative regions of Russia		The evolution of models of the innovative process on the way to the openness of innovative systems is presented in the article. The conclusion is drawn that each new generation of models arises in reply to the requirements of development of world economy, in which the sphere of innovations was actively globalized. Data of the researches are provided confirming that in Russia the absolute majority of innovations are developed in the companies, practically without attraction of intellectual and financial resources from the outside. With such a closed approach the company does not use external sources for creation of innovations, and counts only on itself and seeks to protect the innovations by the rights to intellectual property. Open innovative practice assumes active search of perspective ideas in environment, joint researches and creation of innovations with other partners, and also strategic use of the rights to intellectual property. Foreign experience shows that within the developed innovative economy in branches with intensive research and development the rectilinear logic of the last century according to which the large producer of goods or the services achieved the maximum decrease in expenses thanks to a scale effect and production optimisation becomes the world leader in the branch ceases to work. Results of the analysis of innovative development of regions, members of Association of innovative regions of Russia (further in the text - AIRR) testify to the domination of linear models in innovative process management. Management of innovative process in compliance with the model of market attraction (G2) is noted in the Republics of Tatarstan and Mordovia, Perm Krai, Lipetsk, Samara and Ulyanovsk Regions. Management of innovative process according to the model of a technological push (G1) is noted in Tomsk and Novosibirsk Regions. Advantages and shortcomings of realisation of each model in the regions are given in the article. A conclusion is made that implementing the linear models of innovative process management the regions of Russia are doomed to the catching- up innovative development and technological lag from the advanced countries. A mutually advantageous, constructive integration into the world innovations processes requires considerable improvement of the existing and creation of new institutions. Imperfection of regulation of the sphere of intellectual property is the main reason for the closeness of innovative systems of various levels. A number of unresolved problems of the sphere of intellectual property are specified that do not allow Russia to profitably interact in the world innovative space realising the model of open innovations. The need is stated in interregional interaction and creation of interregional institutions, whose activity includes coordination of the interregional innovative projects. Their realisation will allow to get additional benefits from the transfer of experience, concentration of efforts and resources of subjects of innovative activity, which, undoubtedly, will accelerate the processes of generation and distribution of innovations by the network of interrelations in the country's Common Economic Space.

Recent empirical evidence suggests that the multiscale data characteristics in the price movement are another important stylized fact. The incorporation of mixture of data characteristics in the time scale domain during the modelling process can lead to significant performance improvement. This paper proposes a novel morphological component analysis based hybrid methodology for modeling the multiscale heterogeneous characteristics of the price movement in the crude oil markets. Empirical studies in two representative benchmark crude oil markets reveal the existence of multiscale heterogeneous microdata structure. The significant performance improvement of the proposed algorithm incorporating the heterogeneous data characteristics, against benchmark random walk, ARMA, and SVR models, is also attributed to the innovative methodology proposed to incorporate this important stylized fact during the modelling process. Meanwhile, work in this paper offers additional insights into the heterogeneous market microstructure with economic viable interpretations.

Fuzzy Demand Estimation as Basis of an Assistant Tool for a Strategic Load Management of PHEV	JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Demand estimation; Fuzzy estimation; PHEV load management		Demand management of Plug-in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (PHEV) is an important requirement for the reduction of greenhouse gases and better use of the energy sources. Smart grids can control the power demand of PHEV, based on the knowledge of the demand curves. However, this information is not always known by PHEV owners or charging stations due to loss of data or due to the charging is done in cities with conventional power grids. These problems can increase the peak demand and makes dynamic pricing more difficult to implement. This paper proposes the use of fuzzy demands estimations to reduce the impact of these problems. This estimator is the basis of assistant software applications for PHEVusers and charging stations to get more information for a best load management for PHEV. Results demonstrate the advantage of this proposal in the demand management for PHEV.	[Cordeiro, Raimundo; Pinto, Joao O. P.; Godoy, Ruben B.; Ribeiro, Pedro Eugenio M.

The measurement of the effective performance of the latter is by evaluating the successful implementation of organizational strategy. The main results of the proposed approach refers to evaluation of overall scores for each dimension of the BSC methodology, financial, customer, internal processes, learning and growth. These results are able to help the organization evaluate and revise their strategy and, in general, to adopt management methods more accurately. The findings highlight on balancing and alignment of strategic objectives, low causality map, strategic communication insufficient and fragmented. The performance indicators portray more meritocracy operational procedures of social projects in the context of the Strategic Map determined in a short-term over the long term. However, there is evidence of improved performance management and strategic taken as a basis of planning as both the strategic map structured. Therefore, the nonprofits need to adopt a form of management that enables planning, setting objectives and targets that provide the continuity of its activities, and generating instruments that can measure the financial performance and non-financial, in order to develop strategic actions for growth and sustainability.

Researchers and industry practitioners have realised that this trend necessitates a fundamental rethinking of approaches to network and service management. This has spurred significant research efforts towards developing autonomic network management solutions incorporating distributed self-management processes inspired by biological systems. Whilst significant advances have been made, most solutions focus on management of single network domains and the optimisation of specific management or control processes therein. In this paper we argue that a networking infrastructure providing a myriad of loosely coupled services must inherently support federation of network domains and facilitate coordination of the operation of various management processes for mutual benefit. To this end, we outline a framework for federated management that facilitates the coordination of the behaviour of bio-inspired management processes. Using a case study relating to distribution of IPTV content, we describe how Federal Relationship Managers realising our layered model of management federations can communicate to manage service provision across multiple application/storage/network providers. We outline an illustrative example in which storage providers are dynamically added to a federation to accommodate demand spikes, with appropriate content being migrated to those providers servers under control of a bio-inspired replication process.

J	Pomeda, JR; Casani, F				Rodriguez Pomeda, Jesus; Casani, Fernando			Higher Officials' Training Needs on Managerial Competencies in Spanish Universities: Preliminary Findings	EURASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Spanish universities; higher education; leadership competencies	SAMPLE-SIZE; LEADERSHIP SKILLS; HIGHER-EDUCATION; SUBSTITUTES; PRESIDENTS; COLLEGE; ROLES	Problem Statement. What the self-perceptions of higher officials in Spanish universities are about the main competencies required in their daily tasks. Purpose of Study. To analyze what the main competencies are in the professional behaviour of higher officials at Spanish universities. The improvement of their competencies through a systematic educative framework would be based on what gaps are found to exist in their competencies. Methods. Principal component analysis: After dealing with sample size, we have analyzed the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic of sampling adequacy and the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity. After that, we ran the component extraction and the interpretation of the components based on oblique rotation. The last task was to check the reliability of the scale used. Findings and Results. Spanish universities' higher officials consider that four competencies have paramount relevance now: organizational transformation (command of change management models, total quality management, and Higher education finance models); strategic management (strategic planning, general and team management); leadership (self-confidence, impact and influence on others); theoretical reflection previous to action (command of achievement orientation, conceptual thinking, information seeking, and directiveness/assertiveness). Conclusions and Recommendations. Context is a key issue of leader effectiveness in order to develop an attuned scheme of competencies, that is, a set of competencies aligned with stakeholders' perceptions about what effective leadership is. In the past, academic leaders exerted their role by applying routine behaviours based on command-and-control schemes within the limits established by the principal stakeholder surveillance. However, the literature increasingly recognizes that single prescriptions for leadership excellence no longer work. When the winds of change blow harder, leaders must be equipped with a broad and complex array of knowledge and skills, that is, a brand-new portfolio of leadership competencies. This must be the goal for any formal training program.

J	Zhang, X; Majid, S; Foo, S				Zhang, Xue; Majid, Shaheen; Foo, Schubert			Environmental Scanning Practices of Travel Agent Companies in Singapore	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH			English	Article						environmental scanning; travel agent companies; Singapore; information source	STRATEGIC UNCERTAINTY; SEARCH; OPPORTUNITIES; PERFORMANCE; EXECUTIVES; BEHAVIOR; QUALITY	The success of tourism firms relies heavily on their ability to adapt to the changing external environments. Environmental scanning, as the acquisition and use of information about external events and trends, has received greater attention in the tourism management literature. This study investigated the environmental scanning initiatives of travel agent companies in Singapore through a questionnaire survey. In total, 42 completed forms were returned from 319 invited firms. The findings discovered a positive relationship between the scanning frequency and the perceived strategic uncertainty of task environment. It was also found that human information sources were used most frequently for collecting environmental information due to their highest reliability, while electronic sources were under-utilized probably due to lack of computer-based information system and awareness toward the importance of online information.

Availability of hospice and palliative care is increasing, despite lack of a clear national strategy for developing and evaluating their penetration into and impact on the target population. Objectives. To determine whether targeted investment (i.e., strategic grants made by one charitable foundation) in hospice and palliative care in one U.S. state (North Carolina [NC]) led to improved access to end-of-life care services as indicated by hospice utilization. Methods. Access was measured by the death service ratio (DSR), defined as the proportion of people who died and were served by hospice for at least one day before death. Calculation of the DSR is based on counts of patients accessing hospice by county in a given year (numerator) and U.S. Census projected population data for that county (denominator). Multilevel modeling was the primary analytic strategy used to generate two models: 1) comparison of the DSR in counties with vs. without philanthropic funding and 2) relationship between years since receipt of a philanthropic grant and DSR. Results. In NC, the average DSR increased from 20.7% in 2003 to 35.8% in 2009 (55% increase). In 2009, 82 of 100 NC counties had a DSR below the U.S. average (41.6%). In Model 1, significant associations were found between county population and DSR (P = 0.03) and between receipt of philanthropic funding and DSR (P = 0.01); on average, funded counties had a DSR that was 2.63 percentage points higher than unfunded counties. Conclusion. Receipt of philanthropic funding appeared to be associated with improved access to palliative care and hospice services in NC. (C) 2013 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

The discussion is based on a study of campaign managers' perceptions of nine successfully implemented European healthy eating campaigns. Based on these interviews, we suggest that social marketing compared to commercial food marketing is not necessarily at a disadvantage; rather, social marketers working to promote healthy eating can benefit from the formation of alliances with public and private partners, the empowerment of their targets and of those who influence the targets, the development of credible and emotive messages and relationships with media and public institutions.

Thus, we identified the major social and environmental management practices of Brazilian companies and the leading indicators that make up the performance of the companies surveyed. The research was characterised as a quantitative research. Among the main aspects highlighted in the analysis one should mention the supremacy of the environmental variable in the relationship with the business performance. With less intensity arise the variable reputation/image, showing that this variable is among the priorities in the socio-environmental agenda of companies. The social variable seems to be among the least concerns of firms, or it is not yet seen by managers as a strategic element to their business competitiveness. The methodological procedures adopted allow us to confirm the existence of a relationship between socio-environmental management practices and business performance.

J	Lavtar, R				Lavtar, Roman			Ways and Side Ways of Using the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Knowledge Sharing in Organizations	LEX LOCALIS-JOURNAL OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT			English	Article						data processing; information and communication technology (ICT); strategic information systems; organizational knowledge creation theory; knowledge intensive organizations; media richness theory; magic bullet theory	MANAGERS	Today, the information and communication technology (ICT) is vital for a successful and on-going operation and as support in the decision-making process of an organization. ICT used to serve merely as a data processing support and later as a management information system but it is nowadays becoming understood as a strategic information system, which is no longer separated from an organization's business strategy. The new functionality requires that an organization does not treat ICT in its business plan separately. Such a role requires a change of business processes, different organizational approaches and a skilled workforce. Knowledge in an organization has been a competitive advantage and not an asset for quite some time now, therefore ICT must also be observed and applied in the light of creating the organizational knowledge. However, there is a risk of the role of ICT being overestimated, both in current operations as well as in the introduction of changes in an organization. The article studies the impact of ICT on the operations of an organization in the context of creating organizational knowledge and introducing changes. Moreover, it points out the traps which the management is exposed to whilst introducing such changes.

Innovativeness in the motor carrier industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						innovativeness; reputation; operational performance; motor carriers	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MARKET ORIENTATION; SERVICE QUALITY; E-COMMERCE; PERFORMANCE; DIFFUSION; ADOPTION; ORGANIZATIONS; CAPABILITIES; ATTITUDES	Drawing upon diffusion of innovation and institutional theory, we examine the effects of innovativeness on various aspects of motor carrier performance and reputation. Motor carriers operate in an extremely competitive environment, where there is little if any room for strategic mistakes. It is understandable that leadership within these organisations is cautious when it comes to the adoption of innovations, as little evidence exists in the literature to support whether or not adoption of common motor carrier innovations will lead to positive outcomes. The results of this study suggest that the degree of motor carrier innovativeness is positively related to on-time delivery, claims ratio, safety, and reputation. These findings provide support for diffusion of innovation and institutional theory while also providing evidence that motor carriers can make more informed decisions regarding innovation adoption.

J	Hatsidimitris, G				Hatsidimitris, George			A theory-to-practice approach for teaching science with animations	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT & E-LEARNING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Multimedia; Animations; Video; Guidelines; Cognition		Educational psychologists have for decades conducted research into the most efficient manner by which information can be assimilated through dynamic visualizations such as animations and video. As a result, a number of research-based guidelines have been formulated to guide the designer, teacher and learner regarding the layout, presentation and self-regulation of transient information. How to apply multimedia learning principles in a considered and creative manner when teaching or learning with dynamic information in a regular classroom situation? This article presents a practical and visual guide for dealing with some of the key issues, such as split attention, signaling, segmentation and strategic learner-control. Some classroom orientated suggestions are offered for the incorporation of these principles when using animations for teaching complex information. The overall objective is to organize the pacing and sequencing of the dynamic information in a manner that is optimally aligned with the students' prior knowledge and cognitive processing ability.

The importance of 'strategic chat time' for people who are blind or low vision	BRITISH JOURNAL OF VISUAL IMPAIRMENT			English	Article						Barriers to inclusion; blind and low vision; lunch and coffee breaks; social inclusion; social interaction; 'strategic chat time'; workplace integration		This article discusses the importance of 'strategic chat time' for the integration of blind and low vision (B/LV) employees. Strategic chat time refers to social time not related to workplace business such as lunch, breaks, and informal social activities, where employees build relationships and assimilate into the company's culture. This study examined barriers B/LV employees experienced and strategies used in getting to know colleagues, developing friendships, and networking for career advancement. This qualitative research study was based on data gathered for a dissertation at the University of Toronto. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 B/LV employees in Canada. Valuable insights were discovered regarding coping strategies used by B/LV employees to access the social arena. Strategies ranged from avoidance to active intervention. Thematic analysis was used to identify four categories for the reported strategies, namely, passive, resourceful, receptive, and proactive. These strategies reveal strong motivation to engage in the social arena and achieve social acceptance. Further research is warranted on the benefits of 'strategic chat time'.

Aircraft Image Recognition System Using Phase Correlation Method	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Aircraft image recognition system; phase correlation; Matlab; normalized cross-power spectrum; invariant moments; image registration	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; MOMENT; IDENTIFICATION; INVARIANTS	This article describes the aircraft image recognition system implemented using the phase correlation technique in Matlab environment. The phase correlation is computed by using the normalized cross-power spectrum between the database and the template test image. The main objective of this article is to develop methods for static analysis of aircraft images. An unknown fighter aircraft is recognized by comparing its static image with those from a database of images of aircraft. This work is a research initiative involving the use of image processing techniques to detect three-dimensional (3D) aircraft object based on their 2D images, providing feedback information for strategic purposes. The phase correlation technique is found to give a better recognition result for the set of database and test images considered, compared with the invariant moments. The phase correlation method is also used in other areas such as image registration. Aircraft images used include those from AeroIndia 2011 held at Bangalore, India.

J	Heroux, S; Fortin, A				Heroux, Sylvie; Fortin, Anne			Exploring information technology governance and control of web site content: a comparative case study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & GOVERNANCE			English	Article						IT governance; Control; Web site content; Internet	MANAGEMENT CONTROL; SARBANES-OXLEY; IMPACT; INTERNET; DISCLOSURE	Information technology (IT) governance is a key component of corporate governance. Effective IT governance can support web-based strategic initiatives such as the dissemination of information on corporate web sites. However, the IT governance literature does not provide insights about the role of IT governance in controlling this information. There is also a lack of research in the web-based reporting literature on the important issue of control of web site content. This comparative case study aims to explore the relationships between IT governance and the control of web site content. In doing so, IT governance structures, processes and relational capabilities, as well as web site content control, are first described for each of four cases. Then, profiles of relationships between IT governance and web site content control are identified and key attributes characterizing the profiles are outlined. Findings suggest that IT governance within firms is more developed than the control of web site content. Moreover, IT governance structures, processes and relational capabilities can be related to control of web site content processes. IT governance structures can also be related to control of web site content structures and relational capabilities. This study contributes to the governance, control and web-based reporting literatures as an exploratory step before building a theory of relationships between IT governance and web site content control.

Shrinkage data were measured in each growth ring at different heights on trees harvested from a mixed-species Nelder tree-spacing plot located in New Brunswick, Canada. Live crown base was reconstructed based on stem analysis. Cambial age, sampling height, crown characteristics (crown length, crown ratio, and distance to live crown base), and ring width at time of wood formation were used as prediction variables. The results indicated that shrinkage magnitude and pattern were closely related to crown dimensions and stem position at time of wood formation. Trees from wider tree spacings with larger crown lengths and ratios tended to have smaller tangential and radial shrinkage. Longitudinal shrinkage decreased nonlinearly from pith outwards with slower rate changes near the bottom of the trees. The model fixed effects accounted for more variation in jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) than in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) for shrinkage in the same anatomical direction. After further validation, the model developed can be used to provide shrinkage predictions for lumber distortion models within the framework of an individual tree growth model.

This was the first time NSW mental health staff have been deployed interstate and the lessons learned from this deployment were derived from the situation reports, participant feedback and an online survey. The lessons include the need for better communication between incoming and departing teams, the pivotal role of team leaders, and the need to use initiative and a flexible approach in undertaking strategic roles to support the emergency response. The aim of this paper is to document the deployment in order to inform future policy and practice.

J	Kogetsidis, H				Kogetsidis, Harry			Change Management: The Need for a Systems Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS APPROACH			English	Article						Complexity; Information Systems; Organizational Change; System Approach; Systems Thinking		The rate with which change occurs has increased dramatically over the years. At the same time, the change management literature is full of claims about the high failure rate of change implementation programmes in organisations. In this position paper a case is made that change initiatives frequently fail because they are not holistic in nature. The paper argues that change can be managed more effectively if the various interconnected and interacting elements of the system are identified, the divergent interests of the various stakeholders are recognised, and the entire change process is managed systemically. As the failures of change efforts are commonly related to human issues, as opposed to technical factors, involving all stakeholders in the change process is expected to reduce resistance and to create a higher level of psychological commitment among employees towards the proposed change. The paper then looks into the implications that this holistic way of thinking has for information systems development and argues that information systems should not be implemented as a means to solving a problem but instead be treated as a significant tool to help address a complex mix of organisational issues. Information system strategy must be in line with the organizations' corporate strategic plan and information systems must be related to a continually changing organisational context and a turbulent business environment.

J	Assefa, T; Garfield, M; Meshesha, M				Assefa, Temtim; Garfield, Monica; Meshesha, Million			Barriers of Knowledge Sharing Among Employees: The Case of Commercial Bank of Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge; knowledge sharing; knowledge-sharing barriers; commercial banks		Commercial banks are one of the main engines that enhance the economic growth of the country by managing financial transactions. Banks process and use information to run their business. Knowledge is one of the strategic resources that commercial banks use to increase their internal efficiency and to operate competitively. Knowledge-sharing barriers hinder the smooth flow of knowledge among employees which often results in negative consequences such as customer dissatisfaction, low employee learning and poor service quality. This research identified complex individual, organisational and technological factors that affect knowledge sharing and puts forward interventions that can improve the culture of knowledge sharing in an organisation. The research also revealed that although organisations put much emphasis on the development of a technological infrastructure as a means to develop their knowledge management, it is the organisational and individual factors that may prove to be more important in improving organisational knowledge management. This research has a theoretical contribution for the generalisability of existing knowledge sharing theory across different socioeconomic contexts, in particular in Ethiopia.

J	Lin, CJ; Chen, CC				Lin, Chen-Ju; Chen, Ching-Chou			Decentralization, proactive innovation, and mediators: a comparative analysis of cross-level perceptional differences	ASIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION			English	Article						comparative analysis; decentralization; proactive innovation; dual-test method; a vertical and horizontal structure perspective	MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH; EXPLORATORY INNOVATION; QUANTITATIVE METHODS; TECHNOLOGY VENTURES; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MARKET ORIENTATION; STRATEGIC CONTROL; CONTINGENT VALUE; UPPER ECHELONS	This paper establishes how management can strengthen the proactive innovation of business units as well as how frontline employees can react to local environments through the identification of the strategic actions by local firms. We examine the environment-strategy-performance paradigm through a comparative analysis of a vertical and horizontal structure perspective tested by structural equation modelling, yielding a sample of 252 groups of 382 dual informants interrelated as local managers and frontline employees from local insurance service firms. The findings indicate that perceived market uncertainty is influential in decentralizing management and in the proactive innovation of frontline employees. Consistent with management perception, employees consider resource commitment from hubs and environmental scanning to be effective practices to facilitate proactive innovation. Frontline employees do not strongly consider tolerance in task conflict as a means to achieve proactive innovation, whereas their managers regard it as a method to encourage the free expression of ideas. We use a comparative analysis to disclose the implied perceptional differences in multilevel interactions for promoting organizational proactive innovation instead of the monotonous method to test and interpret a theoretical model.

From several benchmarks, including a few market surveys, the paper highlights and compares data from 20 model companies featured on the 2011 GuiaExame de Sustentabilidade with the concept of the five corporate development stages, by Nidumolu, Prahaladand Rangaswami (2009) that support the discussion and strengthen the need to align products and services with strategies, in order to have sustainability in business. The conclusion is that few companies are in the most advanced stages and there is the need for greater corporate empowerment on the topic and for further research with similar topics.

A questionnaire survey was administered to 209 students taking Business Ethics course in a higher learning institution in Malaysia. The Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) was used to assess the learning approaches adopted by students, whilst the study used Final Examination to measure students' academic performance. The results indicate that majority students, both male and female groups prefer to use deep approach in studying Business Ethics. The findings also reveal that there are significant positive relationships between deep and strategic approaches and academic performance. On the other hand, there is a significant negative relationship between surface approach and examination result. This study provide guidance to educators to adopt effective teaching strategies to improve student learning by encouraging the right approaches to learning in order to improve students ' academic performance.

J	Said, MF; Adham, KA; Quoquab, F				Said, Mohd Fuaad; Adham, Khairul Akmaliah; Quoquab, Farzana			Strategic Posturing of Malaysian Mobile Phone Service Providers	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Strategic posturing; mobile phone service industry; adaptation theory; Miles and Snow business strategy typology; organizational ecology; institutionalization theory		The Malaysian mobile phone service started with only one service provider in the 1980s, which then increased to seven by mid 1990s due to government liberalization policies. Nonetheless, this number decreased to three in 2004, and this marked the beginning of an intense competition within the industry. Utilizing the case study and content analysis methodologies, we gathered data from the public domain and developed a case that describes strategic actions taken by members within the industry. Based on Miles and Snow's business strategy typology, we analyzed the case data by answering the questions of "How do the industry players compete?", and "What factors are important in shaping their strategies?" The research objective is to provide a conceptualization of strategic posturing by Malaysian mobile phone service providers. Our analysis show that the initial strategic moves of these companies are predominantly prospecting, and, later, analyzing, when the market reaches subscription saturation, and competition begins to intensify. Industry latecomers either arise as challengers or adopt a niche strategy as their strategic option. The adaptive actions of these companies are greatly influenced by institutional elements of the government's policies, market situation, and rivals' actions and responses. These actions are mainly tied to resources and capabilities of their large internationalized parent companies. Taken altogether, the perspective of adaptation, as well as the theories of organizational ecology and institutionalization, provides important theoretical grounds in explaining strategic posturing and factors that influence it.

Differentiating between Sampling- and Environment-Related Mortality in Shortnose Sturgeon Larvae Collected Using Anchored D-Frame Nets	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EARLY-LIFE STAGES; LAKE STURGEON; ACIPENSER-BREVIROSTRUM; PESHTIGO RIVER; HABITAT; DRIFT; WISCONSIN; MIGRATION; BEHAVIOR; GROWTH	This study provided the first attempt to differentiate between environmental- and sampling-related mortality in larval Shortnose Sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum. Anchored D-frame nets are widely used for sampling sturgeon larvae, but the associated larval mortality rates are not known. We assessed larval mortality (1) by examining the effect of net deployment period on mortality rate; (2) directly, by deploying live larvae in nets and observing survival over time; and (3) indirectly, by establishing the time of larval death based on body decomposition. Larval mortality in nets deployed for 12 and 24h was similar: 50% of the nets contained no live larvae. After a 6-h deployment, half of the nets contained 60% or more live larvae. After placement of live larvae in nets for 12h, the nets retained 60.0 +/- 20.4% (mean +/- SE) of the deployed larvae. Of the retained larvae, only 6.5 +/- 2.3% (mean +/- SE) survived 12h inside the net. Decomposition rates of dead larvae were examined both in a controlled environment and in the nets. Dead larvae that were deployed in nets decomposed faster than those in a controlled environment, with high decay after only 12h of deployment. A discriminant function analysis differentiated well between larvae that had been dead for 9h and larvae that had been dead for 21 or 32h. The assessment of time of death based on decomposition was used to identify the cause of mortality for Shortnose Sturgeon larvae collected in the Saint John River, New Brunswick, during 2008-2010. We propose that in short to medium deployment periods (up to overnight), pristine and partly decayed larvae can be assigned to sampling mortality, while highly decayed larvae can be assigned to environment-related mortality. Using this distinction, sampling and environmental sources of mortality accounted for at least 20-56% and 4-25%, respectively, of the sampled Shortnose Sturgeon larvae.

J	Fraser, JRS				Fraser, John R. S.			Message from the chair on introducing enterprise risk management (ERM) to a company	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						enterprise risk management; board governance; strategic objectives; chief risk officer; risk oversight; ISO 31000		Enterprise risk management (ERM), as a theory and practice, has captured the attention of governance experts, boards of directors, regulators, rating agencies and senior management over the last 10 years. Unfortunately, the academic research to date on this topic has been meagre; however, there have been a number of leading practices that illustrate how ERM may be implemented in a simple and effective manner. This article takes the essential features of ERM and provides an imaginary speech that demonstrates what a Chair might say to fellow directors to announce the launch of an ERM program. It is not intended that this is the only way, or necessarily the best way, to launch ERM. Obviously, it should be tailored to each company, the intended audience and each Chair's style. This article draws on the author's 13 years of experience as a Chief Risk officer, as well as his extensive studies of ERM best practices. The success rate for successful implementation of ERM continues to be low. There is much confusion as to exactly what ERM is and how to best achieve value from it. It is expected that material such as this will help guide senior management and board members in understanding what ERM is and in their quest as to how to implement ERM in a simple and effective manner.

The first one employs the long term distribution of the local maxima of ship response while the second one uses the expected number of upcrossings of a level by the response. It is mathematically demonstrated that the two approaches are equivalent. However, the upcrossing method is more straightforward and convenient for practical applications, particularly for non-Gaussian responses. The full-scale measurements of a 2800 TEU container ship during the first six months of 2008 are used in the comparisons.

The time stability of the synthetic suspension was firstly investigated. After a few days of continuous mixing a stable suspension was reached, stability being confirmed by monitoring the main physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon and initial particle size). In order to determine the optimum dose of coagulant, the stable suspension was subjected to jar-test experiments using different doses of alum (5 - 35 mg.L-1). For a suspension with initial turbidity <10 NTU, an optimum coagulant dose of 30 mg.L-1 was determined. The particle size distribution by particle number and weighted by size in a 1 L jar during different mixing intensities (45, 90 and 150 rpm) has been investigated. The variation of bentonite-alum flock size was measured using a light scattering method. Results showed that the average flock size (d(50)) increases with increasing flocculation time up to a maximum value of 165.39 mu m due to primary aggregation and then decreases due to flock breakage. The Argaman-Kauffman model fitted very well the experimental data, confirming the utility of this model in the characterization of flocculation process.

The HR strategic management links the HR field to the competitive advantage of corporations contributing to create the possibility of integrating a new perspective that considers economic and social factors in the macro level (IR). While in the USA since the end of the 1980s there are researches relating issues originated from IR with HR in Brazil those fields of study still move quite separately. We chose leadership to better illustrate our point of view because during many years this issue was relegated to ostracism in Brazilian academy, while researches indicate that the direction of the corporations operating in Brazil as well as in the international level has leadership development as the main point in its strategic agenda.

J	Taguchi, H; Yanagawa, T				Taguchi, Hiroyuki; Yanagawa, Taichi			The dynamic impacts of M&A on employment in Japan	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & GOVERNANCE			English	Article						M&A; Acquisition; Merger; Dynamic employment effects		This paper provides empirical evidence on the dynamic effects of merger and acquisition (M&A) on employment in Japan. The main contributions to the gaps in existing literature are: targeting employment effects of M&A, examining them by the deal type (merger and acquisition) and by the sector (manufacturing and non-manufacturing), tracing the effects in the long term, using large dataset with 9,880 sample firms and 2,530 M&A cases for the period from 1995 to 2008, and focusing on the case of Japan. Our main findings are: the "acquisition'' with the key role of "extension and growth'' proved to have positive effects in the dynamic terms on target firms' employment, mainly in manufacturing sector with high labor productivity. On the other hand, the "merger'' with key function of "consolidation'' turned out to have negative impacts dynamically on post-merger firms' employment, mainly in non-manufacturing sector with low labor productivity. The strategic implication might to be that the different employment responses to M&A events between manufacturing and non-manufacturing reflect the difference in labor productivity between them, i.e. the dual structure of Japanese economy.

J	Muniapan, B				Muniapan, Balakrishnan			The Industrial Law and Right to Retrench in Malaysia from a Human Resource Management Perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Comparative Industrial Relations; Human Resource Management; Industrial Law; Malaysian; Managerial Prerogatives; Retrenchment		This paper explores the legal right to retrench employees from a human resource management perspective in Malaysia. The paper is based on the analysis of the relevant statues on retrenchment such the Employment Act 1955, The Industrial Relations Act 1967, the Employment (Termination and Lay-Off Benefits) Regulations 1980 and the Code of Conduct for Industry Harmony 1975. The author has also used criterion based sampling of the Industrial Court and Superior Court awards to analyze retrenchment cases and to provide recommendations to human resource management practitioners. Findings from these cases analyses reveal that many of the retrenchment awards were made against the employers due to poor selection of workforce for retrenchment, and the handling of the retrenchment exercise itself which violated the relevant statutes and the established procedures. The author suggests that retrenchment should not be viewed as a reactive but a proactive exercise, which begins with effective human resource planning aligned with the organizational strategic plan. The retrenchment exercise should also need be seen as a last resort when limiting recruitment, reduction in working hours, helping the employees (workmen) to find alternative employment, encouraging early retirement, offer of voluntary separation scheme (VSS) and other measures have been exhausted. The author hopes with many proactive measures, taken by employers in the management of retrenchment, the number of unfair retrenchment claims made to the Industrial Relations Department will be reduced.

J	Tsai, BH				Tsai, Bi-Huei			ASSESSMENT OF IC CLUSTERING EVOLUTION BY USING A NOVEL DIFFUSION MODEL AND A GENETIC ALGORITHM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Genetic algorithms; Diffusion model; t-statistics; Parameter stability; Vertical disintegration		The evolution of industrial clusters is a critical factor in the strategic development of locations for high-tech industries. Most previous studies have neglected the quantitative aspects of industrial clustering and their access to crucial data may have been limited. This work developed a novel diffusion model to illustrate the extension of IC clusters from Taiwan to China and included foreign direct investment (FDI) as a quantitative indicator of industrial clustering. We also modified the conventional Bass model by incorporating profitability as an incremental factor in conjunction with regulatory FDI limits as constraints for parameter estimation. A genetic algorithm was used with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm for parameter optimization. Finally, t-statistics were used to compare clustering features among three IC sub-industries: design, packaging/testing and memory modules. Simulation results demonstrate negligible standard deviation in the optimized parameters, which confirms the reliability of our findings. Furthermore, comparison results demonstrate that the proposed model is more stable and accurate than the conventional Bass model. The proposed approach is applicable to other high-tech industries and other locations around the world.

Based on Miles and Snow (1978), an empirical study was conducted to explore whether performing firms are those that indicate consistency within the strategy, process, structure and Capability Lifecycle Path arrangement. The basic premise of this study is adaptability for sustainability, where firms go through adaptation cycles through Business Model Innovation would perform well when they are able to consistently create value and effectively manage adopted business models, or denoted as Business Model Effectiveness. Using data obtained from seven Indonesian firms in various industries, PLS Analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between Business Strategy, Firm Resource Configuration, Capability Lifecycle Path and Business Model Effectiveness. Findings indicated that Capability Lifecycle Path, or decisions made on the development of capabilities at the mature stage, is an important part of the series of decisions made during adaptation to ensure performance.

However, the effect that certain types of learning have on the control of the IJV, which are vital for the success of the internationalization of the entrepreneurial firm, has yet to be explored. The results from case studies of six IJVs show that, during the post-formation stage, the configuration of entrepreneurial partner control over the IJV is conditioned by both technology transfer and by learning specific local knowledge by the entrepreneurial partner. The study also shows that the negative relation between trust and control suggested by the literature is limited to cases where trust has broken down. Greater levels of trust are also compatible with greater control with a view to appropriately exploiting when firms see the need to intensify control or need to implement new control mechanisms in order to properly exploit the resources contributed to the IJV.

J	Tsolkas, D; Passas, N; Merakos, L				Tsolkas, Dimitris; Passas, Nikos; Merakos, Lazaros			Increasing Spatial Spectrum Utilization Through Opportunistic User-to-User Communications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WIRELESS INFORMATION NETWORKS			English	Article						Spatial spectrum reuse; Uplink opportunities; User-to-user communications; Direct communications; Opportunistic spectrum access		The requirements for ubiquitous and highly reliable wireless services, combined with the low utilization of licensed spectrum, call for flexible and efficient spectrum management schemes. To this end, a lot of attention is paid in the literature on allowing secondaryexternal users to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum. In parallel to these efforts, the question is whether the licensed users could further improve their own spectrum utilization. In this paper, we focus on increasing the spatial spectrum utilization of an infrastructure- based wireless system by adding autonomous functionality to the primary (system) users. An opportunistic operation mode for the uplink (UL) period, totally transparent to the base station (BS) of the system, is introduced. Users operating in this mode identify spatial spectrum UL opportunities by interpreting BS broadcast messages, and exploit these opportunities by establishing direct connections. It is shown that multiple direct connections can take place in parallel with a single standard UL transmission. Moreover, significant additional throughput is achieved, and in most of the cases, the energy consumption for the direct connections is lower than that of the conventional ones (using the standard mode).

J	Karky, N				Karky, Nandini			International Students in an Indian Technical University: Faculty Counselors' Preparedness and Perspectives	JOURNAL OF STUDIES IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION			English	Article						internationalization of higher education; mobility of students and academic staff; internationalization of the curriculum; strategic institutional management of internationalization; faculty counselors		A qualitative inquiry into the presence of international students in an Indian Technical University, through the voices of the faculty, who are appointed as international students' counselors. A case study methodology was employed with document analysis and interviews to perceive how technical faculty managed students from varying cultural backgrounds. International students were admitted by the Center for International Affairs, a body in the university, in the three categories, namely, foreign nationals (FN), children of nonresident Indians (NRI), and children of Indian workers in Gulf countries (CWIGC). The focus of counseling turned out to be largely on academic performance and related parameters like class attendance. Besides this, the majority of the international student population were the culturally similar students of Indian origin, with nonresident-Indian parents or relatives, living and working in Western and Middle East countries. These factors were the prime reasons that the faculty perceived themselves as well prepared to handle the role of international-students' counselors. A limitation of the study was the low volume of international students and fact that the majority of international student population turned out to be the culturally similar students of Indian origin. Although cultural differences were few in such a case, there were inherent differences between the Indian education system and the educational systems of the origin countries, which provided the necessary focus. Perspectives on the impact of travel abroad, the reasons of internationalization in Indian universities, and the various problems international students face in a different education system were explored. The faculty counselors expressed their view that the university needed many preparatory reforms before it could confidently welcome a large number of international students from various countries.				nandinikarky@gmail.com					Altbach PG., 2007, J STUD INT EDUC, V11, P290, DOI [10.1177/1028315307303542, DOI 10.1177/1028315307303542]; Andrade MS, 2006, J RES INT EDUC, V5, P131, DOI 10.1177/1475240906065589; Cushner K., 2002, J STUD INT EDUC, V6, P44, DOI DOI 10.1177/1028315302006001004; Dolby N, 2008, REV EDUC RES, V78, P676, DOI 10.3102/0034654308320291; Dongaonkar D., 2008, STUDENT MOBILITY NAT; GANGULI H, 1975, FOREIGN STUDENTS IND; Garten J., 2006, NY TIMES; IIE, 2011, EXP US STUD ABR IND; Johnson K., 2003, J RES INT ED, V2, P251, DOI DOI 10.1177/1475240903002003001; Neelakantan Shailaja, 2009, CHRONICLE HIGHER ED; Powar K.

Short-Term Trends in Heart Failure-Related Hospitalizations in a High-Risk State	SOUTHERN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						blacks; disparities; heart failure; prevention; risk factors	STRATEGIC IMPACT GOAL; HIGH BLOOD-PRESSURE; INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY; MORTALITY-RATES; UNITED-STATES; HYPERTENSION; HEALTH; MANAGEMENT; RACE; BENEFICIARIES	Objectives: We sought to determine whether there are signs of improvement in the rates of heart failure (HF) hospitalizations given the recent reports of improvement in national trends. Methods: HF admissions data from the Tennessee Hospital Discharge Data System were analyzed. Results: Hospitalization for primary diagnosis of HF (HFPD) in adults (aged 20 years old or older) decreased from 4.5% in 2006 to 4.2% in 2008. Similarly, age-adjusted HF hospitalization (per 10,000 population) declined by 19.1% (from 45.5 in 2006 to 36.8 in 2008). The age-adjusted rates remain higher among blacks than whites and higher among men than women. Notably, the rate ratio of black-to-white men ages 20 to 34 years admitted with HFPD increased from 8.5 in 2006 to 11.1 in 2008; similarly, the adjusted odds ratios for HFPD were 4.75 (95% confidence interval 3.29Y6.86) and 5.61 (95% confidence interval 3.70-8.49), respectively. There was, however, a significant improvement in odds ratio for HF rates among young black women, as evidenced by a decrease from 4.60 to 3.97 (aged 20-34 years) and 4.21 to 3.12 (aged 35-44 years) between 2006 and 2008, respectively. Among patients aged 20 to 34 and 35 to 44 years, hypertension was the strongest independent predictor for HF. Diabetes and myocardial infarction emerged as predictors for HF among patients aged 35 years and older. Conclusions: The overall rate of HF hospitalization declined during the period surveyed, but the persistent disproportionate involvement of blacks with evidence of worsening among younger black men, requires close attention.

J	Abbasi, M; Hosnavi, R; Mohammadi, M				Abbasi, Morteza; Hosnavi, Reza; Mohammadi, Mehrdad			Designing a Fuzzy Strategic Integrated Multiechelon Agile Supply Chain Network	JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION			English	Article								This paper integrates production, distribution and logistics activities at the strategic decision making level, where the objective is to design a multiechelon supply chain network considering agility as a key design criterion. A network with five echelons of supply chains including suppliers, plants, distribution centers, cross-docks, and customer zones is addressed in this paper. The problem has been mathematically formulated as a biobjective optimization model that aims to minimize the cost (fixed and variable) and maximize the plant flexibility and volume flexibility. A novel multiobjective parallel simulating annealing algorithm (MOPSA) is proposed to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions of the problem. The performance of the proposed solution algorithm is compared with two well-known metaheuristics, namely, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and Pareto archive evolution strategy (PAES). Computational results show that MOPSA outperforms the other metaheuristics.

J	Abrantes, M				Abrantes, Manuel			Uncertain and Experimental Circularity: An Investigation of the Trajectories of Migrant Domestic Workers in Lisbon	JOURNAL OF IMMIGRANT & REFUGEE STUDIES			English	Article						Circular migration; class; domestic work; ethnicity; gender; migrant labor; Portugal	MIGRATION; CARE; IMMIGRATION; PORTUGAL	This article begins by situating Portugal in the debate of circular migration and paid domestic work. Afterwards, the results from an empirical case study are examined drawing mainly on openended interviews with domestic workers. Disputes over economic and social autonomy are paid particular attention. I argue that the scenario underlying circularity in the eyes of respondents is one of uncertainty and experimentalism rather than strategic decision making. Beyond the corroboration of legal status and pecuniary accumulation as decisive factors, two elements are underscored: the emotional content of the employment relationship and the use of job sharing or replacement by workers.

These research programmes need to be planned and negotiated with industrial stakeholders and carried out in partnership with them. This explains why the 2011 ISTeA Conference produced a number of position papers, the 2012 Conference traced the state of the art in the topics identified and the 2013 Conferencedeals with the non-instrumental relationship between Building Production and ICT.

Many researchers have studied this critical subject in order to identify IT project success factors, however, it is a challenge to get universal agreement on which factors are the key. This paper presents an exploratory study of the main factors that affect IT project success in Saudi Arabian public organizations from chief information officers' (CIOs) perceptive. A qualitative approach using semi-structured interview method was used to collect and analyze the data. Interviews were conducted with CIOs to gather their opinions about the IT project success factors. The findings of the study proposed seventeen factors that may have effect on IT project success. Conflict of interest, knowledge management, rewards and recognition, top management stability and project management office (PMO) have been collected from the interviewees. Top management support and commitment, strategic planning, project management, process management, project team competency, IT infrastructure, change management, risk management, communication management, training and education, supplier management, stakeholder management have been collected from the literature and confirmed by the interviewees.

J	Ansah, JP; Qureshi, MA				Ansah, John Pastor; Qureshi, Muhammad Azeem			System dynamics model of debt accumulation in developing countries The case of Ghana and Pakistan	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Public debt; Debt trap; Economic growth; Public finance; System dynamics; Ghana; Pakistan		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a dynamic macroeconomic framework that identifies the fundamental structure of public debt accumulation process in developing countries and its two way linkages with economic growth and public finances. Within this framework, the objective of this study is to identify leverage points that may be utilized to slow down debt accumulation process without slowing down economic growth. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the system dynamics (SD) method to model and analyze the debt accumulation process. This method allows us to analyze the relationship between structure and behaviour of complex dynamic systems. This paper considers fiscal policy as the strategic element of the debt accumulation process and hence it considers seignorage and consequent inflation to be outside the model boundary. In other words the paper assumes that there exists an effective monetary policy that satisfies the objectives of the fiscal policy. Findings - Capping debt servicing (debt relief) increases the debtor country's capacity to invest and the higher investment will raise capacity to pay debt in the future, with some of the rewards going to the creditor. Financing public investment through borrowing produces the highest Debt-GDP ratio compared to all other polices considered. Widening of the tax base to include this informal sector without increasing the tax rate and reducing the extravagant non-debt current expenditure are effective endogenous policy options that help reduce considerably the Debt-GDP ratio. The best composite policy demonstrates that a reduction in the Debt-GDP ratio does not only require exogenous assistance (debt relief) but endogenous government and private sector responsibility to maintain fiscal discipline and generate growth. Originality/value - The unique characteristic of this model is the transparent way in which it represents the two-way feedback relationship between the debt, public finance and economic development taking into consideration the delays and non-linearities involved in this process.

J	Ante, OM; Danijela, VR; Mirjana, M				Ante, Omazic Mislav; Danijela, Vlahov Rebeka; Mirjana, Matesic			DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WISH AND NEED - EVIDENCE OF BUILDING CSR INDEX IN CROATIA	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						corporate social responsibility index; index development; stakeholder management		Issues relating to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) have taken a centre stage in modern societies Strategic accent of CSR is strongly emphasized by the new EU Communication on CSR that was issued in October 2011 which puts forward a new understanding of CS. This understanding no longer refers to CSR as a voluntary action beyond compliance but highlights that every corporation causes impacts which it is then responsible for. Contemplation of the concept of corporate social responsibility as a derivative of certain conditions markets create, thus determining the nature of relations between various stakeholders, positions it in the context of major forces in today's economic and social changes. In order to assess voluntary practices of Croatian companies, the Croatian Chamber of Commerce and the Croatian Business Council for Sustainable Development started developing a benchmarking methodology, which was launched in 2008 in the form of the CSR index of Croatian public and private enterprises. The used methodology for index development was context based, although it was initiated in accordance with similar comparative methodologies such as BITC CR Index. Since 2008, the index was revised, improved and conducted on an every year basis through a voluntary questionnaire that covers six different fields. The principle goal of the project of CSR index was to accelerate development of CSR as a strategic integration tool among Croatian companies and foster a knowledge sharing process among its participants. In this paper we will describe how a project evolved from an idea to an ongoing important national project, and how all stakeholders involved in that process tried to build a benchmark of acceptable corporate behavior among all participants involved.

J	Carter, EV				Carter, E.			Anatomy of a Scan: Digital Market Intelligence and Economic Literacy in the MBA Curriculum	JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS			English	Article						business education; cognitive rubric; digital intelligence; economic literacy; environmental scanning; knowledge economy; market intelligence; strategic planning		This pilot study examined an innovative rubric designed to overcome the deficiencies of present environmental scanning frameworks. The Anatomy of a Scan rubric resolves two problems associated with environmental scanning instruction. First, the need for simpler rubric designs with familiar formats arises because digital knowledge economy intelligence exceeds the capabilities of existing scanning rubrics, given business education course delivery constraints. Second, the need for improved economic information literacy arises because knowledge economy dynamics expand the breadth and depth of digital market intelligence. By using economic market intelligence to anchor environmental scanning, the anatomy rubric improves students' strategic focus with conceptual advantages and raises economic literacy with empirical application.

Strategic choices are those that have to be made between value-based priorities and criteria of effectiveness and which are then reflected in the way an organisation or system of organisations is configured. Strategic choices in national healthcare systems are grouped under three headings: funding, organisation and roles. These are each considered under the prevailing condition of increasing resource constraint. Particular reference is made to the British National Health Service (NHS).

COMPETITIVE PRESSURE SYSTEMS MAPPING IN THE BRAZILIAN TRUCK MARKET	INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION			English	Article						competitive pressure systems mapping; market commonality; strategy; competitive dynamics; rivalry; automotive industry; trucks		The automotive business in Brazil achieved 10% of the industry revenue and 6% of the formal employment by 2008. The commercial vehicle segment concentrated so far eight truck makers that experienced their best market figures in 2008, the economy crisis in 2009, and an extraordinary recovery in 2010. Government tax reduction programs as well as special financing incentives were undoubtedly decisive to re-stimulate the business during the crisis. Positive Brazilian perspectives with the boom in the agricultural, oil and gas, mining and infrastructure activities plus the coming sports events call the attention of new players that are quickly implementing different business strategies to become part of the game. New emission regulations starting from 2012 also bring uncertainties, challenges and opportunities. With the growing globalization and market concentration it's critical for any industry understand and minimize the forces of competitive pressures. The main goal of this paper, therefore, is to contribute to the academy with an alternative approach of strategic and behavioral analysis of rivalry and competition different than the five forces model of Porter. Ford, Iveco, MAN, Mercedes-Benz, Scania and Volvo were assessed from 2008 to 2010 within three main performance indicators - unit sales, gross revenues and operating profits - supporting the elaboration of the competitive pressure systems mapping model of D'aveni, including a hypothetical future scenario with a new entrant and the potential impacts in the system. Main findings and results portray the asymmetrical strategic behavior of competitors and the temporary dynamic stability in the Brazilian truck industry.

In fact, the purpose of this paper is to identify the key dimensions of corporate entrepreneurship and determine how antecedents influence the corporate entrepreneurship and organizational performance. The empirical paper is based on questionnaire survey and statistical analysis. Mailed structured questionnaire data for this study were collected from agricultural extension organizations in Iran (315 usable responses). Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the collected data. According to the results, individual, organizational and environmental factors are the most important antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship and hypotheses on the relationships among these factors and corporate entrepreneurship were mainly and significantly supported across this study.

Evaluation of short-term geomorphic changes in differently impacted gravel-bed rivers using improved dems of difference	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						DoD; geomorphic changes; gravel bed braided river; LiDAR; Piave River; Tagliamento River		The evaluation of the morphological dynamics of rivers is increasingly focusing, in recent years, on the achievement of quantitative estimates of change in order to identify geomorphic trends and forecast targeted restoration actions. Thanks to the development of more effective and reliable survey technologies, more accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEM) can be produced and, through their consequent differencing (DoD), extremely useful geomorphic analyses can be carried out. In this situation, a major role is played by uncertainty, especially in the final volumetric rates of erosion and deposition processes, that may lead to misinterpretation of spatial and temporal changes. This paper aims at achieving precise geomorphic estimates derived from subsequent hybrid (LiDAR and bathymetric points) surface representations. The study areas consist of gravel-bed reaches of two differently impacted fluvial environments, Piave and Tagliamento rivers, that were affected by two severe flood events (Piave, R. I. of 7 and 10 years and Tagliamento, R. I. of 15 and 12 years) in the inter-surveys period. The basic Hybrid Digital Elevation Models (HDTM) were processed accounting for spatially variable uncertainty and consider-ing, beside slope and point density input variables, a novel component measuring the quality of the bathymetric derived points. In fact, since the major changes occur within river channels, the integration of this variable evaluating the precision of the bathymetric channel elevations in the HDTMs, has allowed, through the creation of targeted FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) rules, to obtain reliable geomorphic estimates of change. Volumes and erosion and deposition patterns were then analyzed and compared to outline the different dynamics among the sub-reaches and the two river systems.

J	Duchessi, P; Biswas, R				Duchessi, Peter; Biswas, Rita			Value Creation in the Publishing Industry: The Impact of Acquiring IT Services Firms Between 2002 and 2007	JMM-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MEDIA MANAGEMENT			English	Article								With the presence of online, digital content and new services for manipulating and searching it, printing and publishing firms may experience technological uncertainty and risk and diminishing profitability. Mergers and acquisitions are approaches for dealing with the current technology and market changes that are underway in the printing and publishing industry. Using an event study methodology and a sample of 60 U.S. printing and publishing firms, this study investigates the value creation of acquiring information technology (IT) services firms. The study's findings reveal that printing and publishing firms experience significant increases in their market values as a result of acquiring IT services firms. In fact, non-newspaper firms realize the largest increases in market value. The study's findings should help academicians and practitioners understand the kinds of strategic acquisitions from which printing and publishing firms are most likely to benefit.

On the basis of a review of different theoretical perspectives we propose and apply a taxonomy of motives for inter-firm technological cooperation. We combined quantitative and qualitative methodologies, developing a database of 540 innovative firms and conducting a survey that obtained evidence from 104 of these firms, supplemented by information gathered from 19 in-depth interviews. Our results show that technological cooperation is not easy to achieve and determined by a complex interplay of intentions and practical opportunities. The lack of convergence in the motives for cooperation creates un-favourable conditions and affects negatively the initiation of the cooperation processes. These differences together with asymmetries in access to funding are important obstacles to cooperation with implications in the administration of national policy incentives and its regulation mechanisms.

This indicates distinct second-order sand transport pathways oblique to the main tidal transport pathways. A conceptual model for the development of the bedforms and channels is presented, which comprises hypotheses of the hydrodynamic forcing of the different second-order sand transport pathways. During flood tide, sand is transported along ESE-oriented pathways across the intertidal flat towards the inner tidal basin. During the late stages of ebb tide, sand is transported in drainage channels (WSW-oriented) from the intertidal flat towards the inlet channel. During storm events with winds from SW, wave-generated currents transport sand along a NE-oriented transport pathway from the inlet channel towards the intertidal flat.

However the fact, in the municipality of Cacoal, located in the Western Brazilian Amazon, this industry moves forward significantly. The aim of this study is to interpret this process and answer what is the impact on this restrictive competition for these are appealed to administrative science in face of the Contingency Theory to explain by the method of case study in which the state of the art is questioned and interpreted by the scenario and a focus group active. The result indicates that such ventures are being managed empirically by the founders under agility interpreted in this task. The study also indicates that business managers achieve success because of creativity. It was concluded by the needs of structural adjustments with supported strategic innovation such as those indicated in this task, mediated by knowledge and technology management. The expectation of this study is to improve the concept of creativity and innovating in business.

J	Few, WT; Joshi, M				Few, W. Timothy; Joshi, Mahendra			Top management team decision making: the role of functional and organisational identities on the outcomes of TMT diversity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						top management teams; organisational identity; organisational identification; functional identification; organisational identity strength; decision making; team coherence; team conflict; top management team context	WORK GROUP DIVERSITY; SOCIAL IDENTITY; UPPER ECHELONS; DEMOGRAPHIC FAULTLINES; PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY; RELATIONSHIP CONFLICT; STRATEGIC CHANGE; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	Despite the theoretical advantages of diversity, scholars have come to recognise that diversity among team members can operate as a source of conflict that disrupts team processes and hinders team performance. Diversity creates a problem for teams when members use the features that create diversity, i.e. background, demography, values, to socially categorise members into various subgroups. Consequently, subgroups prevent teams from functioning effectively since they create faultlines that separate members and promote negative interpersonal conflict. In this paper, we argue that TMT members' functional backgrounds can lead to the formation of salient subgroups when members are highly identified with their functional departments. Furthermore, in contexts where the organisation's identity is strong and team members are highly identified with organisation, TMTs are likely to overcome the negative effects of their functional backgrounds and function effectively as a group. Accordingly, this paper contributes to the TMT literature by exploring how diversity affects TMT processes and outcomes.	[Few, W.

J	Frolov, D				Frolov, Daniil			INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PLACE MARKETING (CASE OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSSIAN REGION)	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						Place marketing; Marketing strategy; Rebranding; Stakeholders; Identity		In recent years the special attention is paid to territorial marketing, it is defined by one of instruments of social and economic development and increase in capacity of the territory, and the marketing paradigm gains more and more wide circulation. However there aren't many examples of the strategic oriented and complete approach in this area, the special programs and marketing strategies. The experience of any subject which generalization promotes an increment of knowledge and promotes search of new perspective ways of development is of great importance for researchers and practitioners. The Volgograd region is rather developed and, at the same time, quite representative region from the point of view of the marketing strategy which analysis of experience allows to allocate the typical mistakes and widespread problems of integration of the principles of territorial marketing to the system of regional strategic management. Developing the marketing strategy of the Volgograd region and its implementation it is necessary to consider the existing experience of other territories. The analysis and reconsideration of the work done in recent years, in the field of territorial marketing in the Volgograd region, will allow to avoid the mistakes and to adapt the positive experience. For this purpose, was organized and analyzed the experience of the implementation of territorial marketing, highlighted stages and forms of this process, detailed the typical for Russian regions problems of strategic marketing planning. Besides, the practical based on off-site experience recommendation about development of regional marketing strategy are offered.

J	Fung, IWH; Tam, VWY				Fung, Ivan W. H.; Tam, Vivian W. Y.			Development of an Empirical Model for Selecting Accident Prevention Measures for Construction Managers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction managers; accident prevention measures; accident causation theories; Hong Kong	SAFETY; DESIGN	This paper investigates the association between the mindsets of construction managers on the acceptance of accident causation theories and the vigour of implementing safety measures on accident prevention in the Hong Kong construction industry. A questionnaire survey is conducted. The vigour of implementing each accident prevention measure is predicted by a combination of accident causation theories. Each measure is associated with a unique set of predictors revealing management mindsets in pursuit of accident prevention. A new model for decision making of implementing accident prevention measures is then developed and its application is also demonstrated in this paper. This paper found that Hong Kong construction managers have exhibited their commitment to safety by implementing all the accident prevention measures with above average vigour levels. Referring to the results of the correlation and linear regression between the accident causation theories and the accident prevention measures, the extent of construction managers' acceptance of the accident causation theories do not reflect any linear correlation on their vigour of implementing the accident prevention measures for Safety pre-task planning (M-5), Employee pre-qualification (M-6), Safety training (M-8), Smoking, alcohol and drug ban program (M-10), and Safety meetings (M-13). The systematic and logical based approach in mapping out the specific accident prevention measures can be adopted by the construction managers so that they can implement appropriate measures for safety performance improvement.

J	Soto, GG				Guajardo Soto, Guillermo			PUBLIC COMPANIES IN LATIN AMERICA: HISTORY, CONCEPTS, CASES AND PERSPECTIVES	REVISTA DE GESTION PUBLICA			Spanish	Article						Public companies; Latin America; History; Economy		The article highlights the need to address the history of public companies in Latin America for having played a significant role in regional development during the 20th Century, as well as for the current reappearance of these organisms in the international energy sector, for the strategic role they still play in many countries and, lastly, because decades of privatization have weakened the collective memory on these organisms, in favour of the prevailing neoliberal version which justified the sale of the public heritage. Do we have good knowledge on the history behind the importance and track record of public companies in Mexico and Latin America? How can their resistance after decades of privatizations be explained? These queries are replied in the current dossier of the Public Management Journal, which gathers a group of studies analysing the cases of Uruguay, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina between 1912 and 2012, shedding light on the entrepreneurial activities of the State under different economic models. In these countries, public companies have placed themselves in vital areas for the functioning of the economies, such as telecommunications, electricity, oil, transportation and, to a lesser extent, manufacturing. The final section is an invitation not only to read but also to initiate an agenda to analyse and allow revealing the complex history of these public organisms.

J	Halbert, JCC; McDowell, WS				Halbert, John; McDowell, Walter			Sustaining Local Radio Journalism: A Case Study of the WLRN/Miami Herald Strategic Alliance	JOURNAL OF RADIO & AUDIO MEDIA			English	Article								Facing severe cutbacks in funding from the government and private benefactors, non-profit broadcasters are challenged to sustain meaningful local radio journalism. One survival strategy is to form a strategic alliance with another respected local news organization. This case study examines one such partnership between Miami NPR affiliate WLRN-FM and The Miami Herald newspaper. The study asserts that in addition to offering an innovative business model, this alliance relies heavily on the intangible asset of the brand equity exhibited by both parties.
