J	Cokins, G				Cokins, Gary			The Promise and Perils of the Balanced Scorecard	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article								There is lack of consensus as to what a balanced scorecard is. Many organizations develop a balanced scorecard without first developing a strategy map, from which key performance indicators (KPIs) for the balanced scorecard should be derived. In addition, many organizations confuse strategic KPIs, which belong in a balanced scorecard, with operational performance indicators (PIs), which belong in a dashboard.

Organizational Attributes and the Distribution of Rewards in a Region: Managerial Firms vs. Knowledge Clusters	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						regional cluster; organizational attributes; knowledge spillovers; managerial salaries	PATENT CITATIONS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; GEOGRAPHY; CAPABILITIES; SPILLOVERS; INNOVATION; NETWORKS; MOBILITY; MARKET; STRATEGIES	This paper expands the organization theory and evidence on regional industrial agglomerations. We define regional economic activities according to the attributes of the organizations that populate a region and investigate how organizational characteristics influence macro-outcomes at a regional economic level. We focus on two dimensions emerging from two widely known organizational forms: the managerial corporation and the knowledge cluster with a marked orientation toward interfirm knowledge spillovers. We use an original data set of 146 U. S. cities to obtain variations in the extent to which they are populated by managerial firms or knowledge clusters. By utilizing city-level measures of managerial salaries, we test how the intensity of managerial corporation versus knowledge cluster characteristics affects the mean and dispersion of the "rewards" of cities. Our evidence suggests that higher managerial corporate characteristics lower the variability of rewards, while they have no effect on the mean of rewards. Higher-knowledge cluster characteristics produce both higher dispersion and higher expected rewards. We explain these results by looking at the different learning mechanisms of the two organizational types. In so doing, we highlight the role of intra- and interfirm knowledge processes as important sources of differences in the rewards of the two models. From an empirical point of view, results are confirmed using both patent-based and skill mobility-based measures of knowledge spillovers.

We develop models for capacity choice and expansion decisions in a single firm environment where investment is irreversible and demand is uncertain. These models illustrate specifically the relevance of path-dependent options analysis to planning capacity investments when the firm adopts demand tracking or average capacity strategies. It is argued that Asian/average type real options can explain hysteresis phenomena in addition to providing superior control of assets in place. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Den Hertog, F; Van Iterson, A; Mari, C				Den Hertog, Friso; Van Iterson, Ad; Mari, Christian			Does HRM really matter in bringing about strategic change? Comparative action research in ten European steel firms	EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Human resources management; Strategic change management; Communication, rhetoric and trust building; European steel industry	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; TRUST; FRAMEWORK; ROLES; MODEL	This paper discusses the contribution of human resource management to major transformations in ten European steel companies during the 1990s, and is based on an exchange program organized by the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer). The study focuses on three aspects of HRM's contribution to strategic change: (1) the context in which change was embedded, (2) the implementation process of the change, and (3) the communication strategies used by management to create trustworthiness regarding the change process. Some firms proved to be supporters of "long marches" (incremental change over an extended period of time), while others were rather involved in "short strokes" (rapid overall change) (cf. [Kanter, R. M., Stein, B. A. and Jick, T. D. (1992). The challenge of organizational change. Free Press, New York]). We conclude that HRM has played a role as strategic partner in most steel companies, particularly those who made short strokes, while also a trend towards closer integration of HRM with line management became evident, primarily in those firms taking tong marches.

J	Alhorr, HS; Singh, N; Kim, SH				Alhorr, Hadi S.; Singh, Nitish; Kim, Seung H.			E-COMMERCE ON THE GLOBAL PLATFORM: STRATEGIC INSIGHTS ON THE LOCALIZATION-STANDARDIZATION PERSPECTIVE	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH			English	Article						global; e-commerce; standardization; globalization; localization	MARKETING STANDARDIZATION	While extensive empirical and theoretical literature has been developed on organizational adaptation, especially in strategic management, the broad application of the environment-organization has not been applied adequately to the growing global e-commerce research realm. In this paper, we apply the concept of "adaptive strategies" [Kraatz 1998] to e-commerce practices in the global arena to address the localization-standardization paradigm, which continues to be a healthy debate. Bringing two areas of research together, the global e-commerce and institutional theory perspectives of organizational change and adaptation, adds a new dimension to the literature of global e-commerce, and conforms with institutional theorists that organizations are adaptive systems attempting to match the complexities of their environments [Meyer and Rowan 1977]. This paper offers strategic insights about the localization-standardization debate in international business and its strategic implications on global e-commerce strategies.

J	Asem, SO; Roy, WY				Asem, Samira Omar; Roy, Waleed Y.			Biodiversity and climate change in Kuwait	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Plants; Deserts; Biodata; Land; Kuwait; Global warming		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the various consequences of climate change on the biodiversity of Kuwait. Many world organizations have established strategic plans for climate change, such as The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, which is adopted in 2002 by the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utlizes a wide range of research projects completed at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR), which provide information leading to the degradding effects and risks of climate change on the biodiversity and ecosystem services of Kuwait. Findings - The biodiversity of Kuwait is under severe stress due to natural and anthropogenic factors. The region is also threatened physically and biologically by the global warming phenomena. More severe and harsh climatic conditions will cause increase in formation of sand dunes, sand encroachment, and extreme dust storms. In 2008, Kuwait has the worst ever reported summer since 1991 with increase in intensity and frequency of dust storms. Drought will cause more water demand for local consumption and irrigation. The seawater temperature increase would affect the spawning period of fish and shrimp and would cause migration of fish to other more suitable areas. This would cause severe impact on the fish industry in Kuwait and the region. Losses in plant cover will be due to sand encroachment or erratic rainfall periods causing runoff and flooding. Research limitations/implications - The work is based on various projects at the KISR and by some journal publications that relate to climate change impact on biodivesity. More research work is needed to test the long-term impact of climate change on bidivesity of Kuwait. Originality/value - There is a need to develop a strategic plan for climate change mitigation and adaptation in Kuwait. Specific elements of the plan would include: research for identification of vulnerable species, collecting field population data, conducting modeling research to inform conservation programs; monitoring key species; ex situ conservation using living collection and ensuring representation in conservation collection; in situ conservation and increase in protected areas; education and public awareness programs; networking; and sharing knowledge.

J	Caudle, SL; de Spiegeleire, S				Caudle, Sharon L.; de Spiegeleire, Stephan			A New Generation of National Security Strategies: Early Findings from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						national security; national strategies; strategic management		This article presents early observations from the experiences of two early adapters of a new generation of national security strategies, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The new strategies are broader in scope in addressing security challenges and are "whole of government,' even increasingly "whole of society' in nature. The strategy development process takes advantage of new mechanisms whereby governments can sense and prioritize quickly changing security challenges, adaptively plan for those challenges, and anchor the strategies in regular policy and budget cycles. The national security strategy experiences of both countries illustrate common themes and challenges that other countries might consider, ranging from fundamentally understanding the importance of a national security strategy as an effective frame of reference for national security decisions to the importance of administrative actions to keep the strategy "evergreen," whether through a formal or informal assessment process.

J	Chen, D				Chen, Dan			Does inter-firm technological cooperation enhance innovation performance? An empirical study of high-tech SMEs in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						high technology; SMEs; small and medium-sized enterprises; inter-firm cooperation; product innovation; innovation performance; learning		This study, utilising data drawn from a sample of 133 China's high-tech Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), examines the effect of inter-firm technological cooperation on product innovation. The framework builds on the emerging strategic management theories, including resourced-based view, knowledge-based view and dynamic capability view of the firm. Results are concluded as: Firm size, coupled with cooperation, has significant influence on patent creation; the success rate of cooperation increases as the number of cooperative projects increases; more firms engage in cooperative relationships, better firms perform in sales and profitability.

J	Cheng, V; Rhodes, J; Lok, P				Cheng, Vincent; Rhodes, Jo; Lok, Peter			A framework for strategic decision making and performance among Chinese managers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Chinese culture; cognitive-speed path; organizational performance; social-political path; strategic decision making processes (SDM)	ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMISM; COGNITIVE DIVERSITY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CULTURE; RATIONALITY; IMPACT; GUANXI; LOCUS; WORK; COMPREHENSIVENESS	This study develops an integrative model that explains the relationship between Chinese culture, managers' strategic decision making (SDM) processes, and organizational performance. For the study 1200 participants were randomly selected from a business club's company register, resulting in 204 valid respondents. The results highlighted two significant SDM paths used by managers: (1) the cognitive-speed path, which suggested that Overseas Chinese managers (the Chinese who live outside of Mainland China) focus on the big picture, draw analogies from past experiences, and use extensive networks to reduce the duration of the decision process; and (2) the social-political path which shows that Overseas Chinese managers focus on collective interests, strive to maintain harmony, and to save face while using a collaborative style to handle conflict; this approach reduces dysfunctional political behavior, while reinforcing the decision team's focus on common goals. From these results we concluded that a speedier decision making process (based on intuition, experience, and networks) accompanied by the appropriate use of political behavior (that created harmony, through a hierarchical structure, during conflict management) in the Overseas Chinese managers' strategic decision making process could positively influence organizational performance.

TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN MERGING HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS: A CASE STUDY	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						transformational leadership; merger; incorporation; executive management; higher education		Orientation: The use of transformational leadership in the implementation of merger and incorporation policy in the higher education sector is well documented in other parts of the world and not in countries in transition like South Africa. Research purpose: The objectives of this study were to establish an understanding of 'transformational leadership' and to determine the extent to which it was employed by leaders in an institution of higher education which had incorporated another institution. Motivations for the study: The study provides a starting point, not only for the successful implementation of higher education changes in the future but also the building of leadership commitment and alignment to the proposed changes in the sector as well as the development of institutional leadership teams to take responsibility for any other transformation processes. Research design, approach and method: The population of the study consisted of 350 full-time employees of the institution who had experienced the incorporation process. Two samples - one consisting of six executive management leaders and the other consisting of 153 employees - were used. Both qualitative and quantitative research approaches were employed using the case study method. Main findings: Results showed that transformational principles of idealised influence, intellectual stimulation, and inspirational motivation principles were used more than others and that employees were generally not satisfied with how the incorporation process had taken place. Practical/managerial implications: The results of the study affected the attitude and satisfaction of the employees in this study. Contribution/value-add: The study reveals that leaders in the institution played key roles such as shared vision, team work and the creation of an enabling environment. An important point that has emanated from this study is the evidence that during transformation, a lack of strategic direction and empowering of followers and capacitating them leads to dissatisfaction with the whole process, despite the transformation process being declared a success.

J	Droege, S; Johnson, NB				Droege, Scott; Johnson, Nancy Brown			Limitations of low-end disruptive innovation strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						airline; disruptive innovation; human resource strategy; low cost		Using qualitative data, we build a case study of differentiation and cost containment based on personal interviews from top management team members, secondary data, and media reports from AirTran Airways and analyze these data from both strategic management and human resource perspectives. From a strategic perspective, AirTran Airways offers service attributes for which customers, at least so far, have been unwilling to pay a large price premium. Nevertheless, AirTran Airways' efficiency has positioned it near the top of the industry in terms of profitability. From a human resource perspective, AirTran Airways blends flexibility and control in an effort to increase labor productivity. This builds on the disruptive innovation literature by suggesting boundary conditions especially when such conditions are swayed by legacy labor practices. Still, given the intensely competitive structure of the airline industry, AirTran has managed to sustain a competitive advantage. However, AirTran Airways illustrates the limitations of a low-end market disruptive innovation strategy and illustrates how industry structure places intrinsic limitations on the profitability of new entrants pursuing such strategies.

J	Ginige, K; Amaratunga, D; Haigh, R				Ginige, Kanchana; Amaratunga, Dilanthi; Haigh, Richard			DEVELOPING CAPACITIES FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: CAPACITY ANALYSIS IN SRI LANKA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Built environment; Capacity development framework; Capacity gaps; Disaster risk reduction; Sri Lanka		This paper introduces a framework for capacity development for disaster risk reduction in the built environment. The framework was developed as a part of an ongoing research which aims to strengthen the capacities of individuals and institutions in the built environment to ensure that disaster risk reduction meets its mission and goals in a sustainable way. It is presented as a matrix that identifies four stages of capacity development against six groups of stakeholders in the built environment. The stages and the stakeholder groups were derived through a series of expert interviews and a comprehensive literature review. The four stages are named as Analysis, Creation, Utilisation and Retention. This paper in its latter sections focuses on the first stage, Analysis, and presents some of the initial findings of the research. Analysis attempts to capture capacity gaps in the relevant context in order to identify required capacity development. The study reviews literature on Sri Lanka and discusses such capacity gaps. Problems in the regulatory structure, deficiencies in necessary laws and regulations including problems in their implementation, and lack of required resources and skills have been identified as the major capacity gaps in the country.

J	Gupta, A; Mittal, S				Gupta, Akanksha; Mittal, Sanjiv			Measuring retail productivity of food & grocery retail outlets using the DEA technique	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						grocery; Indian retail; productivity; measurement technique; DEA	EFFICIENCY; SCALE; PERFORMANCE; ECONOMIES; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	This paper explores the productivity measurement aspects in the Indian grocery retail sector. Here, an attempt has been made to measure the productivity of retail outlets with specific reference to Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR). Productivity is the ratio of output and input. The input and output variables for this study were selected with proper care. The variables were discussed with the retailers during the preparation of the study. In this present research, six input variables have been taken, namely: total square feet area of the store; total number of Stock Keeping Units; number of point of sales machines; labour cost/wages of employees; number of employees; and working hours of the employees. The two output variables taken are sales and customer conversion ratio. The non-parametric technique of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for measuring the efficiency of 43 retail outlets firms has been used. It was found out that 16 out of the 43 firms are efficient units (who have a score of 1), meaning they are the ones who are optimally utilising their input for the generation of output. This will help the retailers in the long term to improve them after benchmarking with the efficient retail firms.

J	Gustafsson, M; Smyth, H; Ganskau, E; Arhippainen, T				Gustafsson, Magnus; Smyth, Hedley; Ganskau, Elena; Arhippainen, Tomas			Bridging strategic and operational issues for project business through managing trust	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project management; Operations management; Social capital; Management strategy; Trust		Purpose - Organisational trust is analysed through observation of operations or strategic prescription. The management and project management literature is largely prescriptive. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role and potential of strategic trust development and management to improve operations in the project business and enhance client satisfaction, analysing trust as social capital. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is supported by the method of and data gathered through CROL (R) : a process for managing business relationships and interfaces. The case in question focuses on over 30,000 customer relationships covering five years of global operations by companies in the project business. Findings - The analysis focuses on the connection between self-awareness, performance, improvement and the impact upon both relationships and financial performance - social capital in the "balance sheet". The objective is to identify the extent to which trust management can help bridge the gap between prescriptive strategy and operations. Bridging this gap entails linking trust as social capital with organisational culture, operational systems and routines, and behaviours. Research limitations/implications - The analysis shows the importance of self-awareness in managing business relationships. Practical implications - The paper outlines on a conceptual level how companies can manage trust and capture the value in business relationships. Originality/value - The paper shows how companies through systematic forced reflection can manage trust in individual business relationships.

Biogeochemical Influences Associated with Sedimentation in Riparian Forests of the Southeastern Coastal Plain	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ORGANIC-MATTER REMOVAL; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; N-MINERALIZATION; FLOOR REMOVAL; WETLAND	The importance of riparian forests in maintaining water quality through the retention of sediments and nutrients is well understood; however, little is known about how sediment deposition from upland erosion affects the integrity ' of these systems. The objectives of this study were to compare decomposition rates, net N mineralization rates, microbial biomass, and other soil properties along a gradient of sedimentation rates in headwater systems. These factors were measured in 17 plots situated within riparian forests of ephemeral streams at Ft. Benning, GA. The soils were analyzed for texture, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and bulk density, A decline in soil quality was found with increasing sedimentation rates. Soils in plots with the highest sedimentation rates (highly disturbed or HD) exhibited decreased CEC, temperature, and moisture, and increased bulk density, sand content, and pH. The HD plots also had lower nutrient turnover from decomposition, net N mineralization rates, and microbial C and N. Declines in biogeochemical processes corresponded to sedimentation rates associated with HD plots (1.0 cm yr(-1)). Shifts in biological indicators corresponding to annual variations in climate suggest that the stress of sedimentation may be further exacerbated by drought conditions. The results of this study imply that even low levels of erosional deposition in headwater riparian forests may significantly impact biogeochemical processes in these systems.

Strategic flexibility choices in the ocean transportation industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT LOGISTICS			English	Article						shipping; transport; flexibility; competence; capability; strategy	MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; SUPPLY CHAIN; PERSPECTIVE; DEFINITION; FRAMEWORK	Flexibility is an issue widely studied in the manufacturing literature, but only recently has attention been paid to flexibility in logistics and supply chain management. Flexibility is taking prominence due to the uncertainties and disruptions created in the production and distribution processes of an organisation and its respective supply chains. This paper aims at studying the level of transport flexibility achieved in the ocean transportation industry to gain understanding on the strategic choices of carriers to cope with market changes and customer demand. Our analysis indicates the different strategic choices ocean transportation companies need to make with regards to transport flexibility.

J	Mefford, RN				Mefford, Robert N.			Offshoring, lean production and a sustainable global supply chain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain; lean production; sustainability; CSR; corporate social responsibility; sweatshop labour; offshoring	PERFORMANCE; CODES	Seeking lower costs of production, many global firms have offshored production of products, parts and services. Results of these efforts have often disappointed in terms of quality, productivity and sustainability issues. Firms need to take a strategic view of offshoring decisions emphasising the role foreign production plays in their supply chain. Modern systems, such as lean production, require a tightly linked global supply chain. Lean production also fosters a sustainable global supply chain making practices such as sweatshop working conditions and environmental pollution incompatible and uneconomic.

J	Molteni, M; Pedrini, M				Molteni, Mario; Pedrini, Matteo			In search of socio-economic syntheses	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; Organizational performance; Stakeholder analysis; Management accountability		Purpose - Starting from the premise that responsible managers utilize their competences and creativity to carry out projects which improve stakeholder satisfaction and economic performance simultaneously, the paper aims to present a classification of these solutions, called socio-economic syntheses, and the way to reach them. Design/methodology/approach - The paper refers to literature on corporate social responsibility and sustainability, with special attention to contributions on the relationship between social performance and economic performance. In particular, the model presented highlights several successful case studies that have been studied or directly observed in large and medium-sized firms. Findings - The paper provides a classification of seven categories of socio-economic syntheses, from solutions concerning operational management, often applicable in different industries, to projects with greater strategic value, which are typically firm-specific. Moreover, two ways to achieve a win-win solution are proposed: the first starting from an idea of activity aimed at improving economic performance; the second from the desire to better satisfy expectation of one or more stakeholder categories. Practical implications - In this paper practitioners can find suggestions and opportunities for better introduction of win- win solutions inside their firms, which could be the fruit of imitation or creativity. Originality/value - The classification of the socio- economic syntheses represents a new conceptualization that opens up paths for an increasing number of solutions that can improve economic and socio-environmental performance simultaneously.

The internationalization of Austrian firms in Central and Eastern Europe	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Austrian companies; CEE region; internationalization processes	ENTRY MODE CHOICE; PSYCHIC DISTANCE; CULTURAL DISTANCE; OWNERSHIP; STRATEGY	We test and expand the Uppsala model with a sample of 109 Austrian companies active in the CEE region, representing 1,271 entries. On the one hand, our expansion of the model is based on collective learning of firms from a specific context, an issue largely neglected in IB research. On the other hand, we expand the model by including two further strategic, i.e. dependent, variables. The paper contributes to research by finding three distinct internationalization processes in CEE, two of them new to the Uppsala Model. Furthermore, the paper strongly supports our argumentation with regard to collective learning and thereby draws new conclusions on learning processes that take place within and between firms over time. Dieser Beitrag testet und erweitert das Uppsala Modell anhand eines Samples von 1.271 Markteintritten durch 109 osterreichische Firmen in der CEE Region. Unsere Erweiterung bezieht sich einerseits auf kollektives Lernen, emn Phanomen welches bisher in der IB Literatur weitgehend vernachlassigt wurde. Andererseits erweitern wir das Modell durch die Einbeziehung von zwei weiteren abhangigen Variablen. Der Artikel leistet einen Beitrag zur Forschung in dem drei unterschiedliche Internationalisierungsprozesse, zwei davon neu fur das Uppsala Model, identifiziert werden. Daruber hinaus unterstutzen die Ergebnisse unsere Argumentation des kollektiven Lernens. Dies lasst neue Schlusse in Bezug auf Lernprozesse, welche innerhalb aber auch zwischen Firmen stattfinden, zu.

J	Palousis, N; Luong, L; Abhary, K				Palousis, N.; Luong, L.; Abhary, K.			Sustainability risk identification in product development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING			English	Article						sustainability risk; product life cycle; life-cycle assessment; life-cycle costing; carbon price; waste regulations		Sustainability-related issues present significant financial, strategic, compliance and operational risks to manufacturers. Many of these risks directly or indirectly result from the way a product is designed and managed across its life cycle. Assessing sustainability risk (S-R) at the product design stage is crucial for the development of products that both minimise sustainability risk exposure and are environmentally sustainable. Managing the costs associated with these risks requires risk management intervention at the design stage before these costs are committed throughout the life cycle (production, use, end-of-life). The goal of the sustainability risk assessment (SRA) methodology is to provide an approach to comparing the financial cost of a 'sustainable product' vs. an 'unsustainable product', by factoring in the effects of S-R on life-cycle cost. The SRA methodology demonstrates that, in some cases, sustainable products cost less than unsustainable products when sustainability risk is considered in the costing analysis. This paper outlines the first step of the SRA methodology, which is a process for identifying SR inherent in the product life cycle. Once key risks are identified, the subsequent steps of the SRA assess and prioritise these risks for treatment through changes to product design and materials composition.

J	Power, D; Hanna, V; Singh, PJ; Samson, D				Power, Damien; Hanna, Victoria; Singh, Prakash J.; Samson, Danny			Electronic markets, data access and collaboration: relative value to performance in firm operations	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Electronic commerce; Marketing strategy; Operations management; Supply chain management	SUPPLY-CHAIN-MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION; TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; DATA INTERCHANGE; BUSINESS; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT; LINKAGES; COMMERCE	Purpose - This paper aims to examine the direct and indirect effects of the use of electronic markets (e-markets), access to online data and trading partner collaboration on operational performance. Design/methodology/approach - This study involved survey data from 233 Australian firms. Data were provided by members of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply Australia, who reflected upon relevant practices and performances of their firms. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings - The results show that whilst all three direct effects are non-significant, when the indirect effects are taken into account, the total effects are significant in strength. This suggests that use of e-markets, access to online data and collaboration with trading partners, when taken in isolation, are not as effective as could be expected. However, when these factors are implemented together, their value and impact becomes significant. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to Australian firms. Practical implications - The results highlight that investments in information and communication technology must be deployed in an holistic manner, for example, by combining use of web-based applications and market mechanisms with effective data sharing and collaboration, if they are to produce significant improvements in operations. Originality/value - While e-markets may have been viewed as a mechanism for reducing the costs of inputs and/or as a new demand channel, this study establishes that more value can be extracted when this technology is viewed and exploited in a more strategic manner. E-markets should be used in concert with access to data and collaboration with trading partners who are able to exploit the opportunities for mutual benefit.

J	Roumboutsos, A; Chiara, N				Roumboutsos, Athena; Chiara, Nicola			A strategic partnering framework analysis methodology for public-private partnerships	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Public sector organizations; Private sector organizations; Partnership; Strategic alliances; SWOT analysis		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to view and analyse public-private partnerships (PPPs) under a strategic partnering approach between the key parties involved, i. e. public sector, private sector and lenders, and their business environment. Design/methodology/approach -A strategic partnering framework analysis methodology has been devised based on existing and well-known business strategic analysis tools (the political-economic-social-technological (PEST) and strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) analysis). The methodology consists of modules and may be used to identify the potential of strategic partnering in a sector and/ or country and/ or for a particular project in a procurement process. By using appropriate modules of the methodology, public sector partnering requirements or the market potential for PPPs, in general, may be assessed. Findings - The small-scale application of a module of the methodology is demonstrated through an international consultation on the influence of the present credit crunch. Findings indicate market changes and trends that may be pursued. Research limitations/ implications - The proposed strategic partnering methodology may be used in all business partnership applications. Its scope is to identify the key elements on which the particular partnership should be based. Originality/value - PPPs have been viewed through finance-and service-based approaches. The present study introduces the view of a partnership-based approach. In the effort, the study also presents improvements to the commonly used PEST and SWOT analysis by adding a dynamic dimension to the analysis.

J	Shamir, E				Shamir, Eitan			The Long and Winding Road: The US Army Managerial Approach to Command and the Adoption of Mission Command (Auftragstaktik)	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article						Mission Command (Auftragstaktik); US Army; Managerial Approach	INNOVATION; WAR	The purpose of the current paper is to examine the adoption and adaptation process of mission command (Auftragstaktik) in the US Army. This concept, developed by the Prussians, denotes a decentralized command approach wherein superiors dictate their intent and allow subordinates to formulate their operational plans independently and change it according to the emerging situation. The paper examines the US command approach prior to the adoption of mission command. It argues that it was heavily influenced by corporate management practices which inherently contradict mission command approach. It continues and investigates how the US Army endeavored to emulate the approach in its doctrine and in major operations. While it has officially incorporated mission command into its doctrine, it has been less successful in utilizing it in operational situations. This state of affairs has to do with the cultural legacy of the managerial approach to command that still persist. Despite the partial success, the US Army has recently reaffirmed its commitment to this approach.									AMIDROR B, 1979, PENGUIN BOOK AM CIVI, P9; Aylwin-Foster Brig.

ALLOCATION RULES WITH OUTSIDE OPTION IN COOPERATION GAMES WITH TIME-INCONSISTENCY	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coalition games; network games; allocation rules; Myerson-value; time-inconsistency; outside option; supply chain cooperation	PROOF NASH EQUILIBRIA; DECISION-MAKING; QUANTITATIVE-EVALUATION; MULTICRITERIA METHODS; TRANSITION ECONOMY; TOPSIS METHOD; VILNIUS CITY; REAL-ESTATE; CONSTRUCTION; SELECTION	In game theory agents have the possibility to make binding agreements. The agents are assumed to determine their strategies based on intended but bounded rationality. The field of strategic games provides the possibility to an agent to understand the optimality of his behaviour. In coalition and network games stability, Pareto-efficiency and fairness of agreements is investigated. The paper shows the relationship between the different fields of game theory in the case of 3 agents. On that basis it shows the ubiquity of time-inconsistency in dynamic setting due to bounded rationality, deception and environment changes. The paper explains why allocation rules like the Shapley-based Aumann-Dreze-value and the Myerson-value for coalition structures must be modified in dynamic setting in order to consider the influence of excluded agents, the outside option. An accordingly modified allocation rule is introduced and investigated. It is shown that the "Aumann-Dreze-value" and the "Myerson-value for coalition structures" remains relevant for the case that the switching of the partner is connected with high costs. It is shown through the example of enterprise cooperation in supply chains that low partner switching costs require the introduced allocation rule that considers the outside option.

J	Storck, J				Storck, Joakim			Exploring improvement trajectories with dynamic process cost modelling: a case from the steel industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						cost analysis; manufacturing strategy; simulation; process industry; system dynamics; exploratory data analysis	SYSTEM DYNAMICS; CAPABILITIES; TOOL; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY	Improvement trajectories are sequential managed chains of improvement initiatives required to handle changes in competition and market. This paper presents a five-step framework, based on dynamic process cost modelling, which was developed during a four-year research project at a major stainless steel producer, to support the selection of an improvement trajectory based on strategic requirements to combine high product diversity with cost reduction. The framework aims to develop insight into what manufacturing capabilities are required to reach the strategic goals by combining system dynamics simulation with process cost modelling and visual exploratory data analysis in an iterative modelling procedure. The applicability of the five-step framework is demonstrated through a case study from the steel industry, in which a goal driven analysis is used to assess process requirements based on performance and market considerations.

J	Strehle, F; Katzy, BR; Davila, T				Strehle, Florian; Katzy, Bernhard R.; Davila, Tony			Learning capabilities and the growth of technology-based new ventures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technology-based new ventures; entrepreneurial growth; dynamic capabilities; management control systems; MCS	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PERFORMANCE; EVOLUTION; MARKET	This study considers the impact of organisational learning as endogenous growth driver for technology-based new ventures. Over a period of up to 12 years, the growth path of 44 venture capital backed companies was analysed as critical event series, where the events were the adoption of 50 management control systems. The study shows that the adoption of eight bundles of these systems, which are used as proxies for the emergence of the dynamic capabilities strategic planning, financial planning, and evaluation, human resource planning, and evaluation, product development, marketing and sales, and partnering are positively associated to the growth of the venture. In addition, the growth path, i.e. the order of adoption, is associated with growth performance.

J	Valentini, C				Valentini, Chiara			Personalised networks of influence in public relations Strategic resources for achieving successful professional outcomes	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social groups; Influence; Social values; Public relations; Italy	GUANXI	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to look into Italian PR practitioners' opinions on whether or not specific social networks, the personalised networks of influence, are perceived to be one of the main strategic resources and the degree of relevance they give to such networks. Personalised networks of influence are also tested with Italian journalists. Design/methodology/approach - The data of the study were gleaned from a survey on PR practitioners' and journalists' self-perceptions and perceptions of each other that was conducted in Italy from March to October 2007. The survey was based both on qualitative data collected through personal interviews with senior PR practitioners and journalists and on quantitative data gathered through an online, close-ended questionnaire. The study is based on the analysis of the survey data on personal influence. Findings - The findings show no statistical difference between PR practitioners and journalists. PR practitioners and journalists did not perceive the importance of having personalized networks of influence differently with regard to their professional activities, although they valued more significantly having strong professional skills than personalised networks for their career advancement. Originality/value - The study offers new insights into the personal influence model and the concept of influence and power in relation to public relations practitioners' career advancement and professional activities.

With the introduction of advanced IT systems which collect and model internal customer data (CRM), marketing managers face new choices when seeking information to facilitate their particular business strategy. A survey of market research (MR) and CRMusage was conducted among 207 marketing managers. The findings showed the Miles and Snow Prospector strategists placed greater reliance on both MR and internal CRM data systems than did Defenders. This applied in their tasks of developing new strategies and in enlisting senior management support for their actions. As Prospectors were the most reliant on both traditional market research and CRM systems, they need to be skilled in using CRM in conjunction with traditional research methods. Marketing managers who use CRM will need to foster functional relationships with the technical specialists who run CRM systems.

J	Vanpoucke, E; Vereecke, A				Vanpoucke, Evelyne; Vereecke, Ann			The predictive value of behavioural characteristics on the success of strategic alliances	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						strategic alliances; supply chain management; operational performance	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; INTEGRATION; TRUST; COLLABORATION; CONSTRUCTS; COMMITMENT; INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK	An increasing number of companies are setting up strategic alliances with suppliers and customers. However, the majority of these alliances do not succeed. Our aim is to understand how different behavioural characteristics are associated with alliance success. We hypothesise that alliance attributes, communication behaviour, and alliance management are predictors of cost benefits and service benefits. Furthermore, we found that while alliance attributes are related with both cost and service benefits, communication behaviour and alliance management are only associated with service and cost benefits, respectively. We also see that alliance attributes explain most of the variance of supply chain success and are thus better predictors of alliance success than other behavioural characteristics. Furthermore, we provide insight into the way managers can build up supply chain performance by setting up strategic alliances.

J	Leese, B; Storey, C; Cheater, F				Leese, Brenda; Storey, Claire; Cheater, Francine			Retaining primary and community nurses over the age of 50 years: the views of managers	JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						older nurses; primary and community care; retention; strategies; workforce		Aim To investigate employment policies in England to encourage retention of primary and community nurses over the age of 50 years. Background Little is known about why older nurses in the primary and community workforce leave or what might encourage them to stay. Methods Fifteen telephone interviews with staff with responsibility for the nursing workforce in five primary care trusts (PCTs) and associated Workforce Development Confederations and Strategic Health Authorities. Results When older nurses left, there was concern about the loss of skills, experience and intelligence about local communities. Strategies such as flexible working, support for returners and carers, and career breaks had been introduced. Concern about pensions was a key influence on nurses' decisions to stay or leave nursing. Conclusions Efforts were being made to introduce employment strategies to improve the working lives and experiences of all nurses. Some policies designed more specifically for younger nurses requiring childcare were also being taken up by older nurses with caring responsibilities. There were numerous strategies in place or being set up to improve recruitment and retention, indicating a desire amongst managers to retain their pool of nurses. Implications for Nursing Management Managers should continue to develop policies to retain older nurses and learn from others with successful strategies.

The method suggests using it series of fools mentioned in the literature that were organized providing logical reasons for the managers to build the management system. When mapping the processes of the studied enterprise, four macroprocesses were identified. which Were sustained by 21 support processes. in addition to three management processes. The strategic aims were determined by the internal and external environmental analysis, resulting in five priority items, and the processes considered critical to achieve them were described by flow diagrams. The strategies to achieve the goals were determined by the Porter General Strategies method, where the differentiation option was chosen for the two main macroprocesses. whose action focuses were different.

J	Clarke, AH				Clarke, Ann Hojbjerg			Bridging Industrial Segmentation Theory and Practice	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING			English	Article						Industrial segmentation; product development; action research; segmentation process	MARKET-SEGMENTATION; PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; INTUITION; STRATEGY; ISSUES	Purpose Segmentation is seen today as a core concept within mainstream marketing. While industrial segmentation has received considerable attention within academic literature, there have been many reports on companies having problems using, applying, and implementing the principles of segmentation. Authors criticize the literature on segmentation forgiving too little attention to implementation, providing marketers little help and guidance on bow to make segmentation work in a practical environment. This article addresses some of these problems. Methodology/Approach: The objective of this article is to design a process with methods and activities for segmentation by building on action research case study data from a large Danish industrial company. Findings: Along with important considerations, this article presents the process of segmentation using a build-up approach based on qualitative market data. The process is practical and easily approachable for companies. The purpose behind segmentation is strategic-identify target segments and facilitate the planning of future product offers. It is argued that segmentation should be dedicated to the purpose and context of the company. This case illustrates how the company adapted segmentation theory to their particular needs.

A decision support model for establishing an air taxi service: a case study	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						air transport; decision analysis; heuristics; practice of OR; simulation	A-RIDE PROBLEM; TIME WINDOWS; DELIVERY PROBLEM; TRANSPORTATION; OPERATIONS; ALGORITHM; PICKUP	Recent availability of relatively cheap small jet aircraft creates opportunities for a new air transport business: Air taxi, an on-demand service in which travellers call in one or a few days in advance to book transportation. In this paper, we present a methodology and simulation study supporting important strategic decisions, like for instance determining the required number of aircraft, for a company planning to establish an air taxi service in Norway. The methodology is based on a module simulating incoming bookings, built around a heuristic for solving the underlying dial-a-flight problem. The heuristic includes a separate method for solving the important subproblem of determining the best distribution of waiting time along a single aircraft schedule. The methodology has proved to provide reliable decision support to the company.

J	Jones, MR; Karsten, H				Jones, Matthew R.; Karsten, Helena			DIVIDED BY A COMMON LANGUAGE? A RESPONSE TO MARSHALL SCOTT POOLE	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article							GIDDENSS STRUCTURATION THEORY; ADAPTIVE STRUCTURATION; TECHNOLOGY	Marshall Scott Poole identifies some important issues in the treatment of adaptive structuration theory in our review of the use of Giddens's structuration theory in IS research (Jones and Karsten 2008). We argue, however, that a number of his criticisms reflect differences in our respective use of particular terms and that the statements made in Jones and Karsten are reasonable, especially in the light of Giddens's own writings. There are some substantive differences between our position and that of Poole, though, especially in relation to the distinctiveness and compatibility of positivist and interpretive research, and the immateriality of Giddens's structures. Arguments are presented to show that, as Jones and Karsten discussed, Giddens's position is able to offer a plausible and self-consistent account of IS phenomena, including those such as the role of material artefacts in the U.S. legal system, "distributed cognition," and the use of GDSS that Poole suggests are incompatible with Giddens's account of structuration.

J	Zhang, XL; Zhang, KC				Zhang, Xin-Li; Zhang, Ke-Cun			Using genetic algorithm to solve a new multi-period stochastic optimization model	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Conditional value-at-risk; Efficient frontier; Genetic algorithm; Simulated path; Transaction costs	LIFETIME PORTFOLIO SELECTION; EXPECTED RETURNS; CONSUMPTION; DECISIONS; BEHAVIOR; COSTS	This paper presents a new asset allocation model based on the CVaR risk measure and transaction costs. Institutional investors manage their strategic asset mix over time to achieve favorable returns subject to various uncertainties, policy and legal constraints, and other requirements. One may use a multi-period portfolio optimization model in order to determine an optimal asset mix. Recently, an alternative stochastic programming model with simulated paths was proposed by Hibiki IN. Hibiki, A hybrid simulation/tree multiperiod stochastic programming model for optimal asset allocation, in: H. Takahashi, (Ed.) The Japanese Association of Financial Econometrics and Engineering, JAFFE journal (2001) 89-119 (in Japanese); N. Hibiki A hybrid simulation/tree stochastic optimization model for dynamic asset allocation, in: B. Scherer (Ed.), Asset and Liability Management Tools: A Handbook for Best Practice, Risk Books, 2003, pp. 269-294], which was called a hybrid model. However, the transaction costs weren't considered in that paper. In this paper, we improve Hibiki's model in the following aspects: (1) The risk measure CVaR is introduced to control the wealth loss risk while maximizing the expected utility; (2) Typical market imperfections such as short sale constraints, proportional transaction costs are considered simultaneously. (3) Applying a genetic algorithm to solve the resulting model is discussed in detail. Numerical results show the suitability and feasibility of our methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Component prioritisation for strategic purchasing and the case study of a South Korean elevator manufacturer	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Purchasing strategy; Business strategy; Competitive priorities; Supply chain management; AHP	SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; INDUSTRY; QUALITY; SYSTEM; MODEL; AHP	The importance of aligning purchasing strategy with business strategy is argued using a substantial literature review. However, some purchases will have a greater impact on the strategic priorities of the business, and suppliers cannot be expected to achieve optimal performance in everything they do, especially at day 1. This paper presents the application of the analytic hierarchy process to prioritise the components of an electric traction elevator in the context of their importance to the business strategy of the manufacturer. This is the first step in the formulation of the manufacturer's purchasing strategy. The relative importance of the competitive elements in the form of quality, cost, availability and time are first established for the manufacturer's business strategy, along with the relative importance of the sub-criteria used to measure these elements. The components of the elevator are then assessed to see which have the greatest impact on these sub-criterion measures to establish component priorities and groupings to guide those forming the purchasing strategy. The paper includes a justification of the criteria and sub-criterion measures used, based on a literature review.	[Drake, P. R.; Lee, D.

J	Khorram-Manesh, A; Hedelin, A; Ortenwall, P				Khorram-Manesh, Amir; Hedelin, Annika; Ortenwall, Per			Regional coordination in medical emergencies and major incidents; plan, execute and teach	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							DISASTER PREPAREDNESS; TRAUMA CARE; SYSTEMS; TRIAGE; IMPACT	Background: Although disasters and major incidents are difficult to predict, the results can be mitigated through planning, training and coordinated management of available resources. Following a fire in a disco in Gothenburg, causing 63 deaths and over 200 casualties, a medical disaster response centre was created. The center was given the task to coordinate risk assessments, disaster planning and training of staff within the region and on an executive level, to be the point of contact (POC) with authority to act as "gold control," i.e. to take immediate strategic command over all medical resources within the region if needed. The aim of this study was to find out if the centre had achieved its tasks by analyzing its activities. Methods: All details concerning alerts of the regional POC was entered a web-based log by the duty officer. The data registered in this database was analyzed during a 3-year period. Results: There was an increase in number of alerts between 2006 and 2008, which resulted in 6293 activities including risk assessments and 4473 contacts with major institutions or key persons to coordinate or initiate actions. Eighty five percent of the missions were completed within 24 h. Twenty eight exercises were performed of which 4 lasted more than 24 h. The centre also offered 145 courses in disaster and emergency medicine and crisis communication. Conclusion: The data presented in this study indicates that the center had achieved its primary tasks. Such regional organization with executive, planning, teaching and training responsibilities offers possibilities for planning, teaching and training disaster medicine by giving immediate feedback based on real incidents.

For spores, the Storage methods tested were freeze-drying and ultra-low temperatures, and for hyphae, freeze-drying, agar slants, and two methods of ultra-low temperatures. Spores of A. aggregata and A. apis stored well at -80 degrees C and after freeze-drying. A. aggregata hyphae did not store Well under any of the methods tested while A. apis hyphae survived well using cryopreservation. Spores produced from cryopreserved A. apis hyphae were infective. Long-term storage of these two important fungal bee diseases is thus possible. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Jensen, A.

Characterizations of in-group social position, threat, and the deployment of 'distinctive' group attributes	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							INTERGROUP DIFFERENTIATION; IDENTITY; IDENTIFICATION; CATEGORIZATION; DYNAMICS; DISCRIMINATION	A considerable body of research has shown that group members establish and emphasize characteristics or attributes that define their in-group in relation to comparison out-groups. We extend this research by exploring the range of ways in which members of the same social category (Welsh people) deploy a particular attribute (the Welsh language) as a flexible identity management resource. Through a thematic analysis of data from interviews and two public speeches, we examine how the deployment of the Welsh language is bound up with characterizations of the in-group's wider intergroup position (in terms of power relations and their legitimacy and stability), and one's position within the in-group. We focus in particular on the rhetorical and strategic value of such characterizations for policing in-group boundaries on the one hand, and for the in-group's intergroup position on the other. We conclude by emphasizing the need to (1) locate analyses of the uses and importance of group-defining attributes within the social setting that gives them meaning and (2) to appreciate such characterizations as attempts to influence, rather than simply reflect that setting.

J	Wolmarans, H; Sartorius, K				Wolmarans, Hendrik; Sartorius, Kurt			CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT TRANSACTIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article							MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; EVENT; ANNOUNCEMENTS; RETURNS; MARKET; WEALTH	Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has recently received considerable attention in literature. One of the vehicles by which companies can conform to CSR in South Africa is Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). In this regard, BEE has been employed to assist previously disadvantaged groups of investors obtain a larger share of the equity of South African listed companies. The question has often been asked whether the announcement of BEE transactions by listed companies increases shareholder wealth. This article tries to answer this question by examining the share performance of 125 BEE transactions involving 95 companies during the period January 2002 to July 2006. The results indicate a positive relation between BEE transaction announcements and shareholder wealth creation, but only during the last part of the period covered by the study.

J	Ding, JF				Ding, Ji-Feng			FUZZY MCDM APPROACH FOR SELECTING STRATEGIC PARTNER: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF A CONTAINER SHIPPING COMPANY IN TAIWAN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Selection of strategic partner; Container shipping; Fuzzy MCDM	DECISION-MAKING; NUMBERS	The main purposes of this paper are to develop a fuzzy MCDM algorithm and to survey an empirical study to select a suitable strategic partner for a container shipping company in Taiwan. At first, some concepts and methods of the fuzzy set theory are applied to develop the proposed fuzzy MCDM algorithm. For matching this evaluation process, a hierarchical structure is constructed with seven criteria, thirty-two sub-criteria and three alternatives for evaluating partner selection. Then, the aggregating evaluation ratings for all alternatives can be obtained by the proposed algorithm. By combining the methods of ranking fuzzy numbers with maximizing and minimizing sets and total risk attitude index, the suitable partner can eventually be determined. In addition, the risk-bearing attitude of the committee trends towards optimism, which is based upon the procedure of data input stage. Based on the proposed fuzzy MCDM algorithm and the empirical study, company C is finally selected as the most suitable partner for the WZ company to link with,, as a shipping alliance. Furthermore, this paper with its methodologies developed can be employed as a practical tool for business application.

J	Howard, J				Howard, John			Informing Public Health Policy and Practice: The Strategic Management of Research Processes and Organizations	GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS			English	Article								Better health depends on how well federal public health organizations perform both scientifically and organizationally. The performance challenges of public health science organizations are not carbon copies of those facing public service organizations. This article examines how one federal science agency in the public health field has instituted a performance orientation over a dozen years, offering a detailed illustration of how the in-principle advantages of the "managing for performance" approach can be realized in practice. In taking science more seriously as a basis for public policy, the new administration should not lose sight of lessons it can learn from its predecessors about managing science organizations for performance.

The defensive use of IT in a newly vulnerable market: The New York Stock Exchange, 1980-2007	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Strategy; Newly vulnerable markets; Securities exchanges; Electronic markets; Market share; Organizational investment in IT; Performance impacts of IT; Case study; Prais-Winsten regression	INNOVATION; FUTURES	New technologies enable entrants to create business models that threaten incumbents in a range of industries. This paper extends the framework of newly vulnerable markets to explore the dynamics of competition between entrants and an incumbent through a study of the New York Stock Exchange. For over 200 years, the NYSE has operated a physical market for trading securities. Beginning in the 1960s, it employed information technology to process increasing trading volumes and to disseminate data on stock prices and volumes. The Exchange invested heavily in IT for its trading floor, and defended it against electronic markets enabled by new technologies. In 2005 various pressures forced the NYSE into a merger with Archipelago, a leading electronic exchange. The NYSE's latest market system, Hybrid, launched in 2006, is the first at the NYSE that enables investors to bypass the trading floor completely. Despite the new technology, its share of trading volumes fell. This paper documents four eras of IT management at the exchange, presenting a detailed 27-year history.

J	Rodgers, S				Rodgers, Svetlana			The state of technological sophistication and the need for new specialised tertiary degrees in food services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Food service; Curriculum; Technology; Research; Industrial cuisine; Molecular cuisine	SAFETY	Hospitality management graduates have limited insights into latest operational/technological concepts such as Industrial Cuisine, Molecular Gastronomy and Personalised Nutrition. In fact, 'hard' or equipment-based technologies support the two major strategic options, cost leadership and differentiation. At present, suppliers and governments, but not operators, drive research and development in the field. In the education sector, new specialised curricula incorporating pathways stemming from natural science are needed to equip future graduates with 'cutting edge' skills for innovation at product, process and system levels. The research-teaching cycle can be strengthened by sharing degrees with departments of science and engineering across tertiary institutions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Meade; Steele, Jo Ann; Osgood, Laurie; Keating, Heidi			Building and Measuring Infrastructure and Capacity for Community Health Assessment and Health Improvement Planning in Florida	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						community health assessment; health improvement planning; MAPP		Background: COMPASS (Comprehensive Assessment, Strategic Success) is the Florida Department of Health's community health assessment and health improvement planning initiative. Since 2002, COMPASS built state and county health department infrastructure to support a comprehensive, systematic, and integrated approach to community health assessment and planning. Methods: To assess the capacity of Florida's 67 county health departments (CHDs) to conduct community health assessment and planning and to identify training and technical assistance needs, COMPASS surveyed the CHDs using a Web-based instrument annually from 2004 through 2008. Findings: Response rate to the survey was 100 percent annually. In 2007, 96 percent of CHDs reported conducting assessment and planning within the past 3 years; 74 percent used the MAPP (Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships) framework. Progress was greater for the organizational and assessment phases of the MAPP-based work; only 10 CHDs had identified strategic priorities in 2007, and even fewer had implemented strategies for improving health. In 2007, the most frequently requested types of training were measuring success, developing goals and action plans, and using qualitative data; technical assistance was most frequently requested for program evaluation and writing community health status reports. Conclusions: Florida's CHDs have increased their capacity to conduct community health assessment and planning. Questions remain about sustaining these gains with limited resources.

J	Abdullah, HS; Ahmad, J				Abdullah, Hazman; Ahmad, Jasmine			The fit between organisational structure, management orientation, knowledge orientation, and the values of ISO 9000 standard A conceptual analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ISO 9000 series; Strategic management; Knowledge management; Organizational structures; Quality standards	INNOVATION; QUALITY; CERTIFICATION; CODIFICATION; EXPLORATION; IMPROVEMENT; STRATEGY; FIRMS	Purpose - The purpose of this conceptual paper is to examine the fit between values underpinning the ISO 9000 standard and selected managerial and organisational factors. Design/methodology/approach - The study is a conceptual one relying on the literature on the selected strategic factors and also the standard. The values of institutionalisation, explicitation, systematisation, delineation and Taylorisation underpinning ISO 9000 standards were distilled from the origin and the principles of ISO 9000 and the ISO 9000 certification practices. The values are juxtapositioned with the imperatives of control and creativity, knowledge management and organisational structure to understand the consequent synergism or tension. Findings - It is postulated that the more mechanistic and explicit knowledge based organisations will enjoy ISO 9000 certification while the more organic and tacit knowledge based organisations will experience tensions arising from lack of fit. Hence, conceptually, the standard will work best in a more mechanistic and routine knowledge based settings. Creativity oriented strategies will find the standard quite dysfunctional while control and operation-based strategies are likely to benefit most from the certification. Originality/value - Most ISO 9000 related studies are weak on conceptualisation of the relationships examined. Despite the growing volume of studies on ISO 9000, the values of the standard have not been explicitly outlined. Consequently, discussion of the efficacy of the standard has focused on the explicit requirements of the standard rather than the instrumental values it promotes. Based on the explication of the standard's values, the article examines the possible synergies and contradictions between the standard and, management orientation (control vs creativity), knowledge orientation (explicit vs tacit) and structure (organic vs mechanistic).

J	Ansari, S; Bell, J				Ansari, Shahid; Bell, Jan			Five easy pieces: a case study of cost management as organizational change	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE			English	Article						Accounting; Action research; Cost accounting; Organizational change; Oil industry; West Africa	ACCOUNTING CHANGE	Purpose - The primary purpose of this paper is to merge two traditions in management accounting change - design theory and action research - to explain findings from a case study of introducing a cost leadership initiative. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is an example of action research in which design theory explains events related to the implementation of a strategic cost leadership initiative at Shell Gabon, a Royal Dutch Shell unit in West Africa. Findings - The evidence shows that technical accounting changes are, in the final analysis, change management exercises. Implementing change requires thinking as a designer and employing the logic of conjecture rather than scientific deductive or inductive reasoning. Successful implementation requires conjuring an image of a future reality that does not currently exist and making that image persuasive by connecting it with the values of the organizational participants. Research limitations/implications - This case study provides five key lessons for future designers of accounting change. Implementers should: understand the mental models of organizational participants; show respect for the cultural values of the organization they are working in; meaningfully engage organizational participants; use structured processes to unfold change; and be ready to seize new opportunities and discard old game plans when necessary. The case study also reveals gaps in existing change management models and behavioural accounting theories. Originality/value - This paper offers design theory as an alternative way of viewing organizational change and offers criteria for evaluating the use of design as a process and for assessing the value of the implemented change.

J	Ayoun, B; Moreo, P				Ayoun, Baker; Moreo, Patrick			Impact of Time Orientation on the Strategic Behavior of Thai and American Hotel Managers	JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Time orientation; Confucian dynamism; strategic behavior; international hospitality; hotel; managers	UNITED-STATES; VALUES	The aim of this article was to investigate the potential influence of the cultural dimension of time orientation on the strategic behavior of hotel managers. A survey questionnaire was mailed to top-level hotel managers in the U.S. (short-term orientation) and Thailand (long-term orientation). A usable sample of 120 was used in the analysis. The results indicated that this cultural dimension provided a relatively proper base for explaining the differences between managers from these two countries. Compared to their American counterparts, Thai managers were found to place a stronger emphasis on longer term strategic plans, have a stronger tendency toward involving others when developing their business strategy, and a stronger reliance on long-term evaluation of strategy. No significant differences were found between the managers concerning openness to strategic change and commitment to strategic decisions. Directions for future research and implications for the hotel industry are presented.

J	Chatzoglou, PD; Sarigiannidis, L				Chatzoglou, Prodromos D.; Sarigiannidis, Lazaros			Business outsourcing and organisational performance: the case of the Greek hotel industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						outsourcing; organisational performance; hotel activities; competitive advantage	FIRM; TRUST; MODEL	The adoption of the outsourcing strategy for services and products is expanding rapidly worldwide. The strategic character of outsourcing has led many hotels in Greece to appreciate its significant role in the pursuit of improved performance. This study empirically investigates the outsourcing strategy adopted by Greek hotels. The research models were validated, using data collected from 106 questionnaires, completed by Greek hotel managers. It is found that hotel managers believe that outsourcing has a clear, significant and positive influence on achieving operational objectives such as financial and flexibility improvements, access to new managerial and sourcing methods and quality improvements. In addition, the impact of outsourcing on organisational financial and non-financial performance, from the aspect of the strategic value of the activities, is also examined. Surprisingly, the results indicate that there is no evidence supporting the existence of a significant direct effect of outsourcing on the performance of hotels in Greece. Hotel managers, therefore, should realise that outsourcing is a tool that is used sensibly it can help hotels improve specific activities and achieve some, mainly non-financial, targets. Further research should attempt to led some light on the conditions under which outsourcing of specific activities can enhance hotels' performance.

J	Chen, JR				Chen, Jau-Rong			An exploratory study of alignment ERP implementation and organizational development activities in a newly established firm	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic alignment; Manufacturing resource planning; Internal control; Internal auditing; Corporate governance; Organizational development	RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEMS; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; ENTERPRISE; TECHNOLOGY; NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK	Purpose - The importance of alignment of enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation for organizational strategies has been widely recognized. However, ERP implementation in the context of new ventures has not yet been convincingly demonstrated. Furthermore, how to align ERP implementation with organizational development in new ventures deserves further examination as new ventures are in the emergency or early growth stage and thus have distinct concerns in adopting ERP. Against this background, the main purpose of this paper is to explore how ERP implementation can facilitate the organization development of new ventures. Design/methodology/approach - This study adopts an in-depth case study method for gathering and analyzing data. The case research strategy allows the exploration of unforeseen phenomena and offers insights into the inter- dependencies among the factors captured in the study. It is believed that case study research will be most appropriate in gaining in-depth knowledge of the practices of ERP implementation in new venture development. Findings - Drawing on an in-depth case study from a Taiwanese IC design house, this study shows that, to leverage the value of ERP system, the implementation should consider the firm's growth stages, the unique industrial characteristics, the influences from the business group, and the alignment of the internal control and audit function, corporate governance, and information technology governance. Practical implications - The findings of this study contribute to the literature on ERP implementation and organization development in new ventures. The implications and future research directions are also discussed. Originality/value - This single case study has provided valuable insights into the practice of ERP implementation. Furthermore, data analysis of this study provides a set of vocabularies that researchers and practitioners could employ in similar organizational processes as in new ventures.

J	Diez, K; Lennerts, K				Diez, Karin; Lennerts, Kunibert			A process-oriented analysis of facility management services in hospitals as a basis for strategic planning	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Facilities; Costs; Hospitals; Strategic planning; Germany		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe research which investigated the interdependencies between facility management performance and costs, and primary processes in hospitals. Through the implementation of the German diagnosis related grouping (DRG) system and the resulting cost pressure, the need for optimized use and operation of the spatial resources in hospitals is growing. In the DRG system, the provision of ready to use infrastructure is treated as a fixed cost and is allocated to patient cases by a single cost driver. In reality, very different services are needed to provide ready to use functional space. Design/methodology/approach - A primary activity based cost model for facility management (FM) services in relation to functional space units in the hospital is developed. Using process and cost data of an empiric research study from four German hospitals, a model is developed for a key functional space unit in the hospital, the operation unit. The relevant FM services structured by a product-oriented approach are determined by real data. For these services, process figures are derived and implemented in a basic cost estimation model. The cost estimation model is compared to the cost approach of the DRG system. Findings - In an explorative study, the model provides an approach for a patient focused cost allocation of FM services for the operation unit. Depending on the time spectrum of operations great differences between this approach and the legal cost allocation approached in Germany can be determined. One way for hospitals to face the consequences may be the determination and optimization of relevant FM services according to a primary process portfolio. Research limitations/implications - The activity based cost model should be developed for further space units in the hospital. Thus, a holistic approach to FM and strategic planning of space and FM services could be achieved. Further, the explorative study should be enlarged to a greater database for the development of general key figures for FM in relation to the primary processes. Practical implications - The model can be used by hospitals for strategic planning of the FM costs and services in relation to the capacity and utilization of the operation unit. The impact of changes of the primary performance portfolio on the utilization of corresponding infrastructure can be simulated. Thus, cost data can be made available to support strategic decisions. Originality/value - There is no existing cost model for the hospital considering FM in a holistic way in relation to the primary processes.

J	Helmy, EM; Travers, R				Helmy, Eman M.; Travers, Robert			Towards the Development of Egyptian Medical Tourism Sector	ANATOLIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Medical tourism; Competitive advantage; Development scenarios; Strategic development pillars; Service value chain-Egypt		Medical tourism has shown an exceptional growth worldwide during the last few years. Such growth has involved an increase in the number of the international medical tourists, and the emergence of competitive medical tourism destinations. Arguably, the success of each destination in entering the medical tourism business will greatly depend on its ability to develop a comprehensive and competitive accredited medical tourism business. This paper outlines the strategy development stage of a national project for the development of Egyptian medical tourism. Based on a preceding phase, benchmarking the Egyptian medical tourism sector against international key players, the strategic approach involved a number of tasks: identifying Egypt's competitive advantages, debating different scenarios for the sector development, setting short and long term Egyptian medical tourism goals and drawing main pillars for the medical tourism development. Pillars identified by research findings are: an enabling environment, product development, human resource development and marketing.

J	Hunt, W; Coutts, J				Hunt, Warren; Coutts, Jeff			Extension in Tough Times-Addressing Failures in Public and Private Extension, Lessons from the Tasmanian Wool Industry, Australia	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION			English	Article						Agricultural extension; Catalyst; Change agent; Information vacuum; Drought; Extension market segmentation; Social capital		This paper reports research on the impact of introducing a range of extension approaches into the wool-growing regions of Tasmania Australia to meet an emerging knowledge and skills gap in the sector. The wool-growing industry of the state has experienced minimal government extension support for over 15 years. There is a failure in both private and publicsector extension services in meeting the current collective needs of the industry. A new industry funded initiative funded by the grower body Australian Wool Innovation Ltd and hosted with the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research (TIAR), an arm of the University of Tasmania, is filling this void. The approaches included the establishment of grower groups, workshops, demonstrations and newsletters in a coordinated extension programme. The research interest lay in learning of the value of these different approaches in developing and maintaining sustainable sheep and wool production systems in the state. The research methodology involved evaluating change according to Bennett's hierarchy. Techniques used included surveys of participants from respective industry segments and analysis of relevant secondary information and data. Findings indicate that the programme has affected substantial on-ground changes in stock and property management by businesses involved. There was evidence of group members taking a more strategic view of their businesses from involvement in the programme. Group members (65%), industry active (53%) and service sector (65%) survey respondents indicated that the biggest outcomes of their involvement were improved technical or management skills. Members of groups and service-sector respondents saw even more impact (70%) on improved information seeking skills. The interactive and passive extension methodologies employed in this initiative have positioned the programme as a catalyst for change amongst producers, and have served as a mechanism to fill a serious information vacuum in the industry. They also appear to have realised positive social capital outcomes within the grower community during the difficult circumstances of sustained drought. Finally, the segmentation of the extension target audience appears to be paying dividends in terms of programme delivery and resource allocation.

J	Liddle, J				Liddle, Joyce			The Northern Way: a pan-regional associational network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Partnership; Central government; England; Regional development; Regional government; Urban regions		Purpose - This paper aims to examine a pan-regional initiative, The Northern Way. The argument is framed within the on-going city-region debate to demonstrate some of the challenges and difficulties of working in collaboration and partnership across associational networks. It seeks to highlight the importance of institutional and local legacies and politics for understanding the nature of this particular form of pan-regional arrangement. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on existing literature and other secondary source material from policy and guidance documents, participant observation in regional and sub-regional meetings, and supplemented with primary interview data. Findings - The Northern Way, promoted by central government to manage decline in the Greater North of England, demonstrated a continued legacy of regional disparities and an attempt to move city actors from inter and intra regional rivalry towards collaboration and partnership. As an associational network, the fluidity of scales and wide ranging social forces impacted on coordination and integration of processes, institutions, plans and strategies. This emergent governance form exemplified institutional turbulence, as powers were re-configured continuously across scales and, across policy sectors and policy actors. The Northern Way was a very complicated arrangement of networks across regional and sub-regional territories, and its lack of autonomy from central government hampered its overall effectiveness and strategic approach. Originality/value - The paper provides a valuable insight for academics, practitioners and policy makers into some of the challenges and difficulties of managing across a pan-regional associational network. It is original because most of the earlier literature focuses solely on city-regions rather than a specific pan-regional initiative such as the one under enquiry here.

J	Magal, SR; Kosalge, P; Levenburg, NM				Magal, Simha R.; Kosalge, Parag; Levenburg, Nancy M.			Using importance performance analysis to understand and guide e-business decision making in SMEs	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Electronic commerce; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Management strategy; Business analysis	ELECTRONIC COMMERCE; SUCCESS	Purpose - E-business adoption among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been limited because of resource constraints and a failure to understand the strategic value of e-business. To facilitate decision making concerning e-business applications and their implementation, simple, low cost tools are needed to assist in analyzing and developing effective e-business strategies. This paper aims to evaluate the use of e-business applications among SMEs, to test the robustness of importance-performance (IP) analysis models and to present IP mapping as a resource/tool for decision making. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 19 e-business motivations were identified from the literature and incorporated into a self-administered survey questionnaire. Data were collected from 439 SMEs located throughout the US. Findings - Most IP studies have assumed that importance and performance are independent; however, three recent studies have argued otherwise, identifying positive, negative and v-shaped relationships. The study finds a fourth, N-shaped relationship between importance and performance. This is an extension of the v-shaped relationship and appears when the full range of performance scale values is displayed. Research limitations/implications - The relationship between the "importance" and "performance" variables suggests a path of travel that can help show the e-business adoption states and the possible undulations in e-business strategies along the path. Firms can identify their location on an IP map relative to the N-shaped path and then identify the path to the optimum location on the map.

Arguably, environmental uncertainty leads to greater organizational responsiveness to those environments through strategic planning. This survey of 505 American Public Relations Society of America members indicated, however, that perceived environmental conditions were less important to management decision-making than how those conditions were translated or packaged as decision-making inputs through formal environmental scanning mechanisms. Environmental uncertainty had no impact on decision making, once the mediating influence of formal scanning was controlled.

Motivations and potential monitoring effects of large shareholders	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Corporate governance; Benefits management; Shareholders	INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS; EQUITY OWNERSHIP; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; FIRM; TURNOVER	Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to synthesize and evaluate the stream of research that links large shareholders to the production of shared corporate benefits. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is to review the literature with an emphasis on the development of findings. Findings - The presence of large shareholders is positive only if their incentives are aligned with other owners and they have the power to exert influence. The presence of large shareholders, even those whose interests are aligned with owners, does not always result in stronger governance structures. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited by the existing stream of literature and the completeness of our search process. Practical implications - A synthesis and evaluative summary of the research is presented that may be used by researchers, executives, and board members. Originality/value - From a research viewpoint, effective research designs should incorporate both incentive and power when assessing the monitoring role of large shareholders to aid in the validity and comparability of research results. From a practice viewpoint, managers and board members may use our summary figure to evaluate power relationships and likely reactions to strategic and tactical decisions in their firm's governance structure.

J	Piercy, N; Rich, N				Piercy, Niall; Rich, Nick			The implications of lean operations for sales strategy: from sales-force to marketing-force	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						sales force; marketing; changing role; lean		Lean operating principles are based on the systems of Toyota Japan. Companies around the world, in all sectors of the economy, now embrace these approaches to improve quality, cost and productivity. Different purchasing and sourcing practices in lean organisations mean that winning sales from them requires major changes to sales strategy and practice. This process has not been fully explored. Serving lean customers, who demand complete transparency across the supplying organisation and focus on capability not cost, has proven problematic for traditional sales departments. Further, as supplying organisations themselves become lean (this transformation being a result and requirement of selling to a lean company), organisational redesign extends from operations into sales. This paper illustrates the shifts needed in sales approach and strategy in selling to, and subsequently, becoming a lean business. The role of this future-sales-force is considered in relation to its shift towards a marketing-orientated rather than sales-push strategy.

The study also involves a comparative evaluation of the proposed and the existing systems under a spectrum of operating conditions. A comprehensive simulation is used to evaluate system performances under a variety of settings which include reliability, service level, and cost consequences. The analysis is based on a full factorial experimental design. In summary, the developed self-regulating management system which involves dynamic work allocation and pre-emption is shown to yield higher machine availability and higher mechanic utilisation even with fewer mechanics. The study also finds that the new system is more streamlined, agile, and robust although it is subject to more-constrained machine reliability and mechanic service time environments. Further, a major reduction of current manpower can still achieve at least 95% machine availability, illustrating the cost effectiveness and efficacy of the developed system. This rule-based corrective maintenance system can be operated in uncertain environments on a real-time basis without additional reformatting costs and provides a competitive measure to deal with managerial issues such as low retention rate for skilled mechanics, highly uneven training levels and pay scales. The financial consequences and gains in strategic advantage with respect to the facility's operational structure are promising after implementation. Moreover, the system developed in this case study represents a meaningful starting point for a more vigorous theoretical research on the bucket brigade system to different functions in industrial and operations management.

J	Robb, A; Parent, M				Robb, Alastair; Parent, Michael			Understanding IT Governance: A Case of Two Financial Mutuals	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Case Study; Financial Services; IS Risk Management; Outsourcing of IS; Strategic Alignment	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; FIRM	Legislators, regulators, and shareholders increasingly demand good governance over all aspects of their business. While much is made of financial governance, most legislation and regulation implicitly recognizes the need for prudent governance of information technology (IT) functions. In this study we conduct an exploratory collective case study of IT governance (ITG) in two financial mutuals-one in Australia and one in Canada-using a contextual lens. In one case, the mutual governs its IT through Board participation in a subsidiary. In the second, governance is delegated to management and a lead director. Both of these mechanisms appear to minimize ITG risk, and are the result of their respective regulatory environments. This research begins to lend some clarity regarding IT governance choices by firms, and denotes important contextual differences between countries' regulatory environments. This will allow researchers, managers, and directors to better understand and discriminate between ITG processes and structures.

J	Rossi, F				Rossi, Federica			Universities' Access to Research Funds: Do institutional features and strategies matter?	TERTIARY EDUCATION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ACADEMIC RESEARCH; HIGHER-EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION	Competitively allocated research funds, from both public and private sources, constitute an increasing share of university revenues. The article investigates empirically, using data on the Italian university system, whether structural and strategic features of universities-such as size, age and especially the importance that they assign to their teaching and research missions-affect their success in securing research funds. The analysis shows that universities that strategically prioritize their research mission also obtain higher funds per researcher, from different sources. These results are compared with those obtained by similar studies of other European higher education systems, and some general implications of the introduction of competitive funding mechanisms for university behaviour are derived.

This paper examines how firms employ slack resources to enhance the relationship between quality management (QM) and organisational learning to obtain sustainable competitive advantages. The findings use empirical data gathered from 202 quality managers to support the hypotheses that: (1) there is a strong connection between organisational learning and QM; and (2) the relation between organisational learning and QM is moderated by slack resources.

Such integration would instill innovation, proactive attitudes and regulated risk-taking needed to pursue ongoing improvement and proactive response to change. By managing each change as a project, embedded in smoothly running operations, hotels would extend their life span by continuously reinventing themselves. The implementation of such strategic shift would necessitate reliance on empowered staff, placed in a flexible environment that engenders favorable climates for service, innovation, and strategic human resources (HR). The end result is synergy achieved through a complementary mix of service and project management cultures.

J	Singh, OP; Chand, S				Singh, Om Pal; Chand, Satish			Supply chain design in the electronics industry incorporating JIT purchasing	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Supply Chain Management; SCM; analytical models; JIT practices; Mixed Integer Programming; MIP	JUST-IN-TIME; INTEGRATED PRODUCTION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	The overriding objective of the present work is to design and analyse the supply chain of a section of an existing electronics industry which is involved in the manufacturing of instruments to be used in communication and is presently unable to compete in the open market. The suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers have been integrated with each other using Just-in-Time (JIT) purchasing. The models have been developed both at the strategic, as well as operational, levels for minimising the cost. The operational level models have been integrated with the strategic level model to achieve overall optimization, instead of individual echelon optimisation. Keeping in view the large number of variables, constraints and related industrial data, the model has been solved using 'Industrial LINGO 8.0' software. The model solution gives the optimum values of the various cost components and per product cost for the customers. The dominant costs have been targeted for reduction using JIT purchasing in the raw material procurement process. Finally, it is observed that the implementation of JIT purchasing considerably reduces per product costs.

J	Srivastava, RK				Srivastava, R.			Measuring brand strategy: can brand equity and brand score be a tool to measure the effectiveness of strategy?	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						brand score; brand equity; brand image		Measuring the effectiveness of brand strategy is a difficult task. This paper examines the approach to measurement of strategy through application of brand score and brand equity as a tool. The study was done in two phases. In the first phase brand score was calculated by 150 postgraduate management students. The second phase of study was to calculate brand equity using the same respondents for the same brands. The top three brands in food, cold drink and telecommunication service provider segments were selected for the study. Higher McDonald's brand score also had higher brand equity index when compared to Domino's and Pizza Hut. It means strategy is working quite well as reflected in two measurable tools. The individual component study for brand score and brand equity index can give insight on impact of strategy on these two measurable approaches of strategy. It can also help in reducing wastage of promotional expenditure. This could give scope for further research because of less work done in this area.

J	Su, S; Lai, MC; Huang, HC				Su, Syi; Lai, Mei-Chi; Huang, Hao-Chen			Healthcare industry value creation and productivity measurement in an emerging economy	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						strategic resources; resource-based view; healthcare	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MARKET ORIENTATION; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; INNOVATION; EFFICIENCY; STRATEGY; FIRM	During the past decade academicians and researchers interested in strategic management have devoted increasing attention to the influence of strategic resources on the organizational competitive advantage and value creation. This work draws upon the recent literature concerning the strategic resources and, more specifically, how this may influence hospital performance in the healthcare industry. This work analyzes the impact of human capital and innovation capability on hospital performance from a resource-based perspective in an emerging economy. The research comprises two stages. During the first stage, a plausible empirical model was developed for exploring the links between contextual variables. To clarify the relation influence of these variables, structural equation modeling was performed to examine the model. During the second stage, the data envelopment analysis model and the bilateral model were developed to analyze the relative efficiency of hospitals and compare productivity among the different hospital ownership groups.

J	Svensson, G; Payan, JM				Svensson, Goran; Payan, Janice M.			Organizations that are international from inception Terminology and research constellations "academic protectionism" or "academic myopia"?	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Globalization; International business; Business formation; Entrepreneurialism; Marketing	GLOBAL STRATEGIES; BORN GLOBALS; FIRMS; BEHAVIOR; VENTURES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the terminology used by various constellations of researchers concerning the formation of organizations that are international from inception, present conceptual and definitional attributes of the phenomena of interest, and propose common terminology, and conceptual framework to use in the future. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review is undertaken that compares research terminology used by different streams of research and different constellations of researchers referring to a new organization that intends be international from the beginning of its creation. Findings - Two principal findings may be stressed: there are constellations of labels used to describe essentially the same phenomena of organizations that are international at their inception, and there are constellations of researchers that use their own unique labels in this field. Provocatively, the authors question whether these findings are due to "academic protectionism" between the constellations or "academic myopia" (i.e. inability to appreciate the literature's terminology between constellations). It is proposed that the terms used in this field of research should be collapsed into another recent concept introduced and defined in literature, namely "early internationalizing firms." Research limitations/implications - A conceptual framework of "early internationalizing firms" is outlined. It suggests this concept is more beneficial and appropriate than the concepts using traditional terminology such as: "international new ventures" and "born globals." It is argued that the "early internationalizing firms" concept is more descriptive of the actual phenomena and explicitly considers the crucial short timeframe involved in the process of internationalization of firms. Practical implications - The label "early internationalizing firms" may be easier to communicate in practice than some of the current labels used in literature. It emphasizes the practical imperatives of simultaneous localization and globalization, and planning at several levels (i.e. operative, tactical, and strategic levels) in a short timeframe. Originality/ value - The paper suggests that "early internationalizing firms" is more descriptive of the phenomena of interest and should be used in the field. It contributes to the literature by presenting a broadened more useful framework in describing the phenomena of interest. In specific, it takes into account short timeframes and both the globalization and localization aspects of the phenomena.

J	Tretyak, OA; Popov, NI				Tretyak, Olga A.; Popov, Nikita I.			Explaining scientific networking with b2b network theories: the cases from the EU and Russia	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article						Networking; Knowledge management; Russia; European Union	STRATEGIC NETWORKS; ORGANIZATION; HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; NONPROFITS; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; CREATION; SYSTEMS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend existing theories of b2b networks over non-profit networks. Design/methodology/approach - The paper sheds light on the network organisational forms recently implanted in the academic community. the analytic induction method is used to extend b2b network concepts to a non-profit context. The concepts of b2b networks are critically analysed and applied to explorative case studies of networks in academia. The paradox of open knowledge exchange in these networks is revealed and an attempt is made to elucidate it. Findings - B2b network concepts should be modified before being extended to non-profits. Propositions are suggested to adapt b2b network concepts to explain non-profit networks. Questions to address in further research are developed. Research limitations/implications - The main conclusions are only applicable to specific types of networks. Only academic networks are reviewed. The case study approach does not allow for generalizing the findings and deriving a set of concepts for non-profit networks, and thus, calls for further research. Practical implications - There may be space for achieving excellence in research by facilitating interpersonal rather than interorganisational research networks. This is important, since by facilitating interpersonal networks one can escape from organisational bureaucracy. Originality/value - The study reports networking between the non-profits, an issue largely neglected by marketing researchers, and contributes to its understanding in the frame of existing b2b network concepts'.

J	Tuusjarvi, E; Moller, K				Tuusjarvi, Eiren; Moller, Kristian			Multiplicity of norms in inter-company cooperation	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article						Small to medium-sized enterprises; Corporate strategy; Management strategy; Networking; Organizational behaviour	SOCIAL CONTRACTS; COMMITMENT; GOVERNANCE; CONFLICT; EXCHANGE; TRUST	Purpose - This paper aims to examine the multiplicity of norms in inter-company cooperation in the context of an SME export group. It will show that the strategic interests of the parties call for more diversity in norms than that identified in existing studies on relational exchange. Design/methodology/approach - This is a qualitative longitudinal case study of a group of five firms. The theory of relational exchange served as the basis for analysis, interpretation, and context of the research findings. Findings - This study shows that both relational and discrete norms are necessary for cooperative groups. Furthermore, the paper argues that companies in cooperation have a shared need to retain a certain degree of independence and to develop normative expectations for autonomy while cooperating Consequently, it suggests a new category of norms "norms of moderated autonomy". Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on limited case material Thus, future study is required to examine the validity of the suggestions and their applicability in the context of larger companies Practical implications - The study suggests that the parties need to be explicit with their interests that form the basis for the emergence of cooperative norms, and to acknowledge the contingent and conflicting nature of these different normative expectations Originality/value - The research focuses on the overlooked topic of the independence and maintenance of autonomy in business cooperation By proposing a new category of norms of moderated autonomy, the study expands the seminal theory of relational contract.

J	Wu, LF; Park, D				Wu, Lifang; Park, Daewoo			Dynamic outsourcing through process modularization	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Outsourcing; Competences; Continuous improvement; Process management	TRANSACTION-COST-ANALYSIS; PRODUCT MODULARITY; COMPETENCES; INNOVATION; STRATEGY; INTEGRATION; OPERATIONS; IMPACT; ENTRY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a dynamic outsourcing framework for making and implementing process outsourcing decisions in a rapidly changing environment. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical framework incorporates three major concepts/techniques: the order winner concept to identify strategic level competitive priorities, the modularization concept to reconfigure enterprise organizational structure, and the analytical hierarchy process technique for linking critical demand attributes with process modules at the operational level. Findings - The study presents a dynamic outsourcing approach through organizational modularization and shows when and how core and non-core activities can be outsourced in a fast changing market. Research limitations/implications - The complexities of the framework will need facilitation and supports on issues such as organizational modularity, multi-goal optimization, and empirical validation. Practical implications - This paper offers practical insights and clarifies common confusions associated with strategic outsourcing. Originality/value - The paper tries to fill the gap between the existing outsourcing literature and the practical need for choosing specific outsourcing activities at the operational level. The dynamic framework creates a foundation for continuous process improvement on a cyclic basis.

J	Han, S				Han, Sukhee			From engagement to hedging: South Korea's new China policy	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article							FUTURE	With the inauguration of South Korea's new president, Lee MyLing-bak, Korea's China policy is changing. Replacing the policy of tilting toward China pursued by his predecessor, Roll Moo-hyun, President Lee instead suggests a policy of hedging toward China. In general, the policy of hedging is composed of two different approaches, engagement and balancing. President Lee's twin hedging emphasizes deep engagement and soft balancing toward China. The basic rationale of the Republic of Korea (the ROK) is to adopt the policy of twin hedging as it needs both great powers, the United States and China, for its strategic stability and economic prosperity. For the successful implementation of the twin hedging policy, the South Korean government, as a way to deepen the economic engagement, has to precipitate and expand the economic cooperation between the ROK and China. Simultaneously, it has to strengthen the U.S.-Korean alliance as a mode of soft balancing. For the United States, the diplomatic shift of Lee Myung-bak to the policy of twin hedging is, of course, a welcome development. But China seems to feel uncomfortable with this. Although China cannot object to the reinforcement of the U.S.-Korean alliance, however, it is beginning to feel concerned about a potential strategic coalition between the United States and the ROK on the sensitive issues, including Seoul's participation in the Missile Defense System and Proliferation Security Initiative, the ROK's shift of its North Korean policies unfavorable to China, and the shift of conditions and roles of the American troops stationed in Korea. The success of the policy of twin hedging toward China depends oil how carefully and competently the Lee Myung-bak administration convinces the Chinese government of the ROK's strategic necessity for the hedging policy.

J	Millson, MR; Wilemon, D				Millson, Murray R.; Wilemon, David			Designing strategic innovation networks to facilitate global NPD performance	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This article reviews and applies a strategic new product development (NPD) networking maturation process developed for organisations that employ networks to develop successful new products. Understanding this model can assist new product developers in making important decisions for attaining marketplace advantages that can aid the successful development and commercialisation of new products. This paper describes the development of a strategic NPD networking maturation process model that is compatible with current global new product development practices and environments. It is noted that strategic NPD networking for new product development is not a discrete event but a process that involves several stages. These stages are described and include awareness, exploration, commitment and dissolution. It is suggested that embarking on a strategic NPD networking process resembles the processes of the adoption and implementation of an important innovation. The paper concludes with a summary of the discussion.

It focuses empirically on the role played by the British Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service in facilitating the modernization of public sector employment relations. We show how the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service has played a 'benchmarking' role that assists the development of more strategic forms of decision-making and cooperation in employment relations change, and identify the challenges of developing such all approach in the context of the shift towards a more decentralized and market-oriented system of public service delivery. In conclusion we assert that there is a new 'advisory and benchmarking' state evolving based on a soft-market view of industrial relations, and that this mitigates (but is also in tension with) the harder market view within the state concerned with transforming the public sector.

Findings also suggest that relational innovation has an effect on product innovation for the upstream perspective, while process innovation influences product innovation for the downstream perspective.

An intracellular symbiont and other microbiota associated with field-collected populations of sawflies (Hymenoptera : Symphyta)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						bacteria; endosymbiont; Hymenoptera; sawflies; Wolbachia	PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; IXODES-SCAPULARIS; BACTERIOPHAGE-WO; DESERT LOCUST; GUT BACTERIA; WOLBACHIA; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCE; MICROORGANISMS	Six species of sawfly (Hymenoptera: Symphyta) from four taxonomic families (Agridae, Diprionidae, Pamphiliidae, and Tenthredinidae) were collected from locations across Canada and surveyed for their associated microbiota. Total DNA was extracted from individual insects, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the conserved 16SarRNA gene from microbiota. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were undertaken to separate bacterial clones associated with the host insect. Sequencing of the PCR-DGGE and PCR-RFLP products revealed a dominance of alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria, with most sequences showing high similarity to bacteria previously identified from other insect species and environmental samples. Additionally, a strain of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia and a Wolbachia bacteriophage were identified from the mountain ash sawfly (Pristiphora geniculata).

J	Jiang, X; Gao, SX; Li, Y				Jiang, Xu; Gao, Shanxing; Li, Yuan			How trust dependence and prior ties influence the stability of alliances	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the stability of strategic alliances. Based on combinations of different levels of changes in the initial alliance conditions and different levels of alliances' adaptation capabilities, this study proposes a typology of alliance stability: sustaining stability, flexible stability, rigid stability and transient stability/instability. Subsequently, the critical roles of trust, dependence, and prior ties in the stability of alliances have been analysed by drawing on an inter-partner relationship perspective. From this discussion, a number of propositions have been developed to facilitate future empirical testing of our conceptual model.

J	Majumdar, S				Majumdar, Satyajit			Modelling Growth Strategy in Small Entrepreneurial Business Organisations	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP			English	Article							PERFORMANCE; FIRMS	Growth is understood variously by entrepreneurs, and their attitudes influence the goals and ambitions concerning growth. Their actions in this regard depend on the contextual conditions. In this article a model on growth strategy in small entrepreneurial organisations is presented and three propositions are made: (1) attitudes and vision of the entrepreneurs drive growth of small organisations, (2) entrepreneurs of small organisations conduct early search for strategic fit in the market and the environment, and (3) entrepreneurs of small organisations persist in their search for better fit in the market. The model reflects strategic and entrepreneurial dimensions of growth. The propositions can be tested in specific industry settings. First, the dimensions of growth as understood by the entrepreneurs should be analysed and then the process of finding a fit between the industry and its market opportunities should be mapped out to arrive at a robust strategy framework.

J	King, WR; Flor, PR				King, William R.; Flor, Paulo Roberto			The development of global IT infrastructure	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						global strategic orientation; global interdependence; global IT infrastructure; global integration	STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; BUSINESS; MANAGEMENT; FIT; DETERMINANTS; ARCHITECTURE; ORIENTATION; FRAMEWORK	A research model of the impact of a multinational corporations' (MNC) global strategic orientation on global IT infrastructure was developed using global integration, or the degree to which a global strategy is actually implemented, as a mediator. A "matched pair" survey of 94 MNCs was conducted (two respondents per firm) in order to guard against common source bias. The results showed that the firms that pursue a globally oriented strategy actually enacted these strategies as indicated by a wide-variety of resource flows across national units. The role of the level of global integration as a mediator between global strategic orientation and global IT capabilities was empirically demonstrated. This confirms that a global strategy is not sufficient to ensure that an enabling IT infrastructure will be developed; rather it is the actual level of integration and interdependence that is achieved as a result of the strategy that drives IT infrastructure. The primary areas in which global integration was found to be closely linked to the global IT infrastructure were human resources, which significantly influenced the reach, range, support services and planning of the global IT infrastructure, and information resources which significantly influenced the planning dimension of the infrastructure. These results strongly suggest that the transfer of people among national units creates an information needs "pull" which leads to the development of better IT infrastructure and that the "push" of standardized information also contributes positively.

J	Cangemi, JP; Burga, B; Lazarus, H; Miller, RL; Fitzgerald, J				Cangemi, Joseph P.; Burga, Bill; Lazarus, Harold; Miller, Richard L.; Fitzgerald, Jaime			The real work of the leader: a focus on the human side of the equation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Leadership; Innovation; Humanistic philosophy; Communications; Emotional intelligence		Purpose - No one would argue that leaders have a myriad of significant responsibilities. Using a premise the authors support - leadership is a people business - they aim to utilize their more than 100 years combined leadership to answer the question: what, then, is the real work of the leader? Design/methodology/approach - Narrative based on over 100 years of leadership and consultation on leadership with a wide variety of organizations. Findings - The result is the eight roles of the leader, which are as follows: collaborative developer of mission, vision, and organizational core values; creator of a humanistic work environment; developer of people, builder of capabilities; Initiator of organization-wide communications; role model of emotional intelligence; utilizer of strategic data; consensus seeker - risk taker; change agent. Practical implications - The paper discusses each of the roles of the leader in some detail, using a model developed for this purpose. The paper does not attempt to deal with the production, product quality, financial, etc. responsibilities of the leader, only what the authors feel is the principal focus of leadership - the people. Originality/value - The authors are leaders with over 100 years combined leadership experience. Some are leading theorists and practitioners as well. Defining exactly what is leadership has been a persistent problem for researchers and theorists. Discovering how to create or produce leaders likewise has been a difficult challenge over the years. This paper provides a model that encompasses both challenges to answer the fundamental question, what is the real work of the leader?

However, research has not yet considered how job characteristics are associated with other organizational factors to promote employee attitudes and behaviors in a more sustainable way. The authors develop a structural model that addresses this gap with data from services. The results provide broad support for the proposed model, indicating that, perceptions of a customer-oriented culture, autonomy, and behavior-based evaluation systems are associated with task variety, identity, and supervisory support.

Operational effectiveness and strategic flexibility: scales for performance assessment of new product development systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						new product development; operational effectiveness; strategic flexibility; performance assessment	MARKET ORIENTATION; SUCCESS FACTORS; CAPABILITIES; BENCHMARKING; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; FIRMS	Many firms attribute a central role to their New Product Development (NPD) function, in speeding up time to market, improving product quality, increasing manufacturing efficiency, building core competence and increasing innovative ability, often all within one and the same NPD system. This balancing of short-term operational effectiveness and longer-term strategic flexibility requires accurate insight in NPD performance on both dimensions. This paper reports on the operationalisation of these constructs based on NPD success literature, using a subdivision in product concept effectiveness and NPD process effectiveness. A validation test of the subjective scales shows good reliability results. Preliminary analysis of test results (n = 29) seems to point at firms trying to both exploit and explore by adapting the NPD process, and the building of dynamic capabilities.

Effectiveness of nutrient supplement placement for changing beef cow distribution	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						grazing; livestock distribution; supplement placement	PRECISION CONSERVATION	Assessments of conservation effects are being conducted to determine the effectiven ess of agricultural conservation practices. The practice of nutrient supplement placement to improve livestock distribution has not been designated a "best management practice" by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).Three studies in California visually and statistically document the effectiveness of nutrient supplement placement for changing livestock distribution. The initial study conducted in the Sierra Nevada foothills demonstrated that use of riparian patches could be reduced with strategic placement of dehydrated molasses supplement. A study on in adjacent ranch found that during the dry season, supplement placement effectively redistributed livestock by attracting them into a zone that extended out to about 600 in (1,980 ft) from the supplement. In a study on a coastal ranch in San Luis Obispo County, nutrient supplements were used to attract cows into an ungrazed forest adjacent to grazed grassland. The results of the studies reported here support the effectiveness of supplement placement for changing livestock distribution. Integration of supplement placement practices into best management practices and into NRCS's prescribed grazing standard is supported by this research.	[George, M.

J	Hensen, P; Schiller, M; Metze, D; Luger, T				Hensen, Peter; Schiller, Meinhard; Metze, Dieter; Luger, Thomas			Evaluating hospital service quality from a physician viewpoint	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Questionnaires; Customer services quality; Doctors; Hospitals; Germany	PRIMARY-CARE; COMMUNICATION; INTERFACE	Purpose - The purpose of this research is to show that referring physicians play a strategic role in health care management. This study aims to evaluate the perception of hospital services by referring physicians and clinicians for quality improvement. Design/method/approach - Referring physicians in private practice and hospital clinicians at a large dermatology academic department providing inpatient and outpatient services at secondary and tertiary care levels were surveyed to determine their perceptions of service quality. A comparative questionnaire survey was established to identify improvement areas and factors that drive referral rates using descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings - Referring physicians' (n = 53) and clinicians' (n = 22) survey results concordantly revealed that timely and significant information about hospital stay as well as accessibility to hospital staff are major points for improvement. Significant differences between both samples were found with respect to inpatient services and patient commendation. Clinicians tended to rate their services and offerings higher than referring physicians (p = 0: 019). Geographic range was correlated with the frequency of patient commendation (p = 0: 005) and the perception of friendliness (p = 0: 039). The number of referred patients was correlated with medical reports' informational value (p = 0: 042). Research limitations/implications - Although the study has a limited sample size it appears that surveying physicians' perspectives is an essential tool for gathering information about how provided health care services are perceived. Originality/value - Survey results should be useful for continuous quality improvement by regular measuring and reporting to executive boards. Hospitals should pay careful attention to their communication tools, particularly medical reports.

Incorporating complex adaptive systems theory into strategic planning: The Sierra Nevada Conservancy	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION	Conservation organizations rely increasingly on integrated planning approaches that explicitly address social and economic goals while pursuing ecological conservation. Moreover, the spatial and temporal scale at which these organizations operate is growing. The Sierra Nevada Conservancy, established as a new state agency by California legislation in 2004 to pursue social, economic and ecological sustainability across a 25 million acre region, exemplifies this large-scale, integrated approach. Therefore, the new agency faces a complex set of policy objectives that must be pursued across a widely varying geography of social, economic and ecological conditions. Using the Conservancy's. re management program area as an example, the paper illustrates how application of an analytic framework from complex adaptive systems theory can guide the Conservancy to deploy its resources more effectively than broader-scale application of a single, agency-wide strategy relying on a more static model. Therefore, the complex adaptive systems framework offers promise in strategic planning. The paper illustrates how the model's four-stage cycle can be applied at the sub-regional and programmatic level to identify opportunities for agency intervention that address varying local conditions. This approach is likely to increase the effectiveness of programs for agencies facing similar complexities and challenges.

This study combines the theoretical background of technology and sustainable competitive advantage with specific, actionable business cases in which firms currently are employing RFID technology to shift costs and to improve overall industry structure, thereby leading to sustainable competitive advantage. From this study, it is evident that inter-organisational communication and cooperation are even more crucial in truly leveraging the benefits of RFID technology. Companies must negotiate with each other so that they can determine accountability. responsibility, data standards, hardware standards, network standards, and the like.

J	Karhunen, P				Karhunen, Paivi			Toward convergence in the St. Petersburg hotel industry through the lens of institutional theory	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						hotel industry; transition economies; Russia; institutional isonorphism; organizational field	STRATEGIES; TRANSITION; CULTURE; RUSSIA	The article assesses the power of institutional organization theory in explaining enterprise adaptation in post-socialism. Empirical analysis of the hotel sector in St. Petersburg, Russia, shows that industry-level isomorphic forces are not at work during economic transition. Combined with market imperfections, this results in intra-industry strategic diversity. The underlying logic however changes as the transition proceeds. During the transition, diversity is based on local versus foreign management and during the post-transition on the legitimacy of operations. The majority of hotels start operating according to shared norms and practices, whereas the lack of coercive pressures from the state still allows some hotels to operate in the shadow and ignore institutional norms.

Both organizational and geographical boundaries often slow down or block the flows of knowledge and experience that are needed to make full use of the organization's capabilities. There is a high cost to the duplication of effort, inconsistencies and inefficiencies that result. A number of organisations have pioneered new ways of working in order to address this strategic challenge. One of the most promising approaches is the development of what is commonly referred to as 'communities of practice'. This article highlights the experiences of four global organisations - Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Oracle, Shell and Schlumberger - in terms of how they have approached the governance of their communities, at both a strategic and an operational level.

Design/methodology/approach - General conclusions are drawn and strategic implications derived from a survey of 355 UK manufacturing companies which had expressed interest in the introduction of new computer-based technology. Findings - It was found that the companies with strategy-technology integration showed better financial and operational performance. Strategies of technology leadership and market orientation were also associated with enhanced financial performance. However, a number of organisational conditions were found to be necessary for the pursuit of these strategies. Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed to examine the process and structure in which strategy technology can be better integrated. Practical implications - Firms should strive to achieve strategy- technology integration to maximise the benefits of adopting new technologies.

Subba			A study of AMT in North America A comparison between developed and developing countries	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Advanced manufacturing technologies; Developing countries; Strategic manufacturing; North America		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report the findings of an exploratory survey administered in North America on advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTs). The objective of the survey is to compare the status of AMT investment, planning and implementation, and performance in two different regions: Anglo America (developed countries) and Middle America (developing countries). Design/methodology/approach - Responses from 97 Anglo-American companies (62 from Canada and 35 from the USA) were compared to responses from 125 Middle American companies (85 from Mexico and 40 from Costa Rica). The researchers used different statistical analyses such as exploratory factor analyses, analysis of variance and regression. Findings - In general, Middle American countries representing the developing region show higher AMT investment, planning and implementation activities, and finally, higher performance due to AMT implementation. This phenomenon was hypothesized since developed countries have shifted most of their manufacturing operations into developing countries, while they keep ownership of multinational firms. Therefore, big corporations that previously invested in AMT in their home countries are now investing in AMT in their manufacturing plants in developing countries. Originality/value - This research provides insights to the growing body of knowledge on AMT. Most AMT research has been done in developed countries. In this study, the researchers show results comparing developed versus developing countries.

Instead of focusing on opportunistic behaviour in knowledge transactions and assuming minimising transaction costs as a firms' objective, I focus on firms' absorptive capacity and emphasise gains from knowledge transfer in technology sourcing. I analyse bow a firm matches a sourcing mode with its absorptive capacity to enhance knowledge transfer in technology sourcing, and I find positive relations between a firms' absorptive capacity and interactive technology sourcing modes.

J	Schiff, A				Schiff, Amira			Pre-negotiation and its Limits in Ethno-National Conflicts: A Systematic Analysis of Process and Outcomes in the Cyprus Negotiations	INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION-A JOURNAL OF THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Ethno-national conflicts; pre-negotiation; negotiation; Cyprus		The repeated failures of negotiation in ethno-national conflicts highlight the importance of studying the relationship between the pre-negotiation process and the results of the subsequent formal negotiations. This study examines various factors that contributed to a decision by adversaries to initiate official negotiations, and how these factors affected the prospects for a negotiated agreement. Furthermore, it suggests that certain elements in the pre-negotiation process portend the nature of the changes in the parties' political positions ( tactical or strategic) and the parties' readiness to reach an agreement. An exploration is presented using a case study of the negotiations over the Cyprus conflict in 2004 which resulted in the ultimate rejection by the negotiating parties of the Annan Plan in late March of 2004. We examine the connection between the pre-negotiation process, from the end of 2003 until February 13, 2004, and the failure of the formal negotiations in March 2004. The analysis indicates that the deficient method and process of the pre-negotiations that took place regarding the Cyprus conflict determined the subsequent failure of the negotiations. The early detection of such factors in other negotiations over ethno-national conflicts may mitigate the causes that lead to failure, or perhaps assist in managing the process differently, so as to facilitate a more positive outcome.

Manufacturing managers' perceptions of functional power in manufacturing organizations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cross-functional integration; Operations and production management; Strategic manufacturing; United States of America	PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; ROLES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine differences in manufacturing managers' perceptions of functional area power in manufacturing organizations to address the perception in the literature that manufacturing has little if any power in the organization. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data gathered from 129 manufacturing executives in the USA are used to examine their perceptions of differences in functional power in manufacturing firms. Relative rankings of functional areas for four types of power - position, expertise, resource, and political - are used to examine perceived differences, and the relationship between power and the role of the manufacturing executive in strategic decision making. Findings - Contrary to prior assertions in the manufacturing strategy literature, it was found that the manufacturing and marketing areas are perceived by manufacturing managers to be the most powerful functions, switching in their dominant roles depending upon the type of power. In addition, a relationship exists between position, expertise, and political power and the role of the manufacturing executive. Research limitations/implications - Although, this research includes a second respondent from a sub-sample of firms, future research should examine not only the manufacturing managers' perceptions of intra-organizational power, but also should dovetail the paper's findings with perceptions of managers in other functional areas as well. Practical implications - Manufacturing managers can take actions to enhance their role in business-level strategic decisions and be proactive in increasing the power of their functional area. Originality/value - This paper addresses intra-organizational power, which has not been examined in the manufacturing strategy literature from the perspective of the manufacturing manager's perception.

Replication strategies, knowledge and attention: a study of coffee chains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICE INDUSTRY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						organizational planning; corporate strategy; knowledge management	DISTINCTIVE COMPETENCE; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose and test a model that uses "organizational attention" as an explanatory factor of knowledge transfer, and apply it to firms pursuing a replication strategy - like McDonalds or Starbucks. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from three coffee chains, empirical findings that operationalize and illustrate their different attention profiles are presented, and differences in their replication outcomes are demonstrated. The paper concludes with some qualitative analyses of the linkages between attention and replication success. Findings - Each chain has a different attention profile, reflected in varying attention to knowledge sources and domains. These profiles are found to be consistent with each three outcome measures of each chain's replicafion strategy - namely uniformity, accuracy, and distinctiveness. Research limitations/implications - The paper extends prior understanding of the knowledge based view of the firm, organization, learning, cognitive limits, attention, and templates into an explanatory model of the process of knowledge flows, selection, and effectiveness in implementing replication strategies in service firms. Originality/value - The proposed model is a pioneering examination of the influence of organizational attention on exploiting knowledge as a strategic resource; and specifically on three indications of the success of the replication strategy, namely accuracy, uniformity, and distinctiveness.

Repeated measures analysis showed that firms that substantially cut jobs failed to improve their labour productivity and their operational indebtedness. Then, taken a step further, statistical analysis surprisingly revealed that firms that cut the highest proportions of their workforce had a significant deterioration of their operational indebtedness and a non-significant change of their labour productivity. These results call into question the economic legitimacy of major workforce reductions increasingly institutionalized to the detriment of the strategic approach of HRM.

J	Sen, BA; Taylor, R				Sen, B. A.; Taylor, R.			Determining the information needs of small and medium-sized enterprises: a critical success factor analysis.	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Conceptions of Library and Information Science	AUG 13-16, 2007	Boras, SWEDEN				QUALITY MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; TQM	Introduction. This paper reports the results of a critical success factor analysis of two small businesses that share staff and premises, operating within the same industry ( educational resources), but within different market sectors ( early years literacy and religious education). Method. Data were collected by interviews with managers and from analysis of documents. The approach is defined and explored as being useful for small to medium sized enterprises in determining their information needs, which are critical to strategy, business development and growth. Findings. Nine critical success factors emerged, one of which was corporate information competence. Information was also a sub-factor underlying all other critical success factors. Conclusion. It is essential for small businesses in today's competitive environment to take a strategic approach to their information needs if they wish to develop and remain competitive. If information expertise is not present within the company it is advisable to invest in that expertise through recruitment, training, partnership, or outsourcing. This study confirms previous research findings relating to the 'critical' role of information in organizations and specifically small companies.	[Sen, B.

J	Lichtenstein, S; Dade, P				Lichtenstein, Scott; Dade, Pat			The shareholder value chain: values, vision and shareholder value creation	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Business now almost universally accepts that the primary management task is value creation. The impact of leaders', directors' and executives' personal values in the value creation process has been largely ignored in the literature. This paper seeks to redress the current situation by proposing that the needs and values of leaders and executives drive the vision, goals and strategies to create shareholder value. Yet, while most directors and senior managers will be at ease with pushing the organisation farther and faster in the creation of new methods to create more shareholder value, this is creating dis-ease amongst other directors, executives and the organisations' operator who have different values. This disease potentially stymies leaders' and boards' ability to create more value for shareholders. By understanding the values dynamic and asking different questions, boards and leaders can motivate the culture to create more value. The objective of this paper is to build on previous executive values research by examining the impact of how the values of one executive value group translate into methods of creating shareholder value and proposing the linkage between leaders values and shareholder value. First, a theoretical background is provided. Next, the results of empirical research into executive values are briefly reviewed and combined with data and insights from proprietary market research to discuss how the needs and values of one executive value group impact on strategic leadership factors driving shareholder value creation methods. This is followed by proposing a conceptual framework illustrating the linkages between leaders' values and shareholder value creation with propositions. Conclusion and implications are drawn and finally limitations and areas for further research are provided.

Influence of iodine on nutritional, metabolic and immunological response of goats fed Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal diet	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							DEGRADING RUMEN BACTERIA; FORAGE-BASED DIETS; THYROID-HORMONES; FEED-INTAKE; DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS; GLIRICIDIA-SEPIUM; BLOOD METABOLITES; REPLACEMENT VALUE; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; DRIED LEUCAENA	Fifteen indigenous nondescript kids (8 center dot 2 kg; 8 months initial age), randomly allotted into three equal groups, were used to study the effects of supplementation of extra iodine on their performance when fed a leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal containing diet. Group I (CON) was fed a control concentrate supplement consisting of a conventional protein source whereas the other two groups (LL and LLI) were fed a concentrate containing leucaena leaf meal so as to supply 0 center dot 5 of the net crude protein (CP) requirements. Additionally, animals in group LLI were given supplemental iodine (as potassium iodide solution) at 0 center dot 25 mg/head/day. Wheat straw was provided ad libitum as the sole source of roughage during the 120 days of the experimental period. A metabolism trial, conducted at the end of the feeding trial, revealed no variation in the dry matter intake (DMI) among the groups. A significant (P<0 center dot 01) decline was evident in digestibility of CP in both the leucaena-fed groups (0 center dot 463 and 0 center dot 482 versus 0 center dot 586) whilst that of the other organic components remained unaffected. Animals on the LL diet exhibited lower (P<0-01) nitrogen retention and average daily gain (ADG) in live weight (LW). Blood collected periodically was analysed for the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (TO and thyroxine (T-4) as well as other biochemical parameters. At the end of the experimental feeding, the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response of the goats was assessed by intra-dermal inoculation of phytohaemagglutinin-P and measuring the change in skin thickness at various postinoculation hours. The results revealed that the serum concentration of glucose was significantly (P<0 center dot 05) higher in the LLI group of animals fed leucaena with iodine. The concentration of cholesterol in serum of LL animals increased significantly (P<0 center dot 05) compared to the CON and LLI groups. No variation due to dietary interventions was evident in other indices of metabolic profile. While the concentration of circulating T-3 remained unaffected due to dietary intervention, that of T4 reduced significantly (P<0 center dot 05) in the LL group. Moreover, the T4 concentration in the LLI group remained similar to that of control indicative of positive impact of iodine supplementation. The immune response revealed that the skin thickness of animals in the LL group was lower (P < 0 center dot 05) as compared to the control, indicating a compromise of CMI response due to feeding of leucaena leaf meal. Supplementation of iodine appeared to be partially effective in potentiating the response. In conclusion, iodine supplementation could be adopted as a strategic management strategy to ameliorate the negative impacts of feeding leucaena leaf meal in growing kids.

Water industry asset management: a proposed service-performance model for investment	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						asset management; holistic modelling; investment planning; regulation		The water industry in England and Wales has developed over the last century, from small organisations serving local communities to large integrated companies in private ownership, overseen by a government regulator. Asset management practice has developed greatly in the 17 years since privatisation, with companies able to plan their operations and investment as they believe appropriate for the provision of customer services, subject to justifying their plans to the economic, quality and environmental regulators. Investment has flowed into the industry to replace deteriorated assets and to improve the quality of drinking water and rivers. The asset base is complex and, with a replacement value of approximately 231 pound billion at the 2002-2003 price base index suitable approaches are required to ensure that both the water service and the sewerage service are delivered at the most appropriate long-term cost. The 2004 UK water industry price review was supported by the introduction of a Capital Maintenance Planning Common Framework to help companies understand and explain their maintenance investment requirement. In this paper, a service-performance model is proposed to improve managers' understanding of the way in which businesses and the environment change over time, taking account of maintenance and other strategic requirements. Although developed with the water industry in mind, the model is equally applicable to other asset-intensive industries.

J	Willis, MR; Keller, AA				Willis, Melvin R.; Keller, Arturo A.			A framework for assessing the impact of land use policy on community exposure to air toxics	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						air toxics; risk assessment; air pollution; city planning; regional planning; strategic environmental assessment	RISK; GIS	our research focuses on the linkage between land use planning policy and the spatial pattern of exposure to air toxics emissions. Our objective is to develop a modeling framework for assessment of the community health risk implications of land use policy. The modeling framework is not intended to be a regulatory tool for small-scale land use decisions, but a long-range planning tool to assess the community health risk implications of alternative land use scenarios at a regional or subregional scale. This paper describes the development and application of an air toxic source model for generating aggregate emission factors for industrial and commercial zoning districts as a function of permitted uses. To address the uncertainty of estimating air toxics emission rates for planned general land use or zoning districts, the source model uses an emissions probability mass function that weights each incremental permitted land use activity by the likelihood of occurrence. We thus reduce the uncertainty involved in planning for development with no prior knowledge of the specific industries that may locate within the land use district. These air toxics emission factors can then be used to estimate pollutant atmospheric mass flux from land use zoning districts, which can then be input to air dispersion and human health risk assessment models to simulate the spatial pattern of air toxics exposure risk. The model database was constructed using the California Air Toxics Inventory, 1997 US Economic Census, and land assessment records from several California counties. The database contains information on more than 200 air toxics at the 2-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) level. We present a case study to illustrate application of the model.

The study consists of scale development to measure the dimensions of entrepreneurship in business schools. Results suggest that AACSB deans must reassess the school's mission, nourish entrepreneurship, reward and support opportunity creation and discovery, and link entrepreneurship with the school's strategy.

J	Agndal, H; Elbe, J				Agndal, Henrik; Elbe, Joergen			The internationalization processes of small and medium-sized Swedish tourism firms	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM			English	Article						internationalization; process; tourism; small and medium-sized firms	FOREIGN; ENTRY	This paper develops eight propositions regarding internationalization processes for small and medium-sized tourism firms (SMTFs). A SMTF is defined here as a company that produces a tourist attraction locally, its product based on local resources. This means that SMTFs rely on customers seeking them on the firms' home market. This has implications for the SMTF's expansion into new markets and, consequently, its internationalization process. In a study based on the propositions, the internationalization processes of ten Swedish SMTFs were investigated It was found that some SMTFs internationalized slowly; initially displayed a reactive and emergent approach, and entered markets that were culturally and geographically close. Born global SMTFs, however, searched more actively for opportunities, also in more remote markets. Intermediaries were the dominant mode throughout the process for all firms. Over time, most of the SMTFs developed a more strategic and deliberate approach in their selection of counterparts and new markets. The support of a destination management organization was important initially for some of the firms.

J	Izquierdo, CC; Samaniego, MJG				Camarero Izquierdo, Carmen; Garrido Samaniego, Maria Jose			How alternative marketing strategies impact the performance of Spanish museums	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategic marketing; Internal marketing; Market orientation; Museums; Spain		Purpose - The current work seeks to analyze the different effects of three alternative strategic marketing orientations - market orientation, sales orientation, and product orientation - on non-profit organizations' effectiveness, specifically their economic and social effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach - In order to test the hypotheses proposed, an empirical analysis of 182 Spanish museums was conducted. Findings - The study reveals that social effectiveness relates highly to product and customer orientation, whereas economic effectiveness mainly depends on sales orientation and inter-functional coordination. Practical implications - The results suggest that applying a marketing orientation centered on the product and knowing the visitor is critical for successfully fulfilling the objectives of conservation and diffusion of culture. Moreover, the organization needs to focus on sales, on the internal customer, and on the coordination between the managing institutions, to be able to achieve satisfactory economic results. Originality/value - This work makes an empirical contribution to the analysis of market orientation on cultural organizations. Although previous research has underlined the relevance of a market orientation for museums and cultural organizations, few empirical analyses have been developed until now.

Agile MPC system linking manufacturing and market strategies	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article							SHOP-FLOOR CONTROL; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; EXCEPTIONS	Increasing complexity and interdependency in manufacturing enterprises require an agile manufacturing paradigm. This paper considers a dynamic control approach for linking manufacturing strategy with market strategy through a reconfigurable manufacturing planning and control (MPC) system to support agility in this context. A comprehensive MPC model capable of adopting different MPC strategies through distributed controllers of inventory, capacity, and WIP is presented. A hierarchical supervisory controller (referred to as decision logic unit, DLU) that intakes the high-level strategic market decisions and constraints together with feedback of the current manufacturing system state (WIP, production, and inventory levels) and optimally manages the distributed controllers is introduced. The DLU architecture with its three layers and their different functionalities is discussed showing how they link the higher management level to the operational level to satisfy the required demand. A case study for an automatic PCB assembly factory is implemented to demonstrate the applicability of the whole approach. In addition, a comparative cost analysis study is carried out to compare between the developed agile MPC system and classical-inventory- and capacity-based MPC policies in response to different demand patterns. Results showed that the developed agile MPC policy is as cost effective as the inventory-based MPC policy in demand patterns with steady trends, as cost effective as capacity-based MPC in turbulent demand patterns, and far superior than both classical MPC polices in mixed-demand patterns.

J	Drumaux, A; Goethals, C				Drumaux, Anne; Goethals, Christophe			Strategic management: a tool for public management?: An overview of the Belgian federal experience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic planning; Strategic objectives; Public sector organizations; Managers; Behaviour; Belgium		Purpose - The aim of this contribution is to propose a first overview of the strategic plans in the Belgian Federal Administration and to analyse the process of strategic planning itself. Design/methodology/approach - In the first part, the strategic plans are analysed in order to understand the intentions regarding various public policies. A content analysis will be provided in order to propose a typology or at least a comprehensive framework of the intentions. In the second part, the strategic process itself is investigated more into details on the basis of interviews of the presidents of the Federal Public Services. The contribution tries to formalise several behavioural hypotheses in accordance with a model of strategic action in a public context. Finally, the article concludes on the relation between intention and action. Findings - Three models characterize the management plans in Belgian federal administration: external polarization, internal polarization and balanced polarisation. Furthermore, the survey carried out confirms the existence of some effective behaviours of public top managers related to the nature of the public sector and to specific constraints. This result is fully coherent with behavioural assumptions formulated by a contextual model of strategic management. All these elements assess the possible divergence between the intentional strategy and the emergent strategies that would result from a more flexible behaviour. Research limitations/implications - This result is based on the strategic intentions and should be confronted with the later versions of the plans and even better with their achievements in order to distinguish intention and opportunity. Only this longitudinal study will allow final conclusions about the nature of the strategy really implemented in the federal administration to br drawn. Practical implications - The result of this research implies that "ideal" competences of public managers might differ from those requested for a private manager, especially regarding decision making (more incremental) and authority (more influential). Originality/value - This contribution allows an evaluation of strategic process in the public sector as it is formulated by real actors, rather than by a mythical decision maker.

J	Hinks, J; Alexander, M; Dunlop, G				Hinks, John; Alexander, Martin; Dunlop, Graham			Translating military experiences of managing innovation and innovativeness into FM	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Military actions; Leadership; Facilities management		Purpose - This is a conceptual paper for facilities management (FM) practitioners and FM researchers. The paper seeks to analyse a number of well-documented successes and failures in military exploitation of innovation, and identify several recurrent facets that resonate with the contemporary approach to, and difficulties with achieving innovation in FM. Design/methodology/approach - Several military cases are selected for their analogous pertinence to FM. They cover military aspects of technological innovation; process innovation, including innovativeness in the modes of engagement; innovativeness within strategy and paradigm; and innovativeness in the tactical behaviours needed to realise the value of innovations. They are presented as an indirect means of illuminating systemic challenges for innovation within FM. Findings - The paper identifies the primacy of innovativeness over individual technological innovations; and the centrality of empowerment practices and the catalysing of local tactical and operational innovative behaviours to innovativeness. The crucial factors are the attitude and behaviour of leaders, especially in terms of creating latitude for local managers; the locus of command, control and communication; plus local empowerment to achieve clearly explained strategic targets. The authors also identify a shift in performance measurement perspective as a pivotal pre-requisite for successfully innovating for post-industrial FM. Originality/value - Particular focus is made on lessons for developing a culture of organisational innovativeness and for the successful exploitation of latent innovation potential. The paper concludes that these issues represent a significant and systemic challenge to innovation and innovativeness in FM.

J	O'Reilly, P; Finnegan, P				O'Reilly, Philip; Finnegan, Patrick			B2B marketplaces sharing IS/IT infrastructures: an exploration of strategic technology alliances	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic alliances; Business-to-business marketing		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a technology alliance for B2B marketplaces. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper there was a lack of rigorous empirical evidence in the area upon which to base this study, so an exploratory methodology chosen was deemed appropriate. An interpretative case study was undertaken in the Eutilia B2B marketplace. Data gathering took place over a three-month period from July to September 2003. The data-gathering techniques used were semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Findings - This paper draws upon research on co-operative partnerships and strategic alliances to explore the applicability of technology alliances to business-to-business (B2B) electronic marketplaces. The paper explains a model developed by Eutilia, a leading B2B marketplace in the utilities sector, to justify such a technology alliance. The case study illustrates how Eutilia operationalised this model and entered a technology alliance with a competing B2B marketplace. The analysis shows how both marketplaces benefited from the technology-alliance, and the paper concludes by proposing determinants of technology alliances for B2B electronic marketplaces. Research limitations/implications - In this paper a single case study was the method adopted, so findings may not be generalisable. Originality/value - This paper illustrates how B2B electronic marketplaces can benefit from technology alliances. This paper is of interest to both academics and practitioners involved in B2B electronic marketplaces.

J	Owens, M; Quinn, B				Owens, Martin; Quinn, Barry			Problems encountered within international retail joint ventures: UK retailer case study evidence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Joint ventures; Retailing; International business; Transaction costs; Strategic management	PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; DETERMINANTS; CORPORATION; INSTABILITY; MANAGEMENT; ALLIANCES; DYNAMICS; POWER	Purpose - The paper aims to investigate the problems encountered in retail international joint ventures (IJVs). It synthesizes and applies transaction cost economics and strategic management theories to help explain the dynamics within the international retail joint venture (IRJV) process. Design/methodology/approach - Applies a multiple case study approach based on a sample of UK-based retailers during the retail internationalisation process. Findings - Highlights the key problem areas encountered by retailers involved in IJV activity. Concludes that in contrast to production-driven joint venture activity, retailers appear to have a shorter and intensive adjustment period to effectively co-ordinate operational activity and bridge the corporate and behavioural differences between themselves and the partner. Research limitations/implications - Focuses on a sample of UK retail companies only. Given the intensive instantiation process, a predetermined approach may be more appropriate for retail firms to avoid problematic outcomes in IJV management. Practical implications - Retail companies may experience post formation risk in joint ventures, arising from partner resource limitations. Differences in management capability between the partners may lead to ineffective collaboration and poor operational performance. Originality/value - Addresses a previously neglected area of research and provides insights into the management of IRJV. Examines the relevance of key theoretical perspectives in relation to the problems encountered in IRJV activity.

J	Quesada, H; Gazo, R				Quesada, Henry; Gazo, Rado			Methodology for determining key internal business processes based on critical success factors A case study in furniture industry	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Critical success factors; Business policy; Furniture industry; United States of America		Purpose - The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to help manufacturers determine and rank key internal business processes based on critical success factors (CSF). Design/methodology/approach - First, company CSF and key performance measures were determined based on vision, mission and strategic objectives statements. Second, most important CSF were prioritized according to rating scores such as cost savings, necessary improvement, and own discretion using a balanced scoreboard procedure and a prioritization matrix. Third, CSF were related to internal business processes based on "strength of relationship" in order to define the most critical internal processes. Fourth, possible differences in the perception of CSF and strategic objectives among different management levels were compared. Fifth, the methodology was validated in three furniture manufacturing companies. Findings - It was found that when a firm is missing vision or mission statements, it is imperative to define them before CSF can be identified. The CSF found through this case study were related to customer service, manufacturing management, quality and price of the products. The key internal business processes identified for the companies in this study were customer engagement, product operations and supply chain management. Conclusions show that better results were obtained when this methodology was applied to highest-level of management. Originality/value - This study has proved to be a useful tool to determine a strategy based on CSF and their relationship to internal business processes. Plant managers in our case studies were able to prioritize the critical internal business processes for their plants based on the most important CSF.

In this article, we describe a balanced scorecard-based framework in detail and discuss its potential e-business uses. This framework enables e-business managers to plan and allocate resources more effectively and align strategic objectives with performance results. It also provides a stable point of reference for e-businesses to understand and manage the fundamental changes introduced by e-business initiatives.

J	Prior, DD				Prior, Daniel D.			Integrating stakeholder management and relationship management: contributions from the relational view of the firm	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper offers a synthesis of the stakeholder management and relationship marketing literature in terms of how both strands can inform each other. Based on the suggestions of Luk, Yau, Tse, Sin and Chow (2005), stakeholders are seen as synergistic or hindering in terms of the overall strategic prospects of the organisation. This conflict is central to traditional stakeholder management approaches. The relational view of the firm (Dyer and Singh, 1998) offers an interesting framework on which stakeholder relationships can be based. Using the four key variables contained within the relational view, this paper argues for a stakeholder analysis process that is underpinned by the notion of competitive rivalry in stakeholder markets rather than on incumbency.

A deep insight is given into the nature, motivation and implementation of the SCP as a value-added component in the forefront of SCM. The role of the Internet in SCP is examined, and the current situation of SCP in China is analysed. Compared with available e-portals in the global market, a web-based DRAGON Engineering Portal (DEP) across geographical borders and cultural barriers is proposed to support European and Chinese industrial partners in developing strategic manufacturer-supplier partnerships. E-partnering and cultural repository are in-built to support a dislocated supply chain partnership for collaborative product development, starting with the location of partners and the implementation of contact initiation.

J	Bassen, A; Blasel, D; Faisst, U; Hagenmuller, M				Bassen, A; Blasel, D; Faisst, U; Hagenmuller, M			Performance measurement of corporate venture capital - balanced scorecard in theory and practice	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						balanced scorecard; corporate venture capital; intrapreneurship; performance measurement		A large number of corporations have invested in e-business ventures in order to create strategic values, such as enhanced innovation or improved entrepreneurship, within the firm's network. The achievement of these objectives may take several years before resulting in financial returns for the corporation and is therefore very difficult to measure. At the same time, challenging market conditions have put financial valuations especially of e-business ventures under pressure over the last years. Consequently, the realisation of strategic returns becomes increasingly important to Corporate Venture Capital investors. This paper develops a performance measurement framework based on the Balanced Scorecard concept of Kaplan and Norton. The framework intends to make the results of Corporate Venture Capital activities more transparent by integrating both strategic and financial measures. The case of Siemens Venture Capital illustrates the practical use of a Balanced Scorecard. It shows the development process of the Siemens Venture Capital Scorecard and demonstrates its evolution over several years.

J	Callaway, SK; Hamilton, RD				Callaway, Stephen K.; Hamilton, Robert D.			Exploring disruptive technology: the structure and control of internal corporate ventures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Corporate ventures; Control systems		Purpose - The purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual model addressing how environmental uncertainty resulting from disruptive technology affects an internal corporate venture's organization. Design/methodology/approach - Based upon a review of two complementary theoretical perspectives - resource dependence theory and institutional theory, propositions regarding internal and external linkages and the internal organizational governance mechanisms of organizational structure and strategic control systems of ICVs are developed. Findings - Resource dependence theory and institutional theory are both necessary to explain the organizational issues resulting from the uncertainty surrounding disruptive technology. Research limitations/implications - A limitation is that this is a theoretical paper; empirical research is needed to test the theories presented in this paper. Practical implications - To the extent that managers can be trained to recognize and understand the complexities of disruptive technology, their likelihood of appropriate organizational responses will be enhanced. Originality/value - The paper presents a conceptual model of how to successfully manage an internal corporate venture in a disruptive technology environment.

J	Gregory, A				Gregory, Anne			A development framework for government communicators	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Government; Communications; Competences; United Kingdom		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a development framework for government communicators. Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes how a working group approached the project which involved examining extant training frameworks from communication professional bodies, academic literature and practitioner communities; undertaking extensive interviewing and data collection from departments and obtaining input from external organisations in order to devise an original, process-driven model which embeds a strategic approach to communication. The paper also outlines the collaborative way in which the model was developed which included extensive input from government communicators at all levels of seniority, ongoing consultation and testing with potential users, private sector organisations and accrediting professional bodies. Findings - Following a review of government communications in 2004, the new permanent secretary for government communication has begun to implement a range of initiatives. Work had already begun in the cabinet office on developing a more strategic approach to training and development and a working group was set-up originate and launch a development framework (now called evolve) for the whole civil service communication community. Originality/value - The paper describes the development of evolve-an open, transparent and iterative approach which has elicited commendation and support from all the parties involved.

J	Lee, WB; Lau, HCW; Ning, A				Lee, WB; Lau, HCW; Ning, A			An integrated study methodology for learning strategic inventory management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						integrated study methodology; motivation-based learning; educational simulator; logistics workflow inventory management	GAME	The pivotal idea central to engineering education is the cultivation of a motivation-based environment There is little doubt that students learn better, particularly with regard to 'deep learning' if they are allowed to focus on areas of a curriculum in which they are strongly motivated On the other hand, engineering education can also be regarded as an integrated study for students, which foster the cultivation of basic skills and the talent to follow well-defined patterns of procedures in order to solve problems. This paper presents the design and implementation of an educational simulation which mimics a microworld of business activities. The objective of such educational simulation is to present an integrated environment for students to undergo a motivation-bused learning experience based on an integrated study methodology The design and implementation of the educational simulation is intended to motivate students to accept personal responsibility for behavior in a simulated environment by recognizing and taking pride with a sense of self achievement.

J	Lussier, RN; Sonfield, MC				Lussier, Robert N.; Sonfield, Matthew C.			The effect of family business size as firms grow: a USA-France comparison	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Family firms; Business development; United States of America; France	PERFORMANCE; OWNERS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how family businesses change as they grow in size, and to compare differences between the USA and France. Design/methodology/approach - The research design is survey research, statistically t-testing 12 hypothesized differences between smaller and larger firms in the USA (n = 159) and in France (n = 116). Findings - The research finds that both countries' larger firms have significantly (p, 0: 05) more non-family members within top management and make greater use of outside consultants, advisors, and professional services than smaller firms. However, family businesses in France had no other significant differences, while those in the USA had four. Larger US firms have a smaller percentage of women family members working in the firm and less conflict and disagreement between family members; they also spend more time in strategic management activities, and use more sophisticated methods of financing. Research limitations/implications - There are some variations between the two country samples. Practical implications - Understanding whether and how family business management activities, styles and characteristics change with growth can help those who own and manage such businesses. It can also be of value to those who advise and assist family businesses, as well as researchers who study them. Originality/value - This is the first study to analyze the effect of firm size on family business management and to conduct a cross-national comparison.

J	Miller, KD				Miller, Kent D.			A Case for Including Religious Organizations in Management Research	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SPIRITUALITY & RELIGION			English	Article						Religious Organizations; Strategic Management; Organization Theory; Interdisciplinary Research	ENVIRONMENT; COMPETITION; ECONOMICS; MARKET	This article clarifies and extends my 2002 Strategic Management Journal article on the competitive strategies of religious organizations. I respond to some concerns raised by Gomez and Moore and offer arguments supporting management theorists' involvement in research on religious organizations. Management does not offer a comprehensive theory of religious organizations, only a distinct and potentially insightful vantage point. We need to evaluate the appropriateness of management theory assumptions and arguments in this novel context. It is neither appropriate nor desirable that management theory remain unchanged as a result of its encounter with religious organizations. The dialogue between management and religion has the potential to be a generative process changing both management theory and practices within religious organizations.

Knowledge-based strategies and information system technologies: preliminary findings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						knowledge-based strategy; taxonomy; IS technologies; organisational culture		Knowledge-Based (KB) strategies are being recognised as a vital factor of business strategy. Still, there is limited empirical research in this young academic field. This research intends to add to the limited empirical research in the area of Knowledge Management (KM) and Information Systems (IS) technologies. This research uses a recently proposed framework to analyse the relationship between six KB strategic dimensions, organisational culture, and IS technologies. The results indicated that two KB strategies had a positive association with a number of IS technologies, but not all types of IS technologies. Further, only one IS technology showed statistically significant association with one of the outcomes tested.

The local instrument was used for local public health systems and on Native American reservations. A description of the process as well as aggregated results of the local performance assessment is presented. An importance ranking scale was combined with the performance scores to identify priority areas. Priority needs were specifically identified for developing community health profiles, working more closely with community partnerships, and increasing emphasis on health education activities. The process was a good opportunity for bringing partners together in local public health systems and for developing interest in using the more complete strategic planning tools in Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships.

This article provides a chronological description of the development of MAPP, devoting significant attention to pivotal decisions, development milestones, and distinguishing features of this new public health planning tool. All phases of the development ensured a practice-driven process, ongoing substantive input from the field, careful attention to research and literature, and intentional linkage with related efforts. This deliberate process laid the foundation for a tool that is not only well grounded in research and concepts but also relevant for practical use in communities. The process also demonstrates how practice-based research can be conducted in a way that effectively balances the need for applied relevance with intellectual integrity.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						communication complexity; economic analysis; e-sourcing; organization structure; procurement; queuing; reverse auction	SUPPLY CHAIN; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT SCIENCE; E-BUSINESS; LONG-TERM; PROCUREMENT; IMPACTS; ORGANIZATION; STRATEGIES; AUCTIONS	Strategic sourcing, defined as a firm's key business process to identify, evaluate, configure, and negotiate purchases in important spend categories while managing long-term supplier relationships, is playing a significant role in sourcing strategies. The adoption of e-sourcing, defined as the use of business software (for example, using application service providers to conduct online procurement auctions) to automate or augment the aforementioned key business process, has been growing rapidly in recent years. One often-cited benefit of e-sourcing is the predicted savings, which is appealing, given the increasing pressure on cost competitiveness faced by firms. Using queuing techniques, this paper develops an economic model that captures fundamental trade-offs in a firm's e-sourcing business process as characterized by communication complexity, frequency of use, and cost of delay. This allows comparisons of two widely adopted structures for e-sourcing: the centralized structure versus the decentralized structure. Conditions under which the centralized structure is favored over the decentralized structure and vice versa are identified and illustrated with numerical examples and case evidence. These findings are robust in other settings. The paper concludes with a discussion of managerial implications.

Training programs attracting high-quality applicants and taking into account the complexity of this emerging field are urgently needed. Methods: An advanced training program, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), was developed by 24 mentors affiliated with nine different universities. The main objective of this program is to develop transdisciplinary knowledge, skills, and attitudes regarding WDP. This program has been developed for PhD students or post-doctoral fellows already registered full-time in a Canadian or recognized foreign university whose main interest is WDP, regardless of the health problem. Results: Since its implementation, the program received two successive cohorts of 10 students. They were registered in 13 universities in five countries and trained in nine different disciplines. Conclusions and significances: Appropriate WDP research may save major societal costs attributable to prolonged work disability. The proposed training program will contribute to developing tomorrow's research workforce.

Elucidation and Decisional Risk in a Multi-Criteria Decision based on a Choquet Integral Aggregation-A Cybernetic Framework	JOURNAL OF MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS			English	Article						decision-making support system; multi-criteria analysis; knowledge engineering; argumentation; elucidation; decisional risk; Choquet integral aggregation		The authors are developing multi-criteria Decision-making support systems (DMSS) for project teams in charge of selecting a technical solution among alternatives. They propose a cybernetic framework to emphasize the link between decision-making (DM) and knowledge management processes in such projects. These DMSSs rely on the tracking of the accompanying knowledge production of long-term decisional processes by a collective with many actors. Based on knowledge-production management, this paper explains how to design decisional risk evaluation, monitoring and control aids and traceability functions for strategic choices and logical argumentation. The DMSS is seen as a recommender system for the project manager. Each possible solution involved in the decision-making process (DMP) is evaluated by means of a set of criteria. The evaluation results from an interpretation of the knowledge items in terms of satisfaction scores of the solutions according to the considered criteria. Aggregating these partial scores provides a ranking of all the possible solutions by order of preference. As criteria are sometimes interacting, the aggregation has to be based on adapted operators, i.e. Choquet integrals. Evaluating possible solutions by the knowledge contained in the knowledge base (KB) opens the way to automating the argumentation of the project team's decisions: the argumentation principle underlying this approach is based naturally on coupling a knowledge dynamical management system (KDMS) with the DMSS. The DMSS also evaluates the decisional risk that reflects the eventuality of a wrong selection due to the insufficiency of available knowledge at a given time in order to adopt a reliable solution. Decisional risk assessment corresponds to sensitivity analyses. These analyses are then exploited to control the decisional risk in time: they enable to identify the crucial information points for which additional and deeper investigations would be of great interest to improve the stability of the selection in the future. The knowledge management of a collective project is represented as a control loop: the KDMS is the actuator, the risk accompanying the decision is the controlled variable and is strongly linked to the entropy of the KB managed by the KDMS. Each of the three phases-intelligence, design, choice-of the DMP is identified to a function of the control loop: actuator, process and regulator. This cybernetic framework for decision has its origin in knowledge management activities for a great-scale project-the EtLD1 project of the French Atomic Commission (CEA) that concerns the management of high-level long-life radioactive waste in France.

Using Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships as a framework for planning at the community level, the CDPH supports five community coalitions through the Chicago Center for Community Partnerships. The overall goal of the Center is to increase community capacity, build new partnerships, provide coalitions with access to decision makers, and inform the role of local public health agencies in supporting this type of work, Bringing together a wide spectrum of stakeholders, coalition members work to conduct assessments and develop and implement strategies, While coalitions demonstrate outcomes related to specific strategies, they also exhibit infrastructure-level results, with increased levels of community organizing, leveraging of existing resources, and new systems for information dissemination. Simultaneously, the CDPH has gained new partners in public health, increased collaboration, and more information about communities. These outcomes are contingent on certain elements of success: (1) committed leadership; (2) commitment to a new way of doing business; (3) prepared public health workforces; and (4) community readiness.

Forming strategic alliances or integrating an enterprise's internal. firms by means of collaborative planning/operations to gain competitive advantage is inevitable. This paper presents the development of an activity-based costing collaborative production planning system (ABC/CPPS) to help production planners to estimate the manufacturing profit of semiconductor backend turnkey (combined IC assembly and testing) operational services at the early stage of order release to production line in a collaborative context. The estimation is under the real constraints of production resources. A predicate/transition net (Pr/Tr net) is used to simulate and implement the activity-based costing (ABC) model with the dynamic characteristics of a production line incorporated.

J	Paxson, DA				Paxson, DA			Multiple state property options	JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Cambridge-Maastricht Symposium	JUN, 2003	Univ Cambridge, Madingley Hall, Cambridge, ENGLAND		Univ Cambridge, Madingley Hall	real expansion; contraction; suspension; reversion options; action triggers; profit uncertainty	INVESTMENT	Before taking strategic actions in property investments, consider the type and number of expansion, contraction and suspension alternatives and the future profit volatility. The optimal investment strategy for a current or prospective property owner should reflect the expected variability of future profits (rent times occupancy times units available), and current profits relative to threshold trigger profits for a variety of alternative states and actions. These alternatives include remaining idle, building and operating properties, expanding, contracting, suspending, reverting to normal service or reduced service capacity, or abandoning. A valuation model is developed for up to eight different options, each with a distinct trigger. Then numerical solutions show optimal profit triggers and valuations for each of these real options. Generally, increasing the number of options reduces the investment and abandonment triggers, and increases the values of the investment option and total option values, given these alternatives and parameters. The relevant parameters will depend on the investment context and feasible actions, but generally include interest rates, profit volatility, and irrecoverable costs of investment, expansion, contracting, suspension and abandonment. Generally increases in investment costs reduce the value of upward options, and increases the optimal triggers for exercising those options. Increases in expected profit volatility increase the value of all options, increases investment triggers and decreases abandonment triggers. These generic models may be appropriate for many contexts where the costs of changing states are partially irrecoverable, yet where management has some flexibility to alter scale, quality and pricing of assets and services.

J	Rowe, F				Rowe, F			Are decision support systems getting people to conform? the impact of work organisation and segmentation on user behaviour in a French bank	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Decision Support Systems	JUL, 2004	Prato, ITALY	IFIP WG 8 3		decision support systems; conformity; strategic conformity; banking; user behaviour; work organisation; environment	INFORMATION; PERSPECTIVE; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; JUDGMENT; STRATEGY; MODEL; DSS	The longitudinal study of the most sophisticated decision support system (DSS) for the management of debit accounts provides new answers to the question of conformity in French banking. In 2003, the analysis of 45 observations and qualitative interviews showed that the advisor maintains his free appreciation of risk. However, even if conformity does not exist, the results on the modification range show that the DSS does exert an influence on user behaviour. In addition, the interpretation and acceptance of DSS recommendation are different according to the type of portfolio managed and how the work is organised. The less the financial advisor knows the client, the greater the influence of the DSS. Recent decisions regarding the division of labour for the management of lower segments heighten the risk that DSS used without knowing the client leads to more conformity, or at least to what we conceptualise as strategic conformity, and a taylorisation of services.

J	Cabot, PE; Nowak, P				Cabot, PE; Nowak, P			Planned versus actual outcomes as a result of animal feeding operation decisions for managing phosphorus	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT	The paper explores how decisions made on animal feeding operations (AFOs) influence the management of manure and phosphorus. Variability among these decisions from operation to operation and from field to field can influence the validity of nutrient loss risk assessments. These assessments are based on assumptions that the decision outcomes regarding manure distribution will occur as they are planned. The discrepancy between planned versus actual outcomes in phosphorus management was explored on nine AFOs managing a contiguous set of 210 fields in south-central Wisconsin. A total of 2611 soil samples were collected and multiple interviews conducted to assign phosphorus index (PI) ratings to the fields. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (r(s)) indicated that PI ratings were less sensitive to soil test phosphorus (STP) levels (r(s) = 0.378), universal soil loss equation (USLE) (r(s) = 0.261), ratings for chemical fertilizer application (r(s) = 0.185), and runoff class (r(s) = -0.089), and more sensitive to ratings for manure application (r(s) = 0.854). One-way ANOVA indicated that mean field STP levels were more homogenous than field PI ratings between AFOs. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests displayed several nonsignificant comparisons for cumulative distribution functions, S(x), (if mean STP levels on AFO fields. On the other hand, the K-S tests of S(x) for PI ratings indicated that the majority of these S(x) functions were significantly different between AFOs at or greater than the 0.05 significance level. Interviews suggested multiple reasons for divergence between planned and actual outcomes in managing phosphorus, and that this divergence arises at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels of decision-making.

In our research, we were surprised to find that knowledge workers have for the most part abandoned the use of knowledge portals. Moreover, in cases where they do turn to knowledge portals they use it as a last resort. In this brief communication, we call attention both to research and practice to help transform current knowledge portals to ones that are more sensitive to the issues faced by practitioners. To this end, we will elaborate on the need to pay attention to maintenance of knowledge management portals.

J	Chae, B; Poole, MS				Chae, Bongsug; Poole, Marshall Scott			Enterprise System Development in Higher Education	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						academic administration IS; enterprise IS; information system implementation; organizational culture		"One system for everyone" has been an ideal goal for information technology (IT) management in many large organizations, and the deployment of such systems has been a major trend in corporate world under the name of enterprise systems (ES) (Brown & Vessey, 2003; Davenport, 2000; Markus, Petrie, & Axline, 2000). Benefits from ES use are claimed to be significant and multidimensional, ranging from operational improvements through decision-making enhancement to support for strategic goals (Shang & Seddon, 2002). However, studies (Hanseth & Braa, 2001; Rao, 2000; Robey, Ross, & Boudreau, 2002) of the deployment of ES in private sector organizations show that the ideal is difficult to accomplish. This paper reports a case in which a major university system in the US attempted to develop an in-house enterprise system. The system is currently used by more than 4,000 individual users in almost 20 universities and state agencies. This case offers a historical analysis of the design, implementation and use of the system from its inception in the mid 1980s to the present. This case indicates that ES design and implementation in higher education are quite challenging and complex due to unique factors in the public sector - including state mandates/requirements, IT leadership/resources, value systems, and decentralized organizational structure among other things - that must be taken into account in planning, designing and implementing ES (Ernst, Katz, & Sack, 1994; Lerner, 1999; McCredie, 2000). This case highlights (1) the challenges and issues in the rationale behind "one system for everyone" and (2) some differences as well as similarities in IT management between the private and public sectors. It offers some unique opportunities to discuss issues, challenges and potential solutions for the deployment of ES in the public arena, particularly in higher education.

J	Powell, TC; Lloyd, CJ				Powell, TC; Lloyd, CJ			Toward a general theory of competitive dominance: Comments and extensions on Powell (2003)	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						competitive dominance; likelihood ratio; decomposition	DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY; INCREASING RETURNS; INEQUALITY INDEXES; ENTROPY MEASURE; SIZE; CURVE; VALIDITY; FIRMS	In a recent paper, Powell (2003) studied 20-year performance in 21 industries, using an ordinal performance measure ('wins'), and the Gini coefficient as a measure of competitive dominance. The findings suggest that firm performance is statistically indistinguishable from performance in non-business domains such as politics, games, sports, and pageants. This paper extends these findings, developing the statistical foundations for a general theory of competitive dominance. The paper presents a Gibrat-based null hypothesis, develops a decomposable index of competitive dominance, and suggests statistical procedures and empirical methods for future research.

J	Heier, H; Borgman, HP; Manuth, A				Heier, Hauke; Borgman, Hans P.; Manuth, Andreas			Siemens: Expanding the Knowledge Management System ShareNet to Research & Development	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						case study; explicit knowledge; information system implementation; IS project teams; knowledge exchange; knowledge sharing; organizational culture; tacit knowledge; user participation; user training		The case study describes the issues surrounding the expansion of the community-based knowledge management system (KMS) ShareNet to the research and development (R&D) function at Siemens Information and Communication Networks (ICN). It sets the stage for a decision situation that Siemens ICN's vice president business transformation and knowledge management, Janina Kugel, faced in 2003. While R&D usage rates differed not remarkably from other Siemens ICN functions, a strategic emphasis on innovative products and services as well as ambitious targets for leveraging offshore development resources - necessitated a stronger penetration of this highly relevant function. Could this extension build on earlier experiences gained with the best practice implementation approach at the sales and marketing function? The case description provides a chronological account of ShareNet's conceptualization, development, international rollout, and operation. It pays attention to information systems (IS) implementation issues, change management, and current developments in the field of knowledge management (KM).

J	Markic, M				Markic, Mirko			Innovation processes and quality development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						constant adaptation; innovation; learning; management and governance; organisation; processes; quality development		This article deals with the role of innovation processes in organisations and presents an interdisciplinary approach to this crucial issue. The study focuses on the role of managers as information providers. It is found that most managers are aware of the significance of information systems for strategic decision-making and that such management information systems facilitate top management when making complex, far-reaching and unpredictable decisions. It is argued that implementing new technologies not only requires the purchasing of sophisticated equipment but also the introduction of an integral system. The balance of all factors of success is, after all, the principal objective of innovation processes in any organisation. The search for a way to accomplish a dialectical system of innovation preconditions is thus related to the research on comprehension of quality significance in Slovenian Istria. By means of a survey on the quality precondition, 80 organisations in Coastal - Karst region have been examined. The results of the survey which deals with quality development in Coastal - Karst region show that organisations in this region are aware of the importance of quality and they consider it to be the key to having a competitive edge. However, the conditions of the business environment they operate in have not forced them yet to become more innovative. Therefore, this is not a systemic quality but rather one which gave a competitive edge thirty years ago; unfortunately, this does not work today.

J	Regev, G; Alexander, IF; Wegmann, A				Regev, Gil; Alexander, Ian F.; Wegmann, Alain			Modelling the regulative role of business processes with use and misuse cases	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Organizational processes; Modelling; Systems theory		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for understanding value-added and abuse prevention activities in business processes. Design/methodology/approach - The paper considers business processes as a regulation mechanism that an organization uses to survive and flourish in its environment. It proposes a theoretical framework based on the concept of homeostasis, the maintenance of identity in a changing world. In this framework the paper classifies business processes into three levels (strategic, operational, regulative) and analyse the relationships between these three levels. Based on this framework, the paper extends the "Use and Misuse Cases" technique to support modelling of value-added and abuse prevention activities. Findings - The main finding is the importance of considering business processes as regulation mechanisms. Traditionally, business processes are analysed through the goals they are designed to achieve. This paper analyses what the organization aims at maintaining. This makes it possible to explicitly model the potential abuses (threats) to business processes and their associated corrective measures (regulative processes). Practical implications - Use of this framework enables process designers to explicitly model abuse prevention activities, even though they are traditionally considered as not participating in customer value creation. This should lead to better-fitting business processes. Originality/value - The framework is useful because it provides a theoretical justification for the value creation and abuse prevention activities that can be found in business processes. The three levels that we use to analyse business processes (strategic, operational and regulative) constitute an innovation in business process modelling where only two levels (strategic and operational) have been considered thus far. Few, if any, business process theoretical frameworks provide this kind of rationale for abuse prevention activities.

J	Roberts, J; Andrews, M				Roberts, John; Andrews, Matthew			Something Funny Happened on the Way to Reform Success: The Case of Budget Reform Implementation in Ghana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article								The current article discusses experience with budgeting and financial management reforms in Ghana and is particularly focused on the development of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) between 1998 and 2002. Evidence shows that this reform began well but faltered after an initial period of progress. A number of factors are referenced in trying to explain why reform implementation was derailed, including reform ownership and political will, organizational integration and organizational incentives, and strategic capacity. All of these factors are commonly presented as influences on reform implementation. The Ghanaian experience provides detail as to how such influences could work.

J	Smith, G				Smith, Gareth			Politically Significant Events and Their Effect on the Image of Political Parties: A Conceptual Approach	JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING			English	Article						Political marketing; brands; image; events; Iraq	SPREADING ACTIVATION THEORY; BRAND	This article begins by arguing that the image of a political party is of strategic importance in its pursuit of electoral success. More specifically, it is argued that important influences on party image are 'politically relevant' events. The paper then develops a conceptual model of how the images of political parties are influenced by such events. It considers internal and external factors that influence the power of a given event to affect party image. Next, the process of image transfer itself is discussed along with the factors that influence the way credit/blame is apportioned from an event. Then, ways of dealing with 'negative' events are considered. The overall model is used to analyse a specific political event (the Iraq war) and assess its likely impact on party image. The article concludes by assessing the model's efficacy and limitations in analysing the case used and with events per se. Finally, future research ideas prompted by the paper are discussed (C) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Zehrer, A; Pechlaner, H; Holzl, B				Zehrer, Anita; Pechlaner, Harald; Holzl, Barbara			The Development of a Destination Management System (DMS) in South Tyrol	ANATOLIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Destination Management Organizations (DMDs); Destination Management System (DMS); transaction costs; South Tyrol		Recent changes in modern information and communication technologies have resulted in a big challenge to create new interfaces among service providers and tourism organizations like a Destination Management System (DMS). The information revolution has reduced the transaction costs of communication and further democratized access to information and knowledge. DMO management generally requires a certain amount of cooperation and networking among the actors involved, which is highly complex and often results in high transaction costs. These costs may be decreased by means of a well-structured DMS. In South Tyrol, the northern-most province of Italy, a project was carried out by the European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano (EURAC) from 2001 to 2004, to develop a DMS for the thirteen DMOs of the province. After the project was successfully piloted by the destination Eisacktal valley in the year 2001, it was extended to all regional tourism organizations of South Tyrol with the Upper Pusteria Valley presented as a case study in the paper. The article draws insights from the transaction costs theory of the New Institutional Economics on the potential role of DMOs in inducing a technological and strategic tool for the tourism industry.

We consider situations in which there are both moral hazard and adverse selection problems in the delegation relationship and where the seller tries to gain strategic advantage by imposing a minimum price above which she pays the delegate a commission. It is shown that incentives and commitment are substitutes. A low-type agent is given less discretion in dealing with the buyer and weaker incentives, while a high-type agent is given more discretion and stronger incentives.

To meet the stringent requirements of this globalization asks for internationally oriented and well-educated graduates. A major challenge of academia thus ties in qualifying graduates for international positions in this new world. A crucial element in the training and education of tomorrow's medical informatics specialists is exposure to health care systems across national borders. In this contribution, we report on the international aspects of and experiences with an inter-university course for medical informatics students on hospital information systems, in particular on their strategic information management.

J	Powell, J; Powell, P				Powell, J; Powell, P			Scenario networks to align and specify strategic information systems: A case-based study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						scenarios; strategic planning; information systems; case method	FIELD ANOMALY RELAXATION; FUTURES METHOD	Contemporary conceptions of the planning component of strategy stress the need for an accommodating approach. This is seen alternatively as contingent planning, where commitments are made stage-by-stage as the surrounding situation develops. or as a robust response, where the emphasis is on retaining freedom of manoeuvre through flexibility. In either concept, the strategic information system (SIS), as a critical asset of the firm, needs to accommodate (and indeed often shape) the emerging strategic plan. This paper presents a method based on discrete state networks that allows close mutual development of the overall strategic plan for a firm and its SIS. The method presents the future in a network of scenarios between which the firm can move. By considering desired trajectories in the network of scenarios the firm can identify the developmental requirements needed to bring about the movement between future states. The high-level SIS specification emerges from this trajectory analysis. An extensive worked example of an insurance firm is used to illustrate the method. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Scott, CH; Scott, JE				Scott, CH; Scott, JE			On models for the operation of a class of electronic marketplaces	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						electronic marketplace; intermediaries; Internet; optimization; goal programming		Innovation in information technology and the use of the Internet have enabled electronic marketplaces to become an important mechanism for linking suppliers and customers in a cost-efficient fashion. Previous research has generally focused on the benefits of electronic marketplaces from transaction cost economics and strategic perspectives. Yet very little academic research has addressed how to actually operate such a marketplace. In this paper, after reviewing the status of electronic marketplaces research, we focus on an operational perspective. A model of an electronic marketplace linking customers and suppliers either directly or via an intermediary is given and solved under various scenarios. This model uses a single cost-minimizing objective and the extensions address issues such as (1) a physical presence for the electronic marketplace, which can provide value-added services and preserve anonymity; and (2) sole sourcing or dual sourcing. An additional model explicitly represents the diverse objectives of the multiple players in the market using goal programming. The contribution of this research to practitioners is to offer a cost-effective alternative to current forms of allocating supply and demand. The cost-minimizing and multiple criteria models and extensions in this study make a contribution to research by expanding the horizons of previous studies on the operation of electronic marketplaces.

J	Stovall, OS; Neill, JD; Perkins, D				Stovall, OS; Neill, JD; Perkins, D			Corporate governance, internal decision making, and the invisible hand	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Annual International Conference on Promoting Business Ethics	2001	St John Univ, Niagara Fall, NY		St John Univ	Invisible Hand; Corps Governance; Multiple Stakeholder Approach		Proponents of the dominant contemporary model of corporate governance maintain that the shareholder is the primary constituent of the firm. The responsibility for managerial decision makers in this governance system is to maximize shareholder wealth. Neoclassical economists ethically justify this objective with their interpretation of Adam Smith's notion of the Invisible Hand. Using a famous quotation from The Wealth of Nations, they interpret the Invisible Hand as Smith's ( An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Methuen & Co., London) assertion that market participants, in pursuing their own self-interests without regard to the interests of others, will collectively provide the optimal economic benefit to society. We argue that the traditional interpretation of Smith is too narrow and potentially harmful to society. In order to fully understand Smith's notion of the influence of the Invisible Hand on human behavior, one must also consider The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In that work, Smith ( The Theory of Moral Sentiments, A. Millar, London) portrays the pursuit of self-interest as only one of several potential motivations for human action. He also acknowledged the existence of a "sympathy principle,'' which refers to the ability and propensity of human beings to consider the interests of others. Heilbroner ( The Essential Adam Smith, W. W. Norton, New York, p. 59) suggests that Smith's sympathy principle allows one to "determine the appropriate degree of self-interest, the proper display of benevolence, the desirable strictness of justice.'' In fact, Smith indicates that ( 1) a society whose members pursue self-interest without a sense of justice will eventually collapse; ( 2) a society whose members pursue self-interest checked by their sense of justice alone will survive; ( 3) a society whose members pursue self-interest, justice, and the interests of others will flourish. Since a more complete reading of Smith indicates that human beings, in considering their own interests, also reflexively consider the interests of others when making decisions, then the traditional corporate governance model appears to be lacking. A broader, multiple stakeholder approach to corporate governance that considers the interests of other constituencies may be more consistent with Smith's views. In particular, Smith's sympathy principle provides a theoretical foundation for a shift away from the narrow, yet dominant, shareholder-based corporate governance model and toward multiple stakeholder models of corporate governance [ e. g., Business and Society: A Strategic Approach to Corporate Citizenship, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA] and internal decision-making [e.g., Sloan Management Review 38, ( 1997) 25 37].

Patients with very short stays (<24 hours) in intensive care units (ICUs) constitute a distinct group with a high turnover rate and a unique patient mix. Our aim was to study their characteristics with the aim of developing strategic approaches for better and more appropriate utilization of ICU resources. Design. Prospective cohort study. Setting. Adult medical/surgical ICU in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Study participants. All admissions in an adult ICU from March 1999 to February 2001 and staying <24 hours were enrolled. Relevant data were collected on these patients, their course and outcome, and analyzed after categorizing patients according to: (i) the nature of admission; and (ii) risk of death (ROD) estimated by Mortality Probability Model II0. Results. Patients staying <24 hours (n = 304) formed 27.8% of all ICU admissions, with an ICU mortality rate of 26.3%. Only 45.4% of them utilized ICU-specific procedures. Around one-third (32.6%) were elective admissions comprising younger patients, with a significantly lower prevalence of chronic illness, a lower ROD, and utilization of less ICU-specific procedures, with very few mortalities. When stratified using RODs into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, significant differences were found with respect to age, nature of ICU admission, presence of chronic illness, utilization of ICU-specific procedures, having do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, length of ICU stay, and ICU and hospital outcomes. Conclusions. Our study has provided crucial input for the study of strategic change towards more optimal utilization of scarce ICU resources. Implementing protocols to target ICU care to patients most likely to benefit, making DNR decisions early in the hospital stay, and operating an Intermediate Care Unit have been proposed as strategic approaches.

J	Xu, TJ; Smith, NJ; Bower, DA; Chew, AS				Xu, TJ; Smith, NJ; Bower, DA; Chew, AS			Development strategies for chinese design institutes	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						engineering firms; regulations; strategic planning; design/build; China	PROJECT	China is gradually opening up its engineering construction services sector to overseas contractors and consultants as part of its move towards joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Traditionally, design institutes have operated as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and for them, China's accession to the WTO in 2001 presents both a threat as well as an opportunity. Given the market conditions in China, most of the design institutes are restructuring their organizations to cope with the increasing competition. Through a pilot investigation, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the Chinese design institutes are identified. Based on the analysis, this paper proposes development strategies for the sustainable growth of Chinese design institutes and suggests approaches for collaboration with foreign contractors and consultants. A case study is presented to demonstrate the practical application of these strategies.

J	McGraw, P				McGraw, P			Influences on HRM practices in MNCs: a qualitative study in the Australian context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER			English	Article						multinational companies; human resource management; centralized control; Australia	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; DETERMINANTS; COMPANIES; PATTERNS	This paper uses data from interviews with HRM managers of the Australian operations of overseas multinational companies to critically question the analytical utility of a number of standard factors that have traditionally been claimed, in the international HRM literature, to influence decisions concerning the appropriate balance between centralization and localization in HRM. The variables reviewed are Primarily structural: industry sector, strategic role of the subsidiary, administrative heritage and formal organizational structure. The data suggest that the firms modify their formal structures frequently in response to environmental turbulence and have evolved towards structural forms that are radically asymmetrical. Two variables that have received limited academic attention to date but which critically mediate the pattern of intended changes are identified First, the perception by key actors in subsidiaries of HR competence elsewhere in the MNC network, particularly head office. Second, the propensity of the staff in the subsidiary to lobby politically, against changes they did not perceive to be rational.

J	Baruch, Y; Peiperl, M				Baruch, Y; Peiperl, M			An empirical assessment of Sonnenfeld's career systems typology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						career systems; career management; empirical; strategic human resource management; typology	EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP; MANAGERIAL CAREERS	Sonnenfeld's career systems typology is recognized as a prominent model in career theory and is widely cited in the career literature. However, this theoretical model has never been tested empirically, thus raising a concern for both theorists and practitioners. This paper reports the results of an empirical study conducted to test the model by surveying 194 British firms. The findings support the strength of one dimension, Supply flow, in terms of reliability and validity, but less so for the other dimension, assignment flow. Comparisons showed that some, though not all of the characteristics from the typology existed in practice. Implications for practice and for future research are discussed.

J	Peak, D; Guynes, CS				Peak, D; Guynes, CS			The IT alignment planning process	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						IT alignment planning; critical success factors; strategic planning; information quality; visualization and color		In 1998, the Information Technology Division (ITD) of Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) jointly developed an IT Alignment Planning Model with their Energy Services Unit. The model helped identify areas of information concern, resulted in the prioritized development of IT strategies, and served as a pilot for the corporate-wide implementation of the IT Alignment Planning process. The IT Alignment Planning process was then applied to the five OPPD business units, giving management a view of Information Concerns and possible solutions. By tying the planning process directly to each business unit's Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in their strategic plans, IT Alignment Planning presented a strategic view of information and IT systems, products, and services across the corporation. The process also provided input into strategic and tactical planning processes, and considered the effects of competition on the objective of improving information quality for IT clients.

US Natl Sci Fdn				Research partnerships are not a new organizational form, but since the mid 1980s the US government, like other national governments, has provided a favorable environment for them to flourish. The purpose of this paper is to address the question: What is the economic foundation upon which public support of research partnerships in the USA is based? In addition, given that foundation: What additional information is needed to increase the efficacy of the current policy environment? We summarize the relevant literature and find that as a whole, the theoretical literature makes clear that research partnerships are a socially beneficial organizational form once formed. However, more empirical research is needed of a different type that has occupied the journals to date. We offer an agenda for such research that will complement the policy process.

Focuses on problems facing business operations and how to improve the situation. Presents the views of purchasing personnel from public and private organizations and of students taking purchasing and supply chain management courses. Discovers that purchasing has not been recognized as a profession, which has led to lack of motivation in purchasing sections' personnel. Further, purchasing policies on external relationships and image are non-existent in most organizations. Claims that managers need to change their thinking about the purchasing and supply function - to see it as strategic and not clerical; and purchasing and supplies personnel require training in supply chain management.

Data on 77 health service organizations were collected from case studies and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) documents. Organizations were scored according to environmental, strategy making, organization/structure variables and financial success. Three individuals with health care experience were provided detailed instructions and were asked to independently rate the 77 organizations relative to the variables. The financial success variable was separately rated by a third individual with extensive finance and health care expertise. Five financially successful and five financially less successful configurations were identified and described according to their major characteristics. The configurations were limited and consistent with configuration studies in industries other than health care with a few noteworthy exceptions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

A firm can handle market-and technology-driven uncertainties if its repertoire of knowledge and competencies is expanded continuously, and its ability to exploit such a repertoire is correspondingly improved. Hence, we examine in this study how competence-based adaptability affects the level of innovativeness, and how internal and external strategic postures influence this interplay. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence for a positive association between adaptability and innovativeness. This interplay is significantly influenced by the underlying mechanism of a firm's dominant business logic and environmental uncertainty. Thus, companies are able to improve success in new product development and commercialisation, by enhancing their ability to adapt to constantly changing environmental conditions, in line with the dominant business logic utilised.

If farmers do not comply with this system they will be taxed, which could constitute a threat to the financial viability of their farms. This paper presents the results of a multi-case study approach to explore the ways in which dairy farms cope strategically, tactically and operationally with the introduction of MINAS. Using three-year panel data from 72 farms and the results of an interactive workshop, propositions regarding nutrient management decisions were formulated and tested. In general, the most environmentally and cost-effective order of nutrient management optimization proved to be: (1) the optimization of production through more accurate management (operational level), (2) the reduction of inputs (tactical level), and (3) a re-evaluation of farm intensity (strategic level). Even though MINAS constitutes a significant change in the external environment of farms it does not cause farmers to alter their strategy. The large variation found in the ways farmers choose to cope with nutrient management problems on their farm appeared to be related to factors like preferences and competencies. These factors affect the choices farmers make to deal with environmental problems.

J	Montagno, R; Sexton, RS; Smith, BN				Montagno, R; Sexton, RS; Smith, BN			Using neural networks for identifying organizational improvement strategies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						neural networks; strategic planning; artificial intelligence; genetic algorithms	GENETIC ALGORITHM; BACKPROPAGATION	The struggle to remain competitive in the global marketplace occupies much of the energy of today's firms. Although there are many performance improvement strategies that can be implemented by an organization, it is yet to be determined which strategy or combination of these strategies, if any, is most helpful in improving performance. A genetic algorithm trained neural network is used to identify such combinations to provide direction to managers as to which performance improvement strategies are associated with increases in performance as reported by operations managers. This study shows that this neural network approach can identify combinations that result in better approximations of performance, as compared to standard statistical techniques, and should be considered as an appropriate tool for performance improvement strategy selection.

However, whilst quantitative modeling has been widely used in other fields, it has not been considered enough in the field of software process improvement. During the last decade software process simulation has been used to address a wide diversity of management problems. Some of these problems are related to strategic management, technology adoption, understanding, training and learning, and risk management, among others. In this work a dynamic integrated framework for software process improvement is presented. This framework combines traditional estimation models with an intensive utilization of dynamic simulation models of the software process. The aim of this framework is to support a qualitative and quantitative assessment for software process improvement and decision making to achieve a higher software development process capability according to the Capability Maturity Model. The concepts underlying this framework have been implemented in a software process improvement tool that has been used in a local software organization.

J	Schwartz, RW; Cohn, KH				Schwartz, RW; Cohn, KH			The necessity for physician involvement in strategic planning in healthcare organizations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Challenges in Surgical Education	MAY 08-09, 2002	LOUISVILLE, KY			strategy; business; physicians; strategic planning	PERFORMANCE; HOSPITALS	Strategic planning is necessary in health care organizations to meet the constraints of a lean economy, rapidly changing technologies, and an unprecedented need to provide quality services at affordable prices. It offers a structure for assessing core strengths and environmental conditions and an innovative approach to enhance revenue and minimize costs. During the planning process, organizations define their mission, identify direction, develop a unified approach, prioritize long- and short-term goals, assign accountability, and allocate financial resources. Effective strategic planning is a continuous process and becomes an integral part of an organization's culture. Implementation is a part of strategy formulation, because future insights arise from current operating experiences. Success depends on buy-in from stakeholders, including physicians, nurses, and managers. The invested effort can offer the rewards of management that is pioactive rather than crisis driven.

J	Stewart, LJ; Greisler, D				Stewart, LJ; Greisler, D			Measuring primary care practice performance within an integrated delivery system: A case study	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This article examines the use of an integrated performance measurement system to plan and control primary care service delivery within an integrated delivery system. We review a growing body of literature that focuses on the development and implementation of management reporting systems among healthcare providers. Our study extends the existing literature by examining the use of performance information generated by an integrated performance measurement system within a healthcare organization. We conduct our examination through a case study of the WMG Primary Care Medicine Group, the primary care medical group practice of WellSpan Health System. WellSpan Health System is an integrated delivery system that serves south central Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. Our study examines the linkage between WellSpan Health's strategic objectives and its primary care medicine group's integrated performance measurement system. The conceptual design of this integrated performance measurement system combines financial metrics with practice management and clinical operating metrics to provide a more complete picture of medical group performance. Our findings demonstrate that WellSpan Health was able to achieve superior financial results despite a weak linkage between its integrated performance measurement system and its strategic objectives. WellSpan Health achieved this objective for its primary care medicine group by linking clinical performance information to physician compensation and reporting practice management performance through the use of statistical process charts. They found that the combined mechanisms of integrated performance measurement and statistical process control charts improved organizational learning and communications between organizational stakeholders.

J	Nemati, HR; Barko, CD				Nemati, HR; Barko, CD			Enhancing enterprise decisions through organizational data mining	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Organizational Data Mining (ODM) is defined as leveraging data mining (DM) tools and technologies to enhance the decision-making process by transforming data into valuable and actionable knowledge to gain a strategic competitive advantage. Presently, the majority of ODM projects focus on customers and profitability, such as customer segmentation, time-dependence studies, customer retention and attrition management, risk forecasting, and profitability analysis (5). This article defines and elaborates on the purpose, utility and industry status of ODM and how organizations are benefiting from it through enhanced enterprise decision-making. To better understand the current status of this dynamic and evolving industry and the issues shaping it, a study was conducted. The study identifies current technical and business issues related to ODM projects and how they influence organizational decisions. ne results of the survey suggest that ODM can improve the quality and accuracy of decisions for any organization willing to make the investment.

Seven strategic groups were identified using grouping variables such as size, vertical integration, operating efficiency, differentiation, and pricing. There appears to be a relation between group membership and financial performance in this market. It is interesting to note that the results indicate neither size nor vertical integration was related to a programmer's financial performance.

J	Trundle, CM; Farrington, M; Anderson, L; Redpath, CK				Trundle, CM; Farrington, M; Anderson, L; Redpath, CK			GRASPing infection: a workload measurement tool for infection control nurses	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION			English	Article						personnel management; workload; personnel staffing and scheduling; infection control; infection control practitioner		The GRASP (R) nursing workload management system was used over a five-month period by both the infection control nurses (ICNs) in an infection control team (ICT) in a 1200-bedded university teaching hospital trust. GRASP data were used to quantify and qualify patient and Trust requirements for infection control (IC). The results indicated that care was being prioritised as the average daily patient care requirement was 15.9 h, whereas the ICNs were only able to provide 12.7 h to meet this. Infection control nurses spent 5.3 h dealing with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and only 3.9 h in preparation and delivery of education. A 'fire brigade service' was being provided at the expense of developmental and strategic issues. GRASP provided a method of quantifying, recording and analysing workload. It was used to support recommendations from the Health Quality Service Organizational Audit (Kings Fund), the Department of Health (DoH), the National Audit Office (NAO), and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) for an increased focus on education and risk management in IC. It was also used in a skill-mix exercise, and resulted in the appointment of additional staffing to the ICT. GRASP data could be used for benchmarking with other institutions to provide a flexible system which may be adapted to meet the changing demands of the health service. It provides a means for ICNs to measure and manage their workload, and may be adapted to other members of the ICT. (C) 2001 The Hospital Infection Society.

J	Lankford, BA				Lankford, BA			Red routes on blue rivers: Strategic water management for the Ruaha river basin, Tanzania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Allocation of water in river basins not only requires the setting of targets of water supply to different users, but also the establishment of appropriate strategies to achieve those targets, As an example of this, 'red routes'-an idea taken from a plan used in the city of London to ensure free-flowing traffic on key arterial routes-is proposed for the Ruaha basin in Tanzania. The paper argues that allocation of water is best achieved by managing key rivers (red routes), rather than all rivers, and by concentrating on part of rather than the whole annual calendar. In this way, the principle of 'zoning' is employed to utilize comparative advantages found in some rivers and not in others. This strategic approach selects from the main theories of water management: command and control, technical, economic and community-based activities. It also uses, in part, a rural-livelihoods justification for re-allocation. This strategic approach fits the hydrological situation of both use and supply of water and has clear objectives in mind, proposing management activities necessary to deliver the objectives.

J	Chinowsky, PS				Chinowsky, PS			Strategic management in engineering organizations	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The traditional philosophy of management in organizations that focus on the built environment, both in the public and private sector, places great emphasis on the ability to plan and execute projects. In contrast, a similar emphasis on strategic management has received less attention in this context. This paper introduces a comparative study of the current strategic management practices in public and private organizations that are responsible for constructing the built environment. The paper introduces the areas that organizations must address to compete in the face of changing customer and competitor conditions. A summary of a comparative survey conducted on firms in the construction industry is documented together with the background research that prompted the investigation of these topics.

J	Martin, G; Woldring, K				Martin, G; Woldring, K			Ready for the mantle? Australian human resource managers as stewards of ethics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business ethics; HRM role; Australia; management education; organizational ethics programmes; HRM profession		In recent years in Australia, interest in business ethics has increased among managers, management educators and the public who observe the behaviour of organizations. This has been reflected in the literature of management education by an increased attention to the ethical implications of management practice. In parallel, human resources management in Australia has continued to evolve as a field, and to press its claims as a profession. This is reflected by ongoing debate in the literature about the HRM role. Advocates of an expanded role for HRM claim that HRM initiatives and practices have a strategic impact on organizations, and should accordingly be recognized at senior management levels. However, these claims for an expanded role for HRM have not been accompanied by an increased discussion of the ethical implications of the HRM role. The need for such discussion is highlighted by a survey of HR managers in Australia, which found a high level of disagreement among HR managers on a wide range of ethical issues. Even where questions related to perceptions of fact rather than the expression of attitudes, a high level of disagreement was revealed. If this is the case, it should not be taken for granted that there is a ready consensus among HR managers when it comes to translating ethical principles into organizational practice. The importance of this conclusion is indicated by another finding of the study: where organizations have undertaken initiatives on ethics, there is a high degree of involvement by HR staff.

Career management, recruitment, training and compensation are chosen in order to highlight some French specificities. An evaluation of the HR function indicates that it should move towards a strategic role. A move towards people management is also perceived. At the beginning of the 2000s, HRM in France exhibits five main trends summed up in this article.

Potential plans for the future of a small Indiana hospital were formulated and Q sorted to determine support or resistance by key leaders from within hospital management, the board, and the medical staff. The hospital was able to identify stakeholder perceptions that resulted in strong consensus that integration should be a priority for the hospital. This exercise provided a list of objectives for hospital leadership and the results were also used to justify the cessation of several programs that the hospital leadership had been pursuing.

The data document a large and growing lack of supply to meet current and future demand. Demographic factors-including the number of university students, their selection of majors, and retirements among IS faculty-favor a probable scenario for continuing strong demand for IS faculty in the longer term. We argue that the severe imbalance will continue if the current state of the economy and businesses' need for technically-savvy managers continues. Implications and recommendations are presented for ensuring the long-term health of the IS discipline in addressing this imbalance.

J	Hertog, JK				Hertog, JK			Elite press coverage of the 1986 US-Libya conflict: A case study of tactical and strategic critique	JOURNALISM & MASS COMMUNICATION QUARTERLY			English	Article							PERSIAN-GULF-WAR; PANAMA INVASION; STATES	This research tests the effects of press professionalism, administration press management, and public patriotism on coverage of the 1986 U.S.-Libya crisis by the Associated Press, Washington Post, New York Times, nad Los Angeles Times. Patterns of "tactical" (small-scale, efficiency-oriented) and "strategic" ( overarching, ethical) critique during periods of low-, medium-, and high-intensity conflict are reviewed. Tactical opposition to both the Reagan administration and the Qaddafi regime slightly outweighs support, while strategic critique of 65 percent pro- Reagan administration but only 14 percent pro-Qaddafi regime. Support foe the U.S. administration declines during intense conflict. The pattern of findings supports administration press management.

J	Jan, TS; Jan, CG				Jan, TS; Jan, CG			Development of weapon systems in developing countries: a case study of long range strategies in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						weapon systems; system dynamics; R&D; R&D capability; long-range strategy	IMPROVEMENT; INVESTMENT; KNOWLEDGE; QUALITY	A long period of economic and industrial development has allowed developing countries to evolve into newly industrialised countries (NICs). Simultaneously, the development of their major weapon systems has evolved from foreign weapons acquisition to independent development due to establishing research and development (R&D) capabilities. However, competitive pressures in the international arms market has finally led these countries to return to foreign acquisition, consequently rapidly eroding their R&D capability. Balancing foreign acquisition and independent development is a long-term strategic problem for NICs. This study applies the system dynamics methodology to construct a weapon systems development model for Taiwan. This model is used to analyse the impact of acquisition policy.

J	Wood, G; Els, C				Wood, G; Els, C			The making and remaking of HRM: the practice of managing people in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						international HRM; HRM practice; personnel; international business		This paper explores the nature of human resource management (HRM) practice in the Border region of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, located within contemporary local and international debates regarding the content and nature thereof Four distinct patterns of practice were identified. The first represented a simple changing in nomenclature of the relevant personnel sections, with, in several cases, staff being seen not as managers, bur rather as a distinct, and somewhat junior, category of employee. In the second category, the traditional personnel function was broadened to encompass clearly delineated areas such as training and development. In the third category, while HRM practitioners did play an important strategic role, this was more in terms of facilitating the adoption of progressive industrial relations policies, than in developing a vision for managing human resources across the organization. In all cases, what human resource practitioners did seemed somewhat removed from the 'conventional wisdom' definition of HRM. In part this was a result of the persistence of effective and militant trade unions, necessitating the adoption of hybrid HR-industrial relations practices. However. it also represented a product of particular managerial traditions, and the fact that HRM represents a complex package of concepts and practices, which, inevitably, are subject to adjustment in the light of prevailing realities. This study sheds further light on the diverse and multi-faceted area of HRM practice, and underscores the need for flexibility and pragmatism in both transitional, and, indeed, mature economic contexts.

J	Moussa, FM				Moussa, FM			Determinants, process, and consequences of personal goals and performance	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting of the National-Academy-of-Management	AUG, 1998	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA	Natl Acad Management			SELF-SET GOALS; TASK-PERFORMANCE; MONETARY INCENTIVES; ASSIGNED GOAL; COMMITMENT; DIFFICULTY; LEVEL; EXPECTANCY; EFFICACY; CHOICE	A significant two-way interaction between self-set goal level instructions (an instruction given to subjects to set hard, easy, or any goals) and methods of payment (straight piece-rate, differential piece-rate with goal attainment step bonus, and hourly flat rare) in influencing personal goals, subsequent personal goals, and goal valences was found. The highest level of personal goals was set under straight piece-rate (pay for performance) in which self-set hard goal instructions were given. In addition, goal valences were Sound to partially mediate the interactive effects of methods of payment and self-set goal level instructions on personal goals. Furthermore, personal goals were found to: (1) completely mediate the effects of goal valences on performance; and (2) completely mediate the main effects of self-set goal level instructions-as well as the interactive effects of both self-set goal level instructions and methods of payment-on subsequent personal goals. This research sheds light on the determinants, process, and consequences of personal goals and performance and shows that organizational contextual variables such as the reward systems and instructions to choose goals of a certain level significantly interact to influence personal goals, subsequent personal goals, and goal valences.

J	Gadhoum, Y				Gadhoum, Y			Potential effects of managers' entrenchment and shareholdings on competitiveness	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						competitiveness; ownership structure; blockholders; management entrenchment	EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; OWNERSHIP; STRATEGY; MARKET; PERFORMANCE; TAKEOVERS; MERGERS	Previous studies on competitiveness have examined either broad macroeconomic factors such as financial/economic systems, infrastructure, exports and imports, and cultural/social values, or common microeconomic factors such as cost or product differentiation position, economies or scale/scope, and employee education and motivation as determinants of competitiveness. However, there is very little conceptual or theoretical literature, explicitly dealing with the influence of managers personal objectives such as power, status, perquisite seeking and risk reduction on corporate strategy and hence on firm competitiveness. This paper offers a first attempt to focus on ownership structure and management entrenchment (self-serving, risk-avoidance, and short term commitment) as the key factors that contribute to or impede firm competitiveness. Using parametric and non parametric tests on a sample of 600 Canadian listed firms, the study implications point to the influence of blockholders in reducing management waste, preventing asymmetric information, and obtaining more cash distributions in an effort to ensure efficiency and positively affect the strategic development of a firm.

J	Iacobucci, D; Neelamegham, R; Hopkins, N				Iacobucci, D; Neelamegham, R; Hopkins, N			Measurement quality issues in dyadic models of relationships	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							INTERRATER AGREEMENT; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; DIRECTED-GRAPHS; MISCLASSIFICATION	Interpersonal relationships are an important and integral part of numerous social science research agendas. Analytical tools have been created in the last 10 years that model dyadic interactions. In particular, this article focuses on the dyadic models of Fienberg and Wasserman [Fienberg, S.E., Wasserman, S., 1981. Categorical data analysis of single sociometric relations. In: Leinhardt, S. (Ed.), Sociological Methodology. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco.], Holland and Leinhardt [Holland, P.W., Leinhardt, S., 1981. An exponential family of probability densities for directed graphs. Journal of the American Statistical Association 76 (1981) 33-51.], Iacobucci and Wasserman [Iacobucci, D., Wasserman, S., 1988. A general framework for the statistical analysis of sequential dyadic interaction data Psychological Bulletin 103 (1988) 379-390.] and Wasserman and Iacobucci [Wasserman, S., Iacobucci, D., 1986. Statistical analysis of discrete relational data. British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology 39 (1986) 41-64.]. However, measurement issues like reliability and validity, as discussed by Alien and Yen [Allen, M.J., Yen, W.M., 1979. Introduction to Measurement Theory. Brooks/Cole, Monterey, CA, 1979.], Nunnally [Nunnally, J., 1978. Psychometric Theory, 2nd edn. McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 1978.] and Uebersax [Uebersax, J.S., 1988. Validity inferences from interobserver agreement. Psychological Bulletin 104 (1988) 405-416.], have not been considered in conjunction with these models, and little is known about the empirical performance of the dyadic models under sub-optimal measurement quality conditions. We offer two essential approaches to ascertaining the level of measurement error in the observed indicators of social ties and relationships. The first approach combines latent class and social network models in one integrated framework: and allows for the simultaneous study of measurement and dyadic structural issues. The second approach is an alternative that may be more useful to social science researchers, both because the method is more accessible and because researchers could apply the techniques to data they have already partially analyzed. This approach is a two-staged procedure whereby in the first stage, a probability model based on latent class analysis is estimated which provides an indication of the measurement quality in the data In the second stage, traditional social network models are estimated. To investigate the implications of different levels of measurement error for interpreting the nature of the network ties and the dyadic parametric performance, we also designed a Monte Carlo experiment. Measurement error is simulated as the likelihood of a binary relational choice (for simplicity) being inaccurately classified, where incorrect diagnoses can result from poor interitem agreement (i.e., unreliability) or poor interrater agreement. The simulation can be used by researchers in combination with the two-stage approach. The results of the simulation provide guidelines for situations when social network models can withstand a reasonable degree of sub-optimal measurement quality and highlight adverse conditions which can significantly affect the performance of the modeling approach. Further, the simulation shows that sample size assists in reducing the chances of making Type II errors, but it does not compensate for biases in parameter estimates in the presence of increasing error. Finally, the measurement and dyadic analytical methods are applied to a real dataset describing interorganizational relational activity using multiple raters. Recommendations are offered to guide the researcher in making decisions about research design when using dyadic models. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mosakowski, E; Zaheer, S				Mosakowski, E; Zaheer, S			The global configuration of a speculative trading operation: An empirical study of foreign exchange trading	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						global strategy; firm boundaries; informational assets; speculation; multinational firm	ECONOMIC-THEORY; METEOR-SHOWERS; HEAT WAVES; KNOW-HOW; MARKET; INFORMATION; CAPABILITIES; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; FIRM	This paper proposes a theory of firm boundaries based on foreknowledge development and exploitation in speculative or "informed" trading. Foreign exchange trading provides this study's empirical context. From research on information economics, we suggest optimal speculative trading operations are multiunit and globally dispersed. Alternatively, transaction cost economics suggests atomistic actors prevail in the market for fungible commodities like currencies. We also develop competing hypotheses about information technology's effects on foreign exchange trading operations. Speculation arguments predict that the global scope of trading operations will expand after the introduction of generic information technologies. Transaction cost economics proposes that, when atomistic actors do not prevail, trading operations will contract after this introduction. We test competing predictions with models of the expansion, contraction, and net change in a firm's global dispersion. We estimate these models with data from the population of banks worldwide engaged in interbank foreign exchange currency (FX) trading from 1974 to 1993. Our results uncover two types of firms: those that approach the atomistic actor of transaction cost economics, and those that resemble the globally dispersed multiunit configuration from our speculation discussion. These results encourage reflection on how the theory of the firm differs when firms trade to produce versus speculate.

J	Klemz, BR				Klemz, BR			Using genetic algorithms to assess the impact of pricing activity timing	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						market structure; marketing strategy; marketing mix timing; genetic algorithms	NEURAL NETWORKS; COMPETITION; SYSTEMS	Current methods of assessing competitive structure from aggregate sales data, such as the estimating of marketing mix elasticities, offer insight into the magnitude and direction of competitive actions. However, this level of analysis offers no insight into the impact that the timing of such mix activity has on one's market share. In this research, I illustrate a method of assessing market structure by utilizing the timing of competitive mix activity. Specifically, using a genetic algorithm approach, I estimate marketing mix timing rules for a consumer product market. This research illustrates the ability of these marketing mix timing rules to assess the impact that the timing of competitive mix activity has on one's market share. In addition, I show that these marketing mix timing rules offer strategic insight that can complement existing methods of assessing competitors using aggregate sales data, such as elasticity analysis, thereby improving the brand manager's understanding of the competitive structure of the market.

J	Smith, TS; Stevens, GT				Smith, TS; Stevens, GT			The architecture of small networks: Strong interaction and dynamic organization in small social systems	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	92nd Annual Meeting of the American-Sociological-Association	AUG 09-13, 1997	TORONTO, CANADA	Amer Sociol Assoc			ATTACHMENT; PSYCHOLOGY	A new theoretical model of social interaction, conceptualized here as a hyperstructure, provides the basis for simulation experiments designed to explore the network effects of high frequency social dynamics, or strong interactions. Based on neurophysiological discoveries of brain-behavior mechanisms at work in attachment, the theoretical model provides a nonreductionistic understanding of how biological forces constrain social interaction and yield effects that propagate beyond dyads into wider social networks. The network effects of the model are equivalent to patterns long recognized in sociological research on personal networks, showing that the model can reproduce empirically familiar and sometimes surprising bottom-up discoveries about network dynamics. Additionally, the model provides sociological theory with a straightfoward computational approach to discovering how deep structural principles at work in all complex systems also yield a social architecture-specifically, how a system/subsystem architecture; first described by Herbert Simon, emerges when strong interactions partition persons into naturally occurring subsystems.

J	Avella, L				Avella, L			Focal points in manufacturing strategic planning in Spain - Comparison with American and other European manufacturers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Spain; operations management; manufacturing; competition; strategy		The aim of this work is to analyse the manufacturing strategies of the large Spanish industrial companies during the 1990s, making a comparison with the experience of American and other European manufacturers. To this end, and taking 1994 as a reference, this paper describes the planning process and content of Be manufacturing strategies of a representative sample of the largest industrial companies in Spain, analysing, in particular the high priority manufacturing objectives and policies maintained during the period 1992-1993 and those foreseen for the period 1995-1999 The information analysed has been obtained from a mail survey. The comparison of the Spanish companies with American and other European manufacturers attempts to observe how the Spanish experience is similar to that of other countries, in order to obtain interesting conclusions for the managers who may be responsible for managing industrial companies located in Spain.

J	Kaye, L				Kaye, L			Strategic human resources management in Australia: the human cost	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER			English	Article						strategy; human resource management; Australia; organizational change; planning; competitive advantage	PERFORMANCE	Strategic human resource management (HRM) is increasingly being used to indicate a system-wide intervention that links HRM to strategic Planning and cultural change. However, what may be inadvertently occurring is a reinforcing of the use of the "hard" model of HRM, one that prioritises "management" aspects above "human" aspects of the discipline. Competitive business strategies may be improving the bottom line of a company, but they are hurting many individuals, especially when workers are being viewed as a commodity in a labour market. The Australian experience suggests that strategic HRM is not particularly people focused and has led to greater job insecurity and lower job satisfaction. If the current intent of strategic HRM is to strategise in conjunction with an organization's business direction, then if needs to be reconceptualised to acknowledge the human endeavour of organizations. This will require a broadening of the perspective of strategic HRM.

J	Pietersma, D; Lacroix, R; Wade, KM				Pietersma, D; Lacroix, R; Wade, KM			A framework for the development of computerized management and control systems for use in dairy farming	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						dairy cattle; management and control activities; decision-support systems; computerized systems	DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEM; HIGH PRODUCING HERDS; EXPERT-SYSTEM; INFORMATION; DESIGN	Computerized information systems can potentially help the dairy producer to deal with the increased complexity of decision making and availability of information in dairy farming. These systems, however, should be fully integrated to ensure a coordinated execution of dairy farming activities. A framework was developed, therefore, to support the creation of computerized management and control systems in dairy farming. Within this framework, a management and control system was defined as a network consisting of the management and control activities and the information flows that are involved in dairy farming. The management and control activities consist of a cycle of decision making, implementation, and assessment. These activities were classified according to level (strategic, tactical, operational, or regulatory) and sphere (breeding, health, nutrition, environment, milk production, fixed assets, labor, or finance). These activities can be performed by human beings or automated systems that are located on or off the farm. A large amount of information exchange exists among these management and control activities, between the overall management and control system, and between the physical farm environment and external agents. The interdependence among decisions at the various levels and spheres necessitates computerized management and control systems that are integrated and that support the exchange of information. The developed framework should facilitate the creation of such systems and could also act as a reference base for the analysis and improvement of existing dairy farm information systems.

J	Korpela, J; Tuominen, M; Valoaho, M				Korpela, J; Tuominen, M; Valoaho, M			An analytic hierarchy process-based approach to the strategic management of logistic service: An empirical study in the mechanical forest industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						customer service; analytic hierarchy process; logistics strategic management		Customer service is increasingly being recognised as a source of competitive advantage. The keys to provide effective customer service are determining the customer needs accurately, and meeting and exceeding the needs in a consistent manner. Companies should adapt a strategic, proactive focus on customer service based on understanding customers' own logistic processes and designing the logistics system to meet their needs. The ultimate objective is to create value for the customers by enabling them to achieve their own objectives more efficiently. In the paper, we approach customer service from a logistics point of view. We present a framework based on using the Analytic Hierarchy Process for strategically managing logistics service consisting of the following steps: (1) dividing the customers into logistically distinct businesses (LDBs), (2) assessing the strategic importance of the customers, (3) analysing the importance of the logistics service elements for the customers, (4) benchmarking own performance against competitors, (5) analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the own company, (6) defining logistics service plans for the LDBs, and (7) reviewing the implementation of the plans and making the needed adjustments. The use of the developed framework is demonstrated with a real application, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Choe, JM; Lee, YH; Park, KC				Choe, JM; Lee, YH; Park, KC			The relationship model between the influence factors and the strategic applications of information systems	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; SMALL BUSINESS; TECHNOLOGY; MIS; MANAGEMENT; SUCCESS; ORGANIZATION; CONTEXT	In previous studies, some researchers empirically suggested the influence factors on the strategic applications of information systems (IS). However, they did not empirically prove the effects of the relationships among the influence factors on the strategic applications of IS. The objectives of this study are to examine these relationships and to identify the moderating effects of support factors on the relationship between the facilitators of alignment and the strategic applications level of IS. For this study, the research model explaining the relationships among influence factors and strategic applications level was developed. The results suggested that there is significant positive correlation between perceived environmental uncertainty and facilitators of alignment. The intervening effect of alignment facilitators and the moderating effects of support factors were also proved. Based on the empirical results, the roles or functions of influence factors and the managerial implications are proposed.

J	Reagans, R				Reagans, R			Differences in social difference: examining third party effects on relational stability	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Sunbelt Social Network Conference	FEB 22-25, 1996	CHARLESTON, SC				NETWORK	In this paper, I examine the effect that the difference in racial heritage between two actors has on the stability of their social tie. I assume that there is a negative association between cross-race relations and relational stability. I examine the extent to which this negative association is rooted in the interpersonal dynamics within the relation itself or in the pressures derived from third party actors associated with the focal actors. I find that race matters. Cross-race relations are more fragile than comparable same-race relations. However, I find that race matters most when a focal alter is a racial isolate in an individual's social network. I conclude that the negative association between cross-race relations and relational stability is rooted in dynamics around the relation with the racial isolate and not within the relation itself.

J	Cox, B; Ghoneim, S				Cox, B; Ghoneim, S			Strategic use of EDI in the public sector: the HMSO case study	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						strategic systems; electronic data interchange; public sector; systems integration	ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE; ADVANTAGE	There has been widespread academic discussion in recent years on the potential of information systems to provide organisations with a strategic advantage. To this debate has recently been added a further controversy, i.e. the extent to which information systems (EDI in particular) and the concept of business network redesign are compatible. The aim of this paper is to contribute to these debates, by arguing that the implementation of EDI may still provide strategic advantage to an organisation, but is dependent upon the industry sector in which the organisation is operating, its position within that sector, the dynamics of the market place, its ability to build on its existing strengths and its ability to exploit the available technology innovatively. Support for these arguments is provided by documenting the case of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO), where the implementation of EDI has resulted in financial gains estimated at between pound 5 million and pound 10 million per annum since 1993. This has been achieved through the integration of EDI with the corporate strategy and results from a process re-design programme reflecting the changing environment of the British public sector. The paper also explores how the traditional role of EDI as a document exchange system has been extended to that of systems' integrator and corporate change agent, thus facilitating future business and technical change requirements.

The indications for teicoplanin use are now established as: early use in clinically infected patients; as a second-line agent for sensitive pathogens; and in primary antibiotic failures. Teicoplanin should not be used as empirical therapy in fevers of unknown origin; neither should teicoplanin be used as prophylaxis (the situations of infection in chemotherapy patients or for Hickman catheter insertion in particular are discussed). Comparative studies versus vancomycin have shown teicoplanin to be equally effective and to be well tolerated. Teicoplanin's good safety profile and ease of use make it particularly useful for non-inpatient therapy. Problems are posed for both glycopeptides by specific resistant pathogens, although these pathogens are currently not common. Haematologists must be aware of, and guard against, abuse of the glycopeptides in their own and other fields, including oral gut decontamination, the treatment of Clostridium difficile and veterinary use.

J	Brewer, DD				Brewer, DD			No associative biases in the first name cued recall procedure for eliciting personal networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							GENERAL SOCIAL SURVEY; COMMUNITY; MEMORY; ACQUAINTANCES; PATTERNS	One thousand five hundred twenty-five respondents from a representative sample of adult residents of the state of Florida (USA) participated in a telephone survey on personal networks (McCarty et al., 1995). McCarty et al. (1995) elicited samples of alters from respondents' personal networks with a first name cued recall interview procedure. This paper reports an assessment of associative biases involved with this technique in a further evaluation of the representativeness of the alter samples elicited with this method. Associative biases would be present if successively recalled alters are more likely to know each other or belong to the same social context (e.g., work, family, school) than alters not recalled successively. Such biases, if present, could influence the characteristics, and thus the representativeness, of the set of alters elicited, such as the density of ties. Analyses indicate that there are no associative biases in the first name cued recall procedure. Future research should investigate the possibility of associative biases in other methods for eliciting personal networks. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Green, A; Rana, M; Ross, D; Thunhurst, C				Green, A; Rana, M; Ross, D; Thunhurst, C			Health planning in Pakistan: A case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health Planning; Pla systems; Pakistan		Health planning is an essential function of the state. For it to be successful, a number of conditions need to be satisfied. In particular it needs to be flexible, participative and integrated with other decision processes. Despite some strengths, the health planning system in Pakistan has generally failed to provide the framework to allow such an approach. Links between strategic and operational planning have been weak; decisionmaking has been very centralized; there has been a lack of functional clarity; the respective roles of bureaucrats and politicians have been unclear; and, links between capital and recurrent budgets and between planning and implementation have been weak, As a result, there is a number of imbalances in the allocation of resources. The introduction of a revised health planning system for Pakistan is discussed. The constraints on such a system and an initial assessment of its success are presented.

J	Russ, M; Camp, SM				Russ, M; Camp, SM			Strategic alliances and technology transfer: An extended paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic alliances; technology transfer; conceptual framework	ARRANGEMENTS; COMPETITION; COOPERATION; VENTURES; FIRMS; KEY	Going beyond the classic options of purchase, research and development, and joint venture, strategic alliances have been described as a valuable means for acquiring new technology. Much of what is understood about technology acquisition is based on communications and information processing theory. Despite the intuitive similarities, however, researchers have generally failed to explore the linkages in theory and process between 1) establishing and maintaining strategic alliances, and 2) transferring technology. The purpose of this study is to develop a theoretical framework which is pertinent to advance the theory building in the areas of strategic alliances and technology transfer.

J	Tang, JE; Tang, MT				Tang, JE; Tang, MT			A study of information systems planning and its effectiveness in Taiwan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							KEY ISSUES; SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT; PERCEPTIONS	The main objectives of this research were to compare and contrast the findings of the relationships among different stages of information systems (IS) strategic planning, system planning, plan implementation, and IS effectiveness across various organizations in Taiwan. The intent was to take a broad look at the key concerns of IS planning across cultures. The relationships among three phases of planning (strategic planning, systems planning, and plan implementation), and their relationships with user satisfaction were examined. Five hypotheses are used to examine the relationships. The correlation analysis results support the following hypotheses: (1) the extent of IS systems planning is positively associated with the extent of IS strategic planning; (2) the extent of plan implementation is positively associated with the extent of IS systems planning; and (3) the extent of IS strategic planning is positively associated with the extent of user satisfaction. IS systems planning has no effect on user satisfaction. IS plan implementation has no relationship with user satisfaction.

J	Ayyar, RVV				Ayyar, RVV			Educational policy planning and globalisation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Oxford Conference on Education and Development	SEP 21-25, 1995	NEW COLLEGE, OXFORD, ENGLAND		NEW COLLEGE			These observations on policy and planning against the backdrop of globalisation are made from the perspective of a large, high population, developing country with considerable human resources and a federal democratic polity trying to liberalise its economy. Whether in the realms of products, ideas, culture or media, one notices two concurrent but opposing streams - homoegenisation and particularisation. This paradox is of great relevance while discussing the impact of globalisation on the policies as well as content and process of education. It is now universally accepted that during the stabilisation phase of structural adjustment, effective policies should be put in place to protect public expenditure on basic services, such as primary education, as an integral part, rather than ex-post. As the economics of education is not considered central to the discipline in the way trade or macroeconomics is, education is not part of the reform package. The increasing and multiple demands on education accentuate the policy-maker's dilemma, particularly in developing countries where the climate is of fiscal austerity, to find resources for education and ensure their optimal allocation among different stages of education. The stylised models postulating priorities with reference to levels of education development are no more relevant than deterministic theories of stages of growth. While alternatives to public funding can contribute significantly, education would continue to be heavily dependent on public exchequer. Financing policy should, therefore, encompass a mixture of reinforced and consistent measures to mobilise resources from multiple sources and simultaneously enhance the efficiency of resource use. Multiplicity, however, casts a heavy burden on the policy-maker. Economic analysis, an essential component of policy planning, often gives little guidance on policy implementation. It needs to be complemented by a sensitivity to the institutional and political settings which constrain policy choices and condition policy processes, and to the tensions inherent in steering the system towards the desired goals of policy changes. Education systems the world over are engulfed in crisis, but one which lacks immediacy and high visibility. Policy leadership lies in scanning the continuously changing environment, identifying the targets of opportunity to get the system do what is right, building a coalition of relevant groups, setting choices that minimise foot-dragging by the unenthusiastic and subversion by the opposed and continuing to retain leeway so that uncertainties are clarified over a period of time. The management of change thus is a process of iterative negotiations and the events are a result of the interplay of conflict and compromise among diverse interests. The outcomes are indeterminate and at variance to what is envisaged. Consequently, monitoring and evaluation need to have a bifocal vision, both longitudinal and cross-sectional, for assessing a process that is essentially probabilistic. It cannot rely on simplistic models of policy formulation and objectively verifiable indicators. In the area of basic education, there is agreement on what the goals should be and what the ideal strategies are. While what needs to be done is clear, how, or much of how, is not. Concepts like capacity building, process projects and participation are not self-executing. For implementing these essential strategies the antagonistic cooperation of a host of actors and modifications of the standard operating procedures of many organisations is called for. Different layers of government, teachers and teacher unions, resource organisations, NGOs and activists have important roles to play and have to be brought on board. The challenge in implementation lies in mastering the logistics of bringing the resources and actors together and of deploying them to achieve agreed goals. Though not recognised, negotiations are at the heart of most of these processes. In policy planning as well as implementation the task of combining the strategic vision with tactical decisions and responses to the emerging situation is formidable.

J	SLATER, JS; MCCUBBREY, DJ; SCUDDER, RA				SLATER, JS; MCCUBBREY, DJ; SCUDDER, RA			INSIDE AN INTEGRATED MBA - AN INFORMATION-SYSTEMS VIEW	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						IS EDUCATION; IS CURRICULUM; INTEGRATED MBA EDUCATION		This paper chronicles the evolution and content of an integrated MBA (IMBA) at the University of Denver and relates an IS-oriented view of the curriculum integration and teaching experience. The study emphasizes IS faculty efforts to integrate curricula from the traditional MIS course into three of the seven team-taught, interdisciplinary IMBA courses. Their teaching experiences illustrate pedagogy, and ensuing sections summarize student feedback and provide insights on what appears to work and what does not, as well as what remains to be done. A process is recommended to MIS faculty for infusing IS topics into an integrated curriculum. Gaining respect from other faculty for teaching the use and management of IT beyond its use for personal productivity, and incorporating IS into multiple class sections with scarce IS faculty resources are major problems. What appears to work best for MIS faculty is to attend curriculum discussions with (I) an appreciation of what IS/IT knowledge is essential for an MBA to (a) understand IS contributions to the solution of business problems and (b) participate in systems development activities to obtain (and later manage) IT applications; and (2) a willingness to look for opportunities to position IS/IT topics to complement other curricula.

J	RAMARAPU, NK; LADO, AA				RAMARAPU, NK; LADO, AA			LINKING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO GLOBAL BUSINESS STRATEGY TO GAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE - AN INTEGRATIVE MODEL	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							KEY ISSUES; ENTERPRISE; FRAMEWORK; BARRIERS	While information technology has been recognized as critically important for supporting global business strategy, the contingent relationships between salient dimensions of an information technology and key sources of competitive advantage have not been systematically explicated and discussed in the literature. Instead, a universal view of the role of information technology in developing competitive advantage for a firm is often adopted. Taking a contingency perspective, this paper more systematically examines the links among global business strategies, global information technologies (GIT) and competitive advantage within an integrative framework. Additionally, the issue of sustainability of GIT-based competitive advantages is addressed using the conceptual tool kits of the I/O (industrial organization)-based and resource-based theories of strategic management. The proposed conceptual model provides an encompassing framework for future research on the increasingly important topic of global information technology and its potential to generate competitive advantage for firms.

The results provide support for the theorized role of strategy in partially mediating the effects of the environment on organizational performance. The evidence suggests that, although firms can proactively respond to some forms of extended rivalry via the implementation of appropriate strategies, other conditions seem to be relatively intractable. Managerial insights are provided concerning the achievement qi competitive advantage over extended rivals via the utilization of particular generic strategies.

In term of Type I error and power, a z-test based on the difference between pooled estimators appears most accurate, while a confidence interval approach modified to permit testing between two mean effect sizes and Hedges and Olkin's (1985) chi-square test with one degree of freedom appear roughly equivalent, and each of these is superior to a z-test based on an r-transformation. The modified confidence interval approach has particular promise for graphical examination of presumed moderators in meta-analyses.

J	BUDROS, A				BUDROS, A			ANALYZING UNEXPECTED DENSITY-DEPENDENCE EFFECTS ON ORGANIZATIONAL BIRTHS IN NEW-YORK LIFE-INSURANCE INDUSTRY, 1842-1904	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						DENSITY DEPENDENCE; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; LIFE INSURANCE; ORGANIZATIONAL BIRTHS; ORGANIZATIONAL ECOLOGY	AMERICAN BREWING INDUSTRY; POPULATION ECOLOGY; EVOLUTION	Organizational ecologists argue that numbers of firms (density dependence) significantly affect industrial development. Rising numbers of firms are thought to legitimize a young industry, leading persons to launch new firms in the industry; but in a more crowded, older industry, increasing numbers of companies are expected to intensify competition, producing a decline in organizational births. Since this argument dominates ecological theory, results that challenge it must be explained. I identify six reasons for such results. Only a few of these explanations have been evaluated empirically and the ideas rarely have been assessed with respect to organizational births. Therefore, I address these explanations in order to resolve unexpected density dependence effects on foundings in New York's life insurance industry from 1842 to 1904. Measuring numbers of life insurance operators at both the state (New York) and national (U.S.) levels of analysis resolves the unexpected density dynamics in this study and produces a coherent pattern of density findings. Further, numbers of mutual savings banks and numbers of small life insurers in New York created competitive pressures in the life insurance business, leading persons to abandon carrier entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship also suffered when the life insurance industry was dominated by a few large sellers. More generally, the evidence shows that New York was divided into two insurance submarkets and that carrier organizers reacted to legitimation and competition trends in the submarket occupied by domestic insurers. I conclude that once we consider the reasons for unexpected density dynamics, the core model of density dependence offers a cogent explanation for industrial evolution.

In this paper we argue that the bilateral exchange between groups of buyers and sellers in adjacent markets should be made explicit. Within this bilateral context, the market for non-tactical Navy information systems is empirically examined. Strategic groups are developed for both seller and buyer industries, and the interaction between these groups are explored over time. In particular, two market interventions, the imposition of industrial funding procedures in 1984 and a Life-Cycle requirement order in 1988, were examined with respect to their impact on seller/customer exchanges and vertical integration strategies. Significant changes in strategies were noted, and explained within a transaction cost framework.

Verbal confrontation with the adversary was the most common strategy and usually preceded other approaches. Efforts to arrange mediation and arbitration were extremely rare, though third parties were approached for other reasons in most of the cases. It was possible to distinguish complainants from respondents in 61 percent of the cases. Respondents employed more problem solving and apology than complainants, while complainants employed marginally more pressure tactics.

J	WESTERN, B				WESTERN, B			UNIONIZATION AND LABOR-MARKET INSTITUTIONS IN ADVANCED CAPITALISM, 1950-1985	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES; TRADE-UNION GROWTH; DECLINE	This article examines the dependence of unionization on labor market institutions and long-run trends in inflation, unemployment, and the sectoral composition of the labor force in 18 OECD countries. The large number of contending explanations highlights the difficulty in comparative sociology of drawing confident conclusions when there are few cases to compare. This problem is addressed through diverse evidence-a review of the comparative historical record and a time-series analysis-to form a Bayesian prior distribution, which is combined with a cross-sectional data set to sharpen conventional estimates of economic and institutional effects. This analysis indicates working-class organization in trade unions expanded in the postwar period where labor acquired an institutional influence over capitalist labor markets.

J	BORGATTI, SP; EVERETT, MG				BORGATTI, SP; EVERETT, MG			ECOLOGICAL AND PERFECT COLORINGS	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							EXCHANGE NETWORKS; POWER; ROLES	A recent study (Hummon and Carley 1992) has indicated that one of the main research paths in the discipline of social networks is the study of roles and positions. Several key positional concepts have been elucidated, including regular colorings (White and Reitz 1983), automorphic colorings (Everett 1985), and structural colorings (Lorrain and White 1971). Regular colorings in particular have been seen as formalizations of the intuitive concept of social role. However, in this paper we suggest that regular colorings only incorporate one half of the intuitive role concept. The other half, which we formalize as ecological colorings, is equally important. We therefore introduce perfect colorings, which are both regular and ecological, and are consequently more complete models of the role concept. Perfect colorings have a number of interesting mathematical properties, which we describe briefly.

Organizational information management strategies	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						information management; information systems planning; information systems strategy; strategic information systems planning		Information technology is a key factor in competitiveness. Business managers increasingly have to make decisions in this field. Their involvement in planning and decision making should be active and genuine. There are numerous methods to support information systems planning and implementation. This study focuses on the organizational approach to generating plans. An interactive framework for evolutionary information systems planning is presented together with the results of applying this framework in six organizations. The author has been working with these organizations very intensively, using an action research approach. The main emphasis is on the success of the organizational method of creating information management strategies. The main finding is that an interactive way of generating strategies is not enough. The role of internal 'project champions' in both planning and implementation is extremely important. Outside facilitators cannot replace their contribution.

J	LEE, GG; GOUGH, T				LEE, GG; GOUGH, T			AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR INFORMATION-SYSTEMS PLANNING AND ITS INITIAL APPLICATION	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CURRENT ISSUES; KEY ISSUES; MANAGEMENT	This paper outlines an approach to information systems planning (ISP) that addresses not just the technical problems encountered in ISP but the whole range of problems which derive from social systems, organizational processes, formal organizational arrangements, technology and the external environment. The approach is designed to improve the effectiveness of the high-level planning processes for information systems (IS). A five-phase framework is proposed. The first phase, the perception phase, aims to provide the managers with an environment that enables them to recognize the strategic value of IS and that activates them to participate in strategy formulation. The second phase, the evaluation phase, involves the evaluation of the organization's systems. The third phase, the selection phase, is focused on analysing the data collected from previous phases in order to select feasible projects. The fourth phase, the construction phase, is responsible for producing a set of preliminary IS plans. The fifth phase, the review phase, aims to ensure that ISP effectiveness is further enhanced by ongoing adjustments to the plans. The paper includes brief comments on the initial application of the framework in the Mingchi Institute of Technology.

J	MCCUTCHEN, WW				MCCUTCHEN, WW			STRATEGY CHANGES AS A RESPONSE TO ALTERATIONS IN TAX POLICY	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							R-AND-D; PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; SALES GROWTH; PERFORMANCE; EXPENDITURES	This study examines how firms in the pharmaceutical industry responded to the R&D tax credit which was enacted in 1981. The change in research intensity (research/sales) subsequent to the tax change was estimated for the firms. An increase in research intensity was associated with the adoption of the tax credit. The strong response by the firms to the tax credit and the effort to maintain their relative position in research intensity indicate that research intensity is an important strategic dimension and driving force in the industry.

J	LUDWIG, DC				LUDWIG, DC			ADAPTING TO A DECLINING ENVIRONMENT - LESSONS FROM A RELIGIOUS ORDER	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						DECLINE; CUTBACK; RETRENCHMENT; RELIGIOUS ORDERS; JESUITS	ORGANIZATIONS; MANAGEMENT; SIZE	This study examines the ten U.S. provinces of the largest religious order of Catholic priests and brothers, the Jesuits, and explores the structural/organizational adaptations which these ten provinces employed to accommodate dramatic reductions in membership. The organizational placement of roughly 11,000 individual members of these provinces is traced between the years 1965 and 1979. The research indicates that, by increasing interorganizational cooperation and exchange of information and by enhancing the administrative component, these organizations were able to reduce slack resource requirements and were largely able to protect their core operations from the impact of decline. These observations differ dramatically from those reported in typical, for-profit organizations (e.g., Harrigan 1980). Finally, to the extent that cutback did reach the core, an attempt is made to examine the width and depth of retrenchment at both the divisional and departmental levels and to determine whether the mode of retrenchment affected individuals' willingness to subsequently invest in the organization. The analysis suggests that narrower, deeper cuts at the departmental level may have had a positive effect on members' willingness to invest in the organizations, while narrower, deeper cuts at the division level may have contributed to more members deciding to leave the organizations.

It elucidates the progress in this field and shows how empirical crop protection with many phenomenological aspects transformed into a science-based (inter)discipline. The availability of experimental tools and the rapid development and introduction of computers enabled the application of systems approaches which stimulated a revolution in thinking and caused a considerable improvement of strategic and tactical decision making in crop protection. Zadoks played a crucial role in that development.			RABBINGE, R (corresponding author), WAGENINGEN UNIV AGR,DEPT THEORET PROD ECOL,POB 430,6700 AK WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS.

Markets have become more fragmented, and the time required to emulate competitors' products has decreased. Organizations are using information technologies to provide competitive advantage. This article uses changes in the healthcare environment to illustrate the use of information technology in organizational strategies. Effective uses of information systems are identified and deficiencies are noted. The importance of maintaining or developing systems for measurement of internal efficiencies in service organizations is identified and a model of information system requirements driven by the competitive environment is proposed.

System dynamics models are particularly appropriate for , inclusion in this emerging framework for the debate of policy issues. The procedural framework integrates ideas from group decision support systems, boardroom systems and scenario generation and requires particular features in the system dynamics modelling software employed. Consideration is given to those specific features of the DYSMAP2 software which meet the need of senior managerial groups who are faced with the resolution of policy issues.

Observing Organizational Environments: A Systematic Approach for Information Analysts	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Information analyst; information analysis; observation; organizational environment; mise-en-scene		Information Analysts observe the elements of an organization in order to gain information unavailable through interviewing and the investigation of hard data. In the past he process of observation has been intuitive at best. This article describes and develops a systematic methodology for analyzing the internal organizational environment. The approach is based on a framework used in film criticism called mise-en-scene analysis. Seven major concrete and abstract elements which influence organizational decisions are identified: office lighting and color; office design, space, and location; clothing of decision makers; individual and group decision making; abilities of decision makers; attention to multiple objectives; and cognitive maps of decision makers. The systematic framework for observation developed in this article is an alternative to the common sense approach to observation. The major advantage of the mis-en-scene approach is that it allows the Information Analyst to classify, document, and interpret important factors which usually remain at the subconscious level.

Firms need to carefully anticipate the difficulties during recovery and formulate appropriate strategies to ensure the survival of their businesses and supply chains. To enhance awareness of the issues, this research aims to identify and model recovery challenges in the context of the Bangladeshi ready-made garment industry. A Delphi-based grey decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology was used to analyze the data. While the Delphi method helped identify the major supply chain recovery challenges from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the grey DEMATEL approach helped categorize the causal relationships among these challenges. Of the 23 recovery challenges finalized, 12 are causal challenges. The study's findings can assist decision-makers in developing strategic policies to overcome the recovery challenges in the post-COVID-19 era.

J	Kour, P; Jasrotia, A; Gupta, S				Kour, Parvinder; Jasrotia, Aruditya; Gupta, Sudhanshu			COVID-19: a pandemic to tourism guest-host relationship in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES			English	Article						Travel behavior; Intention to revisit; Guest-host relationship; Pandemic situations	RESIDENTS ATTITUDES; CONSUMER ETHNOCENTRISM; SOCIAL DISTANCE; ANIMOSITY; IMPACT; PERCEPTIONS; TRUST; INTENTION; COMMUNITY; CRISIS	Purpose The emerging situation of pandemic due to COVID-19 has not only influenced the daily life but also the society and travel activities around the world thereby depriving tourists (especially who are already on the move) of facilities and even making them to look for desperate alternatives. Such situation in fact may draw a long-term impact on guest-host relationship while residents' behavior reflects hostility toward the tourists. Such kind of interactions contributes toward tourists' perception and experience about the destination and its services thereby affecting their level of acceptance and tolerance for tour and travel activities (Armenski et al., 2011). Moreover, the guest-host relationship has mostly been studied with perspective of and focus on residents/host and not enough on tourists (Skipper, 2009; Vargas-Sanchez et al., 2014). Keeping this in view, this paper aims to analyze the impact of pandemic situation on guest-host relationship and its future impact on travel intentions among the tourists in India. Design/methodology/approach The study undertakes the help of in-depth interviews and extracting themes to understand the guest-host relationship and the perspective of tourists in challenging times like COVID-19 and its impact on the relationship. The secondary sources have been adopted to retrieve the data related to current status of travel industry in India. In-depth interviews were conducted online to gather data for the qualitative analysis regarding the research. Further, the data has been analyzed for retrieving a dimensional approach to subject area. Findings The data from participant observation showed that the hosts displayed panic, mistrust and irresponsible behavior toward the guests, and this clearly indicates that the pandemic situation has a highly negative impact on the image of the community and the destination. This ultimately affects the guest-hosts relationships in the long term. Most of the tourists showed that they were okay with following the rules and respect local culture but were expecting support from local community during distress. It was found that there were two female tourists who were asked to vacate the accommodation, which can be considered as an inappropriate and extreme behavior. Thus, COVID-19 is not only causing a threat to the tourism presently but will have a prolonged influence on guest-host relationship as negative interaction or experiences are supposed to be frequently radiated by the tourists (de Albuquerque and McElroy, 2001). Originality/value There is no dearth of studies focusing on travel behavior dimensions, whereas the linkage of residents' behavior toward it still requires much consideration and analyzing simultaneously. The study looks into the area of guest-host relationship and tries to explore it from the perspective and significance of tourist (guest) rather than the much read and researched resident (host) perception at the center. The findings of the study could be helpful in drawing the strategic framework for the industry to handle and sustain the guest-host relation so as to safeguard the future of tourism and sustain potential travel market reiterating the significance of tourists/guests and their perspective about the hosts, in developing and growing the tourism of a destination.

J	Alegoz, M; Kaya, O; Bayindir, ZP				Alegoz, Mehmet; Kaya, Onur; Bayindir, Z. Pelin			A comparison of pure manufacturing and hybrid manufacturing-remanufacturing systems under carbon tax policy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Supply chain management; Closed-loop supply chain; Remanufacturing; Carbon tax	LOOP SUPPLY CHAIN; QUALITY CHOICE; COORDINATION; COMPETITION; STRATEGIES; PRODUCTS; DECISION; DESIGN	Collection and remanufacturing of used products can be considered as one of the options to improve the sustainability of a manufacturing system. In this study, we focus on production and sustainability level decisions in pure manufacturing and hybrid manufacturing-remanufacturing systems and compare the systemwide performances and the performances of supply chain actors under different settings in terms of economic and environmental performance measures. We consider four settings as follows. In the first setting, no remanufacturing is made and only the manufactured products are sold via the retailer, whereas in the second, the third and the fourth settings, used products are collected and remanufactured by the manufacturer, the retailer and a third-party remanufacturer, respectively. Under all settings, we put the emissions resulting from the manufacturing and remanufacturing processes into account and consider one of the well-known emission policies, the carbon tax policy. We propose stylized models for the centralized and decentralized cases of each setting and analyze the decisions obtained under optimal or equilibrium solution. Based on our analysis, we observe that since the upper bound on the remanufacturing quantity depends on the manufacturing quantity, the manufacturer uses manufacturing quantity as a strategic power to compete with the retailer or the third-party remanufacturer.

We consider strategic behaviour to arise when an agent: (i) believes the choice experiment will be used to determine a provision decision over a discrete set of alternatives; and (ii) has expectations about the relative likelihood of those alternatives being selected and delivered. In the experiment, agents receive induced values for the discrete set of provisioning alternatives. In treatments where agents receive information that their first best outcome is unlikely to win, we investigate the extent to which their choices change, in a manner consistent with them seeking to deliver their second best outcome in the provisioning decision. We find that 27% of respondents misrepresent their preferences and reveal evidence of strategic bias. We find that this behaviour is sufficient to change inferences about preferred provision at the aggregate level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Technology, especially digital technology, has changed the way of doing business around the globe. Marketers need to develop new strategies by incorporating the element of digital technology to overrun their competitors, as conventional competitive strategies will not produce extraordinaryresults. The rise of social media, in this regard, is a game-changer in the context of marketing as it provides a strategic touchpoint to the marketers to involve the customers with a brand. Prior research has largely ignored the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of a brand and positive customer experiences. Hence the present study aims to test the relationship of customer-related CSR activities on social media on behavioral consequences of customers, such as their purchase likelihood and electronic word of mouth (E-WOM). The data were collected from the banking customers of a developing economy and were analyzed through structural equation modeling in AMOS software. The results revealed that customer-related CSR activitieson social mediainfluence customer behavioral outcomes like E-WOM and purchase intentions. The result also revealed that brand attitude mediates the relationship between customer-related CSR, E-WOM, and purchase intentions. The findings of the present study can help policymakers to understand the importance of CSRpractices from the perspective of marketing, which is largely ignored by contemporary CSR researchers.

Globalization, government policies, capitalism, colonialism, and other rapid social-ecological changes threaten the relationships between Indigenous Peoples and local communities and their environments, thereby challenging the continuity and dynamism of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK). In this article, we contribute to the "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity," issued by the Alliance of World Scientists, by exploring opportunities for sustaining ILK systems on behalf of the future stewardship of our planet. Our warning raises the alarm about the pervasive and ubiquitous erosion of knowledge and practice and the social and ecological consequences of this erosion. While ILK systems can be adaptable and resilient, the foundations of these knowledge systems are compromised by ongoing suppression, misrepresentation, appropriation, assimilation, disconnection, and destruction of biocultural heritage. Three case studies illustrate these processes and how protecting ILK is central to biocultural conservation. We conclude with 15 recommendations that call for the recognition and support of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and their knowledge systems. Enacting these recommendations will entail a transformative and sustained shift in how ILK systems, their knowledge holders, and their multiple expressions in lands and waters are recognized, affirmed, and valued. We appeal for urgent action to support the efforts of Indigenous Peoples and local communities around the world to maintain their knowledge systems, languages, stewardship rights, ties to lands and waters, and the biocultural integrity of their territories-on which we all depend.

J	King, A; Goldfarb, B; Simcoe, T				King, Andrew; Goldfarb, Brent; Simcoe, Timothy			LEARNING FROM TESTIMONY ON QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH IN MANAGEMENT	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article							TO-CARRY LAWS; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; MODEL UNCERTAINTY; ME; CONVERSATION; REPLICATION; ECONOMICS; CLAIMS; SHALL; TESTS	Published testimony in management, as in other sciences, includes cases where authors have overstated the inferential value of their analysis. Where some scholars have diagnosed a current crisis, we detect an ongoing and universal difficulty: the epistemic problem of learning from testimony. Overcoming this difficulty will require responses suited to the conditions of management research. To that end, we reviewthe philosophical literature on the epistemology of testimony, which describes the conditions under which common empirical claims provide a basis for knowledge, and we evaluate ways these conditions can be verified. We conclude that in many areas ofmanagement research, popular proposals such as preregistration and replication are unlikely to be effective. We suggest revised modes of testimony that could help researchers and readers to avoid some barriers to learning from testimony. Finally, we imagine the implications of our analysis for management scholarship and propose hownewstandards could come about.

J	Farshbaf-Geranmayeh, A; Zaccour, G				Farshbaf-Geranmayeh, Amir; Zaccour, Georges			Pricing and advertising in a supply chain in the presence of strategic consumers * , ** , ***	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Pricing policy; Advertising; Supply chain; Strategic consumers	BRAND CHOICE; MARKDOWN; QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTS; BEHAVIOR	It is well known that strategic consumers can harm firms' profits by delaying their purchases, to buy at a discounted price. A retailer can induce consumers to purchase at the right price and time by acting on the two components of the consumer's surplus in each period, that is, the willingness to pay (WTP) and the selling price. We develop a multi-period model to investigate pricing and advertising decisions in a sup-ply chain, in the presence of two types of consumers, namely, myopic and strategic. We assume that the retailer's advertising positively affects the consumer's WTP at a decreasing rate over time. The manufac-turer sets the wholesale price and its share in the retailer's advertising cost, while the retailer determines the retail prices during the different periods of the selling season, along with the advertising budget. Our approach makes it possible to determine endogenously the number of price drops during the selling sea -son and the depth of each discount. Assuming decentralized decision-making in the supply chain, we determine the conditions under which the retailer prefers a single-pricing policy to a markdown-pricing policy. We show that the manufacturer has a say in the retailer's choice through its participation rate in the retailer's advertising cost. Interestingly, we obtain that an integrated supply chain would, roughly speaking, adopt the same pricing policy as in the decentralized case. To start with, we assume that the WTP is distributed uniformly, and later on, we assess the impact of changing the distribution on the results.

J	Sun, XR; Wang, WW; Pang, JR; Liu, XX; Zhang, M				Sun, Xinran; Wang, Wenwen; Pang, Jingru; Liu, Xiaoxiao; Zhang, Ming			Study on the evolutionary game of central government and local governments under central environmental supervision system	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Central environmental supervision; Central and local governments; Evolutionary game	HAZE POLLUTION; POLICY; CHINA; GOVERNANCE; STRATEGIES; EFFICIENCY; MORTALITY; TAXES; PM2.5; MODEL	The central environmental supervision system is an innovation to environmental governance in China, which has created a new form of the game between the central and local governments. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is built to analyze the interaction process and evolution direction of the central and local governments, which can find out the key factors that affect the strategic choice of both sides. The results demonstrate that: (1) The behavior choice of the central and local governments depends on the comparison of cost and benefit participating in governance. In the low-cost state, the local gov-ernment chooses to rectify while the central government chooses to supervise. With the increase in cost, both sides tend to take less action. (2) Due to the low initiative of local government, the special funds can play an important part in encouraging local governments to carry out rectification, while its scope of changes is narrow and inflexible. (3) According to the data simulation results of MATLAB, the mechanism of reward and punishment can affect the decision-making speed of the central and the local govern-ments. With the increase of rewards and punishments, it takes less time to reach the stabilization be-tween the local and the central government. This study can provide constructive suggestions for optimizing the environmental supervision system and improving the performance of environmental governance. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Arbolino, R; Boffardi, R; De Simone, L; Ioppolo, G				Arbolino, Roberta; Boffardi, Raffaele; De Simone, Luisa; Ioppolo, Giuseppe			Multi-objective optimization technique: A novel approach in tourism sustainability planning	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Regional sustainable development; Decision support systems; Urban and regional planning; Sustainable tourism	RURAL TOURISM; MANAGEMENT; PROMETHEE; SUPPORT	Strategic management of complex decisional problems in the tourism sector requires the implementation of proper planning procedures for sustainable tourism activities, due to either the number of actors involved, the presence of conflicting goals and the need of resource rationalization. Thus, the aim of the research is to implement a new approach for the selection of projects to be funded by public administration, in order to maximize the efficiency of public resource allocation. Furthermore, the proposed technique enhances the inclusion of the three dimensions of sustainability in tourism policy planning and implementation phases. The Multi-objective Optimization model accounts for environmental, social and economic impacts, to select tourism activities to be realized in order to maximize stakeholder utility. In order to test the model, we selected a case study: a call for tender drafted by an Italian Public administration, whose aim was to support the attractiveness of the urban areas. Findings illustrate that, in comparison with multicriteria techniques, the proposed model allows to achieve a better allocation of public funds, in both quantitative (i.e., amount of resources allocated) and qualitative (selection of projects with positive social and environmental implication) terms.

J	Ahangar, SS; Sadati, A; Rabbani, M				Sadeghi Ahangar, Shahin; Sadati, Amirhossein; Rabbani, Masoud			Sustainable design of a municipal solid waste management system in an integrated closed-loop supply chain network using a fuzzy approach: a case study	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Municipal solid waste management; multi-objective problem; recycling; mixed-integer linear programming; network flow; sustainable supply chain		Waste management can be considered as a strategic issue for any government, which could include waste collection, separation, transfer, disposal, and recycling. Having a proper disposal and recycling supply chain is useful to prevent contamination of the environment to a large extent. The implementation of this system seems far from reality, regardless of considering the uncertainty. For this purpose, the fuzzy programming approach has been used. In this paper, a sustainable municipal solid waste disposal system has been designed and developed by a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize the number and locations of construction sites for recycling centers. This system, in addition to taking the costs into account, includes optimizing the number of manpower, as well as the amount of pollutant. These aspects have been considered in order to have a system as close as possible to reality.

This paper draws on the research question: How does manufacturing incumbents use AI for enabling business model innovation in industrial ecosystems? We use qualitative method in order to study four large global manufacturing incumbents that are transforming their business models with AI. We performed more than 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with strategic key personnel in order to understand how they have succeeded with implementing AI and transforming business models. Our main contribution establishes the need for AI business-model innovation to be aligned with ecosystem innovation. Specifically, in short-term incumbents may use ecosystem reconfiguration strategy, whereas long-term strategies relate to ecosystem revitalization, and resilience. Thus, we contribute by connecting organizational microelements with ecosystem macro dimensions and provide an evolutionary model envisioning how incumbents attempt to promote strategic transitions in their firms and ecosystems.

J	Mishra, P; Yadav, M				Mishra, Poornima; Yadav, Manmohan			"Environmental capabilities, proactive environmental strategy and competitive advantage: A natural-resource-based view of firms operating in India"	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Proactive environmental strategy; Natural-resource-based view; Shared vision; Strategic proactivity; Continuous innovation; Competitive advantage; Perceived environmental uncertainty and; hostility	GREEN PRODUCT INNOVATION; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; MODERATING ROLE; MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES; STAKEHOLDER INFLUENCES; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; POLLUTION PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; ECO-INNOVATION	Drawing on the natural resource-based theory, the study examines the relationship of specific environmental capabilities, proactive environmental strategy (PES), and competitive advantage. In addition, it explores how perceived uncertainty and hostility in the general business environment moderate the deployment of strategic proactivity capability in formulating proactive environmental strategy. Accordingly, hypotheses were formulated, which were then tested using multiple hierarchical regression and bootstrapping mediation analysis on the survey data collected from 162 firms operating in India. The results indicate that the capabilities of shared vision, strategic proactivity, and continuous innovation are pre-requisites to formulate a PES. Furthermore, the findings confirm that PES mediates the relationship between environmental capabilities and competitive advantage. Moderation results reveal that perceived uncertainty positively moderates the relationship between strategic proactivity and a PES. However, the moderating impact of perceived hostility was found to be insignificant. The study contributes to the understanding of natural-resource-based view and contingent influence of external variables in designing PES by firms in the Indian business context. These findings provide important managerial implications for the deployment of environmental capabilities to pursue PES in gaining a competitive advantage. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Freeman, RE; Dmytriyev, SD; Phillips, RA				Freeman, R. Edward; Dmytriyev, Sergiy D.; Phillips, Robert A.			Stakeholder Theory and the Resource-Based View of the Firm	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cooperation; normativity; people; resourced-based view; stakeholder theory; sustainability		We start this article with the exploration of similarities between the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) and stakeholder theory at the time of their origination and then proceed with the conversation on what led to distinct developmental trajectories of the two theories. Though RBV has become a leading paradigm in the strategic management field, we argue that in its current form, RBV is yet incomplete. We suggest there are four aspects that stakeholder theory can offer to inform RBV: normativity, sustainability, people, and cooperation. Reconciling stakeholder theory and RBV is a promising path to advancing our understanding of management, and we provide a two-part guideline to management scholars and practitioners who would be willing to take this path.

Entrepreneurial orientation, concern for socioemotional wealth preservation, and family firm performance	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Entrepreneurial orientation; Socioemotional wealth; Performance; Family firms; PLS-SEM; fsQCA; Moderating effect	MODERATING ROLE; CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; VENTURE PERFORMANCE; DECISION-MAKING; RISK-TAKING; PERSPECTIVE; STEWARDSHIP; CONSTRUCT	This paper explores whether concern for socioemotional wealth enhances or undermines the positive effect of entrepreneurial orientation on family firm performance. Two analysis techniques were used: second-generation structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). These techniques were applied to data on 106 Spanish family firms. Results of both analyses are similar, lending validity and robustness to the proposed research model. Specifically, the results indicate that 1) entrepreneurial orientation positively influences family firm performance, 2) concern for socioemotional wealth preservation positively influences both entrepreneurial orientation and family firm performance, and 3) concern for socioemotional wealth preservation positively moderates the influence of entrepreneurial orientation on family firm performance.

Our study aims to explicate the knowledge creation dynamics (structure and networks) of JBR special issues (SIs) and regular issues (RIs) between 1973 and 2020. Applying bibliometrics, we examine the knowledge structure of JBR SIs by identifying their highly cited publications, prolific authors, and affiliations. In addition, using co-authorship, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses, we investigate the knowledge structures prevailing among the sources citing JBR, its contributing authors, and their affiliations. Our findings indicate that the most prolific authors have US affiliations and that JBR has stronger ties with other leading marketing and management journals, such as the Journal of Marketing, the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Marketing Research, Strategic Management Journal, and Industrial Marketing Management. Bibliographic coupling groups the JBR SI publications into seven clusters identified as consumer behavior of emerging technologies, organizational resources and networks, dynamics of consumer power in marketing, measurement issues, globalization of marketing, future-oriented strategies and tools, and market relationships. Finally, a comparison of JBR SIs with RIs highlights scholarship from more countries with a focus on evolving and current topics.

J	Leidner, DE; Tona, O				Leidner, Dorothy E.; Tona, Olgerta			THE CARE THEORY OF DIGNITY AMID PERSONAL DATA DIGITALIZATION	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Personal data; dignity; digitalization; inductive top-down theorizing; dignity disequilibrium	PRIVACY CALCULUS MODEL; INFORMATION PRIVACY; PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT; BIG DATA; CONSUMER PRIVACY; BOUNDARY CONTROL; E-COMMERCE; IDENTITY; SELF; SYSTEMS	With the rapidly evolving permeation of digital technologies into everyday human life, we are witnessing an era of personal data digitalization. Personal data digitalization refers to the sociotechnical encounters associated with the digitization of personal data for use in digital technologies. Personal data digitalization is being applied to central attributes of human life-health, cognition, and emotion-with the purported aim of helping individuals live longer, healthier lives endowed with the requisite cognition and emotion for responding to life situations and other people in a manner that enables human flourishing. A concern taking hold in manifold fields ranging from IT, bioethics, and law, to philosophy and religion is that as personal data digitalization permeates ever more areas of human existence, humans risk becoming artifacts of technology production. This concern brings to center stage the very notion of what it means to be human, a notion encapsulated in the term human dignity, which broadly refers to the recognition that human beings possess intrinsic value and, as such, are endowed with certain rights and should be treated with respect. In this paper, we identify, describe, and transform what we know about personal data digitalization into a higher order theoretical structure around the concept of human dignity. The result of our analysis is the CARE (claims, affronts, response, equilibrium) theory of dignity amid personal data digitalization, a theory that explains the relationship of personal data digitalization to human dignity. Building upon the CARE theory as a foundation, researchers in a variety of IS research streams could develop mid-range theories for empirical testing or could use the CARE theory as an overarching lens for interpreting emerging IS phenomena. Practitioners and government agencies can also use the CARE theory to understand the opportunities and risks of personal data digitalization and to develop policies and systems that respect the dignity of employees and citizens.

We used a survey questionnaire to collect data from 352 supervisor-subordinate dyadic samples in the MNEs in the EMs. The data collected was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the study?s hypotheses. We found that knowledge-based HRM practices directly and indirectly through social capital influence knowledge sharing behaviors in the MNEs. Furthermore, the study?s findings suggest that knowledge sharing mediates the influence of social capital on innovation performance. Moreover, this study empirically suggests how knowledge-based HRM practices through the mediating role of social capital and knowledge sharing on innovation performance.

Pathotypes of Plasmodiophora brassicae collected from clubroot resistant canola (Brassica napus L.) cultivars in western Canada in 2017-2018	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Brassica napus; canola; clubroot; oilseed rape; pathotypes; Plasmodiophora brassicae; resistance; Brassica napus; canola; hernie; canola oleagineux; pathotypes; Plasmodiophora brassicae; resistance		Clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin, is an important soilborne disease of canola (oilseed rape; Brassica napus L.). In Canada, clubroot management relies heavily on the planting of resistant cultivars, but since 2013, resistance has been broken in an increasing number of fields. Prior to the introduction of resistance, P. brassicae pathotype 3H, as defined on the Canadian Clubroot Differential (CCD) set, was predominant in Alberta. In testing of pathogen collections from 2014 to 2016, however, pathotype 3A was most common, indicating rapid shifts in the pathogen population. Up-to-date knowledge of pathotype composition is important for effective resistance breeding and stewardship. Therefore, clubbed roots were collected from clubroot-resistant canola crops from 166 fields in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba in 2017 and 2018, with one isolate per field evaluated for pathotype designation on the CCD set and the differentials of Some et al. Seventeen pathotypes were detected on the CCD set, including the previously reported pathotypes 3A, 3D, 3H, 5 L, 5X, 8E, 8N and 8P, plus the novel pathotypes 2C, 6D, 8D, 9A, 9B, 9C, 11A, 13A and 13B. Five pathotypes were identified on the hosts of Some et al. including P-1, P-2, P-3, P-4 and P-5, with P-4 and P-5 reported here from Canada for the first time. The majority of the isolates, representing 39 fields in 2017 and 92 fields in 2018, could overcome genetic resistance. The results suggest significant diversity in the virulence of P. brassicae populations and an increasing prevalence of resistance-breaking P. brassicae strains.	[Hollman, K. B.; Hwang, S.

J	Barbieri, E; Di Tommaso, MR; Tassinari, M; Marozzi, M				Barbieri, Elisa; Di Tommaso, Marco Rodolfo; Tassinari, Mattia; Marozzi, Marco			Selective industrial policies in China: investigating the choice of pillar industries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS			English	Article						China; Manufacturing; Policy making; Selective industrial policy; Uncertainty analysis; L50; L60; O14; M00		Purpose China's experience of industrial growth is noteworthy for several reasons, not least because it has made a massive use of selective industrial policies. The industrial development guidelines set by the Five-Year Plans are extensively based on the choice of "strategic" or "pillar" industries to be promoted and supported. What remains unclear is the way in which such industries are identified among many. The purpose of this paper is to propose a debate on how to improve the government choice of strategic sectors and suggests a methodology to make this choice more transparent and rigorous. Design/methodology/approach The methodology allows ranking the different industries according to their strategic importance in the Chinese economy. The authors employ an uncertainty analysis methodology to verify the robustness of the ranking. Findings The results point to a list of strategic sectors for China. Comparing the ranking of the strategic sectors to the list of strategic priorities described in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, we find that, by and large, the ranking coincides with the list of strategic sectors of the Chinese government. Social implications The authors argue that improving the transparency and the rigor of the choice of pillar industries can be crucial for the Chinese government to maintain social legitimization in the transition to a "market" economy. Originality/value Very little is known about the choice of strategic sectors in China in the international literature. By addressing the debate on the choice of pillar industries in China, the paper discusses a topic scarcely studied offering a unique and original contribute.

UNPACKING FIRM EXTERNAL DEPENDENCE: HOW GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DEPENDENCE AFFECTS FIRM INVESTMENTS AND MARKET PERFORMANCE	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article								We advance resource dependence theory (RDT) by answering calls for theorizing on both how being dependent on external entities for resources affects firms and the heterogeneous nature of such dependencies. Specifically, we theorize how internal firm dynamics and performance are affected by resource dependence by integrating resource orchestration (RO) into RDT. Building on RO, we argue that as the degree to which a firm is dependent upon a single source of revenue increases (a core tenet of RDT), the firm adjusts internally by reducing investments and the market responds negatively as well. Further, we argue that the heterogeneous nature of such dependence-namely, dependence scope (the spread of dependence throughout the entity with which the dependence relationship resides), dependence supplementation (the addition of new relationships within the prior dependence relationship), and dependence stability (the expected length of the dependence relationship)-moderates the relationship between the level of dependence and these outcomes. We find broad support for our theorizing in a longitudinal sample of manufacturing firms' dependence upon governmental contracts for revenue. Collectively, we advance understanding of RDT by adding nuance to both explanatory mechanisms underlying dependence and conceptualizations of firms' external dependence relationships, posing theoretical and practical implications.

THE TWO TOWERS (OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN): THE BEHAVIORAL CONSEQUENCES OF POSITIONAL INCONSISTENCY ACROSS STATUS HIERARCHIES	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article								We examine how actors react to status inconsistencies across multiple status hierarchies. We argue that pluralistic value systems create multiple status conferral mechanisms, and that hierarchies' prestige varies as a function of the values they represent. While status inconsistency, in general, increases the likelihood that actors will pursue opportunities that can boost their lagging status, their status hierarchies' unequal prestige influences the magnitude and direction of actors' responses to their status inconsistency. Further, their ability to respond is constrained by their relative standing in their primary status hierarchy and the extent to which they are embedded in particular professional networks. Using the artistic and commercial status of Hollywood performers, we found that status-inconsistent performers were more likely to appear in films that could boost their lagging status in the commercial hierarchy when they possessed relatively higher artistic than commercial status. Moreover, being high-status decreased the likelihood a performer would pursue opportunities that could improve their lagging status only when they were high status in the artistic status hierarchy, while embeddedness only decreased the likelihood when their primary status hierarchy was commercial.

EMPOWERMENT FROM SIDE-HUSTLES AND ITS EFFECTS ON FULL-TIME WORK PERFORMANCE	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article								Side-hustles, income-generating work performed alongside full-time jobs, are increasingly common as the gig economy provides opportunities for employees to perform supplementary work. Although scholars have suggested that side- hustles conflict with full-time work performance, we assert that psychological empowerment from side- hustles enriches full-time work performance. We argue that sidehustle complexity-the motivating characteristics of side-hustles-positively relates to empowerment and that side-hustle motives moderate this relationship. A study of 337 employees supports these assertions. We then investigate the spillover of side-hustle empowerment to full-time work performance in a 10-day experience-sampling method study of 80 employee-coworker dyads. We address an affective pathway in which daily side-hustle empowerment enriches full-time work performance through side-hustle engagement and positive affect at work. We also consider a cognitive pathway wherein side-hustle empowerment distracts from full-time work performance through side-hustle engagement and attention residue-persistent cognitions about side-hustles during full-time work. Overall, performance enrichment from side- hustles was stronger than performance conflict. We also consider affective shift from full-time work to side-hustles, finding negative affect from full-time work strengthens the relationship between side-hustle empowerment and engagement. Combined, our two studies examine the source of side-hustle empowerment and how side-hustle empowerment influences affective and cognitive experiences during full-time work.

We argue that a downside of this process is that newcomers' social integration and acculturation may be weakened. This suggests declining levels of FSB may result in decreased organizational commitment across time and ultimately greater turnover likelihood. These predictions were examined in two longitudinal studies (Study 1, N = 158; Study 2, N = 170) among newcomers. In both studies, FSB by supervisor inquiry was found to decline across time, and the decrease in FSB preceded a steeper decline in affective organizational commitment. In Study 1, the decline of commitment also resulted in a steeper decrease in FSB. Study 2 further found the decline in commitment to mediate the relationship between the decrease in FSB and increased turnover intention. Finally, increased turnover intention mediated the relationship between the decline in commitment and increased turnover the following year. Bridging research on FSB and organizational commitment, these findings shed new light on the influence of the dynamics of FSB on newcomer turnover.

A thorough understanding of local biophysical and socio-economic conditions is essential in formulating effective development plans and policies. Here, we propose the use of a social-ecological model as a comparative tool to help understand these critical components in order to inform sustainability-driven strategic interventions and best practice learning. We use the cities of Chicago and Stockholm as our comparison cases, and explore the spatial relationships between development patterns and accessibility attractors such as employment, transportation, and recreational opportunities. Potential environmental impacts are evaluated for comparison using ecosystem service value and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results indicate that although each city exhibits distinctive patterns of development, there are commonalities to build on for potential adaption strategies. For example, to mitigate the high ecosystem service and NDVI losses of Chicago from urban development, what can be learned from Stockholm are: 1) promoting infill for future residential development; and 2) stronger restrictions on both commercial and residential developments on buffer zones of valuable ecosystem services, especially waterways. These findings help us to understand the driving forces of different patterns of urban growth and to give suggestions on city-specific sustainability policies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bubicz, ME; Barbosa-Povoa, APFD; Carvalho, A				Bubicz, Marta Elisa; Ferreira Dias Barbosa-Povoa, Ana Paula; Carvalho, Ana			Social sustainability management in the apparel supply chains	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Sustainable supply chain; Social sustainability; Apparel supply chain; Social sustainability strategy	CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; MODERN SLAVERY; US TEXTILE; FASHION; BUSINESS; RESPONSIBILITY; INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; RETAIL	The apparel supply chain is an example of a complex global supply chain where sustainability issues are a concern and where no satisfactory answers have been achieved yet, especially in social aspects. The growth in importance of social sustainability represents a strategic change in the sector with the necessary involvement of different tiers and external stakeholders to mitigate the negative social impacts. In this paper, a qualitative analysis through the application of content analysis using NVivo software is carried out, first to identify the structure and the main entities in this supply chain, and then to understand the main drivers towards social sustainability management. Six global companies were analysed, considering their sustainability reports from 2014 to 2018. The findings showed that social sustainability is a part of strategic goals as policies and commitments, and several actions have been developed along the supply chain to promote human rights, labour conditions, social development, and product responsibility, with external stakeholders collaboration. Finally, this article contributes to understanding how social sustainability should be managed in the apparel sector in a global supply chain context. Furthermore, in order to enrich the knowledge on this field, this paper provides some insight throughout the definition of a roadmap for future research in the area. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bhattacharyya, SS; Thakre, S				Bhattacharyya, Som Sekhar; Thakre, Shreyash			Coronavirus pandemic and economic lockdown; study of strategic initiatives and tactical responses of firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Business continuity; Economic lockdown; Organizational tactics; Pandemic crisis; Strategic initiatives		Purpose The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and the associated economic lockdown provided a jolt to businesses around the world and the global economy. Amid the ongoing uncertainty, circumstances varied across business sectors and regions, but the common goal for business organizations was to respond effectively, devising strategies to survive the turmoil and accelerate recovery. The narrative in India was no different from the rest of the world. Due to the novelty of the event, literature regarding its impact on the strategic management of firms was scarce. Thus, this paper aims to attempt to ascertain the crisis impact on firms and subsequently unravel the tactical short-term and long-term strategic responses initiated by Indian firms. Design/methodology/approach The authors carried out an empirical investigation to comprehend the strategic foresight adopted by Indian firms. Following a structured literature review, the authors conducted semi-structured open-ended interviews with 28 business experts who were involved in drafting strategic responses for their respective firms. Subsequently, the authors performed a thematic content analysis of the expert interview responses to document firm-level strategic responses to the COVID-19 crisis and associated economic lockdown. The authors further searched reputed media articles to supplement and triangulate the primary research findings with management perspectives. Findings The authors identified that managers had adopted a dual approach responding to the disruption. Companies simultaneously focused on surviving the crisis in the short-term by reconfiguring existing resources and initiated long-term recovery by mobilizing efforts for a redesigned business model. The research findings indicated that companies had adapted to the dynamic chaotic crisis environment to fulfill the changed consumer expectations. Remote working was widely implemented, supply networks were adjusted, operations were managed with minimal resources, working capital was closely monitored and the product-portfolio was revamped to reap benefits in an essentials-only world. The impact of several strategic firm responses was determined through this study on the revenue, profitability, operational costs and regulatory adherence of the companies along with the ability to meet stakeholder expectations. The study suggested that companies encouraged innovative solutions and highlighted the importance of collaborative inter-organizational practices. Research limitations/implications The study contributed to an inter-theoretical perspective on firm strategic initiatives to confront a global crisis. Resource-based view, dynamic capabilities perspective and industrial-organizational theory-based perspectives, were applied. This facilitated an extensive analysis of the entire business ecosystem to identify various paths to accelerated recovery during and post COVID-19 world. Practical implications The research findings would aid managers in drafting a comprehensive response strategy during and post COVID-19 world. This study results would help managers in addressing multiple concerns such as the sustainability of operations in the short-term through working capital management, the fulfillment of changing consumer needs through sustained innovation and business model alterations to ensure long term growth. The study enabled managers to prioritize necessary actions, ascertain the impact of strategic initiatives and build sustainable competitive advantage for long-term growth. Originality/value The novel coronavirus pandemic and the associated economic lockdown impacted firm strategies and this was one of the very first empirical studies regarding how firm-level short-term tactics and long-term strategies were getting reshaped. Traditionally, companies were prepared to handle localized disruptions but a crisis of such epic global proportions jeopardized most business. This study provided an extensive review of the short-term tactical and long-term strategic response perspectives adopted by Indian firms to absorb the impact of this unique crisis and expected recovery with renewed strength. This was one of the first research articles to provide an inter-theoretical perspective on the ongoing global pandemic. This integrated view of the possible impacts of firm-level strategic initiatives provided a detailed knowledge repository to design the crisis response capability of firms.

The Emergence of Emergent Leadership: A Comprehensive Framework and Directions for Future Research	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						leadership; emergent leadership; leader emergence; framework	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SHARED LEADERSHIP; SOCIAL NETWORK; MEMBER EXCHANGE; VIRTUAL TEAMS; GENDER-ROLE; PERSONALITY; PERFORMANCE; TASK; METAANALYSIS	There has been increasing attention to examining informal (i.e., horizontal), rather than formal (i.e., vertical), approaches to leadership over the last several decades, enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of emergent leadership. Although such research has led to a growing comprehension of the process of, and factors involved in, leader emergence, the literature still lacks theoretical coherence. Without a clear way to connect and synthesize extant research, the time is right for a much-needed comprehensive review. To address this issue, we examine emergent leadership research to date with the aim of developing a concise overview and comprehensive framework of the literature. In doing so, we (1) review past conceptualizations, establish a clear, common definition, and compare emergent leadership to other related constructs; (2) review previous operationalizations and provide recommendations for future measurement; (3) develop a comprehensive organizing framework of existing research; and (4) use our organizing framework, as well as three existing theories related to emergent leadership, to generate a series of detailed suggestions for future research for the next decade and beyond.

J	Linden, E				Linden, Erik			Pandemics and environmental shocks: What aviation managers should learn from COVID-19 for long-term planning	JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Air transport; Environmental shocks; Uncertainty; Strategic planning; Strategy process	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; LARGE ORGANIZATIONS; BOARD INVOLVEMENT; AS-PRACTICE; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; UNCERTAINTY; DISCOURSE; ROUTINES	This article gives guidance to aviation managers being struck by environmental shocks. The introduced frameworks support aviation managers to think strategically during times of shocks and help them to prepare for future shocks by developing more resilient and learning organizations. Practical, short-term recommendations include strategically orienting or reorienting and not exaggerating the current, short-term developments due to unproductive uncertainty. Further, and to prepare for future shocks, the results of this study suggest that aviation managers should develop a common strategy language, introduce uncertainty as a standard factor for long-term planning, manage uncertainty proactively and make long-term plans accordingly by fostering a dialogue with various stakeand shareholders, being aware of the strategy tools in use, making the board a co-creating team and introducing a three-step process in sensing, seizing and transforming the organization accordingly.

This study evaluates the critical processes, patterns, and impact factors of the carbon footprint of grain production in China based on a new scale data set: agricultural statistics data of over 300 prefecture-level regions. Results show that fertilizer application, straw burning, and methane emissions in rice paddy are the main causes of GHG emissions. High production carbon footprint (PCF) typically appears in areas with low crop yield, whereas low PCF appears in areas with intensive pro-duction. Longitude, altitude, and per unit yield are significant correlated with the methane emissions in rice paddy. The increase in GHG emissions from fertilizer application on per unit crop yield highly contributes to the increase in PCF. Moreover, longitude, latitude, and soil properties are the most important factors in PCF variation. Promoting large-scale and intensive modern agriculture production remains a key measure to mitigate GHG emission.

J	Xie, XM; Wang, HW				Xie, Xuemei; Wang, Hongwei			How to bridge the gap between innovation niches and exploratory and exploitative innovations in open innovation ecosystems	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Open innovation ecosystem; Innovation niche; Exploratory innovation; Exploitative innovation; Innovation ecological network	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; MEDIATING ROLE; SOCIOTECHNICAL TRANSITION; BUSINESS ECOSYSTEMS; PRODUCT INNOVATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS; COLLABORATION; STRATEGIES	In the context of open innovation business environments, more and more firms are joining together and creating innovation ecosystems to improve their innovation capabilities by interacting with heterogeneous actors. Yet, there has been little research that has examined the mechanisms regarding how and when firms within such open innovation ecosystems could enhance their innovation capabilities. To address this gap, we propose and empirically test a conceptual framework for understanding the internal mechanisms and contextual conditions in the relationship between a firm's innovation niche and its exploratory and exploitative innovations. Using a sample of 327 Chinese manufacturing firms in strategic emerging industries, we find that a firm's innovation niche within an open innovation ecosystem has a positive impact on its exploratory and exploitative innovations, and we demonstrate that these relationships are mediated by the innovation ecological network. Additionally, we find that the innovation ecological environment moderates the relationship between a firm's innovation niche and the innovation ecological network. Furthermore, we show that the innovation ecological environment moderates the indirect effects of a firm's innovation niche on its exploratory and exploitative innovations via the innovation ecological network. These results not only enrich the research on open innovation ecosystems but also provide important managerial implications for implementing innovation niche initiatives to foster firms' exploratory and exploitative innovations.

J	Ragan, R; Dhir, S; Sushil				Ragan, Rishabh; Dhir, Sanjay; Sushil			Technology management for innovation in organizations: an argumentation-based modified TISM approach	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Innovation; Technology alliance; Modified total interpretive structural modeling; TISM	HUMAN-RESOURCE PRACTICES; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; STRUCTURAL MODELING TISM; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; TRANSFER POLICIES; MEDIATING ROLE; PERFORMANCE	Purpose In the rapidly changing business world, innovation plays a vital role for organizations to gain a competitive advantage. Various factors associated with technology management and innovations in organizations are diverse in the existing literature. Therefore, there is a need to bridge these gaps in the fitting proportions toward innovations within organizations. The primary objective of this study is to identify, explain and interpret the relationships between the identified technology-related factors that are important for innovations in organizations. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a modified total interpretive structural modeling (M-TISM) methodology was used to examine and analyze the various interactions between identified factors for innovations in organizations. However, the argumentation of the links is relatively weak in M-TISM. In order to compensate for this, M-TISM is additionally altered by an "Argumentation-based Modified TISM". Hence, this research strengthens the modified TISM methodology by incorporating argumentation and total interpretation of the relationships between the identified factors. Findings A total of six major factors were identified using a literature review. Results suggest that workforce technical skills, technological infrastructure, technological alliances, technology transfer and top management support have an impact on innovation in organizations. Results also suggest that top management support and the technological infrastructure of an organization have a greater impact on innovation. Research limitations/implications For policymakers and practitioners, this study provides a suggestive list of critical factors, which may help to develop policies or guidelines for improving innovation in organizations. Policymakers should focus on technological infrastructure and collaborations to enhance innovations and productions within the organizations. For academicians, this study provides a modified TISM model that shows the impact of technology-related factors on innovations. Future researchers could expand this study by adding a greater number of technological factors and validate this model in other industries. Originality/value This study fills a gap in the literature by interpreting the various relationships among the identified factors and innovations. The model has been validated through a panel of seven experts from the Indian automotive industry of multiple organizations. This study is useful in the automobile industry as it determines what and how technology-related factors affect innovations, process improvement and R&D production for organizations.

However, implementation of BCT in HSC discerns several barriers. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify and model the block chain implementation barriers in the context of HSC. Design/methodology/approach In the present study, 14 potential barriers to BCT adoption in HSC have been identified through literature survey. The survey comprises white papers, pilot studies, conference proceedings and journal articles. Further, the identified barriers were finalised in consultation with a team of experts. The team comprised experienced stakeholders working in the humanitarian domain and BCT development. The barriers were categorised into four (technological, organisational, exogenous and economic) perspectives adopting the kappa statistics. Further, the barriers were prioritised using fuzzy best worst method (FBWM) approach. Later, sensitivity analysis was performed to check the robustness and viability of the model. Findings The findings from the study indicate that the barriers, such as "data privacy, ownership, and security issues" (B1), "funding issues and cost complexity" (B3) and "technological complexities" (B8), are relatively more influential. The HSC stakeholders and BCT developers are required to identify the safety mechanism against the misuse of victim's data. The funding issues and technological complexities are interrelated and need synergetic cooperation between blockchain developers, donors, humanitarian organisations (HOs) and other HSC stakeholders. Further, "lack of awareness and understanding among stakeholders" (B6) and "interoperability, collaboration and cross-pollination among HOs" (B5) were identified as least influential barriers to BCT adoption in HSC. Research limitations/implications In literature, limited study has been observed on determining barriers to BCT implementation. A more systematic method and statistical confirmation is necessary to establish further new confronting barriers. This study is limited to Indian context. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is first of its kind to use an FBWM approach for prioritising the barriers to BCT adoption in the context of HSC. The study provides potential barriers to BCT and categorises them into four different perspectives, along with their degree of influence.

J	Norgren, A; Carpenter, A; Heath, G				Norgren, Alex; Carpenter, Alberta; Heath, Garvin			Design for Recycling Principles Applicable to Selected Clean Energy Technologies: Crystalline-Silicon Photovoltaic Modules, Electric Vehicle Batteries, and Wind Turbine Blades	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE METALLURGY			English	Article						DfR; Circular economy; Renewable energy; Photovoltaics; PV; Batteries; Wind	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; SEPARATION; RECOVERY	The global growth of clean energy technology deployment will be followed by parallel growth in end-of-life (EOL) products, bringing both challenges and opportunities. Cumulatively, by 2050, estimates project 78 million tonnes of raw materials embodied in the mass of EOL photovoltaic (PV) modules, 12 billion tonnes of wind turbine blades, and by 2030, 11 million tonnes of lithium-ion batteries. Owing partly to concern that the projected growth of these technologies could become constrained by raw material availability, processes for recycling them at EOL continue to be developed. However, none of these technologies are typically designed with recycling in mind, and all of them present challenges to efficient recycling. This article synthesizes and extends design for recycling (DfR) principles based on a review of published industrial and academic best practices as well as consultation with experts in the field. Specific principles developed herein apply to crystalline-silicon PV modules, batteries like those used in electric vehicles, and wind turbine blades, while a set of broader principles applies to all three of these technologies and potentially others. These principles are meant to be useful for stakeholders-such as research and development managers, analysts, and policymakers-in informing and promoting decisions that facilitate DfR and, ultimately, increase recycling rates as a way to enhance the circularity of the clean energy economy. The article also discusses some commercial implications of DfR.Graphical Abstract	[Norgren, Alex; Carpenter, Alberta; Heath, Garvin] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Strateg Energy Anal Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Norgren, Alex; Heath, Garvin] Joint Inst Strateg Energy Anal, Golden, CO 80401 USA		Heath, G (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Strateg Energy Anal Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.; Heath, G (corresponding author), Joint Inst Strateg Energy Anal, Golden, CO 80401 USA.

Organizational identity elasticity and strategic responses to disruptive innovation	JOURNAL OF FAMILY BUSINESS STRATEGY			English	Article						Organizational identity; Strategic adaptation; Disruptive innovation; Business families	SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; SOCIAL IDENTITY; FIRMS; ADOPTION; THREATS; FUTURE; DIRECTIONS; CRISIS; IMPACT	Organizational identity represents a characterizing aspect of family firms with the potential to drive their heterogeneity and decision making. While the intertwined relationship between organizational identity and strategy is increasingly receiving attention from scholars in general management, research in the family firm field has yet to tackle it. Building on the construct of organizational identity elasticity, we conceptually examine how heterogeneity of family firms' organizational identities influences, and is affected by, strategic decisions. We ground our conceptual investigation in the ideal context of disruptive innovation, a technology shift that might eventually threaten the traditional solution of an incumbent family firm. Thus, our study contributes by unveiling the multifaceted and dynamic nature of organizational identity in relation to family firm strategy and develops a novel perspective on typologies in family firms by identifying the theoretical underpinnings of the distinction between family business and business family archetypes. In addition, we advance the emerging debate on family firms' interaction with exogenous technological changes.

We propose a two-stage theoretical model-first, a lead firm is selected to lead the alliance; second, the lead firm selects other partners- and we argue that political risk affects both stages. In the first stage, firms with knowledge of and influence in the project country are selected to lead projects in countries with high political risk. In the second stage, the lead firm selects a group of partners with knowledge and influence to ensure that the alliance-as a whole-has the resources needed in such countries. We also show, as a corollary, that the imperative to find these resources drives the lead firm to work with more-diverse multipartner alliances despite the higher coordination costs involved. We test our hypotheses by analyzing, first, the selection of the lead firm in 1,044 multipartner banking syndicates that financed some of the world's largest infrastructure projects in 68 countries between 2003 and 2012. Controlling for the lead firm, we then examine how political risk affects the selection of other partners in the multipartner alliance by comparing the realized syndicates with over 33,000 counterfactual (unrealized) multipartner syndicates.

J	Motlaghzadeh, K; Kerachian, R; Tavvafi, A				Motlaghzadeh, Kasra; Kerachian, Reza; Tavvafi, Aidin			An evidential reasoning-based leader-follower game for hierarchical multi-agent decision making under uncertainty	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Water resources; Evidential reasoning; Game theory; Leader-follower; Multi-level decision making; Lake Urmia	WATER; MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHM	In multi-agent decision making, agents' decisions are coherently interdependent, and the objectives of agents are possibly inconsistent. In this type of decision-making, agents need to reason and act strategically. Therefore, game theory can be used to study the strategic interactions among decision-makers. This paper presents a new hierarchical decision-making methodology, which uses the advantages of both game theory (i.e. Stackelberg leadership model) and Evidential Reasoning (ER). ER, as a multi-attribute decision-making method, considers both qualitative and quantitative attributes, and incorporates existing uncertainties in evaluating alternatives. The backward induction method and Monte-Carlo theory are used to solve the deterministic and stochastic forms of the proposed leader-follower game. The methodology is applied to choose the best restoration scenario for Urmia Lake, which is the biggest saltwater lake in the Middle East. In the past decade, the lake's surface area has dramatically decreased due to climate change and an anthropogenic drought. In this paper, 19 lake restoration scenarios have been evaluated, and a scenario, which is corresponding to a 40% reduction in agricultural water consumption and water release from Nezam Abad dam, is found to be the equilibrium solution for both types of the game.

J	Parashar, S; Sood, G; Agrawal, N				Parashar, Sapna; Sood, Gunjan; Agrawal, Nishant			Modelling the enablers of food supply chain for reduction in carbon footprint	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Carbon footprint reduction; Food supply chain; Food wastage; Sustainability; Interpretive structural modelling; MICMAC Analysis	INVENTORY MANAGEMENT; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; RISK-MANAGEMENT; INTEGRATED ISM; TRACEABILITY; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; COLLABORATION; QUALITY	Reducing carbon footprints has become a pertinent global issue. The creation of carbon footprints is germane in the food supply chain owing to food-wastage. Food is a valuable commodity that not only quickly transforms to waste but also adversely impacts the environment. It leads to loss of labour hours, futile resources, unfed lives, lost profits and an increase in environmental hazards. With this backdrop, the present study aims to identify the key enablers which are crucial in diminishing the inefficiencies across the entire food supply chain. Interpretive structural modelling and matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classification techniques are used to understand the interdependence of the shortlisted enablers. The study provides holistic and practical insights to the stakeholders for improving the effectiveness of their firms by level partitioning the enablers as 'givens' (regulations and governance), 'means' (technology, financial implication, perishability, logistics and traceability) and 'ends' (inventory management, storage, collaboration, trust, hygiene, packaging and information sharing). The research findings will facilitate the strategic decision making regarding the reduction in the wastage of food thereby diminishing the level of carbon footprint creation. Apart from providing significant implications for the policymakers, the results also add the theoretical implications in the extant literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Toubiana, M				Toubiana, Madeline			ONCE IN ORANGE ALWAYS IN ORANGE? IDENTITY PARALYSIS AND THE ENDURING INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS ON IDENTITY	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY; COMPETING LOGICS; JUSTICE POLICY; WORK; ORGANIZATIONS; RISK; INEQUALITY; COMPLEXITY; CONSTRUCTION; PERSPECTIVES	We know that individuals' identities can become intertwined with institutions through processes of identification. But what happens when individuals need or desire to disentangle their identities from institutions after identification has taken place? In this paper, I examine previously incarcerated men's efforts to de-identify with the institutional logics associated with prison as they transition back into society. While past work has tended to characterize de-identification efforts as ultimately successful, I reveal how individuals can remain stuck in their identifications and experience identity paralysis. In doing so I add nuance to our understanding of de-identification by revealing the factors that can contribute to its breakdown and failure. I highlight specifically the importance of identity material and the content of institutional logics in influencing de-identification processes, and thus extend the existing focus on the cognitive accessibility of logics. Importantly, I reveal that challenges to de-identification result not merely from the individuals "holding on" to old targets but rather from their becoming stuck and resigning themselves to existing targets when they simultaneously feel they lack identity material to realize new identities and face negative social evaluations. Indeed my findings point to the powerful and durable ways in which institutions shape our identities even when we desire to change them.

J	Zhang, W; Fan, X; Liu, YT; Wang, SG; Chen, B				Zhang, Wen; Fan, Xing; Liu, Yating; Wang, Saige; Chen, Bin			Spillover risk analysis of virtual water trade based on multi-regional input-output model -A case study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Spillover risk; Virtual water trade; Virtual scarce water; Physical water use; Agriculture	INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; FOOTPRINT; LAND; CHINA; FOOD; TRANSFERS; SCARCITY; FLOWS; NEXUS	Massive amounts of water embodied in commodities are transferred via interregional trade which increase the water scarcity risk of exporting region. This study proposed an integrated evaluation framework for sectoral physical water use risks and virtual water flow risks in Northeast China. The initial water use risks for different sectors by provinces were first assessed based on sectoral physical water consumption. Then based on the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model, a virtual water trade network was established, and simultaneously the virtual scarce water in sectoral export of intermediate goods and final goods were accounted to investigate the virtual water flow risks by sectors. Finally, interprovincial embodied scarce water transfers between Northeast China and the rest of China were mapped, and by grafting the concept of 'spillover risk' to the virtual water trade, we analyzed the spillover risk difference of virtual water trade between regions. The results showed that the sectors of Agriculture (Ag) and Other manufacturing (OM) presented the highest risk of water use while Nonmetal mining (NmM) belonged to the potential high-risk sectors of water use for Northeast China. The sectors exported more virtual scarce water in intermediate goods also exported more in the final goods; and the sector of Manufacture of food products and tobacco processing (FP) was the largest contributor to the large exporting virtual scarce water for Liaoning and Jilin while Ag in Heilongjiang province was the largest exporter. The cumulative spillover risk index from rest of China to Liaoning province through virtual water trade is the highest; and the main risk spilt provinces to Northeast China were Xinjiang, Jiangsu, Anhui and Hebei province. The proposed risk framework for water utilization and trade may help promote the redistribution of water resources and explore pathways for sustainable management of water resources.

PLAYING IT SAFE FOR MY FAMILY: EXPLORING THE DUAL EFFECTS OF FAMILY MOTIVATION ON EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY AND CREATIVITY	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY; WORKING SMART; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; LEARNING-BEHAVIOR; JOB; GENDER; PERFORMANCE; ORIENTATION; SATISFACTION; IDENTITY	Research has shown that family motivation exerts an energizing effect on employee performance. Challenging this, we argue that family motivation is a double-edged sword with both an energizing and a debilitating effect on employee performance, depending on the performance criterion in question. Specifically, drawing upon self-determination theory and the "hard work versus smart work" framework, we hypothesize that family motivation is positively related to employee productivity via enhanced work effort (i.e., energizing effect). However, family motivation also stimulates employees to see their jobs as a means to gain financial support for their family, rather than an end in itself, which is associated with lower levels of creativity (i.e., debilitating effect). We further propose that employees' family motivation is higher when they experience higher levels of family financial pressure, and that financial pressure is more strongly related to family motivation for women than for men. We find support for our hypotheses in a sample of 187 low-wage, blue-collar workers and a sample of 439 relatively high-income, white- collar employees. We also conduct a qualitative study with 40 high-income employees; results provide a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which family motivation shapes perceptions of the job and subsequent behaviors and outcomes.

In this study, a framework and its accounting model of phosphorus flow analysis in urban household consumption system by means of SFA (substance flow analysis) was constructed. Based on the accounting model, the flow of phosphorus in the urban household consumption system of Dar es Salaam was described quantitatively, and the results demonstrated: (1) the total phosphorus input, stock and output of urban household consumption system in Dar es Salaam were 4874t of P, 59t of P and 4815t of P, respectively. In terms of system input of phosphorus, residents' food consumption had a decisive impact on the system's phosphorus input (4765t of P, 97.76%), while the contribution of detergent to the phosphorus input of the system was small. In terms of system phosphorus output, human feces and urine phosphorus output accounted for the majority of the total system phosphorus output (2313t of P, 48.04%). The total phosphorus output of domestic garbage, wastewater and food processing loss were 1464t of P (30.41%), 561t of P (11.65%), 477t of P (9.90%), respectively. (2) There were 2314t of P discharged into surface water through human feces and urine and domestic wastewater, which had a negative impact on the prevention and control of surface water pollution. 34t of P came from scattered garbage storage and 315t of P came from centralized garbage storage due to limited treatment capacity of waste treatment plant. Centralized storage and decentralized storage increased the risk of further phosphate loss. (3) Accelerated urbanization, rapid economic development and low sewage treatment capacity would cause more phosphorus loss, and Dar es Salaam faced great challenges in P discharge reduction and pollution control. Finally, we proposed policy recommendations for P discharge reduction including the guidance to the reasonable dietary structure with low phosphorus, the promotion of cleaning products with less phosphorus and no phosphorus, and the construction of garbage treatment and sewage treatment infrastructure.

Study design and operational framework for a community-based Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project (MEDP) in 1233 villages of district Mandla, Madhya Pradesh	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Malaria elimination; Strategic planning; Operational framework; Monitoring and evaluation; India		Background In the past decade substantial reduction in malaria morbidity and mortality has been observed through well-implemented case management and vector control strategies. India has also achieved a significant reduction in malaria burden in 2018 and has committed to eliminate malaria by 2030. The Mandla Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project (MEDP) was started in 2017 in 1233 villages of District Mandla to demonstrate malaria elimination in a tribal district with hard-to-reach areas was possible using active and passive surveillance, case management, vector control, and targeted information, education and communication campaigns. An operational plan was developed to strengthen the existing surveillance and malaria elimination systems, through fortnightly active case detection to ensure that all cases including those that are introduced into the communities are rapidly identified and treated promptly. The plan also focused on the reduction of human-mosquito contact through the use of Long-Lasting Insecticial Nets (LLINs) and Indoor Residual Spray (IRS). The operational plan was modified in view of the present COVID-19 pandemic by creating systems of assistance for the local administration for COVID-related work while ensuring the operational integrity of malaria elimination efforts. Results The use of MEDP study design and operational plan, with its built-in management control systems, has yielded significant (91%) reduction of indigenous cases of malaria during the period from June 2017 to May 2020. The malaria positivity rate was 0.33% in 2017-18, 0.13% in 2018-19, and 0.06% in 2019-20. Mass screening revealed 0.18% malaria positivity in September-October 2018, followed by 0.06% in June 2019, and 0.03% in December 2019, and these were mostly asymptomatic cases in the community. The project has been able to sustain the gains of the past three years during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion This paper provides the study design and the operational plan for malaria elimination in a high-burden district of Central India, which presented difficulties of hard to reach areas, forest malaria, and complex epidemiology of urban and rural malaria. The lessons learned could be used for malaria elimination efforts in rest of the country and other parts of South Asia with comparable demography and epidemiology.

User-centric analyses are useful both in terms of the socio-technical perspective on data usage within the educational domain and the positive impact that data-driven methods have. Moreover, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and process innovation has emerged due to the strategic perspectives and the process monitoring that have shown to be missing within the traditional education curricula. This study shows that there is an unprecedented increase in the amount of text-based data in different activities within the educational processes, which can be leveraged to provide useful strategic intelligence and improvement insights. Educators can apply the resultant methods and technologies, process innovations, and contextual-based information for ample support and monitoring of the teaching-learning processes and decision making. To this effect, this paper proposes an Educational Process and Data Mining (EPDM) model that leverages the perspectives or opinions of the students to provide useful information that can be used to enhance the end-to-end processes within the educational domain. Theoretically, this study applies the model to determine how the students evaluate their teachers by considering the gender of the teachers. We analyzed the underlying patterns and determined the emotional valence of the students based on their comments in the Students Evaluation of Teaching (SET). Thus, this work implements the proposed EPDM model using SET comments captured in a setting of higher education.

J	Hu, Z; Wang, M; Cheng, Z; Yang, ZS				Hu, Zhen; Wang, Mei; Cheng, Zhe; Yang, Zhenshan			Impact of marginal and intergenerational effects on carbon emissions from household energy consumption in China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Energy consumption; Marginal effect; Intergenerational effect	DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; AGE-GROUPS; POPULATION; INCOME; PANEL; URBAN; URBANIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; COUNTRIES; UK	As an important part of urban carbon emissions, the carbon emissions from household energy consumption are increasing with the continuous improvement of Chinese urbanization. This study divides family population into 4 groups: adolescents (aged 0-17), young people (aged 18-44), middle-aged people (aged 45-59), and elderly people (aged 60 and older) and develops a calculation model for carbon emissions of household energy consumption in accordance with the latest standards of the World Health Organization based on Chinese Family Panel Studies in 2016. Results showed that the marginal and intergenerational effects coexist in various types of household energy consumption: Families with 3-5 people have the most economical consumption scale and the largest marginal sharing effect; multigenerational families or families with a large proportion of middle-aged and older people are beneficial in reducing household energy consumption. This paper suggests it is important to fully consider the impact of the intergenerational effect, marginal effect, and cultural shock caused by the electronic information age on household energy consumption when formulating standards of household energy consumption.

J	Jouber, H				Jouber, Habib			Is the effect of board diversity on CSR diverse? New insights from one-tier vs two-tier corporate board models	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Board of directors; Corporate social responsibility; One-tier board; Two-tier board; Board diversity	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY DISCLOSURE; FEMALE DIRECTORS; OF-DIRECTORS; ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY; STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; GENDER DIVERSITY; FAMILY; WOMEN; GOVERNANCE	Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of board diversity on corporate social responsibility (CSR). The aim is twofold; does board diversity has any effect on CSR, do structural and demographic differences between one-tier and two-tier board models may impact this effect? Design/methodology/approach This paper applies a panel generalized method of moments estimator to a sample of 2,544 non-financial listed firms from 42 countries over the period of 2013-2017. Findings The findings reveal that board diversity leads to effective CSR. By distinguishing between diversity among boards from diversity within boards, the results display the effects of the specific variables that make up the manner and latter's constructs within unitary and two-tier board structures. Specifically, this paper reveals that tenure, ideology and educational level (gender and nationality) predominantly appear to drive a firm's CSR within one (two)-tier boards settings. These results remain consistent when robustness tests are ruled. Practical implications The study provides managers, investors and policymakers with knowledge about how among and within board diversity attributes favor the decision-making process around CSR. The evidence is useful for companies in setting the criteria to identify directors who can support their strategic decisions. It benefits, moreover, academics in better understanding firms' CSR determinants and practices under different corporate board models. Social implications Examining how different sets of board diversity affect firms' CSR given divergences between one-tier and two-tier board structure is a useful and informative endeavor for all community actors. Originality/value Unlike prior studies that identify the limited scope of diversity, the study is the first to examine the effect of broader dimensions of board diversity on CSR under both one-tier and two-tier board settings. This paper provides a contribution to a greater understanding of the impacts underlying board models and different attributes of board diversity on CSR. This new understanding will help to improve predictions of different features of board diversity impacts on decision-making processes around organizational outcomes.

J	De Cos, O; Castillo, V; Cantarero, D				De Cos, Olga; Castillo, Valentin; Cantarero, David			Facing a Second Wave from a Regional View: Spatial Patterns of COVID-19 as a Key Determinant for Public Health and Geoprevention Plans	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						spatial patterns; COVID-19; microdata; geographic information technologies; ArcGIS; public health; geoprevention		Several studies on spatial patterns of COVID-19 show huge differences depending on the country or region under study, although there is some agreement that socioeconomic factors affect these phenomena. The aim of this paper is to increase the knowledge of the socio-spatial behavior of coronavirus and implementing a geospatial methodology and digital system called SITAR (Fast Action Territorial Information System, by its Spanish acronym). We analyze as a study case a region of Spain called Cantabria, geocoding a daily series of microdata coronavirus records provided by the health authorities (Government of Cantabria-Spain) with the permission of Medicines Ethics Committee from Cantabria (CEIm, June 2020). Geocoding allows us to provide a new point layer based on the microdata table that includes cases with a positive result in a COVID-19 test. Regarding general methodology, our research is based on Geographical Information Technologies using Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Technologies. This tool is a global reference for spatial COVID-19 research, probably due to the world-renowned COVID-19 dashboard implemented by the Johns Hopkins University team. In our analysis, we found that the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in urban locations presents a not random distribution with clustered patterns and density matters in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, large metropolitan areas or districts with a higher number of persons tightly linked together through economic, social, and commuting relationships are the most vulnerable to pandemic outbreaks, particularly in our case study. Furthermore, public health and geoprevention plans should avoid the idea of economic or territorial stigmatizations. We hold the idea that SITAR in particular and Geographic Information Technologies in general contribute to strategic spatial information and relevant results with a necessary multi-scalar perspective to control the pandemic.

Empirical tests based on a 4-year linked employee-customer panel data set, involving 255 do-it-yourself stores, support our predictions. Transformational leadership is positively related to HPWS consensus. Consensus is negatively associated with unit-level job satisfaction dispersion, which in turn relates positively to unit-level customer satisfaction. Our study makes important contributions to the strategic HR and HR system strength literatures, highlighting the roles of leadership and employee consensus in strategy execution.

The influence of perceived host country political risk on foreign subunits' supplier development strategies	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						case study; inductive research; legitimacy; political risk; global operations; supply chain strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES; CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES; LOCATION CHOICE; ORGANIZATIONAL LEGITIMACY; PARTNER SELECTION; ENTRY STRATEGIES; BUILDING-BLOCKS; CHAIN PRACTICES	Recent protectionist trends (e.g., trade wars, Brexit) have challenged the stability of the global supply chains (SCs) of multinational corporations. While the SC and operations management (SC/OM) literature has examined how such sources of political risk influence strategic SC/OM decisions at the global level, we know little about how host country political risk influences the SC/OM practices of foreign subunits at the local level. We conducted an exploratory, multiple-case study of western subunits operating in China to investigate whether managers of foreign subunits in a host country perceive political risk; and if so, how they adapt their SC/OM strategic choices to reduce its impact on their subunits. Our empirical findings suggest that variations in political risk perceptions create different political legitimacy goals that subunits attempt to meet by adapting their supplier development strategies. We induct a process model and identify three archetypes of supplier development strategy-self-centered, collaborative, and voluntary-adopted by subunits to shape their legitimacy and mitigate political risk. We contribute to the SC/OM literature by theorizing SC/OM managers' perceived political risk, showing how foreign subunits may use supplier development to influence how the host government views them, and by complementing traditional "corporate" legitimacy-seeking strategies with new "SC/OM" legitimacy-seeking strategies.

J	Rabetino, R; Kohtamaki, M; Federico, JS				Rabetino, Rodrigo; Kohtamaki, Marko; Federico, Juan S.			A (Re)view of the Philosophical Foundations of Strategic Management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT REVIEWS			English	Article							RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; AS-PRACTICE; ORGANIZATIONAL SCIENCE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; SPECIAL-ISSUE; INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; USEFUL PERSPECTIVE	This paper aims to review how different approaches to social inquiry (e.g. positivist, postpositivist, interpretive, postmodernist and critical theory) have been used in strategy research and how these main paradigms engage with strategy. In a fragmented domain, debates typically match paradigms to schools of thought and use the paradigm concept, sometimes even promiscuously, to examine the underlying premises of different theories. Thus, scholars tend to overlook the debate on philosophical meta-theoretical assumptions (ontological, epistemological and methodological) and prefer onto-epistemological approaches that are considered to be 'normal science', which underestimate the contributions of certain less traditional streams of research. This review offers a fresh view of the philosophical foundations of the strategic literature by combining author co-citation and content analysis of a sample of academic sources and analyses both the meta-theoretical assumptions and the basic paradigmatic assumptions for central constructs that strategy researchers attach to their frameworks (e.g. strategy, environment, firm and strategist). This endeavour enables scholars who work in a multidisciplinary field to gain a better understanding of the philosophical beliefs, principles and conventions held by different research communities and theoretical approaches. Exposing the underlying assumptions, as is done in this study, is a key step in theory development. Hence, this review can help researchers, young scholars and doctoral students navigate a confusing research landscape, problematize the existing literature and set new research questions.

In this work, a dual-functional ultrafiltration (DFUF) membrane was fabricated by loading hollow mesoporous carbon nanospheres (HMCNs) into the finger-like support layer pores of the polymeric ultrafiltration (UF) membrane. The designed DFUF membrane combines the high selectivity of ultrafiltration that removes macromolecules based on size exclusion mechanism, and excellent adsorption capacity of HMCNs towards micropollutants in water. When tetracycline (TCN) and 17 beta-Estradiol (E2) were selected as model micropollutants, corresponding 97 % and 94 % removal were achieved at a low pressure less than 0.15 bar and a flux of 50 and 64 L h(-1) m(-2) (estimated residence time less than 6 s), respectively. Moreover, simultaneous removal of multiple pollutants was demonstrated by filtering a mixture containing TCN and polyethylene glycols (PEG) 600 kDa macromolecules. Over a long filtration period (more than 60 h) that produced 3180 L/m(2) of permeate, the TCN concentration reduced from 100 mu g/L in the feed to less than 10 mu g/L in the permeate. The above results indicate that the DFUF membrane is capable of removing the small molecular and macromolecular pollutants simultaneously at low pressure, and hence offers remarkable potential in water treatment applications.

J	Jacqueminet, A; Durand, R				Jacqueminet, Anne; Durand, Rodolphe			UPS AND DOWNS: THE ROLE OF LEGITIMACY JUDGMENT CUES IN PRACTICE IMPLEMENTATION	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY; SYMBOLIC MANAGEMENT; MULTILEVEL THEORY; GOVERNANCE; ISOMORPHISM; STRATEGIES; RESPONSES; ADOPTION	We explore the way validity and propriety cues contribute to legitimacy judgments about a practice and to explaining whether the subunit of a large firm increases or decreases the implementation of this practice. Empirically, we examine the extent to which 65 subsidiaries of a multinational enterprise implemented three corporate social responsibility practices. Adopting a set-theoretic approach, we find that both validity and propriety cues are extremely relevant to the understanding of subunits' implementation of practices over time. The endorsement of a practice in a subunit's environment plays a particularly crucial role in the extent to which it is implemented, relative to authorization by the parent firm. Furthermore, subunits strongly rely on the active evaluation of the practice's propriety, such that the consonance between the two propriety dimensions (strategic importance and value compatibility) is central to implementation increase, while dissonance between them can favor implementation decrease. By advancing our understanding of legitimacy judgment formation and practice implementation patterns, our study enriches explanations of organizational conformity and decoupling, and contributes to our understanding of how firms respond to multiple institutional demands.

NETWORK IMPACT OF SOCIAL INNOVATION INITIATIVES IN MARGINALISED RURAL COMMUNITIES	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Social Innovation; Marginalised Rural Areas; Farmers Communities; Network Intervention; Social Network Analysis; Rural Hub	AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; FARMERS; AREA	The marginalised rural communities are characterised by societal challenges, such as isolation, lack of job opportunities, land abandonment, low quality of life and generally low education. Social Innovation (SI) initiatives may represent an opportunity to strengthen relationships among the members of rural community, by means of the alteration of the existing social networks. In this way, more exchange of information is expected, paving the way for the creation of professional collaborations among firms and other actors. This paper aims at proposing a short-term evaluation framework of effectiveness of a SI initiative in terms of reconfiguration of the social network structure. The described empirical case study is VaZapp', a rural hub located in Southern Italy, which provides innovative solutions to activate social relations amongst farmers, altering hence their network. A well-referenced SI theoretical model, developed within the H2020 project SIMRA (Social Innovation in Marginalised Rural Areas), and the methodology of Social Network Analysis (SNA) were used to verify and measure quantitative and qualitative indicators affected by network intervention activated by VaZapp' initiative. Results show that this SI initiative worked effectively, leading to a +308% in the number of relations and +250% in social network density. In addition, an evident improvement in the quality of the social relations was found, especially in cases where there are direct engagements within VaZapp'.

Without satisfying the customers, banking business cannot stand alone. To satisfy customers, it is often recommended to provide better quality banking services to the bank customers. Providing quality banking services has become a prime strategic tool for the banking sector nowadays. Therefore, the study investigates the effect of various dimensions of service quality of banking service on customer satisfaction in a developing country, Bangladesh. A total of 212 walking Bangladeshi banking customers participated in this research. A structured questionnaire was developed based on past research. SPSS is utilized for analysis and Likert scale was used in this study. Internal consistency of all items was found correct and a total of seven hypotheses were proposed. For testing, a 5% significance level is considered for acceptance of hypothesis. The findings show that, except employee competency, all other variables such as reliability, assurance, tangibles, responsiveness, empathy, and access to service have positive influence on customer satisfaction. The study provides policy implications for the management boards of the banking sectors.

We specifically examine the challenges posed by the current COVID-19 pandemic (and possible future similar eventualities) and the current and long-term strategies being planned to combat such crises. Design/methodology/approach To reveal the real-life scenario, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 academic leaders (Deans and Directors) of B-schools in India. These respondents were from both public and private institutions across the country. Open-ended questions were framed for exploration to help the authors understand the way forward in the Indian B-school context. Findings Findings reveal that B-schools in India are preparing themselves to overcome short-term challenges faced due to COVID-19 as well as transforming themselves through long-term strategies. Originality/value The study outlines strategic plans for some imaginative reassessments that B-schools may consider as a reaction to a pandemic-like emergency. The focus is on distinguishing the imperatives, creating a key guide for meeting immediate requirements, allotting assets in a prudent way to update educational course curricula and teaching methods and building the required academic infrastructure. The ability to focus on enduring changes (e.g. creating an e-learning framework and providing a safe and secure learning environment to students as per government mandates) will provide B-schools with a new lease of life in the future.

This is understandable as companies all over the world over are facing contemporary challenges such as intense global competition, rising market volatility, constantly changing consumer demand, and shortened product life cycles. Under these conditions, disruptive innovation and disruptive innovation-based entrepreneurship are increasingly becoming a strategic means for achieving sustainable company growth and competitiveness. Yet, limited research exists today on disruptive innovations in or by emerging economies. Therefore, this Special Issue in Journal of Engineering and Technology Management on Disruptive Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economics is devoted to publishing original research that enriches our knowledge about the nature of disruptive innovation and entrepreneurship related with emerging economies, as well as their models, antecedents and economic, social and organizational consequences. The issue also highlights key research areas of disruptive innovation and innovation-based entrepreneurship for future scholarship, inviting more systematic research on the important areas.

Scale dependence of effective geochemical rates in weathering mine waste rock	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Scale dependence; Mine waste rock; Weathering rates; Drainage prediction; Reactive-transport modeling	MULTIPHASE TRANSFER PROCESSES; REACTIVE TRANSPORT; DRAINAGE PREDICTION; PYRITE OXIDATION; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; EVOLUTION; KINETICS; FLOW	Hydrogeochemical models for the prediction of drainage quality from full-scale mine waste-rock piles are often parameterized using data from small-scale laboratory or field experiments of short duration. Yet, many model parameters and processes (e.g., sulfide-oxidation rates) vary strongly with the spatiotemporal dimensions of the experiment: the "upscaling" of prediction models remains a critical challenge for mine-waste management worldwide. Here, we investigate scale dependence in laboratory and field experiments that spanned orders-ofmagnitude in size (i.e. 2 kg to 100,000 kg) at the Antamina mine in Peru. Normalized drainage mass loading rates systematically decreased with increasing scale, irrespective of waste-rock type. A process-based reactivetransport model was used to simulate observed rates and reproduce the geochemical composition of drainage across scales. Long-term trends in drainage quality could be quantitatively reproduced when the model was parameterized with mostly scale- and experiment-specific measured bulk properties or literature values, leaving geochemical rate coefficients the sole calibrated model parameters. Analysis of these fitted parameters revealed that the scale dependence of geochemical rates was largely explained by reactive mineral surface area. This work demonstrates that practical drainage quality predictions for full-scale waste-rock piles can be established from readily available bulk parameters determined at multiple scales.

J	Wang, L; Acheampong, RA; He, SW				Wang, Lei; Acheampong, Ransford A.; He, Sanwei			High-speed rail network development effects on the growth and spatial dynamics of knowledge-intensive economy in major cities of China	CITIES			English	Article						High-speed rail; Knowledge-intensive economy; HSR effects; Regional imbalance; China	YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA; REGIONAL SPECIALIZATION; PRODUCER SERVICES; IMPACT; TRANSPORT; OPPORTUNITIES; INTEGRATION; GEOGRAPHY	The development of high-speed rail (HSR) is a key component of China's overall economic development policy. HSR generates external effects across economic sectors and has the potential to transform spatial-economies. Understanding these effects is, therefore crucial for long-term urban and regional development policy and planning. This paper examines the effect of HSR development on the growth and spatial dynamics of knowledge intensive economy (KE) in major cities of China. The analysis does not only adopt the widely used proxy of total length of HRS network, but it also includes the frequency of HSR services and its interactions with network length. HSR effects on: (a) absolute KE employment growth (b) KE spatial concentration and (c) KE regional specialisation are examined, controlling for relevant socio-economic variables. The results show that HSR network development and service frequency had varying effects on KE growth and spatial dynamics at multiple spatial scales. At the national level, HSR service frequency positively affected KE employment growth, concertation and specialisation, while HSR network expansion had a small but negative association with KE regional specialisation. Among the three main regions of China, positive effects of HSR service frequency were evident in the more prosperous eastern region. In contrast, effects were negligible in the less-developed central region. The results show that HSR development combines with existing favourable regional economic conditions to generate more growth in historically prosperous regions, thereby entrenching existing economic development imbalances. These insights could inform long-term strategic regional development policy to reduce uneven development outcomes in China.

Structural power, corporate strategy, and performance	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						direct and indirect power advantages; mergers and acquisitions; resource dependence; superior performance and competitive advantage; two-step leverage	SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS; RESOURCE DEPENDENCE; CONSTRAINT; DYNAMICS; ASYMMETRY; NETWORKS; IMPACT; HOLES	Research Summary We develop a structural theory of power to explain how an organization is indirectly influenced by others through intermediaries. Our theory begins by explaining why an organization can improve its power position by acquiring partners that have direct advantages over it. We then propose the construct of indirect disadvantage to explain why an organization is motivated to acquire other partners that have advantages over its powerful partners. We further predict that the organization is motivated to acquire non-partners to gain two-step leverage over powerful partners. Finally, we theorize that the total indirect disadvantage of an organization relative to all partners negatively influences its performance. Using an extensive dataset on American businesses (1997-2007), we find strong support for our theory at both industry-industry and firm-industry levels. Managerial Summary Powerful buyers and suppliers are major influencers of the bottom line. This study develops a new theory to explain how to deal with them effectively, especially through mergers and acquisitions. In addition to considering powerful exchange partners as acquisition targets, firms can seek to exercise indirect influence over them through others. Acquiring other partners or non-partners that have control over powerful buyers and suppliers is often feasible and effective in dealing with those organizations and improving the firm's financial position. Our analysis of a very large sample of American businesses over a decade not only provides clear evidence that supports our theory but also highlights the substantial competitive advantages enjoyed by firms that exercise indirect sources of influence over major exchange partners.

D. Richard			National trends in heart failure mortality in men and women,United Kingdom, 2000-2017	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE			English	Article						Heart failure; Sex; Gender; Prognosis; Survival; Mortality	SEX-DIFFERENCES; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; SURVIVAL; EPIDEMIOLOGY; GUIDELINES; DIAGNOSIS; OUTCOMES; DISEASE; GENDER	Aims To understand gender differences in the prognosis of women and men with heart failure, we compared mortality, cause of death and survival trends over time. Methods and results We analysed UK primary care data for 26 725 women and 29 234 men over age 45 years with a new diagnosis of heart failure between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017 using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, inpatient Hospital Episode Statistics and the Office for National Statistics death registry. Age-specific overall survival and cause-specific mortality rates were calculated by gender and year. During the study period 15 084 women and 15 822 men with heart failure died. Women were on average 5 years older at diagnosis (79.6 vs. 74.8 years). Median survival was lower in women compared to men (3.99 vs. 4.47 years), but women had a 14% age-adjusted lower risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-0.88]. Heart failure was equally likely to be cause of death in women and men (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96-1.12). There were modest improvements in survival for both genders, but these were greater in men. The reduction in mortality risk in women was greatest for those diagnosed in the community (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.80-0.85). Conclusions Women are diagnosed with heart failure older than men but have a better age-adjusted prognosis. Survival gains were less in women over the last two decades. Addressing gender differences in heart failure diagnostic and treatment pathways should be a clinical and research priority.

J	Tian, ZZ; Fang, DL; Chen, B				Tian, Zhenzhen; Fang, Delin; Chen, Bin			Three-scale input-output analysis for energy and water consumption in urban agglomeration	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Urban agglomeration; Energy and water Consumption; Three-scale input-output analysis; Nexus strength.	ECOLOGICAL NETWORK; NEXUS; ECONOMY; EMISSIONS; TRADE; URBANIZATION; SYSTEM; IMPACT	The rapid development of urban agglomerations in China has brought up serious energy shortage and water scarcity issues. This paper uses three-scale input-output analysis and nexus strength method to investigate the overall energy and water consumption of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) urban agglomeration in 2012. Three scales, i.e., local, domestic and foreign scales, are linked within the traditional input-output analysis and used to establish the energy and water consumption intensities data. The subsequent analyses of energy-water nexus strength index distinguish important nodes with strong linkages of water and energy. The main results show that Jing-Jin-Ji agglomeration is an overall net exporter, but a net domestic exporter and a net foreign importer, from the perspective of the energy and water consumption embodied in trade. The important nodes with higher energy-water nexus strength values are different among three scales, while the sectors of agricultural, food processing, chemical products and transportation are significant nodes in all three scales. The proposed framework may facilitate the future synergetic management of multi-resources in urban agglomeration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bjorvatn, T; Wald, A				Bjorvatn, Torbjorn; Wald, Andreas			The impact of time pressure on knowledge transfer effectiveness in teams: trust as a critical but fragile mediator	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Teams; Knowledge transfer; Trust; Time pressure; Knowledge transfer effectiveness; Knowledge	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; TEMPORARY ORGANIZATIONS; DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS; INTEGRATIVE MODEL; GROUP-PERFORMANCE; DECISION-MAKING; MODERATING ROLE; PLS-SEM; MANAGEMENT; RETHINKING	Purpose With faster innovation and shorter product cycles, time pressure is a highly relevant factor affecting contemporary business processes. This study aims to extend prior research on the effects of velocity at the firm level by considering the effect of time pressure on knowledge transfer effectiveness (KTE) on the team level and the role of trust as a mediator of this effect. Design/methodology/approach We empirically assess the impact of time pressure on knowledge transfer effectiveness in teams. Further, we test the mediating effect of trust on this relationship. We study a sample of 285 project teams applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The authors find that time pressure is negatively associated with KTE. Moreover, trust among team members has a complementary mediating effect on this relationship. Thus, while trust is urgently needed for enhancing KTE under time pressure, time pressure reduces trust-building too. Research limitations/implications This study establishes empirically the importance of time pressure and trust as drivers of KTE in teams. The contribution connects the field of knowledge management to important streams in the wider business literature: organization studies, management, strategic management, project management, innovation etc. Whereas the model is parsimonious, it has high explanatory power and high generalizability to other contexts. Practical implications Team managers should take care to allow enough time for knowledge transfer within the team. This is particularly important when knowledge sharing is central, e.g. in innovation, development and change processes. If this is not possible, measures should be taken to maintain trust among team members. Social implications Effective knowledge management enhances the performance of business entities and public-sector organizations alike. Today, both the private and public sectors are under considerable pressure to increase both efficiency and effectiveness. Effective knowledge transfer within teams is a core capability to achieve this goal. More effective organizations result in more competitive private firms, more employment opportunities and improved public services to citizens. Originality/value Time pressure is an increasingly relevant factor in contemporary business but so far little explored in research. This study extends current knowledge by considering the effect of time pressure on KTE.

CEOemotions and firm valuation in initial coin offerings: An artificial emotional intelligence approach	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						artificial emotional intelligence (emotion AI); CEO emotions; firm valuation; initial coin offering (ICO); upper echelons theory	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEGATIVE AFFECT; UPPER ECHELONS; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION; ECONOMICS; TRAITS; IMPACT	Research Summary How emotions impact firm valuation is empirically understudied because affective traits are difficult to quantify. However, using artificial emotional intelligence, positive and negative affects can be identified from facial muscle contraction-relaxation patterns obtained from public CEO photos during initial coin offerings, that is, blockchain-based issuances of cryptocurrency tokens to raise growth capital. The results suggest that CEO affects impact firm valuation in two ways. First, CEOs' own firm valuations conform more to those of industry peers if negative affects are pronounced (conformity mechanism). Second, investors use CEO affects as signals about firm value and discount when negative affects are salient (signaling mechanism). Both mechanisms are stronger in the presence of asymmetric information. Managerial Summary The purpose of this paper is to advance our understanding of how CEOs' affective traits influence firm valuation by both, CEOs themselves and investors. The effect of CEO emotions is plausibly particularly pronounced for start-up firms, whose success prospects critically depend on their leaders. My results suggest that CEO emotions impact underpricing in initial coin offerings twofold. First, negative emotions are associated with CEOs choosing an underpricing level that closely conforms to their peer firms' average. Second, investors react to negative CEO emotions by demanding higher discounts on firm value. These effects are more pronounced when there is relatively little public information about the ICO firm. My paper is accompanied by artificial emotional intelligence software for implementation in practice and future research.

Corporate venture capital ambidexterity for exploiting/exploring innovation in technological business	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Technological innovation; Ambidexterity; Corporate venture capital; Entrepreneurial intensity; Financing round; Hybrid investment	ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY; AMBIDEXTROUS ORGANIZATIONS; EMERGING PERSPECTIVES; KNOWLEDGE EXPLORATION; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; EXPLOITATION; ANTECEDENTS; PERFORMANCE; CAPABILITY; SURVIVAL	Purpose Recently, corporate venture capital (CVC) has been gaining increasing attention worldwide as a special form of venturing through which non-financial corporations invest in target companies, usually technological firms, as start-ups. These investments mostly aim not at financial goals but constitute a strategic way for the corporation to obtain access to new technologies and innovations through financing entrepreneurial initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the connections between the core business of the parent company and its venturing investments, investigating, in particular, its "ambidexterity," i.e., the ability of the CVC company to invest in ventures close to its core activities, exploiting internal resources and exploring new markets. Design/methodology/approach Stemming from the results of previous studies, this research has applied a discriminating analysis methodology to the 18 most active CVC companies in the world, all of which have technology innovation as the core business of the corporation, in the 2015/2017 period. Findings An evident correlation between the Financing Round (as the independent variable) and the Entrepreneurial Intensity (as the dependent variable) influences the CVCs investment policies and their behavior with respect to their ambidexterity. This link could also influence the strategic orientation of the CVC policy, forcing the company to appropriately govern and manage the starting nature and/or the variable nature of the CVC (ambidextrous, hybrid, dis-ambidextrous or random). Research limitations/implications The current research has used only secondary data to explore the behavior of only 18 CVCs in a relatively short period. Thus, it would be advisable to extend the number of observations, to enlarge the period under investigation, and to retrieve field data to obtain more detailed and reliable results. Originality/value The main objective/contribution of this study is to understand if there is a correlation between the Financing Round (as the independent variable) and the Entrepreneurial Intensity (as the dependent variable) for the 18 most active CVCs in the world, according to CB Insights, in 2015-2017, adopting and further confirming the model by Rossi et al. (2019). The statistical investigation, based on the conclusions of that linear regression model, has highlighted a total or large correlation between these two variables for the current research perimeter, which includes CVC companies with technology as the core business of the corporation.

J	Akbar, YH; Kisilowski, M				Akbar, Yusaf H.; Kisilowski, Maciej			To bargain or not to bargain: Airlines, legitimacy and nonmarket strategy in a COVID-19 world	JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						COVID-19; Legitimacy; Airlines; Nonmarket strategy; Bargaining	BUSINESS; HEALTH; MODEL; RISK	Nonmarket strategy - strategic actions directed at influencing the governmental, legalregulatory, and societal environment of business - is a key factor in an airlines' competitive position yet remains relatively under analyzed in aviation research. The COVID-19 crisis has created a heightened role for nonmarket strategy and our paper argues that in deciding how to respond to a variety of policy measures introduced by governments, airline executives need to take into account the perceived legitimacy from the flying public of their response to governments. Our paper presents an integrative framework to analyze airlines' nonmarket response to COVID-19 governmental policy measures. Using a two-by-two matrix, we identify key conceptual links between industry's nonmarket response, the health impacts of a given policy measure as well as its economic costs for the airlines. Our study concludes that, unless economic stakes in a given policy measure are high, airlines do not risk active bargaining with governments over the content of that measure. Such bargaining could trigger a delegitimation cascade: a self-reinforcing process in which key stakeholders reassess their view of airlines' conduct and the industry's broader societal impact. Bargaining is pursued when economic impacts of policy measures are high, and in that case, the choice between cooperative and adversarial posture towards the government depends on the health impact of a given policy.

Effects of nursing home eligibility on costs, hospitalizations and survival	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						Long-term care; Policy evaluation; Instrumental variables	LONG-TERM-CARE; DISABILITY INSURANCE RECEIPT; HEALTH; NETHERLANDS; COMORBIDITY; OUTCOMES; IMPACT	Encouraging and helping elderly to postpone a nursing home admission appears to be a win-win that keeps long-term care spending in check and is in line with the target population's preferences, but there is little evidence about its effects. We study the causal impact of nursing home admission eligibility using Dutch administrative data and exploiting variation between randomly assigned assessors in their tendency to grant eligibility for a nursing home admission. We find a drop in medical care use when eligibility is granted, especially in hospital admissions, while total healthcare spending is unaffected. This suggests that postponing an admission may not always be a win-win after all. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Lazaretti, K; Giotto, OT; Sehnem, S; Bencke, FF				Lazaretti, Kellen; Giotto, Olivo Tiago; Sehnem, Simone; Bencke, Fernando Fantoni			Building sustainability and innovation in organizations	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Innovation; Sustainability	BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION; PRODUCT INNOVATION; SUPPLY CHAIN; MANAGEMENT; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PERSPECTIVE; DEFINITION; FRAMEWORK; CREATION; AGENDA	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a systematic literature review on innovation and sustainability. To accomplish this aim, a systematic analysis of the literature in the Scopus database was carried out for articles with the terms "innovation" and "sustainability" in their titles. Once identified, articles were analyzed in three ways: the ten most-cited articles; the ten most-cited literature reviews; and the most recent articles. Sustainable development is the central theme of the articles studied. Sustainable development is influenced by the ways that sustainability is measured within the network of which the organizations are a part, including adequate systems, and is mediated by compatible behaviors. Encouraging green innovation is an environmental commitment and managerial concern driven by customer pressure, environmental regulations and cost reductions. Suppliers and customers can contribute or benefit from the value created. Design/methodology/approach This study was a Systematic literature review. The search terms "Innov * AND sustain *" were defined for the titles of the articles. The analysis was divided into three categories: the ten most-cited articles (without a year filter to form an idea of the impact of the main research in the field); the ten most-cited reviews (these were only filtered from 2009 to 2018); and the 10 most recent articles (all of the articles found were from the year 2018). Findings The main findings of this study were that network action, mobilization of relevant stakeholders, reinvention of the business model, redefinition with multiple values and a sustainable strategic scope are the mechanisms that effectively contribute to promoting the link between innovation and sustainability in organizations. Sustainable development is the central theme of the articles studied. Sustainable development is influenced by the ways that sustainability is measured within the network of which the organizations are a part of, including adequate systems, and is mediated by compatible behaviors. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by providing perspectives for future studies that may contribute to the sustainable development of organizations. Sustainable development is strongly influenced by the ways that sustainability is measured within the network of which the organizations are part, including appropriate systems, and is mediated by compatible behaviors.

J	Liu, ZX; Lu, L; Qi, XT				Liu, Zhixin; Lu, Liang; Qi, Xiangtong			The showrooming effect on integrated dual channels	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						Multi-channel management; valuation uncertainty; consumer strategic behaviour; pricing; consumer returns	SUPPLY CHAIN; FULL-REFUND; ONLINE; POLICIES	By virtue of its cost advantage, online shopping has attracted a substantial population of consumers. At the same time, lacking the first-hand touching experience in online shopping often causes a utility mismatch to consumers, which may not only turn down some potential consumers but also cause a high return rate. A recent business practice for retailers is to encourage showrooming - consumers browsing product in the offline channel but switching to the online channel for purchases, with an aim to leverage both the low cost from the online channel and the real experience from the offline channel. We address such a dual-channel system withomni channels, i.e., concurrently running a mix of online and offline channels by a joint decision on pricing for the two channels as well as the associated return policy. Using an appropriate model we show that a well-designed dual-channel system can indeed increase the profitability of a retailer. Specifically, we find that channel cost difference is the key factor behind the rationale of encouraging showrooming. Retailers can intentionally create a channel price gap to facilitate demand shifting from offline channel to online channel, thus achieving considerable fulfilment cost savings as well as return cost savings. In addition, we reveal that return policy decision is closely related with pricing decisions, and show that return policy design can be viewed as a tool for market segmentation through modulating channel prices. Finally, we identify several barriers for retailers to engage with consumers directly such as consumer valuation uncertainty and cost efficiency of handling returns, and show that it may be beneficial for retailers to engage with consumers indirectly via consumer showrooming.

J	Sergeeva, AV; Faraj, S; Huysman, M				Sergeeva, Anastasia, V; Faraj, Samer; Huysman, Marleen			Losing Touch: An Embodiment Perspective on Coordination in Robotic Surgery	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						embodiment; coordination; technological mediation; technology; robots; role reconfiguration; expertise; materiality; surgery	GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED TEAMS; UNDERSTANDING CONFLICT; TECHNOLOGY; WORK; KNOWLEDGE; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; BOUNDARIES; IDENTITY	Because new technologies allow new performances, mediations, representations, and information flows, they are often associated with changes in how coordination is achieved. Current coordination research emphasizes its situated and emergent nature, but seldom accounts for the role of embodied action. Building on a 25-month field study of the da Vinci robot, an endoscopic system for minimally invasive surgery, we bring to the fore the role of the body in how coordination was reconfigured in response to a change in technological mediation. Using the robot, surgeons experienced both an augmentation and a reduction of what they can do with their bodies in terms of haptic, visual, and auditory perception and manipulative dexterity. These bodily augmentations and reductions affected joint task performance and led to coordinative adaptations (e.g., spatial relocating, redistributing tasks, accommodating novel perceptual dependencies, and mounting novel responses) that, over time, resulted in reconfiguration of roles, including expanded occupational knowledge, emergence of new specializations, and shifts in status and boundaries. By emphasizing the importance of the body in coordination, this paper suggests that an embodiment perspective is important for explaining how and why coordination evolves following the introduction of a new technology.

Drawing on the theory of rivalry, we predicted that third-party observers would experience an "evil pleasure" (schadenfreude) when they perceive a high level of rivalry with the victims of abusive supervision and that the experienced schadenfreude then would motivate third parties to engage in interpersonal destructive behaviors (i.e., undermining, incivility, and interpersonal deviance) toward the victims. We further proposed that such malicious reactions would be attenuated if groups have a high level of cooperative goals. Results based on one experimental study and two time-lagged field studies lend support to our propositions.

How Industry 4.0 reshapes future buyer-supplier relationships	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Buyer-supplier relationships; Supplier relations; Industry 4; 0; Industrial Internet of Things; Supply Chain Management	THINGS IOT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CHAIN MANAGEMENT; INTERNET; INTEGRATION; IMPACT; SMART; PROCUREMENT; LOGISTICS; FRAMEWORK	Purpose This study analyzes how technological changes in the context of Industry 4.0 influence buyer-supplier relationships (BSRs). Design/methodology/approach The study is explorative in nature; hence, an empirical qualitative research design is applied. It bases on 45 expert interviews with managers from German and Austrian industrial companies as empirical data. A qualitative content analysis is conducted to inductively analyze the empirical material and to identify common patterns, themes and categories. Findings The paper finds that future transactions are mainly based on digitized, automated procedures, transferring various value creation processes to platforms. BSRs become more intense in nature. Companies consolidate their supplier base by focusing on important strategic suppliers. Research limitations/implications As the paper is of exploratory nature, it can only present first qualitative insights. Further studies can extend the results by analyzing and contrasting BSRs in various industries or value chain stages and map differences and similarities, respectively. Practical implications The paper's results provide implications for management and corporate practice alike. These help companies to raise Industry 4.0's full potential as for BSRs creating and securing long-term and sustainable competitive advantages. Originality/value This paper is among the first to empirically investigate BSRs in the context of Industry 4.0. Providing implications for research and corporate practice, it contributes to tapping Industry 4.0's full potential complementing an extra-organizational perspective.

Social life cycle assessment of Swedish organic and conventional pork production	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Social life cycle assessment; Pig; Activity variable; Social Hotspot Index; Social Risk Time; Analytical hierarchical processing	ANIMAL-WELFARE; PIG PRODUCTION; DECISION-MAKING; SUPPLY CHAINS; SUSTAINABILITY; HEALTH; ISSUES; PERFORMANCE; SLAUGHTER; MEAT	Purpose Sustainable animal food systems are increasingly important to society. Yet for pork, the most consumed meat product in Europe, there is no social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) in the literature. The breath and complexity of social issues and lack of data makes the task challenging. This study examines the risk of negative social impacts in Swedish pork production systems and includesworkers,farmers,consumers,local community,society, andpigsas stakeholders. Methods The objective was to assess the risk of negative social impacts for the production and consumption of 1000-kg pork (fork weight-bone free meat including cooking losses) originating from two different systems: organic and conventional pork production. Relevant social sustainability issues for pork production systems were identified through a literature search and a consultative workshop with experts. A life cycle inventory was conducted to collect data for activity variables and compute Social Risk (SR), a measure of the risk of negative social impacts related to a reference (here the average European social conditions). Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was used to obtain weights for subcategories. The SR scores and the weights were used to calculate Social Risk Time (SRT) that relates the Social Risk to the functional unit by considering the 'exposure' to the risk, and the Social Hotspot Index (SHI), which relates the SRT to the worst possible situation for that system. Results and discussion The conventional pork system had 42% of inventory indicators with SR > 0.5 and the organic pork system had 32%. For all stakeholders, thepig farmhad the largest SRT in both production systems except forworkersin the organic pork system where the soybean farmhad the largest SRT. In the conventional pork system,societyas well asfarmersat thepig farmhad SHI > 0.5 slightly, meaning performing the same as European average. In the organic pork system, SHI < 0.5 for all stakeholders and subsystems. Conclusion Swedish pork production has lower risk of negative social impacts than the average European social conditions for most of the stakeholders:workers,pigs,local community, andconsumers.Farmersandsocietyat the subsystempig farmhave the same risk of negative social impacts as the average European social conditions. Due to the dependence of the results of the chosen reference level, the reliance on certification, and the indicators included, results should be interpreted and used with care.

Organizational change and the dynamics of innovation: Formal R&D structure and intrafirm inventor networks	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						innovation; organizational structure; R&D; social networks	INTERFIRM COLLABORATION; KNOWLEDGE; FIRM; CAPABILITIES; EVOLUTION; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; PARADOX; MARKET; TIES	Research Prior research has argued and shown that firms with more centralized R&D produce broader innovations, but the organizational mechanisms underlying this relationship are underexplored. This gap limits our understanding of whether and how formal R&D structure can be used as a lever to influence research outcomes. To address this question, we study the relationship between formal R&D structure, internal inventor networks, and innovative behavior and outcomes. We find that centralization of R&D budget authority increases the connectedness of internal inventor networks, which in turn increases the breadth of both innovation impact and technological search. Surprisingly, decentralization does not have the opposite effect. Our results suggest that changes in formal structure influence innovation outcomes through changes in inventor networks, with a lag reflecting organizational inertia. Managerial Diversified corporations can organize their R&D functions to be more or less centralized. Prior research has shown that this organizational choice is associated with different types of innovative outcomes. But what happens when a corporation changes its level of R&D centralization? This paper suggests that centralization of R&D gradually leads to new patterns of collaboration among inventors, which in turn will be associated with innovations that draw on and influence a wider range of technologies. However, future work is needed to understand why decentralization does not appear to have the opposite effect.

J	Kirkegaard, JK; Cronin, T; Nyborg, S; Karnoe, P				Kirch Kirkegaard, Julia; Cronin, Tom; Nyborg, Sophie; Karnoe, Peter			Paradigm shift in Danish wind power: the (un)sustainable transformation of a sector	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article						Danish wind power; socio-technical agencement; paradigm shift; social acceptance; conceptual model	RENEWABLE ENERGY; SOCIOTECHNICAL CHANGE; SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE; ENGAGEMENT	The Danish wind power sector grew out of a combination of small and medium-sized entrepreneurial firms and local pioneers forming small-scale wind farm cooperatives. This paper studies the initial organisation and subsequent transformation of the socio-technical assemblage or 'agencement' around wind power in Denmark, focusing on the changing roles and agency of electricity producers. We propose a conceptual model for mapping the transformation over time, following five entangled dimensions: capitalisation instruments, turbine technology, capital investment, regulation of finance and ownership modes. We show how changes in all five socio-material dimensions have produced a 'paradigm shift', reconfiguring wind power from a distributed power source to critical infrastructure. This shift has marginalised local players and mobilised new types of producers and ownership forms. Using the conceptual model, we map the controversy resulting from the paradigm shift. Our relational lens of market studies within Science & Technology Studies captures how wind power's 'sustainability' has become contested, and how this cannot be understood as a matter of 'community acceptance' dissociated from material factors. Proposing our conceptual model for future studies, we contribute not only to the extant social acceptance literature, but also to critical energy debates on the governance of climate change and sustainability.

J	McDonnell, MH; Cobb, JA				McDonnell, Mary-Hunter; Cobb, J. Adam			TAKE A STAND OR KEEP YOUR SEAT: BOARD TURNOVER AFTER SOCIAL MOVEMENT BOYCOTTS	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							SELF-DETERMINATION; DIRECTOR TURNOVER; CEO IDEOLOGY; REPUTATION; IDENTITY; STIGMA; EXIT; RESPONSIBILITY; IDENTIFICATION; CONSEQUENCES	While prior work has shown that a firm's market performance affects the loyalty of its board, little is known about how corporate social responsibility affects directors' willingness to serve. In this project, we shed light on this question by exploring how social movement boycotts that challenge a firm's social responsibility affect board turnover. We find that boycotts provoke a significant increase in turnover at targeted firms, and that directors are especially likely to leave after boycotts that signal that the firm's social values conflict with their personal values. Specifically, we find that an ideological match between a board member and the activist challengers predicts exit: liberals are more likely to leave after liberal challenges and conservatives are more likely to leave after conservative challenges. Moreover, we show that turnover is consistent with the rigidity of the right hypothesis in political psychology: conservatives, as compared to liberals, are more prone to entrenchment when their firms face challenges from the opposition. Our study offers strong evidence that corporate social performance matters to corporate directors, and provides insights into the manner in which contentious crises affect the motivation of corporate insiders.

A web-based geographic interface system to support decision making for municipal solid waste management in England	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Municipal solid waste (MSW); Waste management; Web-GIS; Decision support tool; Circular economy	CIRCULAR ECONOMY; MANURE MANAGEMENT; TO-ENERGY; GIS; GENERATION; CHALLENGES; MAP; DESIGN; CITY; MSW	To evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of the waste management solutions, it is necessary to assess the quantity and the flows of the waste generated. This research developed a web application which serves as a decision support system for those involved in the planning and management of municipal solid waste. In contrast to present web-based solutions, this tool provides the necessary information regarding the supply chain that is required to assess the suitability of waste valorisation in a particular location such as waste types, waste quantities and related waste contractors. Using publicly available data, a web geographic information system was designed where factors that affect the supply chain of municipal solid waste can be investigated. These include spatial and temporal variation of waste generated. The concept was demonstrated in the developed web application using publicly available data about England. Waste market opportunities were identified, for example Kent County Council and Essex County Council were identified to have the highest quantity of incinerated waste with and without energy recovery (344 and 65 kiloton) respectively. Then Staffordshire and Lancashire County Councils were identified to have the highest quantity of hazardous and non-hazardous waste being landfilled (5 and 296 kiloton) respectively. Seasonal variation was inconsistent across counties, with East North-amptonshire having little seasonal variation in household waste (<500 tonne variation) as opposed to East Riding of Yorkshire which had higher waste volumes in summer with up to 15,000 tonne variation). Circular economy partners were also identified through the web application and these results are presented in context of waste-derived supply chain decisions. The web application is therefore able to provide a comprehensive tool for improving both strategic and logistical decision-making process for municipal solid waste management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Satellite remote sensing; Arctic; Tundra; Shrubification; Climate change; Grazing; Semi-domesticated reindeer	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TUNDRA VEGETATION; SHRUB EXPANSION; RESPONSES; RESILIENCE; FEEDBACKS; DRIVEN; SHIFTS; AREA	Rapid climate change is threatening the stability and functioning of Arctic ecosystems. As the Arctic warms, shrubs have been widely observed to expand, which has potentially serious consequences for global climate regulation and for the ecological processes characterising these ecosystems. However, it is currently unclear why this shrubification has been spatially uneven across the Arctic, with herbivory being suggested as a key regulating factor. By taking advantage of freely available satellite imagery spanning three decades, we mapped changes in shrub cover in the Yamal Peninsula and related these to changes in summer temperature and reindeer population size. We found no evidence that shrubs had expanded in the study site, despite increasing summer temperatures. At the same time, herbivore pressure increased significantly, with the local reindeer population size growing by about 75%. Altogether, our results thus point towards increases in large herbivore pressure having compensated for the warming of the Peninsula, halting the shrubification of the area. This suggests that strategic semi-domesticated reindeer husbandry, which is a common practice across the Eurasian Arctic, could represent an efficient environmental management strategy for maintaining open tundra landscapes in the face of rapid climate change.

J	de Jong, B; Gillespie, N; Williamson, I; Gill, C				de Jong, Bart; Gillespie, Nicole; Williamson, Ian; Gill, Carol			Trust Consensus Within Culturally Diverse Teams: A Multistudy Investigation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						trust; teams; cultural diversity; virtuality; collective leadership; performance	VIRTUAL TEAMS; SHARED LEADERSHIP; MEDIATION MODEL; PROJECT TEAMS; PERFORMANCE; METAANALYSIS; COMMUNICATION; ANTECEDENTS; JUSTICE; MATTER	Despite tremendous progress toward understanding trust within teams, research has predominately conceptualized team trust as a shared group construct, focusing almost exclusively on trust magnitude (i.e., mean level of trust) while ignoring trust dispersion (i.e., within-team differences in trust). As a result, we know little about this critical property of team trust, its determinants, and independent impact on team outcomes. We address this limitation by examining "team trust consensus"-a configural group construct capturing the extent to which team members share their levels of trust in the team-as a variable of theoretical and empirical interest in its own right. Cross-sectional data from a work team sample (Study 1, N = 120) provide initial support for our propositions that national culture diversity negatively affects trust consensus and that trust consensus positively affects team performance. Expanding on these findings, we propose a contingency model in which the negative impact of national culture diversity is mitigated by team virtuality and collective leadership. Multiwave data from an MBA team sample (Study 2, N = 95) offer support for these propositions and replicate the positive direct effect of trust consensus on team performance. Our findings indicate trust consensus is an important predictor of team performance and provide unique insight into the factors that jointly influence trust consensus within teams.

J	Haque, A				Haque, Amlan			Strategic HRM and organisational performance: does turnover intention matter?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article; Early Access						Mediation; Strategic human resource management; Employee turnover intentions; Perceived organisational performance	HUMAN-RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT BREACH; FIRM PERFORMANCE; PERCEIVED PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; WORK; PERCEPTIONS; SATISFACTION; ATTITUDES; SYSTEMS	Purpose Applying the job-demand resources model and the psychological contract theory, this paper aims to examine the mediating influence of employee turnover intentions (ETI) on the relationship between strategic human resource management (SHRM) and perceived organisational performance (POP). Design/methodology/approach With a two-phase data-collection method, 200 complete responses were collected through an online questionnaire survey. This study applied a structural equation modelling to examine the multivariate associations and provided comprehensive outcomes for the proposed hypothesised model. Findings This study suggests that SHRM has direct significant effects on both ETI and POP; partial mediational effect on POP via ETI; and ETI has negative effect on POP. Practical implications This paper suggests that organisations aiming higher POP should encourage SHRM and improve their strategic approaches of HRM. The implications of the study results can help organisations to recognise the adverse effects of ETI and effective SHRM outcomes. Originality/value Despite the significant relationship between HRM and organisational performance, limited empirical research has been conducted on the mediational influence of ETI. This paper examines the unique meditational role of ETI on the relationship between SHRM and POP, which has not been utterly observed from employee perspective.

J	Chen, S; Lin, N				Chen, Stephen; Lin, Nidthida			Culture, productivity and competitiveness: disentangling the concepts	CROSS CULTURAL & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitiveness; Culture; Productivity; Text analysis	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT; TOURISM; VALUES; IMPLEMENTATION; PERSPECTIVE; EVOLUTION; COUNTRY	Purpose Culture has been identified as one of the main drivers of the "competitive productivity" (CP) of nations. However, research studies examining the relationships between culture, competition and productivity are highly fragmented across different streams of literature, leaving researchers with a lack of a holistic view of the topic. This study reviews research studies that examined the relationships between culture and productivity and between culture and competitiveness, as well as the joint relationships between culture, productivity and competitiveness in leading economic, business and management journals in the period 2009-2018 in order to identify research gaps and opportunities for future research. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a combination of bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer, text analysis using Leximancer and systematic review by expert reviewers to analyze 293 articles that consider culture, productivity and competitiveness published in leading business, management and economics journals in the period 2009-2018. Findings The findings indicate that, although productivity and competitiveness are often discussed jointly in some policy circles, research studies on the roles of culture on productivity and on competitiveness take place in quite different streams of academic literature, drawing on different sets of concepts and theoretical frameworks. The concept of innovation appears prominently in both sets of the literature as an antecedent of both productivity improvement and international competitiveness. Research limitations/implications The findings highlight the need for more research studies which jointly examine culture, productivity and competitiveness and the relationships between them. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is among the first attempts to systematically analyze the literature on the relationship between culture and CP.

J	Hawn, O				Hawn, Olga			How media coverage of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility influences cross-border acquisitions	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						corporate social responsibility (CSR); emerging market multinationals (EMMs); international expansion; M&As; public takeover process	ORGANIZATIONAL LEGITIMACY; STAKEHOLDER; MANAGEMENT; RISK; SUSTAINABILITY; REPUTATION; FIRMS; MICROFOUNDATIONS; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE	Research Summary This study contributes to the growing strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature by examining the intersection of acquisition studies and international expansion research and highlighting the unexplored impact of media coverage of CSR and corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) in shaping completion and duration outcomes of cross-border acquisitions. A quantitative analysis of 4,087 cross-border acquisition announcements by firms from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (1990-2011) shows that while media coverage of CSR is not important, media coverage of CSI is associated with lower likelihood of and longer duration till acquisition completion. By theoretically and empirically distinguishing media coverage of CSR from CSI, this paper pushes the existing literature to acknowledge these distinct concepts and their varying effects. In sum, managers should beware media coverage of CSI when acquiring abroad. Managerial Summary Cross-border acquisitions by firms from emerging markets often do not reach completion or are badly delayed, damaging the firms' attempts to expand. A key barrier to completing deals is that employees, customers, regulators, media, and other stakeholders in the target market are suspicious of these firms, fearing that they will be poor corporate citizens. I examine whether media coverage of acquirers' social activities helps overcome these suspicions. I find that media coverage of socially responsible activities does not facilitate deal completion. Strikingly, however, media coverage of irresponsible actions, such as labor or environmental issues, delays or blocks deal completion. The implication is that firms from emerging markets, which increasingly are expanding abroad, need to avoid activities that people outside their country will interpret as inappropriate.

J	Sabzzadeh, I; Shourian, M				Sabzzadeh, Iman; Shourian, Mojtaba			Maximizing crops yield net benefit in a groundwater-irrigated plain constrained to aquifer stable depletion using a coupled PSO-SWAT-MODFLOW hydro-agronomic model	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Crops planning; Groundwater stability; Hydro-agronomic modeling; Hybrid optimization-simulation; PSO-SWAT-MODFLOW	RIVER-BASIN; SIMULATION; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; RECHARGE; QUALITY; PART	Groundwater is a strategic resource for irrigated agriculture particularly in arid regions. Management of groundwater resources is essential to preserve sustainability while conserving economic interests. In this research, crops areas and water depletion by wells in an agricultural plain are optimized. This done by a novel hydro-agronomic-based simulation-optimization approach in which SWAT as the agronomic and MODFLOW as the groundwater simulation models are coupled with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Maximization of the net benefit gained from crops production is defined as the objective function. The decision variables are cultivation area for four major irrigated crops and irrigation depths (groundwater withdrawals). Groundwater depletion for irrigation is limited to a pre-defined value as the stability level. The PSO-SWAT-MODFLOW model is applied for Asemanabad plain in west of Iran. Results show that by optimum crops area and irrigation planning the agricultural net benefit is increased significantly comparing the present situation existing in the plain while the aquifer's depletion remains in the stable range. By sensitivity analyses, it is found that the crops' price has a major effect on the optimum cropping pattern and water consumption while improvement of the irrigation efficiency has a negligible impact on the plain's optimum agricultural net benefit.

J	Musick, K; Bea, MD; Gonalons-Pons, P				Musick, Kelly; Bea, Megan Doherty; Gonalons-Pons, Pilar			His and Her Earnings Following Parenthood in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						earnings; Europe; gender; inequalities; parenthood	WOMENS EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES; GENDER INEQUALITY; DOMESTIC WORK; ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES; EDUCATIONAL GRADIENT; FAMILY POLICIES; WEST-GERMANY; WAGE PENALTY; LABOR; MOTHERHOOD	This article advances a couple-level framework to examine how parenthood shapes within-family gender inequality by education in three countries that vary in their normative and policy context: the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We trace mothers' share of couple earnings and variation by her education in the 10-year window around first birth, using long-running harmonized panel surveys from the 1990s and 2000s (N= 4,117 couples and 28,488 couple-years) and an event study methodology that leverages within-couple variation in earnings pre- and post-birth. Our results show steep declines in her share of couple earnings following first birth across the three countries that persist over several years of follow-up. Declines are smallest in the United States, due to U.S. mothers' higher employment and longer work hours. Declines are also smaller among female partners without a college degree in the United States, where mothers have less work-family support and fewer options to manage work and family on one income. Results shed light on how parenthood plays into gender inequality within couples, and how country context shapes couple dynamics and inequality across households.

J	Patala, S; Salmi, A; Bocken, N				Patala, Samuli; Salmi, Asta; Bocken, Nancy			Intermediation dilemmas in facilitated industrial symbiosis	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Intermediaries; Industrial symbiosis; Dilemmas; Intermediation; Sustainability transition; Waste to value	CIRCULAR ECONOMY; SUSTAINABILITY; INNOVATION; EMERGENCE; ECOLOGY; LEVEL; ORGANIZATIONS; CONSEQUENCES; ECOSYSTEMS; EVOLUTION	Industrial symbiosis (IS) is a key paradigm for achieving circular economy among industrial firms. Achieving new IS projects often requires outside facilitation, and intermediaries can help solidify and expand existing IS networks. While various intermediary roles have been identified in the literature, less attention has been paid to the potential challenges that intermediaries might encounter in their activities. Based on the case of the national symbiosis network FISS, the Finnish Industrial Symbiosis system, this study investigates the dilemmas faced when organizing IS networks. It identifies openness and value demonstration dilemmas, which hinder intermediary-firm relations. It also identifies collaborative intermediation processes among intermediaries in seeking to uncover value, ensuring community embedding of new networks and selective integration of intermediation activities. These processes can help overcome the intermediation dilemmas. The results on the collaborative intermediation and its development over time contribute to research on facilitated IS and on intermediaries in sustainability transitions. For policy-makers, the study pinpoints the need for collaborative intermediation where both national and regional intermediaries are involved to ensure both economies of scale and flexibility.

What is a good level of soil organic matter? An index based on organic carbon to clay ratio	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						land use; soil clay content; soil organic carbon; soil structure	SATURATION; ENGLAND	Simple measures of appropriate levels of soil organic matter are needed for soil evaluation, management and monitoring, based on readily measurable soil properties. We test an index of soil organic matter based on the soil organic carbon (SOC) to clay ratio, defined by thresholds of SOC/clay ratio for specified levels of soil structural quality. The thresholds were originally delineated for a small number of Swiss soils. We assess the index using data from the initial sampling (1978-83) of the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales, covering 3,809 sites under arable land, grassland and woodland. Land use, soil type, annual precipitation and soil pH together explained 21% of the variance in SOC/clay ratio in the dataset, with land use the most important variable. Thresholds of SOC/clay ratio of 1/8, 1/10 and 1/13 indicated the boundaries between "very good", "good", "moderate" and "degraded" levels of structural condition. On this scale, 38.2, 6.6 and 5.6% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded. The index gives a method to assess and monitor soil organic matter at national, regional or sub-regional scales based on two routinely measured soil properties. Given the wide range of soils and land uses across England and Wales in the dataset used to test the index, we suggest it should apply to other European soils in similar climate zones. Highlights We assess the use of SOC/clay ratios as guidelines for soil management in England and Wales. We use data from 3,809 sites to assess thresholds based on work for Polish, French and Swiss soils. SOC/clay threshold values can indicate degraded and good soil structural condition. The thresholds show the effect of land use and provide an index for use in England and Wales.

Many studies have examined the technical performance of AI within an experimental context. These studies provide limited insights into the issues that its use in a real-world context of care and services raises. To help decision makers address these issues in a systemic and holistic manner, this viewpoint paper relies on the health technology assessment core model to contrast the expectations of the health sector toward the use of AI with the risks that should be mitigated for its responsible deployment. The analysis adopts the perspective of payers (ie, health system organizations and agencies) because of their central role in regulating, financing, and reimbursing novel technologies. This paper suggests that AI-based systems should be seen as a health system transformation lever, rather than a discrete set of technological devices. Their use could bring significant changes and impacts at several levels: technological, clinical, human and cognitive (patient and clinician), professional and organizational, economic, legal, and ethical. The assessment of AI's value proposition should thus go beyond technical performance and cost logic by performing a holistic analysis of its value in a real-world context of care and services. To guide AI development, generate knowledge, and draw lessons that can be translated into action, the right political, regulatory, organizational, clinical, and technological conditions for innovation should be created as a first step.

Drawing on the logic of "distinctiveness theory," which argues that the numeric rarity of a category in a given setting promotes the use of that category as a basis for connecting with others, we hypothesized and found: (a) the tendency to connect with same-gender others was stronger among women than among men; (b) the tendency to connect with same-rank others was stronger among high-ranking employees than among low-ranking employees; (c) for high-ranking men, rank was more important than gender as a basis for connecting with others; and (d) for low-ranking women, gender was more important than rank as a basis for connecting with others. We also found that whereas higher ranking individuals were more likely to be in central (bridging) positions in the overall network, gender was unrelated to network centrality. Our study suggests that the affordances of ESM for open and distributed communications notwithstanding, the social networks that emerge on ESM platforms may reinforce social stratification on some dimensions while diminishing it on others.

A cyber-physical stress-testing platform is presented in this work, named RISKNOUGHT, which is able to model water distribution networks as cyber-physical systems, simulating the information flow of the cyber layer and the feedback interactions with the physical processes under control. RISKNOUGHT utilizes an EPANET-based solver for the physical process and a customizable network model for the SCADA system, capable of implementing complex control logic schemes within a simulation. The platform enables the development of composite cyber-physical attacks on various elements of the SCADA, including sensors, actuators, and PLCs, assessing the impact they have on the hydraulic response of the distribution network and the level of service. The platform is tested on a proof-of-concept benchmark network with promising results that demonstrate that the platform can form an innovative cyber-physical tool to support strategic planning and risk management.

Current notions of interdependence remain rooted in seminal works, produced at a time when managers' near-perfect understanding of the task at hand drove the organization design process. In this context, task interdependence was rightly assumed to be exogenously determined by characteristics of the work and the technology. We no longer live in that world, yet our view of interdependence has remained exceedingly task centric and our treatment of interdependence overly deterministic. As organizations face increasingly unpredictable work streams and workers codesign the organization alongside managers, our field requires a more comprehensive toolbox that incorporates aspects of agent-based interdependence. In this article, we synthesize research in organization design, organizational behavior, and other related literatures to examine three types of interdependence that characterize organizations' workflows: task, goal, and knowledge interdependence. We offer clear definitions for each construct, analyze how each arises endogenously in the design process, explore their interrelations, and pose questions to guide future research.

Design/methodology/approach Data from a convenience sample of international visitors to Cairo, Egypt, (N= 302) was quantitatively analyzed using the structural equation modeling approach to test the relationships among constructs. Findings Empirical results reveal that three components of destination food experiences - sensory, affective and behavioral - effectively explain tourists' food satisfaction and destination revisit intention, while intellectual food experience was reported to only influence destination revisit intention. Interestingly, the effect of food experience satisfaction on destination revisit intention was not significant. Research limitations/implications This study identifies local food experience aspects that require to be managed at a strategic level and provides guidelines on how these aspects can be effectively managed. Originality/value This study is the first empirical application of a multidimensional experience model to the context of tourists' local food experience; it identifies the multifaceted characteristics of local food experience that deserve scholars' and marketers' attention.

J	Zhu, QY; Shah, P; Sarkis, J				Zhu, Qingyun; Shah, Purvi; Sarkis, Joseph			A paler shade of green: implications of green product deletion on supply chains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Product deletion; supply chain management; supply chain competencies; supply chain processes; sustainability; green marketing	ELIMINATION DECISION-MAKING; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; INVENTORY LEVELS; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; LINE; STRATEGIES; SELECTION	Product management activities by operations, marketing, and finance functions have typically focused on the innovation, acquisition, growth, and management of product lines and products. The same is true when considering product management for green products. The latter stages of critical strategic decisions related to product deletion or discontinuation have received less emphasis. In this conceptual paper, the focus is on green product deletion implications for supply chain management and operations. Organisations may view green product deletion as evolving from a deep green to a paler shade of green in their product offerings. A proposed strategic framework pays particular attention to the implications of the green product deletion decision for supply chain processes and operational competencies. In this situation, lessened organisational greenness needs to be weighed against other organisational and operational competencies. The strategic and inter-organisational relationships associated with this decision help set the stage for future research on this critical, yet neglected, organisational and operational supply chain issue.

J	Hansen, EG; Revellio, F				Hansen, Erik G.; Revellio, Ferdinand			Circular value creation architectures: Make, ally, buy, or laissez-faire	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						business model innovation; circular economy; consumer electronics; corporate sustainability; partnerships; product design	TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; STRATEGIC ISSUES; PRODUCT RECOVERY; SUSTAINABILITY; INNOVATION; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	Slowing and closing product and related material loops in a circular economy (CE) requires circular service operations such as take-back, repair, and recycling. However, it remains open whether these are coordinated by OEMs, retailers, or third-party loop operators (e.g., refurbishers). Literature rooted in the classic make-or-buy concept proposes four generic coordination mechanisms and related value creation architectures: vertical integration, network, outsourcing, or doing nothing (laissez-faire). For each of these existing architectures, we conducted an embedded case study in the domain of smartphones with the aim to better understand how central coordinators align with actors in the value chain to offer voluntary circular service operations. Based on the above coordination mechanisms, our central contribution is the development of a typology of circular value creation architectures (CVCAs) and its elaboration regarding circular coordination, loop configuration, and ambition levels. We find that firms following slowing strategies (i.e., repair, reuse, and remanufacturing) pursue higher degrees of vertical integration than those following closing strategies (i.e., recycling) because of the specificity of the assets involved and their greater strategic relevance. The typology also shows that higher degrees of vertical integration enable higher degrees of loop closure (i.e., from open to closed loops) and better feedbacks into product design. Furthermore, we differentiate the understanding on third-party actors by distinguishing between independent and autonomous loop operators. Overall, we strengthen the actor perspective in product circularity literature by clarifying the actor set, their interrelationships, and how they form value creation architectures.
