We argue that under certain conditions, network knowledge is beneficial to occupants of low-power positions, but not to occupants of high-power positions. Any low-power actor can benefit from having superior information, but if all low-power actors have equally sound knowledge, then all are worse off a type of social trap. We tested these arguments by manipulating power and the availability of information on network structure and exchange processes in an experimental exchange network setting. The results were supportive. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lopes, J; Nunes, A; Balsa, C				Lopes, Jorge; Nunes, Alcina; Balsa, Carlos			THE LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMY IN CAPE VERDE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						'Bon curve'; Cape Verde; Construction sector; Economic development	INVESTMENT; GROWTH	The relationship between a country's level of activity in the construction industry and its stage of economic development is a complex one. Several studies over the last forty years, based mainly on cross sectional data, found a positive association between national income and several measures of the construction industry activity. Early studies were concerned with the role of the construction sector, as part of physical capital, in the promotion of economic growth and development. A dominant paradigm that later emerged is the 'Bon curve' or the inverted U-shaped pattern of development. More recent research, based on longitudinal analysis, has also pointed to the non-linear relationship between the share of construction in GDP and the level of income per capita. Using time-series data drawn from the United Nations, this study applies an econometric methodology to assess the validity of the underlying propositions in a low-middle income economy-Cape Verde - over the long period of 38 years. The findings are in line with the assumptions that in the upward growth trend in developing countries, the pattern of the construction industry tends to follow that of the general economy.

Strategic justification of advanced manufacturing technology using an extended AHP model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Technology selection; AMT justification; Analytic hierarchy process; Group decision	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DECISION-MAKING; SELECTION; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; AMT	The hybrid process and group decision-making are two critical requisites for justification of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). This study proposes an extended analytic hierarchy process model for AMT justification, which revises the way of obtaining values of pairwise comparisons in order to take into account both tangible and intangible criteria. Additionally, in group decision, the weights of decision makers (DMs) are required while aggregating all DMs' priorities of alternatives. A novel technique for determining DMs' weights is proposed. In addition, the application of the proposed model to a Taiwanese case is used to verify the availability of this model.

This study investigates the effect of tourism upon quality of life in Shiraz, Iran. The results revealed that tourism has the positive effect on quality of life of residents. According to the survey, the strongest tourism impacts are found to be linked with emotional well-being, community well-being, and income and employment. While health and safety well-being are found to be the least favorable in terms of the effect of tourism on quality of life. The findings of this study will aid in the planning of strategic development programs for tourist destinations. [Fariborz Aref. The effects of tourism on quality of life.

J	Baggio, R; Mottironi, C; Corigliano, MA				Baggio, Rodolfo; Mottironi, Cristina; Corigliano, Magda Antonioli			Technological aspects of public tourism communication in Italy	JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Internet; Web 2.0; Destination management; Strategy; Website evaluation; Italy; Tourism	STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; DESTINATION; INTERNET; PROGRESS; IMPACT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the online presence of Italian destination management organizations (DMOs) by assessing the quality of their web sites through a demand-side heuristic approach. Moreover, given the importance of a clear strategic vision for an efficient and effective use of online media, the paper examines the alignment between tourism development plans and practical implementation of information and communication technologies (ICT). Finally, the possible impact of the adoption of a strategic approach on the overall quality of the web sites under investigation is explored. Design/methodology/approach - A double analysis was conducted. An assessment of the main quality features of the official tourism web sites and an evaluation of the statements of public authorities concerning strategic intentions and guidelines for developing ICT instruments. The two evaluations are compared in order to examine their relationships. A strategic matrix of the technological performance and attitude of Italian regional authorities is proposed. Findings - The quality of the Italian DMOs' web sites is satisfactory, on average. Weaknesses are found in the offer of interactive services and Web 2.0 functions. Moreover, an improvement in the user evaluations with respect to the past demonstrates the attention given to ICTs by the DMOs. As a matter of fact, the strategic plans examined deal, in general, relatively well with ICT issues, while it is also shown that poor strategic vision, as expressed in the promotional plans, is related to poor performance of some web sites. Originality/value - The paper assesses the quality of Italian DMOs' web sites quality as perceived by visitors and, for the first time, relates the evaluations to how ICT strategic plans deal with the issue.

J	Bennett, R; Kottasz, R				Bennett, Roger; Kottasz, Rita			Strategic, competitive, and co-operative approaches to internationalisation in European business schools	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						internationalisation; business schools; competitive versus co-operative approaches; strategic orientation	HIGHER-EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE; DIMENSIONS; BEHAVIOR; FIRMS	Globalised educational environments and national pressures increasingly drive European universities and faculties within them to adopt both competitive [as opposed to co-operative] and strategic [rather than ad hoc] approaches towards the internationalisation of their activities. This study examines the degrees of implementation of competitive and/or strategic approaches to internationalisation of a sample of 92 European business schools. Several possible antecedents of competitive and strategic orientations towards internationalisation are considered including coercive, normative and mimetic influences, risk aversion, resource availability and institutional priorities. The level of a business school's autonomy from its host university is also hypothesised to affect internationalisation decisions. It seems from the results that engagement with internationalisation activities is widespread and that, apart from risk aversion, all of the above variables typically impact on the total extent of a business school's internationalisation activities. A number of these variables also appear to encourage the application of strategic and competitive approaches towards internationalisation. An important implication of this study is that business schools which to date have not fully recognised and accepted the implications of the Bologna Declaration will increasingly face severe disadvantages vis-a-vis international recruitment and operations as they become 'left behind' by rivals that have already taken Bologna on board.

Canadian Respond-HD Collaborative	Factors Associated With Experiences of Genetic Discrimination Among Individuals at Risk for Huntington Disease	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS			English	Article						genetic discrimination; Huntington disease; genetic testing; socio-demographic factors	PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; FAMILY COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTIONS; POPULATION; CONTEXT; HEALTH	The purpose of this study was to identify factors that are associated with experiencing genetic discrimination (GD) among individuals at risk for Huntington disease (HD). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with experiencing GD in data from a cross-sectional, self-report survey of 293 individuals at risk for HD. The study sample comprised 167 genetically tested respondents, and 66 who were not tested (80% response rate). Overall, individuals who learn they are at risk for HD at a younger age (OR 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5-6.2; P = 0.002), are mutation-positive (OR 2.8; 95% CI: 1.4-6.0; P = 0.006), or are highly educated (OR 2.7; 95% CI: 1.4-5.1; P = 0.002) are more likely to experience GD, particularly in insurance, family, and social settings. Further, younger age was associated with discrimination in insurance(OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.94-1.00; P = 0.038). This study provides evidence that some people who are at risk for HD were more likely to experience GD than others. Individuals who learned they are at risk for HD at a younger age and those who are mutation-positive were more likely to experience GD, particularly in insurance, family, and social settings. Younger individuals were more likely to experience discrimination in the insurance setting. Overall, highly educated individuals were also more likely to report discrimination. These results provide direction for clinical and family discussions, counseling practice, and policy aimed at mitigating experiences of GD. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Cheng, CY				Cheng, Chung-ying			Confucian global leadership in Chinese tradition: classical and contemporary	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Confucian model; New Confucian model; Harmony; Normative harmonization; Moral power; Confucianism; Ethics; China		Purpose - This paper aims to inquire and argue for a renovated model of Confucian political leadership as a way of political governance rooted in a philosophy of humanity and its potential for development. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is primarily critical and constructive through philosophical analysis and synthesis of ideas and insights into nature of man and political leadership in light of Confucian texts and practices. Findings - Based on reflection and analysis, the classical model of political leadership is shown to consist of core values of virtues and visions in classical Confucianism. By conceptual reconstruction a new Confucian model is formulated in such a way in which ethics of utilities and ethics of justice and righteousness are incorporated. The author further shows how it can be realized in different functions of modernized political and economic leadership. The author finds that this move resulted in achieving an essential transformation toward a more realistic application and practice in a global world. Practical implications - In so far as the new model deals with a process of normative harmonization in which it can be further enhanced by comprehensive considerations of intrinsic human values and future development of humanity as a whole, this model provides a practical method for meeting the urgent needs on different levels of leadership and management for creative and world-oriented attitude-building, policy-making and strategic seminar-course designing for graduate and executive training in contemporary business schools. Originality/value - The author has innovatively constructed the new Confucian model and show how political leadership in this model has the capability and ability to persevere in seeking harmony and harmonization among traditions and nations in the global world. The author has also explained how and why morality when properly supported can be a global leading power for bringing harmony and harmonization to the world. The author has formed a new concept of political leadership force and named it the moral power in addition to but not separated in its persuasion from hard power, soft power and smart power of Joseph Nye. The author's formulation and argument for the new model with its moral power constitute a highly significant contribution to the understanding of Confucian political leadership in contemporary global contexts.

It outlines the relationships between the state and other institutional actors and how the state promotes its HRM ideas by targeting actors in different ways on different HRM issues. It reveals the bargaining powers of actors and the dynamic interactions amongst them in shaping HRM practices. The role of educational institutes and business schools in management development is analysed. The article contributes to the understanding of the role of the developmental state in shaping - or even in parts transforming - HRM practices through institutional isomorphic changes in emerging economies to support their national development goals.

J	Ferguson, D				Ferguson, David			CSR in Asian logistics: operationalisation within DHL (Thailand)	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Logistics; Supply chain management; Asia; Operations management	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY	Purpose - This paper aims to provide an insight around operationalising CSR and sustainability activities within an Asian-Pacific subsidiary of a leading CSR global third-party logistics company; Deutsche Post DHL. Design/methodology/approach - An in-depth single case-study approach was adopted for this study. Using semi-structured interviews with managers, the research maps various strategic CSR activities from the European corporate centre across to activities within this Asian subsidiary's different business units. Findings - The research provides evidence of activities and issues around this subsidiary's internalisation of CSR by selectively highlighting local initiatives and solutions that help address and contribute towards the global CSR strategic objectives. It describes some issues and opportunities around global policies and local activities that affect the subsidiary's present scope for decision making and management accountability. Along with the issues and challenges from this loose fit tactic of bottom-up with top-down engagement, it highlights influential aspects of social, cultural and business management models and the interpretations, context and limitations of the subsidiary's CSR contributions to date. Originality/value - Little has been written around the empirical operationalisation of CSR and sustainability from third-party logistic companies; even less so from the Asia Pacific region. The activities, themes and challenges serve as useful references for practitioners. With new, original data sets, for academic scholars, the findings also serve to provide deeper and more explanatory contributions as complementary theory development resources.

Tidal Power in the UK and Worldwide to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Energy sources and the environment; renewable energy; energy conversion systems; power generation (renewables); physics of tidal power; harnessing tidal power (tidal range, tidal stream); greenhouse gas emissions; Severn and Mersey barrage		This paper discusses the role of Tidal Power in the UK in fulfilling the UK's requirements for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Generating electricity from tidal range of the Severn Estuary has the potential to generate some 5% of UK electricity from a renewable indigenous resource. The paper focuses primarily on the proposed Severn Barrage considering potential benefits, conditions for sustainable development, energy policy context and compliance with environment legislation. UK tidal resource is reviewed: stream resource (that is KE contained in fast-flowing tidal currents), and tidal range resource (that refers to gravitation potential energy). The top tidal range and tidal stream sites in the UK with the resource (in TWh/year) are indicated. A feasibility study for Tidal Range development in the Mersey Estuary is also summarised and other schemes including the Loughor Estuary (Wales), Duddon Estuary (located on the Cumbrian coast) and the Thames Estuary proposals are reported. Also given is a strategic overview of the Severn Estuary resource, electric output and characteristics, carbon emissions (carbon payback and carbon reduction potential) and physical implications of a barrage.

J	Lucas, MT; Kirillova, OM				Lucas, Marilyn T.; Kirillova, Olga M.			Reconciling the resource-based and competitive positioning perspectives on manufacturing flexibility	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive strategy; Flexible manufacturing systems; Manufacturing resource planning; Organizational performance		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reconcile two different perspectives on manufacturing flexibility found in the operations management literature. Design/methodology/approach - Conceptual in nature, the paper examines manufacturing flexibility from the perspective of the resource-based view of the firm as a complement to the competitive positioning view of strategic management. It draws upon both these views to better understand the role of manufacturing flexibility in firms. Findings - The paper emphasizes the proactive use of manufacturing flexibility, as a means to create opportunities, in addition to its reactive use in response to environmental uncertainties. The integration of the resource-based and competitive positioning views has implications for researchers in explaining inter-firm performance differences and for practitioners in incorporating the role of manufacturing flexibility in their strategic thinking. Research limitations/implications - The integration of these two theories should be empirically tested to provide a better understanding of the conditions under which alternative use is more critical in explaining a firm's success. Practical implications - Manufacturing has been traditionally viewed as a reactive tool to adjust to environmental uncertainties. The paper argues that this approach is too narrow and emphasizes the proactive role of manufacturing flexibility as a competitive weapon in strategy formulation. Originality/value - The paper suggests that the integration of the resource-based and competitive positioning allows for a more complete picture of the role of manufacturing flexibility in creating a competitive advantage.

The challenges of developing rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curves and national flood hazard maps for the Caribbean	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Caribbean; flood hazard maps; IDF curves; rainfall intensity		In many Caribbean countries a lack of established good practice methods means that engineers and planners are often unable to plan for and mitigate floods effectively. In most Caribbean states rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are not readily available. This is a result of the limited quantity of short-duration rainfall data available and also because the few IDF curves that have been developed in the region are generally not in the public domain. The lack of readily available IDF curves in the region often results in engineers responsible for the design of key infrastructure inappropriately 'transferring' IDF curves developed for islands, where rainfall is less intense, for use in their designs. There are no countries in the Caribbean with nationally consistent flood hazard maps. This often leaves spatial and emergency planners with insufficient information to make important strategic decisions. This paper details the challenges that were faced in producing rainfall IDF curves for return periods up to 1 in 50 years and nationally consistent extreme fluvial flood extent maps with limited data for selected countries within the Caribbean. Recommendations are made for the future development of rainfall IDF curves and national flood maps in the region both in terms of data and organisational requirements.	[Lumbroso, D.

The most important thing in implementing PPP projects is to properly draw up the contract between the public and private partners, which should explicitly state all terms and conditions, undertakings and liabilities, evaluate risks, determine the payment mechanism and dispute settlement procedure, etc. In order to reduce any risk associated with such projects, a proper legal framework should be developed, which would provide liabilities and undertakings of both parties of the project (the private and public sectors), and more information should be disbursed as to how such projects are being implemented, what the structures of financing are, and what the benefit of such projects is.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a literature review that uses examples from the literature to propose new research directions. Findings - The paper proposes research opportunities, and concludes that the contributions of entrepreneurship to normative macro-marketing are largely absent. Practical implications - The marketing/entrepreneurship interface continues to be a connection that is difficult to define. Yet, it is an area with rich research potential, and it is critical that marketing embraces these opportunities to strengthen its strategic focus as a discipline. Originality/value - The paper integrates literature from a variety of perspectives from marketing and related fields, and maps the marketing/entrepreneurship interface on Hunt's classification schema.

J	Paik, Y; Ando, N				Paik, Yongsun; Ando, Naoki			MNC's competitive strategies, experiences, and staffing policies for foreign affiliates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competitive strategies; experiences; international staffing policy; MNCs	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; JAPANESE FIRMS; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; ENTRY MODE; SUBSIDIARY PERFORMANCE; CULTURAL DISTANCE; GLOBAL STRATEGY; UNITED-STATES; EXPATRIATE; CHOICE	This study investigates the relationship between the strategic role of a multinational corporation's (MNC) foreign affiliates and its international staffing policy. Specifically, this study examines how an MNC's decision on expatriation is affected by strategic roles assigned to foreign affiliates: global integration of activities versus local market seeking. An empirical study is conducted using a sample of 808 foreign affiliates of Japanese firms. The research findings suggest that strategic roles of foreign affiliates alone may not adequately explain the international staffing policies of Japanese MNCs. Rather, we found a significant moderating effect of international as well as host country experience on staffing practices for foreign affiliates. While the staffing policies of MNCs striving for improving global efficiency of their operation are moderated by both international and host country experience, those seeking a specific local market position are influenced only by host country experience.

J	Palttala, P; Vos, M				Palttala, Paulina; Vos, Marita			Testing a methodology to improve organizational learning about crisis communication by public organizations	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Crisis communication; Disaster management; Performance indicators; Quality control; Emergency communication; Organizational performance; Communication management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to test a measurement system with performance indicators to improve organizational learning about crisis communication by public organizations enhancing public safety in large scale emergencies. The tool can be used to conduct a preparedness audit or to evaluate communication performance in a real situation or in an emergency exercise. Evaluation is part of the strategic planning and development of crisis communication. Design/methodology/approach - The construction of the instrument and its theoretical underpinnings are first explained, after which the series of empirical tests that were implemented to scrutinize the clarity and appropriateness of the indicators as well as the usability of the instrument are presented. The process approach to crisis management, in which the various phases of a crisis are seen as a continuum, and the stakeholder perspective, in which both the diversity of public groups and the network of response organizations are taken into account, are applied in the paper. Findings - The tests of the instrument revealed much interest in its use, and it was seen as a potential tool for the improvement by public organizations of their crisis communication. The tests led to improvements in the structure as well as in the phrasing of the individual performance indicators and their explanation. The indicators were considered relevant and important but too many in number. Therefore, a possibility to use the instrument in three separate parts, relating respectively to the period before, during and after a crisis, should be offered. Research limitations/implications - This study addresses the main factors relevant for crisis communication with respect to the approach chosen, but does not report all the literature and empirical findings that validate the individual indicators as this has been done in other publications. It also presents a series of first test findings but not as yet the results of improvements initiated by using the instrument. Practical implications - The instrument developed shows weak and strong points in crisis communication on the level of single indicators, but also allows comparison of performance in different phases and for the various stakeholder groups, showing where more attention is needed. The instrument developed will be available on an open web site and users will be asked to make the measurement results, rendered anonymous, available for its further improvement. Social implications - The paper contributes to effectiveness of emergency management by testing an instrument to facilitate learning about crisis communication. Originality/value - Much of the crisis communication literature focuses on reputation crises. This paper discusses crisis communication supporting crisis management in the case of disasters and other emergencies that are handled by a response network instead a single organization. It provides a clear framework for analysing and assessing the quality of crisis communication and stimulates and thus enables learning and further improvement.

J	Prince, JB; Katz, J; Kabst, R				Prince, J. Bruce; Katz, Jeffrey; Kabst, Ruediger			High-involvement information sharing practices: an international perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						comparative HRM; global HRM strategies; high-performance work systems; information sharing; institution theory	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FIRM PERFORMANCE; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; WORK PRACTICES; PRODUCTIVITY; SYSTEMS; EUROPE; HRM; TURNOVER	The type of information shared within organizations is a key aspect of strategic human resources management. In this exploratory study, we expand our understanding of high-performance work systems (HPWSs) by examining the information sharing practices of firms operating in different countries to assess the extent that high-involvement-oriented information sharing in organizations is influenced by home-country economic structures and national cultural factors. We assess firm-level data from a 12-country sample to evaluate the use of formal information sharing practices for non-managerial employees. The results of our analysis support the contention that information sharing practices varies by country, and that cultural similarities based on geographical region exist within the three information content areas of business strategy, financial performance, and organization of work. Specifically, we found significant variance in information sharing practices of firms based in different countries but homogeneity of practices among geographical neighbors. There is a modest positive relationship between sharing business strategy information and perceived firm performance that is significantly stronger in North America compared to other regions. These results have important implications for the ongoing theoretical development of mechanisms underlying the use of HPWS practices in an international context.	[Prince, J.

J	Rasid, SZA; Rahman, ARA; Ismail, WKW				Rasid, Siti Zaleha Abdul; Rahman, Abdul Rahim Abdul; Ismail, Wan Khairuzzaman Wan			Management accounting and risk management in Malaysian financial institutions An exploratory study	MANAGERIAL AUDITING JOURNAL			English	Article						Management accounting; Risk management; Financial institutions; Malaysia	MANAGERIAL PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; UNCERTAINTY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between management accounting and risk management. The paper measures the extent to which management accounting practices help in managing risks and the extent of the integration between these two important managerial functions. Design/methodology/approach - The study used a mail survey of financial institutions listed in the Malaysian Central Banks' web site. The respondents to whom 106 questionnaires were sent were the chief financial officers; the response rate was 68 percent. A total of 16 post-survey semi-structured interviews were also conducted with selected respondents to gain further insights into the survey findings. Findings - The findings from the survey indicate that analysis of financial statements was perceived to contribute most towards risk management. The majority of the respondents were of the view that the management accounting function was greatly involved in the organization's risk management. Consistent with the survey findings, the interviewees also perceived that budgetary control, budgeting, and strategic planning played important roles in managing risk. Research limitations/implications - This is a study conducted in Malaysian financial institutions and thus, results may not be generalizable to other contexts. The findings of this study strengthen the importance of both management accounting and risk management in complementing each other to form part of the corporate performance management systems. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature as very few studies have examined the significant link between management accounting and risk management.

J	Sahoo, T; Banwet, DK; Momaya, K				Sahoo, Tapan; Banwet, D. K.; Momaya, K.			Strategic technology management in the auto component industry in India A case study of select organizations	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						India; Automotive industry; Automotive components industry; Technology led strategy; Strategic manufacturing; Competitive strategy		Purpose - The automobile industry in India is one of the sunrise industries and is poised to enhance its contribution from 5 percent of GDP in 2006 to 10 percent by 2016. The auto component industry in India has grown hand in hand with the industry and is in the process of transforming itself from being a "Job order fulfiller" to being an "Integrated organization". With the liberalization process having started in 1991, most auto component manufacturers in India have chosen the easy path of attempting to progress on operational or manufacturing capabilities. For advancing on technology capability dimension, they mostly relied on international collaborations. The purpose of this paper is to study the strategic technology management (STM) practices in select case organizations in the auto component industry in India. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed for this study is a combination of literature survey, expert opinion, comparative case study and a flexible systems methodology, situation-actor-process-learning-action-performance analysis. Longitudinal studies of technology development at the two case organizations have been done and the case analysis and synthesis has been developed based on valuable inputs and insights shared by key personnel in the case organizations. Findings - The study finds that two different organizations have adopted different technology strategies. While both case organizations have strong linkage between business and technology strategy, the approach has been reasonably different for technology acquisition and development. The findings suggest that an effective STM can contribute to faster technology absorption and overall business performance. Organizations in India need to develop the in-house capabilities along with suitable technology acquisitions, wherever required. Originality/value - The two cases provide valuable insights into STM practices in two organizations and highlight the methodology adopted by the companies in their evolutions toward becoming world-class integrated organizations. The learning can provide the way forward for capable firms in the auto component industry in India.

J	Schoenherr, T; Mabert, VA				Schoenherr, Tobias; Mabert, Vincent A.			A comparison of online and offline procurement in B2B markets: results from a large-scale survey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						procurement; online reverse auctions; sourcing decisions; supply management; transaction cost economics; psychological distance perspective; survey research	TRANSACTION COST; PRODUCT COMPLEXITY; ADOPTION; DECISION; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; IMPACT; TECHNOLOGIES; ANTECEDENTS	Purchasing professionals in today's business-to-business (B2B) markets can choose between conducting bid solicitations and negotiations using an online or an offline process. One dominant type of online procurement has been the online reverse auction, which has received both praise and criticism. However, the choice between an online reverse auction and alternate offline procurement methods cannot be taken lightly. It is the objective of this research to distinguish these two environments and investigate their differences along the dimensions of purchase importance, supply market availability, future orientation and item specification difficulty. Examining these issues from the buyer's perspective, we develop our arguments of procurement choice based on literature in industrial buyer behaviour, strategic sourcing, and online reverse auctions; the psychological distance perspective and transaction cost economics serve as theoretical foundations for our hypotheses. Our hypotheses are tested with hierarchical logistic regression analysis using responses from 825 purchasing professionals in the US manufacturing sector. Two of our four main hypotheses are supported, indicating that offline procurement is more likely to be chosen when the purchase is highly important, whereas auctions are the preferred choice as more suppliers become able and willing to participate in the bidding process. No differences were detected between the future orientation of the buyer and the item specification difficulty. Advice is provided to practitioners when reverse auctions are more amenable than offline methods. Contributions to academia include the extension of the literature in industrial buyer behaviour and auctions, as well as the theoretical development based on the psychological distance perspective and transaction cost economics.

J	Wiegand, KE				Wiegand, Krista E.			Militarized territorial disputes: States' attempts to transfer reputation for resolve	JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH			English	Article						costly signal; militarized interstate disputes; reputation; resolve; territorial disputes	INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT; WAR; DETERRENCE; ESCALATION; DEMOCRACY; ISSUES; MANAGEMENT; CLAIMS	States involved in territorial disputes are more likely to initiate militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) compared to states involved in other types of interstate disputes, when the disputed territory has strategic or ethnic value, and when the opposing states are contiguous, rivals, or have relative power parity. Though useful, these factors are static or rarely change over time, so they cannot explain the timing of an MID in a territorial dispute. It is not clear why a challenger state would threaten or use force at one point in the dispute, but not at another point. This study proposes that challenger states sometimes use MIDs not only to signal resolve to the opposing state in the territorial dispute, but to credibly demonstrate resolve to other adversaries in other disputes - an attempt to transfer reputation for resolve. To tackle the debate about transferability of reputation for resolve, the study empirically analyzes all territorial disputes from 1919 to 1995 and finds support that challenger states are more likely to initiate territorial MIDs as costly signals of resolve and credibility around the same time as another MID with a different adversary. Further analysis indicates that in terms of intensity level, challenger states are more likely to use threats, displays of force, or low intensity uses of force when initiating an MID to signal resolve to other states.

J	Wigley, SM; Provelengiou, AK				Wigley, Stephen M.; Provelengiou, Aikaterini-Konstantina			Market-facing strategic alliances in the fashion sector	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Corporate strategy; Strategic management; Strategic alliances; Fashion industry		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate market-facing fashion industry strategic alliances in the fashion industry by studying a specific case in context of the existing literature. It has three key objectives: to explore the motives causing strategic alliance formation in the fashion industry; to understand the processes involved in the creation and management of such an alliance, and to identify factors defining the success of the alliance. Design/methodology/approach - Case study methodology was employed studying an instance of market-facing strategic alliance in the fashion sector. Findings - It was found that while issues generic within the literature may be discerned in instances of strategic alliance in the fashion industry, industry-specific factors, especially competence in marketing, branding and retailing, impact on the motives for alliance, partner selection and alliance implementation and alliance. Research limitations/implications - The usual limitations of any case study apply. Practical implications - The paper provides an account of the motives for processes affecting and outcomes of strategic alliance in the fashion industry and promoting student, academic and practitioner understanding of the topic.

Pay dispersion and the financial performance of the firm: evidence from Korea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						incentive intensity; pay dispersion; pay-for-performance efficiency; strategic pay	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; TOP MANAGEMENT; EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION; DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE; WAGE DISPERSION; PRODUCTIVITY; EFFICIENCY; TOURNAMENT; LABOR; SELF	Pay dispersion has been found in prior research to negatively affect both individual and workplace performance. In this study, we examine whether the relationship between horizontal pay dispersion and firm financial performance is curvilinear in nature, with moderate levels of dispersion leading to more positive outcomes than either low or high levels. Using data from a government-sponsored survey of Korean firms, we find support for the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between pay dispersion and firm financial performance. We further find that this curvilinear relationship is moderated by firm and human resource system characteristics. Where the firm had more incumbents in the rank being examined, where pay level was higher, and where there was greater organizational investment in performance evaluation and feedback, the positive slope (within the curvilinear relationship) inverted at a higher level of dispersion.

Organizational learning and performance: Relationship between the dynamic and the operational capabilities of the firm	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational learning; dynamic capabilities; operational capabilities; business performance	RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; MARKET ORIENTATION; CORE COMPETENCE; KNOW-HOW; FLEXIBILITY; ANTECEDENTS; IMPACT	This paper analyzes the relationship between organizational learning mechanisms, normally regarded as dynamic capabilities, and the operational flexibility of the firm, considered as an operational capability, within the context of the measurement of firm performance. Organizational learning is a dynamic process which enables the firm to adapt to changing environments, so making it easier for it to change established behaviour patterns and routines. This dynamic capability is therefore directly related to organizational routines and the operational processes that underlie these routines, and the objective of this study is to analyze this relationship and its effect on firm performance. To this end, we carried out an empirical study to test the relationships proposed in our model. Our most important findings were firstly that there is a link between the dynamic and the operational capabilities of the firm, and secondly that the development of dynamic capabilities will result in improved firm performance.

J	Ben-Zvi-Assaraf, O; Ayal, N				Ben-Zvi-Assaraf, Orit; Ayal, Nitzan			Harnessing the Environmental Professional Expertise of Engineering Students-The Course: "Environmental Management Systems in the Industry"	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Environmental literacy; Engineering education; Environmental management systems	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; SCIENCE; VALIDATION; UNIVERSITY; CURRICULA; TOOL	More and more technical universities now advocate integrating sustainability in higher education and including it as a strategic goal for improving education's quality and relevance to society. This study examines 30 fourth-year chemical engineering students, graduates of a university course designed to combine their terminological domain with sustainability-oriented goals, focusing on topics like corporate sustainability, developing environmental policy, introduction to ISO 14001-Environmental Management Systems (EMS), and environmental legislation. The study explores their perception of industrial-environmental issues and asks-How did the study unit influence the students' ability to use their preexisting scientific knowledge, while relating to industrial-environmental issues? Our findings indicate that engineering students can develop industrial-environmental awareness, and make use of interdisciplinary knowledge beyond that strictly related to the realm of engineering. Regarding the research's particular aim-i.e. determining the study unit's influence on students' ability to relate industrial-environmental issues to their own field of engineering-the findings indeed show a change in the students' conceptions of environmental elements related to industry. The course graduates became more attentive to the environmental aspects associated with building and opening a factory, and the concepts they raised in connection with the topic gained in variety.

J	Gould, JE; Macharis, C; Haasis, HD				Gould, Julie E.; Macharis, Cathy; Haasis, Hans-Dietrich			Emergence of security in supply chain management literature	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SECURITY			English	Article						Supply chain management; Supply chain security; Vulnerability; Resilience; Content analysis; Narrative literature review		The topic of security for supply chains and logistics functions has risen in importance both in practice as well as in the research and has emerged as its own area of research within SCM and logistics. This paper presents a review of the development of the topic of security in supply chain management literature. The article aims to categorize the main security issues dealt with in the literature on supply chain security, enumerate the theoretical approaches applied to these issues and present a discussion of the emergent solutions coming out this research. The article considers three benefits for the supply chain security that form a core set of research goals in the literature on SCS: improving security, making supply chain processes more efficient, and improving supply chain resilience. While operationalization of supply chain security is still not well developed in the literature, some findings of particular interest relate logistics planning to supply chain security. Improving responsiveness of supply chains is still an area that requires a lot of research attention. Underlying the proposed and experienced supply chain security measures is the requirement for integration of security measures in strategic and operational activities across the supply chain.

Drawing on the notions of knowledge reliability (the creation of shared meanings) and validity (the understanding of cause and effect), we explore how organizations learn inferentially in dynamic environments, where active experimentation rather than past experience is the underlying basis for learning. We find that intraorganizational knowledge spill-ins transfer heuristics crafted by one unit under local conditions of reliability and validity to other units, where they are reinterpreted and repurposed. Intraorganizational knowledge spill-ins emerge as a mechanism through which reliability and validity are enhanced for organizational learning. Copyright (c) 2010 Strategic Management Society.

The aim was to improve performance by providing consistent, highly meaningful performance measurement, increase PI skills in staff at all levels, develop organizational capabilities, and provide support for making improvements in medical centers and across regions. Evaluating the PI System: The intermediate results of the PI system were assessed in the 22 medical centers in four of the eight Kaiser Permanente regions. Implementation for 3 of these medical centers occurred in January 2008 through November 2008, with implementation for the remaining 19 medical centers occurring from September 2008 through September 2009. Findings: The 22 medical centers that were evaluated achieved a 61% improvement in selected capabilities, and improvement advisors (IAs) successfully completed 84% of initial PI projects. For each dollar invested, estimates suggested an average return on investment of $2.36. Lessons Learned: Critical factors include adequate dedicated time for PI activities by staff with necessary expertise, expert support to operations, alignment of projects with regional and national strategic priorities, and close working relationships between PI staff and operational management. Involving finance leaders in improvement planning, prioritization, and oversight is important. These elements can be adapted to smaller systems and single hospitals. Conclusions: The initial evaluation of the Kaiser Perma nente PI system indicated that (1) IAs successfully led pro jects in conjunction with frontline teams, (2) organizational capabilities increased, and (3) the investment in PI infrastructure and staff was sound. Expansion throughout the entire Kaiser Permanente system is under way.

J	von Krogh, G; Haefliger, S				von Krogh, Georg; Haefliger, Stefan			Opening up design science: The challenge of designing for reuse and joint development	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Design science; IT artifact; Open Source software; Adaptive structuration; Inter-organizational information systems; Strategic management of IT	OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE; PRIVATE-COLLECTIVE INNOVATION; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; CREATION; COMMUNITIES; MODEL; RETHINKING; GOVERNANCE	The purpose of this paper is to advance design science by developing a framework for research on reuse and the relationship between external IT artifacts and their users. A design science approach to IS research needs to grapple with the fact that a number of relevant, economically attractive, external IT artifacts cannot be designed from scratch nor meaningfully evaluated based on the current state of development, and so design science research will struggle with incomplete cycles of design, relevance, and rigor. We suggest a strategic research agenda that integrates the design of the relationship between an external IT artifact and the user by considering the impact artifacts exert on users. Three dimensions derived from adaptive structuration theory inform our framework on three levels of design granularity (middle management, top management, and entrepreneur): agenda considers the dynamic properties of technological objects, adaptability refers to the functional affordance of external artifacts in development, and auspice captures the symbolic expression and scope for interpretation.

The topic of E-HRM is certainly not becoming obsolete, and its full potential is still anticipated and therefore academic involvement in the topic needs to grow. Besides, there has been a great deal of research on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in Malaysia. Less attention is given to examine the relationship between HR roles (strategic partner, change agent, employee champion, and administrative expert) and E-HRM by adoption of TAM. This paper intended to contribute to the Malaysian literature pertaining to this subject. Based on a review of extant literature on E-HRM, HR roles, and TAM, a model is presented and propositions outlined for future empirical testing.

J	Hayton, JC; Sehili, S; Scarpello, V				Hayton, James C.; Sehili, Saloua; Scarpello, Vida			Why do firms join consortial research centers? An empirical examination of firm, industry and environmental antecedents	JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER			English	Article						Research centers; Interorganizational relations; Cooperative R&D	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; COOPERATIVE STRATEGY; HIGH-TECHNOLOGY; UNITED-STATES; PERFORMANCE; ALLIANCES; RESOURCES	The purpose of this study was to test 10 hypotheses for why firms join research centers that are consortial in nature. We describe research centers with a formal arrangement for accommodating external membership as being consortial research centers (CRC). Although traditional analysis of why firms form collaborative research arrangements have tended to focus upon firm level variables, this study takes a broader view on antecedent factors. We derive hypotheses from resource dependence theory, market forces theory, and strategic behavior model explanations for such firm behavior. Panel data from 503 firms, in 104 industries from 1978 through 1996 were used to test the hypotheses. The decision to join a CRC was modeled using multivariate binomial probit analysis. Results showed that industry competitiveness, technological opportunities and the production of complementary innovations are all positively related to propensity to join a CRC. Slack resources are related to joining propensity in a non-linear fashion.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH			English	Article						transition management, experiment; multi-actor governance, project management	STRATEGIC NICHE MANAGEMENT; BOUNDED SOCIOTECHNICAL EXPERIMENTS; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; TRANSITION; TRANSPORT; INSIGHTS	Sustainable mobility has proved to be a perennial challenge to realize. Scholars have argued that experiments could point the way forward towards sustainable mobility (cf. Loorbach, 2007, Markard and Truffer, 2008). In doing so, literature attributes a vital but complex task to those who engage in experiments. However, an important knowledge gap pertains to whether and how experiments contribute to learning about transitions and in what way they should be managed to break-up the more or less inertial mobility governance system. This paper aims to analyze how state-of-the-art literature on the governance of multi-actor systems considers experiments to contribute to transitions and highlight key dilemma's that professionals engaged in the management of experimental face in the day-to-day management and decision making processes during the experiment. The paper will highlight these dilemmas and choices and illustrate their importance for experiments in the field of transportation and more specifically in the specific context of the Dutch mobility system and the TRANSUMO research program. Identifying these dilemma's benefits practitioners who are engaged in the management of experiments to more consciously reflect on and include issues of second-order learning in the day-to-day management and decision making during the experiment to reach a more sustainable mobile system.

Hospital administrators have traditionally held academic and community physicians and hospital clinicians accountable for integrating the core measures into daily practice. Such efforts have often led to suboptimal results because of the belief that the "organization" (macrosystem) is the appropriate level at which to work to improve quality. Stanford Hospital and Clinics (Stanford, California) has instead held leaders of clinical microsystems-the clinical units where care is provided-accountable to improve performance on the core measures. The strategic approaches taken for this initiative include engagement of the hospital's board of directors; clear assignment of accountability among interdisciplinary care teams to drive the change; implementation of a unit-based medical director program; transparency of core measure performance at the microsystem, mesosystem, and macrosystem levels; and concurrent monitoring with rapid feedback of results. Results: In 2007, the first year of this initiative, the 24-metric composite compliance score for all four core measures increased from 64% to 82%. The composite score was sustained at a minimum of 90% during 2009 and Quarter 1 of 2010. Conclusions: Holding clinical microsystems accountable for improving unit performance proved beneficial to macrosystem performance of the Joint Commission core measures.

J	Kohtamaki, M; Kautonen, T; Kraus, S				Kohtamaki, Marko; Kautonen, Teemu; Kraus, Sascha			Strategic planning and small business performance An examination of the mediating role of exploration and exploitation behaviours	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION			English	Article						strategic planning; performance; exploration; exploitation; small business	FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; AMBIDEXTERITY; ANTECEDENTS; INNOVATION	This paper examines the mediating role of opportunity exploration and resource exploitation in the relationship between strategic planning and small business performance. The research model is examined with a sample of 153 small Finnish firms. The results show that exploitation, but not exploration, carries the effect of strategic planning to the performance of a small firm. This implies that strategic plans as such are not sufficient to improve business performance unless they are carefully integrated into the actual processes and behaviour of the firm.

J	Milutinovic, S; Jolovic, A				Milutinovic, Slobodan; Jolovic, Ana			Building Capacity for Sustainability: Strategic Planning Processes for Local Sustainable Development Practices in Western Balkan	LEX LOCALIS-JOURNAL OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT			English	Article						sustainable development; local community; Western Balkan; Serbia; Montenegro; Bosnia - Herzegovina	POLITICS	Municipalities on the Western Balkan have made significant progress in their strategic approach to local development after 2000. A number of municipalities have already developed and implemented strategic plans for local sustainable development. However, differences in capacities, management skills and motivation among local governments are easy to observe. The lack of substantial decentralization efforts, low internal capacity in municipalities, overlapping jurisdictions between central and local levels, a culture of non-participation and an unfavourable economic environment jeopardize the success of local development efforts. This paper analyzes local sustainable development planning processes and practices in three Western Balkan countries (Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia - Herzegovina) by using the Drina River Basin as a case study.

J	Van Berkel, R				Van Berkel, Rene			Evolution and diversification of National Cleaner Production Centres (NCPCs)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cleaner production; Eco-efficiency; Environmentally sound technology; Sustainable industrial development; Developing countries; Transition economies		Since 1994 UNIDO and UNEP cooperate in a Programme to establish National Cleaner Production Centres (NCPCs) as a mechanism for delivery of Cleaner Production (CP) services to businesses, governments and other organisations. In 2007, 38 NCPCs were operational in 37 developing and transition countries. While initially set up in near-identical ways in each country, over time NCPCs evolved in response to both programme-internal and country-level factors. The resulting diversity among NCPCs is described and analysed here. Differentiation and specialisation had occurred in service areas or topics both within and between NCPCs, however without a clear strategy for integration and synergy. NCPCs were becoming part of expanding networks of business services providers nationally forcing some to focus on audit and training services (tier 1), and others on specialist services in CP technology and/or policy (tier 2) and/or networking services (tier 3). All NCPCs were on a trajectory from a project management organisation to a nationally-owned entity. The different management requirements were not proactively managed and technical aspects of CP service delivery overshadowed institutional and governance aspects of establishing and operating the NCPC institution. Differences in service delivery methods between NCPCs are most evident in three service areas: CP assessments; policy advice; and transfer of Environmentally Sound Technologies. It is argued here that understanding root causes and benefits of this presently-observed differentiation, could lay the foundation for capturing and advancing best practice CP concepts, methods and policies. This in turn would enable strategic planning for customised interventions and support at the national level. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	de Man, AP; Roijakkers, N; de Graauw, H				de Man, Ard-Pieter; Roijakkers, Nadine; de Graauw, Henk			Managing dynamics through robust alliance governance structures: The case of KLM and Northwest Airlines	EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Alliance governance; Airline alliances; Alliance dynamics	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; MANAGEMENT; TRUST; PATTERNS	As alliances are mainly used in dynamic industries, extant theory assumes that alliance governance structures undergo frequent changes. This article aims to show, however, that some governance structures are more robust in dealing with internal and external dynamics than others. We develop propositions about the characteristics that need to be built into an alliance for it to be robust. These propositions are grounded in a case study of the KLM Northwest alliance. After frequent changes in the governance structure of their alliance, KLM and Northwest found a model that has withstood turbulence in the airline industry for over a decade. This model, the virtual joint venture, has among others as a key characteristic a fifty fifty profit sharing arrangement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A leader-followers model of transmission augmentation for considering strategic behaviours of generating companies in energy markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Transmission augmentation; Strategic GenCos; Leader-followers game	ELECTRICITY; CONGESTION; EXPANSION	This paper suggests an integrated mathematical framework developed based on the leader-followers game for augmentation of transmission networks. Transmission Network Service Provider moves first and designs the horizon year transmission system. Generating Companies compete for having the highest share from the energy market and they find their equilibrium point using the Nash equilibrium concept. Finally, Market Management Company receives the planning schedule of transmission system and the energy offer prices and clears the market. In addition to the exact mathematical modelling of the interested players of transmission planning problem, the methodology can design the future transmission system not only for improving the system social welfare but also for encouraging competition among horizon year generating companies.

HR-HPV DNA was detected in 61 (62%), while HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA was detected in 63 (64%) of the samples. Correlation between results from DNA analyses and the E6/E7 mRNA assay showed consistent results in 87% of samples (47 of 54). The results from these two methods in detecting presence of HPV infection of any type agreed in 77%. Overall agreement between the methods was seen in 82 of the 98 cases (84%). When evaluating change in sensitivity for detection of HPV positives by adding more HPV types to the HPV DNA assay, maximum sensitivity was reached by targeting four HPV types. The coverage of HPV DNA presence was 76.9%, while the E6/E7 mRNA assay achieved a maximum coverage of 80.8% using only three HPV types. Thus, E6/E7 oncogene expression analysis may provide a more objective test for assessment of neoplastic glandular cells. Further studies may reveal whether the clinical performance of the E6/E7 mRNA assay will be of prognostic value in management of cervical adenocarcinoma.

J	Stukalina, Y				Stukalina, Yulia			The Management of Integrated Educational Environment Resources: the factors to be considered	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						educational management; quality improvement; model of managing the educational environment resources (MMEER)	STUDENTS; QUALITY	Today, as educational organisations have become large and complex systems, education managers play a greater role in developing the most efficient educational environment. This article analyses the strategic background for educational management in relation to creating a constructive educational environment aimed at supporting a sustainable learning process. It also attempts to describe the diversity of resources that the educational environment comprises. We propose a model for managing the educational environment resources (MMEER) to guide the resources allocation within this multi-level system. The article stresses the need to create an encouraging and motivating environment to use the material and non-material resources as well as the intellectual capital of an educational institution most efficiently, student motivation being an indispensable prerequisite for enhancing quality and increasing the performance of an educational organisation.

J	Tung, GS; Lin, CY; Wang, CY				Tung, Gu-Shin; Lin, Ching-Yi; Wang, Chih-Yuan			The market structure, conduct and performance paradigm re-applied to the international tourist hotel industry	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hotels; market structure; conduct; performance	MANAGERIAL EFFICIENCY; PROFITABILITY	This paper presents a market structure, conduct, performance model (SCP) of industrial economics to estimate causes and effects among the international tourist hotel industry. Previous literature could not confirm the causality of the hotel industry, therefore, this paper develops a comprehensive model, based on realistic data of hotels, which allows the analysis of the system through three simultaneous equations, market share, advertising, and profitability. In a sample of 360 Taiwanese international tourist hotels, from 1995-2006, three-stage least squares results indicate that: (1) two-way causes and effects exist between the market structure and strategic behavior, which is detected from the incentive pattern of the SCP model; (2) a brand positive effect shows on the market share; (3) a firms' profitability is positively, and significantly, impacted by market share, but is affected negatively by total operating costs and capital intensity, which confirms hotel industry issues regarding capital.

Encoded pepsinogens A were classified into two groups, i.e., types A1 and A2, which are different in acidic character. The occurrence of 9 and 5 alleles of A1 and A2 genes (at least 5 and 3 loci), respectively was anticipated. Respective orthologous genes are present in the chimpanzee genome although their copy numbers are much smaller than those of the orangutan genes. Only A1 genes are present in the human probably due to the loss of the A2 gene. Molecular phylogenetic analyses showed that A1 and A2 genes diverged before the speciation of great hominoids. Further reduplications of respective genes occurred several times in the orangutan lineage, with much higher frequencies than those occurred in the chimpanzee and human lineages. The rates of non-synonymous substitutions were higher than those of synonymous ones in the lineage of A2 genes, implying the contribution of the positive selection on the encoded enzymes. Several sites of pepsin moieties were indeed found to be under positive selection, and most of them locate on the surface of the molecule, being involved in the conformational flexibility. Deduced from the known genomic structures of pepsinogen-A genes of primates and other mammals, the duplication/loss were frequent during their evolution. The extreme multiplication in the orangutan might be advantageous for digestion of herbaceous foods due to the increase in the level of enzymes in stomach and the diversification of enzyme specificity.

J	Luke, N				Luke, Nancy			Migrants' Competing Commitments: Sexual Partners in Urban Africa and Remittances to the Rural Origin	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							DAR-ES-SALAAM; TRANSACTIONAL SEX; ECONOMIC ASYMMETRIES; ADOLESCENT GIRLS; INCOME TRANSFERS; SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; SOUTH-AFRICA; YOUNG MEN; MIGRATION; WOMEN	Migrants form nonfamilial ties in urban destinations, which could compete with origin families for a share of remittances. A framework of competing commitment predicts that new relationships affect remittances depending on the extent to which they substitute for the benefits provided by origin families. Analyses of data from urban migrants in Kenya show that serious nonmarital sexual partners substitute for psychosocial support from the rural family and that material transfers migrants give to these partners significantly reduce remittances. The findings have implications for the ways scholars conceive of competition, the nature of exchange, and substitution of support across intimate relationships.

Conflict Management for Justice, Innovation, and Strategic Advantage in Organizational Relationships	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							VERTICAL COORDINATION; PROCEDURAL JUSTICE; TEAMS; ALLIANCES; PERCEPTIONS; ACQUISITION; PERFORMANCE; COMMITMENT; LEADERSHIP; IMPACT	This study proposed that conflict management affects organizations' beliefs that they have an effective voice (procedural justice), have shared their benefits fairly (distributive justice), and are treated respectfully (interactional justice). Structural equation analysis results suggest that a cooperative approach to conflict facilitates justice in its 3 forms in organizational relationships, and that justice, in turn, results in partner strategic advantage and innovation. Results from a sample of 103 pairs of customer and supplier organizations in Shanghai were interpreted as providing support for the value of justice for collaborative work between organizations. The findings also suggest that a cooperative approach to managing conflict is an important antecedent to justice in organizational relationships in China.	[Tjosvold, Dean; Wong, Alfred S.

We do not seek to provide a prescriptive panacea in this paper but we find links between particular types of strategic formulation and operations performance in a range of key parameters. Our research focuses on the personal computer industry where there are high demands placed on the capabilities of the operations function. We suggest that such capabilities do not happen by accident but are developed by specific strategies whereby in-house operations and business mainstream strategies, including supply, become closely linked in both planning and implementation.

Decentralized Dynamic Task Allocation Using Overlapping Potential Games	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						ALADDIN special issue; decentralized technique for planning agent schedules in dynamic task allocation problems; stochastic game formulation	SYSTEMS	This paper reports on a novel decentralized technique for planning agent schedules in dynamic task allocation problems. Specifically, we use a stochastic game formulation of these problems in which tasks have varying hard deadlines and processing requirements. We then introduce a new technique for approximating this game using a series of static potential games, before detailing a decentralized method for solving the approximating games that uses the distributed stochastic algorithm. Finally, we discuss an implementation of our approach to a task allocation problem in the RoboCup Rescue disaster management simulator. The results show that our technique performs comparably to a centralized task scheduler (within 6% on average), and also, unlike its centralized counterpart, it is robust to restrictions on the agents' communication and observation ranges.

J	Chung, HD				Chung, Hyun-Duck			Relationship Building in Entrepreneurship Liaison Work: One Business Librarian's Experience at North Carolina State University	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & FINANCE LIBRARIANSHIP			English	Article						entrepreneurship education; liaison librarians; subject specialists; relationship building; outreach		This article presents the growth of entrepreneurship education on college campuses as an opportunity for business librarians to engage strategic initiatives that reach beyond the business school. Drawing on the experiences of one business librarian serving as the primary liaison to a campus wide entrepreneurship initiative at North Carolina State University (NC State), this article illustrates how a relationship-building approach to liaison work can lead to iterative collaborations with faculty over time. An in-depth consideration of the relationship-building process offers a model that librarians in business and other subject liaison roles can adapt and reflect on their practice. The model considers three stages: recognizing events as opportunities, developing those opportunities into relationships, and cultivating those relationships through collaborative projects that can improve student learning and scholarship through synergistic outcomes.

Impacts of model structure and data aggregation on European wide predictions of nitrogen and green house gas fluxes in response to changes in livestock, land cover, and land management	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						modeling; nitrogen; green house gases; land use; land management; model comparison	EMISSIONS; SOILS	Various model approaches have been developed for assessing emissions of different forms of reactive nitrogen in various parts of Europe at various geographic resolutions and for various time periods. The modeling approaches include emission factor approaches, empirical models, simple process-based models, and detailed ecosystem models. In this study, we compared three relatively simple process-based models, developed for the national scale (Integrated NITrogen Impact AssessmenT model On a Regional Scale (INITIATOR2)), European scale (MITERRA) and global scale (integrated model to assess the global environment (IMAGE)), with respect to their response to structural and technological changes in the agricultural systems based on the IPCC B2 baseline scenario for the period 2000-2030. Changes are predicted by the IMAGE model and relate to crop yield, crop area, animal numbers, and N fertilizer inputs. The predicted relative changes by IMAGE are used in INITIATOR2 and MITERRA while relating the animal categories and crop categories in IMAGE to those in the latter models. A comparison was made of NH3, N2O and NOx emissions and N leaching to ground water. We compared predictions for the years 2000 and 2030 for: (i) the Netherlands between INITIATOR2 and MITERRA and (ii) Europe (EU-27 countries) between MITERRA and IMAGE. The results of the comparison are presented and evaluated in view of differences in model structure and the effect of aggregating input data at larger spatial scales.

J	Dimba, BA				Dimba, Beatrice Akong'o			Strategic human resource management practices: effect on performance	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Human resource strategies; Organizational performance; Multinational companies; Developing countries; Working practices; Kenya		Purpose - Strategic human resource management (SHRM) practices are used by large foreign multinational companies to improve their performance. The purpose of this paper is to establish the direct or indirect relationship between SHRM practices and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - SHRM practices are conceptualized as independent variables measured through a bundle of distinct practices. Organizational performance as a dependent variable is measured using constructs of image, interpersonal relations, and product quality. The model is tested with data from 50 large foreign multinational companies operating in Kenya. Findings - Results of this paper show that the SHRM practices that best predict firm performance are training and development and compensation systems. The relationship between the use of SHRM practices and firm performance does not hold across the five bundles of what are considered as "high performance work practices". This paper also assumes that the relationship between SHRM practices and firm performance is indirect through motivation. Research limitations/implications - Cross-sectional data from 50 large manufacturing companies in Kenya are used, and it would be interesting to test this model for more industries and countries. Practical implications - Results of this paper have shown that the SHRM practices that best predict firm performance are training and development and compensation systems. Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical paper of the influence of SHRM practices on firm performance, using data from large foreign manufacturing companies operating in Kenya.

J	Farris, MT				Farris, M. Theodore, II			Solutions to strategic supply chain mapping issues	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge mapping; Supply chain management; Strategic management		Purpose - The development of strategic supply chain mapping techniques has been slowed by four critical issues. The purpose of this paper is to answer a call to address supply chain mapping techniques and issues. It offers recommendations for more readable and useful strategic supply chain maps. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilized executive MBA, traditional MBA, and graduating logistics undergraduates' applied economic input/output data to refine mapping techniques. Findings - The paper addresses strategic supply chain mapping issues to serve as the next step in advancing the evolution of strategic supply chain mapping techniques. It utilizes geovisualization to provide useful guidance to individuals trying to map their current supply chain and seeking potential improvements. Research limitations/implications - The paper is limited in that strategic supply chain mapping is in its infancy. Future research may consider use of the technique comparing alternative approaches to a supply chain, as well as the application of Pareto analysis and other metrics to focus on critical components for mapping. Practical implications - The use of input/output analysis initiates mapping at the macro industry level as a key starting point. Geovisualization techniques allow those mapping to offer a great amount of detail in a simple, easy-to-read format to identify the critical components of the specific supply chain. Originality/value - This paper is the critical next step to help further advance the evolution of strategic supply chain mapping techniques by both practitioner and academic.

J	Frolich, N; Stensaker, B				Frolich, Nicoline; Stensaker, Bjorn			Student recruitment strategies in higher education: promoting excellence and diversity?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Students; Higher education; Universities; Recruitment; Norway		Purpose - This paper seeks to analyse how excellence and diversity are addressed in student recruitment strategies, and how these strategies are developed in eight Norwegian higher education institutions. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilises a theoretical perspective that asserts that strategy is developed through practice. The authors have combined document analysis with qualitative interviews to investigate the development of institutional student recruitment strategies, their characteristics and their links to the individual institution's profile and ambitions. Findings - The study reveals that student recruitment strategies are often grounded in inherent institutional identities, while at the same time responding to external ideas about excellence and diversity. The study also finds that higher education institutions show significant creativity in trying to adapt to these ideas and general trends, while at the same time maintaining their own characteristics and traditions. Findings suggest that student recruitment strategies are also used for accountability purposes. Given the importance of student recruitment, many higher education institutions attach surprisingly little importance to this issue. Research limitations/implications - The study encompasses only a small number of institutions in a single country, limiting the possibility of generalising aspects of the profile and content of the student recruitment strategies. Nevertheless, the analysis indicates that the processes associated with the development of student recruitment strategies are quite similar, with more emphasis on specific quantitative analytical schemes and less emphasis on other ways of organising strategy development. Originality/value - The paper reveals the importance of placing greater focus on the ways in which strategic processes are organised and identifying the potential for improving the creative organisation of the strategising process.

J	Gomes, CF; Yasin, MM; Yasin, Y				Gomes, Carlos F.; Yasin, Mahmoud M.; Yasin, Yousef			Assessing operational effectiveness in healthcare organizations: a systematic approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Performance measures; Decision making; Health services; Cost effectiveness	PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT SYSTEM; BALANCED SCORECARD; IMPROVEMENT; SERVICES; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a systematic approach to measuring, tracking, monitoring and continuously improving efficiency, availability and quality in healthcare operational settings. Design/methodology/ approach - The proposed measure of healthcare operational effectiveness (HOE) consists of three indicators. They include an availability indicator, an quality indicator, and an efficiency indicator. The proposed approach tends to facilitate the systematic improvement at the different facets of operational effectiveness. Findings - The proposed operational performance approach based on the HOE is consistent with the themes of performance measures and measurement reported in the literature. Research limitations/implications - The proposed healthcare operational effectiveness approach represents a serious attempt at quantifying the key facets of service effectiveness in healthcare operational settings. The validation of this performance assessment and measurement approach is worthy of future research. Practical implications - The approach advocated by the HOE has operational and strategic relevance to decision makers of healthcare organizations. Originality/value - This paper presents a practical, systematic approach toward enhancing operational effectiveness in healthcare organizations. Relevant implementation issues associated with the proposed approach are also addressed.

J	Grossler, A				Groessler, Andreas			An exploratory system dynamics model of strategic capabilities in manufacturing	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic capabilities; Simulation; System dynamics; Accumulation	FLEXIBILITY; VALIDATION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the dynamics of accumulation processes of strategic capabilities in manufacturing, i.e. cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility. By applying a dynamic view, concepts from the literature are tested and shortcomings are identified. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis was conducted with the help of an exploratory system dynamics model that represented a hierarchy of these accumulative capabilities. The exploratory model was parameterized with empirical data from a large international survey of manufacturing plants. Findings - The major finding of this paper is that results from a static analysis can be transferred into a dynamic model, which can be used to test allocation strategies of resources to strategic capabilities. Practical implications - The practical implications concern the distribution of managerial attention on the four capabilities and the consequences of different distributions. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in the insights gained by the transformation of a verbal model into a quantified simulation model, and the learning resulting from simulation experiments.

Strategies towards innovative services: findings from the German service landscape	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						service innovation; interaction; strategy	QUALITY; CUSTOMERS; COMMUNICATION; EXPERIENCES; BUSINESS; FIRMS	The specifics of services seem to prohibit a simple transfer of innovation strategies from the manufacturing to the service sector. To better understand what works, successful strategic service innovators and their strategic approaches have been the focus of this study. To do so, 80 service innovators in Germany have been monitored over a period of one year. By analyzing them, according to the basic strategies they follow (low cost, differentiation or mixed emphasis) and the dominant design of their service delivery system (information technology-based, people-based or mixed approach), this paper provides an understanding of the strategic approaches followed by successful service innovators. Our findings propose that there is a fit between the complexity of service offerings and variety of the interaction approaches by successful service innovators. In sum, we argue that for an appropriate design of service innovation strategy both managers and researchers need to go beyond the traditional distinction of low cost and differentiation strategy.

J	McWatters, CS; Lemarchand, Y				McWatters, Cheryl S.; Lemarchand, Yannick			Accounting as story telling Merchant activities and commercial relations in eighteenth century France	ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Accounting; Publications; Narratives; Storytelling; History; France		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend to accounting and accounting texts the arguments of Phillips which suggest that organisational analysis can be enriched by a greater interface with narrative fiction as a means to bring organisations to life. The paper also introduces the work of Bottin which argues that accounting manuals can be considered as source documents for economic history, more than simply being of purely pedagogical value. Both approaches inform the research into the specialised accounting manual, the Guide du Commerce of Gaignat de l'Aulnais. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses archival-based historical methods to examine the Guide du Commerce and the social and economic milieu presented therein. It has developed its analysis through the examination of both primary and secondary sources to underscore the business and social networks of the milieu and to illustrate accounting as narrative. Findings - In his manual, Gaignat recreates merchant activities and commercial relations of eighteenth century France. Gaignat does not content himself with re-copying material at his disposal or with creating fictitious examples. Rather, through his in-depth development of case studies and examples of actual accounting methods, he offers the reader insights into the strategic nature of the social and economic milieu in which commercial success might be achieved. Practical implications - The research approach is transferable to other settings, motivating renewed interest in the history of accounting literature. The stories related in the Guide du Commerce point to the potential value of accounting manuals and other similar documents as historical sources when such sources no longer exist or are limited. Originality/value - The research method is original in that the methodological approach is new to accounting history, but part of a debate within history more generally.

J	Robotham, D; James, K; Cyhlarova, E				Robotham, Dan; James, Karen; Cyhlarova, Eva			Managing demand and capacity within child and adolescent mental health services: an evaluation of the Choice and Partnership Approach	MENTAL HEALTH REVIEW JOURNAL			English	Article						Demand and capacity; CAMHS; mental health; workload management; CAPA		This study evaluated the implementation of the Choice and Partnership Approach (CAPA), a clinical system designed to improve the management of demand and capacity within child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). The study aimed to investigate how CAPA had been implemented within CAMHS in England, to explore the experiences of staff working within teams who had implemented the system, and to determine the benefits and challenges of implementing CAPA in practice. The evaluation was conducted in three phases: an initial screening survey was sent out to all CAMHS teams in England; a follow-up questionnaire was then sent to all teams implementing CAPA; and interviews and focus groups were then conducted with 62 service managers, clinicians and admin staff within six CAMHS teams who had implemented the system. A total of 213 screening questionnaires were completed, and 97 teams were identified as implementing CAPA; 57 of these teams completed follow-up questionnaires. The results showed that, if well managed and implemented, demand and capacity models such as CAPA appear to provide teams with structured, formal planning mechanisms. However, if implemented poorly and without adequate management, then these models could contribute to confusion and overworking amongst staff. This investigation found the presence of facilitative management to be absolutely crucial for successful implementation of models of demand and capacity.

J	Sands, S; Ferraro, C				Sands, Sean; Ferraro, Carla			Retailers' strategic responses to economic downturn: insights from down under	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Retailing; Recession; Australia; New Zealand; Strategic planning		Purpose - Periods of economic downturn can severely affect the performance of firms in general, and retailers in particular. However, all retailers are not equally affected by recessionary periods, with some viewing this time as an opportunity to invest and establish competitive advantage and others cutting back and waiting for the recession to pass. In the light of the current economic downturn, the purpose of this paper is to investigate retailers' strategic response to the downturn, and assess how these responses differ across different organisations in terms of size, geographic location, and sector of operation. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 50 (25 Australian, 25 New Zealand) managers associated with the retail sector (ranging from chief executive officers to store owners) were invited to participate in face-to-face interviews, resulting in 28 in-depth interviews (15 Australian, 13 New Zealand) across a wide range of retail categories. These exploratory data were combined with a review of the literature to explore retailer responses to the current economic downturn. Findings - This paper suggests that there are growth opportunities for retailers during times of economic downturn. Specifically, this paper suggests that large retailers see this as an opportunity to invest in green and sustainable business practices as a means to aid in the recovery of the recession in terms of reducing costs and beyond in terms of developing competitive advantage. Other strategies include: personalised offerings, differentiation via service, realignment of offer to changing consumer value(s), and reduced costs and investment. Research limitations/implications - The focus of this paper is medium to large sized organisations and, as such, its generalisability to small retailers may be somewhat limited. Originality/value - Past research reveals that not all the retailers are equally affected by recessionary periods. Given this, the value of this paper lies in providing insight into strategic response to an economic downturn, and providing a foundation for examining these strategies and their link to retail performance via quantitative research.

J	Surujlal, J; Singh, C				Surujlal, Jhalukpreya; Singh, Chunderpal			INTERNSHIP AS A MECHANISM FOR PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF SPORT MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN SPORT PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION			English	Article						Internship; Labour; Professional development; Personal development; Marketability; Relevance	COLLEGE INTERNSHIPS; EMPLOYMENT; SKILLS; JOB	The labour market in South Africa (SA) has been characterized by very high and increasing rates of unemployment and an acute shortage of skilled workers. Consequently, finding competent people who will fit in with an organisation's culture, vision and strategic goals has been challenging. As a result, the recruitment drives of many organisations currently focus heavily on attracting skills as well as experience. One of the ways in which the skills shortage and lack of experience could be addressed would be by including an internship in the curricula of different programmes offered at Higher Education Institutions. The current study seeks to articulate from a student's perspective the value of internship in the professional preparation of sport management personnel and attempts to contribute to research in education by providing empirical evidence on the usefulness of internships and make recommendations thereon. A 47-item questionnaire was administered to 300 interns at three universities which offered sport management programmes with internship as a compulsory component. Analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS - version 17). Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the data. A final model consisting of seven factors which accounted for 77.80% of the overall variance in the scale item scores was produced. The factors were professional development (five items), personal development (five items), marketability (thee items), adaptability (thee items), relevance (thee items), opportunity for growth (two items) and networking (two items). The study found internships to be a valuable component in the sport management curriculum. Emanating from the findings several recommendations were made.

J	Valackiene, A				Valackiene, Asta			Efficient Corporate Communication: Decisions in Crisis Management	INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS			English	Article						corporate communication; crisis planning; strategic management; plan of efficient crisis communication	MODEL	Many business leaders agree that almost every company experiences crisis though many of them do not apply any actions to overcome it. Crisis problems are solved not in its primary stage and usually chaotic, without any strategic crisis situation or crisis management plans (Yair, Golenko-Ginzburg, Laslo, 2007; Bivainis, Tuncikiene, 2007; Ciegis, Gineitiene, 2008; Diskiene, Galiniene, Marcinskas, 2008; Kaplinski, 2008; Markovic, 2008). Even more difficult situation appears when company's employees as well as the internal and external environment have to be informed. Therefore it is necessary to represent the organization realistically (Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, 2009; Deep house, 2005), to train the specialists of knowledge management (Melnikas, 2005, 2008; Saee, 2005; Sakalas, Ciutiene, Neverauskas, 2006; Kumpikaite, 2007; Rees, 2008; Boguslauskas, Kvedaraviciene, 2008). The situation does not become easier because of the negative attitude to crises (Klein, 1981; Rosenblatt, Sheaffer, 2002; Anikin, 2008; Virbickaite, 2009). Therefore crisis solution can bring positive consequences in company's change (Gummensson, 1991; Heath, 1994; Sakalas, Savaneviciene 2003; Garskaite, Garskiene, 2005; Adekola, Korsakiene, Tvaronaviciene, 2008; Valackiene, 2009; Startine, Remeikiene, 2009). One of them is efficient communication and conflict management during a crisis period (Varey, White, 2000; Januleviciute, Bieleviciene, Dambrava, 2003; Steyn, 2003; Talef-Viia, Alas, 2009). The efficiency of communication process is confirmed by the worldwide models designed and applied in practice (Turney, 2004; Deephouse, Carter, 2005; Neville, Bell, Menguc, 2005; Luecke, 2007). Worldwide management practice demonstrates the appearance of new management area corporate communication. Global business confederations (European Confederation of PR and CERP) prepare recommendations of public relations in business environment, which are successfully applied in strategic planning, scientific research institutes (Corporate Communication Institute, New Jersey, USA; BNFL Corporate Communication Research Unit, Salford, UK; MBA Corporate Communication Concentration New Jersey, USA; Annenberg Strategic Public Relations Center, USA), where different business researches are done in the area of public relations. Scientific and practical discussions are published in the continual reviewed scientific journals (Theory, Culture, Society, USA; Evolution of Communication, Netherlands; European Journal of Communication, UK; Corporate Communications: An International Journal, UK). Universities in all over the world (Scotland University of Sterning; University of Alabama, USA; Viena Institute for Communications Management and other) prepare professionals according to the Corporate Communication Management program. Communication agencies, crisis management consulting teams, consulting and teaching services successfully work in Lithuania, too, which give wide spectrum of service in public relation area: corporate and marketing communication, strategy creation of crisis communication, government relation, public relation and crisis management problem solving. Corporate Communication is presented as a Strategic Management function, focusing nowadays challenges: the necessity to create confidence between internal and external audience of a company; to activate business forming responsible corporate culture (Goodman, 2006; Luecke, 2007;). In this context efficient Corporate Communication problems still remains relevant in social, economi and managerial aspects. The structure of the paper: center dot in the first part Corporate Communication concept has been based up emphasizing the importance of corporate communication in the management science structure; center dot in the second part the process of crisis planning and strategic management has been discussed; center dot in the third part practical recommendations have been defined- "Plan of Efficient Crisis Communication".

A. D.; UNESCOWorld Heritage List since 1986) is America's greatest pre-Columbian town built in adobe (14 km(2)) and represents the material and immaterial synthesis of 10,000 years of autonomous evolution of the pre-Columbian cultures in northern Peru. From 2001, the Missione Italiana in Peru (MIPE) is operating at Chan Chan carrying on a wide action of documentation, conservation and exploitation. The most important purpose of the work is represented by the restoration of Palacio Rivero, the smallest of the Chan Chan palaces, and by the protection of the site from the aggressive and uncontrolled growth of the near town of Trujillo through the creation of an Archaeological Park. The strategic objective of the work is to integrate all the actions related to the archaeological research, conservation and exploitation of the site with all the actions addressed to the promotion and the social development of its population. The extensive settlement of Chan Chan cannot be analyzed and studied without using great scale images as the high resolution ones from the Quickbird satellite, used for the quantitative measurement of the deterioration and the detailed analysis of the landscape. The image represents the cartographic base of the GIS called "The Archaeological Park of Chan Chan" planned as a means of management and valorization of the Archaeological Complex and of its territory. The final objective of such a system, that is going to be managed in a specific Documentation Centre, is the gradual creation of a multidisciplinary data archive that will allow the various research and conservation actions to be updated. The GIS will help to schedule and implement the improvement procedures, as well as to regulate the various economic activities related to the management of the complex (tourist flow, multimedia products, constraints and integration with the modern city). Finally, the restoration of Palacio Rivero, an example of Chan Chan palaces, represents an operating model allowing the execution and relative application of ICT to all the phases of documentation, research, and restoration. The geometrical survey of the palace was performed using different techniques such as Total Station, GPS, laser scanner, and aerial and ground photogrammetry. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

An Agent-Based Model of Entrepreneurial Behavior in Agri-Food Markets	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE	Rapid technological innovation and globalization have led to increasingly complex agri-food supply chains and networks, and uncertain agri-food markets. Given this type of competitive environment, management scholars have argued that agri-food firms that adopt capabilities for entrepreneurship will outperform firms that do not. We use agent-based simulation methods to explore this hypothesis. Agent-based models are particularly relevant in this study as they allow for the explicit simulation of the entrepreneurial behaviors and firm interactions that lead to wealth creation. In our analysis, we find that entrepreneurial capabilities of alertness, risk-taking, and efficiency vary in their effect on firm performance given alternative agri-food strategic landscape configurations.

Our dependent variable is the degree of change in share price following the announcement of racial/ethnic minority and Caucasian men into senior management positions. Market reaction to the naming of racial/ethnic minorities into corporate leadership positions is significant and negative, while the market's reaction to the naming of Caucasians is significant and positive. However, the negative market reaction to the appointment of racial/ethnic minorities into top management positions is mitigated in those firms that have explicitly incorporated diversity into their strategic growth plan. Our findings suggest that to successfully introduce diversity into upper management, firm decision makers must first signal the importance of diversity to market actors.

Detecting leadership through accuracy of recall	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Interpersonal communication; Internet-based surveys; Network topology; Knowledge networks; Leadership	INFORMANT ACCURACY; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; REPUTATION	We measured interpersonal perception accuracy by focusing on the relationship between actors' centrality and their ability to accurately report their social interactions. We used the network measures of actors' betweenness centrality and degree centrality to identify the most prominent members by correlating ego-perception and alter-perception in a "non-reciprocity" type of misalignment. We found a positive correlation between actors' centrality and their centrality as assessed by senior management, and a negative correlation between actors' centrality and their accuracy in recalling interactions. Under-reporting social interactions may represent a third way of measuring the importance of members and finding the most influential actors. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A qualitative study of the development of respiratory services in the UK	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF MEDICINE			English	Article							GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS; DISEASE; HEALTH; MANAGERS; DOCTORS; VIEWS	Objectives Using frameworks, such as the long-term conditions pyramid of healthcare, primary care organizations (PCOs) in England and Wales are exploring ways of developing services for people with long-term respiratory disease. We aimed to explore the current and planned respiratory services and the roles of people responsible for change. Setting A purposive sample of 30 PCOs in England and Wales. Design Semi-structured telephone interviews with the person responsible for driving the reconfiguration of respiratory services. Recorded interviews were transcribed and coded, and themes identified. The association of the composition of the team driving change with the breadth of services provided was explored using a matrix. Results All but two of the PCOs described clinical services developed to address the needs of people with respiratory conditions, usually with a focus on preventing admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although the majority identified the need to develop a strategic approach to service development and to meet educational needs of primary care professionals, relatively few described clearly developed plans for addressing these issues. Involvement of clinicians from both primary and secondary care was associated with a broad multifaceted approach to service development. Teamwork was often challenging, but could prove rewarding for participants and could result in a fruitful alignment of objectives. The imminent merger of PCOs and overriding financial constraints resulted in a 'fluid' context which challenged successful implementation of plans. Conclusions While the majority of PCOs are developing clinical services for people with complex needs (principally in order to reduce admissions), relatively few are addressing the broader strategic issues and providing for local educational needs. The presence of multidisciplinary teams, which integrated primary and secondary care clinicians with PCO management, was associated with more comprehensive service provision addressing the needs of all respiratory patients. Future research needs to provide insight into the structures, processes and inter-professional relationships that facilitate development of clinical, educational and policy initiatives which aim to enhance local delivery of respiratory care.

Socialist Parties before World War I	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article							CLASS ALLIANCE; ORGANIZATION; LABOR; POLITICS; KNIGHTS; EUROPE	This article builds on social movement theory to explain ideological variation among socialist, social democratic, and labor parties across 18 countries in the early twentieth century. We propose a causal argument connecting (1) the political emergence of the bourgeoisie and its middle-class allies to (2) the political space for labor unions and working-class parties, which (3) provided a setting for internal pressures and external opportunities that shaped socialist party ideology. Combining quantitative analysis and case studies, we find that the timing of civil liberties and the strength of socialist links with labor unions were decisive for reformism or radicalism.

Resource Variation and the Development of Cohesion in Exchange Networks	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article							SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; POWER; COMMITMENT; SATISFACTION; UNCERTAINTY; CENTRALITY; EMERGENCE; TRUST; RISK; TIES	Social exchange theories have identified social structural factors and interaction processes that build cohesion through the everyday exchange of valued resources. However, the types of resources considered in previous research do not reflect the properties of many commonly exchanged resources, namely information, social support, and material goods. In this article, I identify two resource dimensions that underlie and affect exchange: (1) duplicability, that is, whether a resource provider retains control of the resource after exchange and (2) transferability, that is, whether a resource recipient can exchange the resource in another relation. I present a causal model to explain how these dimensions affect cohesion through the mediating effects of structural power exchange frequency. and uncertainty. Notably, resource variation alters the source of structural power, making it necessary to specify when different power mechanisms will operate and their disparate effects on the other mediating factors. A laboratory experiment provides support for the causal model. Resource characteristics fundamentally shape both the exchange process and the outcomes actors experience.

J	Moldoveanu, M				Moldoveanu, Mihnea			THINKING STRATEGICALLY ABOUT THINKING STRATEGICALLY: THE COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF MANAGERIAL PROBLEM SELECTION AND FORMULATION	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						managerial problem solving; strategy formulation; complexity	DECISION-PROCESSES; COMPLEXITY; EQUILIBRIUM; MODEL	A new model of managerial problem formulation is introduced and developed to answer the question: 'What kinds of problems do strategic managers engage in solving and why?' The article proposes that a key decision metric for choosing among alternative problem statements is the computational complexity of the solution algorithm of alternative statements. Managerial problem statements are grouped into two classes on the basis of their computational complexity: P-type problems (canonically easy ones) and NP-type problems (hard ones). The new model of managerial cognitive choice posits that managers prefer to engage with and solve P-type problems over solving NP-type problems. The model explains common patterns of managerial reasoning and decision making, including many documented 'biases' and simplifying heuristics, and points the way to new, effects and novel empirical investigations of problem solving-oriented thinking in strategic management and types of generic strategies, driven by predictions about the kinds of market- and industry-level changes that managers will or will not respond to.

Background In the last decade there has been a growth in nursing support workforce numbers and their scope of practice. An important United Kingdom support worker development is the Assistant Practitioner role. Method A national census was carried out (April 2007) via an emailed questionnaire to Directors of Nursing. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Eighty-five per cent (143/168) of Directors of Nursing, from all 10 English Strategic Health Authorities, responded. Forty-six per cent (n = 66) of Trusts had introduced assistant practitioners and 22% (n = 31) were planning to implement the role before 2009. There is wide variation in assistant practitioner numbers across and between Strategic Health Authorities, Trusts and clinical areas. Resistance to the role existed in 32% (n = 46) of Trusts. Reasons for resistance included no perceived need for the role, lack of evidence of effectiveness, financial constraints and professional and patient safety concerns. Implications for nursing management These findings, which contribute to the international evidence-base on health care support workers roles, provide nurse managers with numbers of assistant practitioners and their deployment. This is useful for Nurse Managers making workforce decisions.

An empirical survey for selecting partners is studied to find out the most appropriate company based on the proposed fuzzy AHP algorithm. To facilitate the main issue for selecting a partner, a hierarchical structure of partner selection for a liner shipping company with seven criteria, thirty-two sub-criteria, and three alternatives was constructed to perform the empirical survey via AHP expert questionnaires. When the operations of fuzzy AHP algorithm are computed, the optimal alternative is selected as the partner for the liner shipping company.

J	Peoples, R				Peoples, Robert			Preparing Today for a Sustainable Future	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						sustainability; career; education; communication; decision making		Business leaders and their academic trainers must embrace the concept of sustainability to prepare future leaders with the understanding and tools necessary to make key decisions based on more than "just the numbers." The economic competitiveness of this country and the survival of our species require a deeper understanding of nature if we are to meet the demands of an expanding population and their expectation for improved quality of life. Competition for finite raw materials and resources will continue to expand despite the momentary speed bumps of the current economic slowdown. A model for enhanced decision making is presented that is based in the simple notion of effective communications. A personal example of strategic decision making translates into lessons learned.

Because of the unavoidable incompleteness of labor contracts, managers with misaligned incentives and budgetary discretion could entrench themselves through their non-value-maximizing adoption decisions. In order to boost their bargaining power in future contract renegotiation, they invest excessively in technologies they manage more effectively than their potential rivals. In addition, they tend to adopt technologies that can create large information asymmetries giving them significant knowledge advantage over their potential rivals ex post. We study the implications and effects of their rent-seeking behavior within the context of organizational IT adoption and management. The efficacies and the limitations of formal incentive contracting are discussed to underscore the need for additional governance mechanisms. While knowledge management may mitigate some of the agency problems associated with entrenchment, managerial self-policing issue remains a challenge. We further explore the incentive provision potential of relational labor contracts in combating entrenchment.

J	Li, Y; Vanhaverbeke, W				Li, Ying; Vanhaverbeke, Wim			THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FOREIGN COMPETITION, ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY AND PIONEERING INNOVATION: AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION IN CANADA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competition; foreign competition; pioneering; innovation; absorptive capacity	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MARKET ORIENTATION; TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; EXPLORATION; DIVERSIFICATION; RELATEDNESS; CREATIVITY; DIVERSITY; SEARCH	The relationship between competition and innovation has drawn great attention from economists and strategic management researchers. However, the empirical evidence for this relationship remains inconsistent. On the one hand, the Schumpeterian viewpoint credits that the large firms with substantial monopoly market power have resources and incentives to innovate. On the other hand, it is also possible for a monopolist to have incentives to suppress subsequent innovations. It is suggested by Baldwin and Scott (1987) and Tang (2006) that the relationship between competition and innovation is dependent on the competition context and specific type of innovation activities. In this study, we investigate the relationship between foreign competition and pioneering innovation and consider the moderating role of absorptive capacity for this relationship, using the Canadian Innovation Data. We find a U-shaped relationship between foreign competition and pioneering innovation: when foreign competition increases from a low to a moderate level, the likelihood of pioneering innovation decreases. However, the likelihood of pioneering innovation increases when foreign competition continues to increase from a moderate to a high level.

Exploring the Dynamics of Value and Fit: Insights From Project Management	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						project management; value of project management; strategic fit; organizational alignment; strategic management	STRATEGIC FIT; PERFORMANCE	The strategic management literature has struggled with how to recognize, measure, and even understand the concept of "fit" between strategy, structure, and environment. Nevertheless, the concept of fit was fundamentally important from the beginning of the Value of Project Management project. In this article, we compare the "fit" construct defined by Miles and Snow (1984) with our concerns with value direction (Thomas 84 Mullaly, 2008). A comparative analysis of these two constructs provides insights into how both dimensions improve overall organizational understanding. We demonstrate that while each of these dimensions independently provides useful information, it is their intersection that provides a means of interpreting not just current realities but appropriate future actions.

J	Moatti, V				Moatti, Valerie			Learning to expand or expanding to learn? The role of imitation and experience in the choice among several expansion modes	EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Mergers and acquisitions; Strategic alliances; Imitation; Experience	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; ENTRY MODE; JOINT-VENTURES; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; JAPANESE INVESTORS; PERFORMANCE; ACQUISITION; DIVERSIFICATION; MERGER; MARKET	This paper examines how firms choose among alternative modes of development in the context of horizontal growth. We suggest that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) as well as alliances formation are influenced by both internal and external factors. More precisely, we investigate the role of imitation and experience as distinct learning mechanisms, both separately and simultaneously. Using isomorphism theoretical background, we show that the choice of expansion mode is highly influenced by competitor moves. We confirmed most of our hypotheses empirically with a sample of 83 firms from the retail industry from 1984 through 2003. Our results also show that imitation mechanism differ whether we consider M&As or alliances. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Agbejule, A; Jokipii, A				Agbejule, Adebayo; Jokipii, Annukka			Strategy, control activities, monitoring and effectiveness	MANAGERIAL AUDITING JOURNAL			English	Article						Internal control; Management effectiveness; Management strategy; Auditing; Finland	MANAGEMENT CONTROL-SYSTEMS; INTERNAL CONTROL; MILES	Purpose - First, this paper aims to provide empirical evidence of the interaction between the components of an internal control system. Second, it seeks to integrate work from the field of strategy and that on the internal control system from the field of auditing. The purpose of this paper is to enable a more profound understanding of how different strategic orientations may influence effectiveness, depending on the components of the internal control system. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through an online questionnaire and analyzed using multiple regression analysis, i.e. a three-way interaction model. The result was a usable sample of the opinions of 741 managers working in Finland. Findings - The results indicate that, for prospector firms, high degrees of internal control activity and low degrees of monitoring ensure a greater effectiveness of the internal control system. On the other hand, for analyzers a high degree of internal control activity and high degrees of monitoring lead to a highly effective internal control system. In addition, our findings indicate no significant differences between defenders and analyzers. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to only two components of the internal control system, namely, internal control activities and monitoring. Future research is needed to examine the interactions of other components of the internal control system. Practical implications - The paper demonstrates the need for managers to be aware of the drivers of the effectiveness of the internal control system and the relationships essential to drive effectiveness, especially when operating in different strategic fields. While all components of an internal control system are vital, this study shows that a good fit between them can lead to improved effectiveness. Originality/value - This is the first empirical study that has used a three-way interaction method to study internal control structures and their effectiveness in an organizational context. Coupled with previous work, it suggests the need for both researchers and practitioners to examine the interactions of an internal control system and how they impact on the effectiveness of that system.

J	Davidson, P; Rowe, J				Davidson, Paul; Rowe, Jillian			Systematising knowledge management in projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Knowledge management; Systems theory; Decision making; Tacit knowledge		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a practicable systems-based approach to knowledge management (KM) in a project environment, to encourage organisations to unlock the value in their review processes. It relies on knowledge capture and storage at decision review points, to enrich individual, team and organisational learning during the project life cycle. The project's phases are typically represented horizontally with deliverables (objectives) or project "promises" as the desirable outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to give expression through introducing a vertical dimension to facilitate the KM process. A model is proposed that conceptualises project-specific knowledge drawing on and feeding into the organisation's knowledge management system (KMS) at tactical and strategic levels. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper links concepts from systems theory with KM, to produce a model to identify, collate, and optimise project-based knowledge and integrate it into the management process. Findings - The application of the system theory approach enriches the knowledge generated by a project, and feeds it into the next phase of that project. At the same time, it contributes to the individual's and project team's KM, specifies possible courses of action, together with risks, costs and benefits and thus it expands the organisation's higher level KMS. Research limitations/implications - The concept suggests that the knowledge capture, storage and sharing process may best be undertaken holistically, in view of the systems relationships between the tasks. Systems theory structures this process. Research opportunities include studying the interfaces between levels of KM, in relation to the project's progress. Practical implications - Reconceptualisation of the project as a knowledge creation process may improve the project's progress as well as add to the individual's, project team's, and wider organisation's knowledge base. An example is given. Originality/value - This paper illuminates the broader potential of under-utilised opportunities in well-known management approaches to add dimension to the business project, of knowledge creation, storage and sharing.

Following Hambrick's (1990) seminal study of strategic management, we similarly examine the management, spirituality, and religion (MSR) field. Using Hambrick's methodology for citation analysis and a dataset of the founding decade of MSR empirical articles, we offer a guide for those doing MSR research. Study outcomes include the 50 most cited MSR works, the 50 most cited journals that MSR scholars use as the foundation of their research, and a theme analysis of the 50 foundational works. Our goals are threefold: to list the seminal works that should inform the framing of future work, to list a variety of possible MSR journal scholarship inspirations and outlets, and to empirically demonstrate current and past MSR research topics so new and experienced MSR scholars can move beyond extant work.

J	Gurkov, I				Gurkov, Igor			Strategy process as formulation and realization of corporate goals: The synthesis of surveys in Russian firms	JOURNAL FOR EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						corporate strategies; strategic goals; Russian enterprises	CAPABILITIES; COMPANIES	Based on a series of corporate surveys, the paper reveals the peculiarities Of strategy processes in Russian companies. The data suggests that the fragile balance of power between the top management and the dominant owners leads to establishing of sets of hardly combined goals. The necessary partial implementation of such sets leads to low confidence in the actions to be undertaken, low persistence in realization of business projects, permanent readiness to withdraw resources from the existing projects for their redirection into non - core assets.				gurkov@list.ru	Gurkov, Igor/H-1501-2015	Gurkov, Igor/0000-0001-8116-0425			Adner R, 2003, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V24, P1011, DOI 10.1002/smj.331; BARRINGTON L, 2006, CEO CHALLENGE 2006 T; BARRY D, 1987, THESIS U MARYLAND; BEGGS J, 1989, MID ATLANTIC J BUSIN, V25, P35; BEGGS JM, 1989, J BUS ETHICS, V8, P471, DOI 10.1007/BF00381813; BIRCH DJ, 2001, MCKINSEY Q, V4, P102; BUDDE A, 1982, CORPORATE GOALS MANA, V1, P1; Chakravarthy B.

Knowledge management implementation: modelling the variables	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING			English	Article						driving power; dependence power; interpretive structural modelling; ISM; innovation; knowledge management implementation; knowledge management variables; KMVs; learning		The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to Knowledge Management (KM) implementation in organisations by understanding the dynamics between the various Knowledge Management Variables (KMVs). Using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), the research presents a hierarchy-based model and the mutual relationships among the KMVs. The research shows that there is a group of KMVs that have a high driving power and low dependence power that require maximum attention and are of strategic importance, while another group consists of those KMVs which have a high dependence power and low driving power. A key finding of this research is that leadership is the main driver for KM implementation.	[Kant, R.; Singh, M.

Nowhere is this truer than in the Canadian wood products industry; where sales to its most important market, the USA, have recently been dwindling. The paper seeks to present how RV was adapted in this research context and extended over elements of scope, range of potential applications, scale of measurement, and computational techniques. Design/methodology/approach - A multiple-case study was undertaken and consisted of the evaluation of 58 customer relationships for three wood products manufacturers. Findings - Findings highlight the necessary distinction between "value for" and "value of" customers when measuring relationship value from a supply perspective. Based on the value and orientation of exchange, a new segmentation of customer relationships emerges which differentiates. "questionable", "supportive", "promising", and "strategic" relationships. Originality/value - The case study will serve in the development of value-driven relationship management approaches, which are likely to become a major source of competitive advantage, not only in the wood products industry, but in business in general.

J	Liao, Y; Liao, K; Hutchinson, R				Liao, Ying; Liao, Kun; Hutchinson, Robert			A conceptual framework for prototyping outsourcing in new product development A knowledge-based view	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prototypes; Outsourcing; Decision making; Suppliers; Communication	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; MODEL; FIRM; DECISIONS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework for prototyping outsourcing. Design/methodology/approach - This study provides an up-to-date literature review and an in-depth case study. Findings - This study identifies three factors (i.e. the degree of the prototyping to core competence, prototyping complexity, and supplier's capability of providing knowledge and speed for prototyping) and three types of risks (i.e. losing control over suppliers, dependency on suppliers, and supplier's lack of capabilities) for prototyping outsourcing decisions. Practical implications - This paper provides guidelines for new product development managers in order to mitigate the risks associated with outsourcing and achieve effective prototyping. Originality/value - This study provides a strategic outsourcing framework for prototyping.

J	Maringe, F; Foskett, N; Roberts, D				Maringe, Felix; Foskett, Nick; Roberts, Dave			"I can survive on jam sandwiches for the next three years" The impact of the new fees regime on students' attitudes to HE and debt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Higher education; Students; Financing; Debts; Loans; United Kingdom		Purpose - The aim of this research is to draw from a project sponsored by the Higher Education Academy and undertaken jointly by researchers at the University of Southampton and The Knowledge Partnership UK, which aimed to investigate the likely impact of the recently introduced new fees regime on students' attitudes to HE and to issues of debt. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a sample of 64 students approaching the end of their A level study in four Further Education Colleges in the South and North of England, the research utilised focus group interviews to seek views about the new fees regime which were to be introduced in September 2006 throughout the country. Findings - The research found that, while the issue of debt was a significant concern for many students, the desire to go to university either immediately or in the long term, remained a strong priority for the students. Different types of debt aversion, including risk debt aversion, sticker type debt aversion, value-based debt aversion and life-style debt aversion, were evident from the students' discourses. Originality/value - Overall, sufficient evidence was not found to support the general belief that issues of student debt would significantly dissuade students from participating in HE. Rather, it was found that students were more likely to be rational in their decisions, as long as the increased fees would add value to their HE experience. Significantly, the research discovers a new form of debt aversion among the participants. HE institutions need to be aware of the variety of forms of debt aversion in order to plan for more strategic recruitment in a new fees and debt economy.

Specifically, detection of fundamental right violations during territorial planning is in focus, because not only third parties but also future tenants of the house being constructed suffer loss of healthy and harmonious work and recreational environment as a direct result of such violations. A classifier of fundamental right violations during territorial planning was developed for that purpose.

J	Noor, MNM; Pitt, M				Noor, Mohd; Pitt, Michael			The application of supply chain management and collaborative innovation in the delivery of facilities management services	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Facilities; Supply chain management; Service delivery		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to define supply chain management (SCM) in facilities management (FM) and in generic business context, and extensively review critical elements to ensure the success of SCM and collaborative innovation in FM as a service delivery system. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs comprehensive literature reviews from a number of publications retrieved from electronic databases, journals and books. Findings - SCM helps organisations to execute strategic purchasing for sustainable market position in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. Facilities will be effectively managed by adopting strategic alliances in SCM with FM suppliers through faster service delivery, increase in service efficiency and cost savings. Research limitations/implications - Limited literature available on SCM in FM prevents comprehensive results, underlining further discussions on the critical aspects that can be adopted to ensure success in SCM in the context of FM service delivery. Practical implications - This paper provides an in-depth analysis of SCM and the significance of adopting critical elements within SCM to ensure the success of a business in an environment that is constantly changing due to various expected or unexpected factors. Originality/value - This paper presents literature updates on the needs of SCM in ensuring an organisation's sustainability, and in creating effective business collaborations to obtain profits through a common objective in FM.

J	Sharma, NL; Goswami, S				Sharma, N. L.; Goswami, Susobhan			The nuances of knowledge creation and development in Indian pharmaceutical industry	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge processes; Knowledge management; Pharmaceuticals industry; Research and development; Brand identity; India	ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE; CAPABILITIES; FIRM	Purpose - Based on strategic management approaches, this paper aims to develop a systemic and dynamic model of knowledge creation. The boundaries of the environment are changing in terms of contract research, in-licensing, out-licensing where strategic intent also changes and gets redefined. Design/methodology/approach - This is an exploratory study using available theories and evidences of companies fanning in different directions in the form of novel types of alliances. Suitable propositions are developed for further study. Findings - The study concludes that organisations will have to reach for tacit knowledge and enhance the knowledge stock by constantly absorbing and assimilating new ideas and research findings. Research limitations/implications - More study in depth and across a variety of companies is required to validate the findings particularly comparing the research and development (R&D) paths of organisations located in multiple countries. Not merely big firms, even small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can be the subject of further study. Originality/value - Previous studies concentrated on conservation, accumulation and recycling of knowledge without considering the absorption capacity of firms. This study takes for its heart the absorptive capacity as the ingredient of dynamic learning opportunities. Both for micro and macro initiatives, a joint interaction is necessary for knowledge to germinate and grow Organisational learning is also a part of this process. Intellectual property in specialised research fields therefore must be created and defended.

J	Sheehan, NT; Foss, NJ				Sheehan, Norman T.; Foss, Nicolai J.			Exploring the roots of Porter's activity-based view	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Value chain; Strategic management; Activity based management	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; ECONOMICS; STRATEGY; FIRM	Purpose - Porter's activity-based view of the firm is a comprehensive strategic framework which analyzes firm-level competitive advantage. Although Porter's activity-based view is widely cited by academics, taught to students, and applied by practitioners, little is known about its intellectual roots. Given that a framework's intellectual antecedents not only determine its current content, but also its future development, this paper aims to examine the intellectual roots of Porter's activity-based view and the value chain. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines Porter's writings in an effort to document his influences while developing the activity-based view and value chain. Porter's and other scholars' explanations are found to be lacking, so the paper ventures further down paths first suggested by Porter and others. Findings - Whereas Porter's five forces framework built on the existing industrial organization paradigm, the activity-based view is not derived from any existing paradigms. While consultants of the 1970s impacted Porter's development of the value chain and the activity-based view, its deeper roots lay in operations research, particularly activity analysis; and the work of Arch Shaw, who was the first to teach a business policy course at Harvard Business School. Porter's contribution is to bring the diverse threads together into a coherent whole which managers can apply to analyze and improve their competitive positions. Practical implications - Following Porter, the authors argue that activities are a key link between resource holdings and strategic positions. Therefore, it is only when the activity-based and resource-based views are integrated that they provide a comprehensive explanation of firm value creation. Originality/value - The paper is the first to critically examine the intellectual antecedents of the activity-based view.

J	Woodside, AG; Sakai, M				Woodside, Arch G.; Sakai, Marcia			ANALYZING PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORTS OF DESTINATION MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS' ACTIONS AND OUTCOMES	JOURNAL OF TRAVEL & TOURISM MARKETING			English	Article						Destination management organization; tourism marketing; audit; evaluation	SENSEMAKING	The present article includes a case study that describes and analyzes three performance audit reports over a 3-decade period for one U.S. State government's destination management organization's (DMO) actions and outcomes. This report extends prior studies (Woodside & Sakai 2001, 2003) that support two conclusions: (a) the available independent performance audits of DMOs' actions and outcomes indicate that frequently DMOs perform poorly and fail to meaningfully assess the impacts of their own actions, and (b) the audits themselves are shallow and often fail to provide information on DMOs' actions and outcomes relating to these organizations largest marketing expenditures. The article calls for embracing a strategy shift in designing program evaluations both by government departments responsible for managing destinations' tourism marketing programs and by all government auditing agencies in conducting future management performance audits. The article offers a "tourism performance audit template'' as a tool for both strategic planning by destination management organizations and for evaluating DMOs' planning and implementing strategies.

J	Zou, MM; Lansbury, RD				Zou, Mimi; Lansbury, Russell D.			Multinational corporations and employment relations in the People's Republic of China: the case of Beijing Hyundai Motor Company	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Beijing; China; Chinese employment relations; cross-border transfer of policies; Hyundai; Korean autos; multinational corporations; South Korea	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; HRM PRACTICES	This contribution examines the transfer of employment relations policies and practices from the domestic operations of the Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) in Ulsan, Korea to its joint venture in China, the Beijing Hyundai Motors Company (BHMC). An integrated 'political economy' theoretical framework is used to analyse the complex interaction of institutional, strategic and micro-political forces that have shaped the hybrid model of employment relations at BHMC. The study shows that the transfer of policies and practices from Ulsan to Beijing has been influenced not only by institutional differences between the home and host countries and the strategies pursued by HMC management, but also by the political contests between various actors within and outside BHMC. Our research findings show that HMC headquarters has sought to maintain control over employment relations at BHMC through the transfer of its core policies and practices from its Korean operations to BHMC. However, a hybrid model has emerged at BHMC with some notable differences to HMC's Ulsan plant. Utilising an integrated political economy perspective, this contribution has shown that BHMC's employment relations policies and practices have been shaped and conditioned by a complex interplay of institutional and market forces, strategic choices and ongoing political contests between various actors within and beyond BHMC.

The empirical evidence is based on interviews with members of the research unit as well as responses from a research environment survey. The findings of the case study suggest specific strategies that are conducive not only for the co-location of research units but also for research management in general. Principal among these are the need to balance increases in diversity and complexity with mechanisms of integration and the use of specific management practices and leadership qualities that support these activities.

Study 1 verified this relationship in the field, and Study 2 replicated the field findings in a lab setting. Study 2 also confirmed trust as a mediator and risk as a moderator of this relationship, showing that trust and greater compliance are produced by the presence of a logo in high-risk but not in low-risk situations. Study 3 confirmed the moderating effects of risk on these findings in a field setting. Study 4 then used a lab set-up to confirm generalization of the findings to different logos. The findings hold important implications for research and management of symbols, trust, and compliance in organizations and for organization theory on initial trust and compliance.

SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERSHIP FOR THREE-ECHELON DETERIORATING INVENTORY MODEL	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Inventory; Three-echelon; Deteriorating item; Integration	DELIVERY SCHEDULING PROBLEM; LOT-SIZE MODEL; ECONOMIC-LOT; REPLENISHMENT POLICY; VENDOR; SYSTEM; COORDINATION; PURCHASER; DESIGN	The different facilities in a supply chain usually develop their partnership through information sharing and strategic alliances to achieve the overall benefit of the system. In this study, we propose a supply chain network system with two producers, a single distributor and two retailers. Each retailer has a deterministic demand rate. A mathematical model of deteriorating item is developed to consider a vertical integration of the producer, the distributor and the retailer and a horizontal integration of the producers. We show how the integrated approach to decision making can achieve global optimum. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are given to validate the proposed system.	[Yu, Jonas C.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Cognitive approach; Rivalry; Strategic groups	MOBILITY BARRIERS; MENTAL MODELS; INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE; MANAGERIAL; FIRM; CATEGORIZATION; DETERMINANTS; ISOMORPHISM; COGNITION	Strategic group literature has generated a significant amount of research over recent decades. However, the rivalry implications of strategic group have remained unclear. This paper analyses rivalry and strategic groups in the house building industry in a small town from a cognitive approach. We consider rivalry as a subjective and directional phenomenon. Estimating rivalry as the direct identification of competitors we try to explain whether similarity affects rivalry and what factors make a company a "rival''. Results show that perceived rivalry is strongly related to size, past performance, subjective similarity and strategic group structure.

Applying the related notions of complementarity and performance landscape to study strategic positioning in the footwear industry, we showthat, though grounded on product innovation (the originalGeox breathes r patented system which allows ventilation in waterproof rubber sole), Geox's competitive advantage has not grown out of operational excellence in single activities in the business, but, rather, derives from a unique and consistent configuration of complementary activities. Such configuration represents an innovative strategic position and corresponds to a peak in the footwear industry performance landscape. The case study offers anecdotal evidence in support of complementarity based economic theory. It confirms that, in the presence of complementarities, rivals find strategy imitation and reverse engineering difficult due to the unique nature of the relationships among complementary variables.

J	Singer, M; Donoso, P				Singer, Marcos; Donoso, Patricio			Upstream or downstream in the value chain?	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						strategic planning and management; production and inventory systems; optimization modeling	PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; MARKETS	Companies in the natural resources industry (e.g., mining, timber, farming and fishery) face the dilemma of whether to focus upstream or downstream in the value chain. The literature provides arguments and empirical evidence for either position. This paper presents an analytical framework based on the neoclassical theory of the firm, for which the best competitive advantage is the one that maximizes production efficiency. It serves to formulate an optimization model for the sawmill industry, and draws the data from the largest sawmilling company in the southern hemisphere. Although one conclusion is that the company should concentrate on the upstream activities, such conclusion is not applicable to other firms, since the analysis of the upstream-downstream dilemma must focus on the individual capabilities of each firm.

In the face of greater environmental uncertainty, global competition, and technological change, it is imperative that multinational lodging firms develop strategies for protecting their domestic franchises and expanding internationally. The findings reveal shifts in current business models, strategies for changing brand architecture, searches for profitable new markets, commoditization and differentiation of the product, and development of customer-centered functional strategies. Implications of these strategic changes for the lodging industry are discussed.

J	Brandl, J; Mayrhofer, W; Reichel, A				Brandl, J.; Mayrhofer, W.; Reichel, A.			The influence of social policy practices and gender egalitarianism on strategic integration of female HR directors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						gender; gender egalitarianism; human resource management; social policy; strategic integration; women	HUMAN-RESOURCE FUNCTION; SEX SEGREGATION; OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION; CHANGING-ROLE; WOMEN; MANAGEMENT; EMPLOYMENT; ORGANIZATIONS; AUTHORITY	The integration of the HR director into the strategic planning process is important if the HR function is to play a strategic role. A considerable number of women hold HR director positions with varying strategic integration across countries. This article deals with the impact of societal factors on the strategic integration of female HR directors. It analyses the consequences of social policy practices facilitating women's participation in work for the strategic integration of female HR directors and additional effects resulting from the interplay between these practices and gender-egalitarian attitudes at the societal level. A study of 984 companies with female HR directors in 16 countries shows that while enabling social policy practices are positively associated with strategic integration of female HR directors, related gender-egalitarian attitudes do not have a supporting effect.

J	Cantista, I; Tylecote, A				Cantista, Isabel; Tylecote, Andrew			Industrial innovation, corporate governance and supplier-customer relationships	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Corporate governance; Customer relations; Supply chain management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the linkage among three factors - shareholder-manager relationships (or corporate governance), customer supplier relationships, and innovation, for two groups of UK firms in the speciality chemicals and electrical equipment industries. Design/methodology/approach - This research was exploratory. In total, 12 companies were studied in depth. The level of innovation was measured through a questionnaire and interviews were carried out with managers, important customers and suppliers. A comparison of management practices was established between the more and the less innovative companies. Findings - This research finds a close connection between shareholder-manager relationships, customer and supplier relationship management and innovation. The firms subject to arms-length relationships with shareholders (as UK-based public limited companies) had more distant relationships with suppliers and customers and poorer innovative performance. Research limitations/implications - The validity and reliability of the conclusions require the undertaking of quantitative studies. Other aspects apart from those explored could affect the level of innovation of companies. Practical implications - In the more innovative companies, strategic and investment plans tend to look to the long-term (five years plus). And, customers and suppliers are involved from the beginning in the development of new products and production processes. Lack of shareholder engagement strongly inhibits "long-termist actions", which include the development of such close relationships with customers and suppliers. Originality/value - This paper is the first to look at the possible link between corporate governance, customer and supplier relationship management and the level of innovation and has research and practical implications.

J	Clarke, AH; Freytag, PV				Clarke, Ann H.; Freytag, Per V.			An intra- and inter-organisational perspective on industrial segmentation A segmentation classification framework	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						Market segmentation; Classification	MARKET-SEGMENTATION; BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS; VALUE-CREATION; DIFFERENTIATION; STRATEGIES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce and discuss a contextual framework, which is based on different purposes of segmentation. A matrix is proposed for segmentation that distinguishes between strategic and operational levels and the degree to which new value is created. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual discussion aims at contributing to development of the discussion of segmentation purpose. Findings - Several models have emerged in the segmentation literature, but the purposes of many segmentation models are not explicitly addressed. However, the purpose of a model affects the segmentation process and has ramifications to the subsequent implementation. This paper links segmentation to the purpose of segmenting and discusses the degree to which previous choices have impact on a firm's possibility to select and implement new segments. Research limitations/implications - This paper contributes to a more extensive discussion on segmentation. It adds to the discussion on segmentation purpose and implementation problems. Originality/value - The proposed matrix sheds new light on the importance of having a clear purpose with a model. Furthermore, it is shown that different purposes may have different ramifications to the firm and be more or less simple to implement, depending on the degree to which changes in the firms' activities, actors and resources are needed. Likewise, changes in established relationships have to be implemented or new ones created.

This new structure consists of a pair of central egos and their direct links with alters, instead of just one central ego as in the egocentered networks or multiple egos as in complete networks. The key point in this kind of network is that ties exist between the central pair of egos and between them and all alters, but the ties among alters are not considered. Duocentered networks can also be considered as a compromise between egocentered and complete networks. Complete network measurements are often costly to obtain and tend to contain a large proportion of missing data (especially for peripheral actors). Egocentered network data are less costly but a lot of information is lost with their use when a pair of individuals is the relevant unit of analysis. From the definition of duocentered networks, we develop new social network measures, some of which based on the measures for complete networks such as degree, closeness centrality or density, both absolute and relative, while others are tailored to dealing with specific characteristics of the duocentered network structures. The proposed measures are used in the analysis of the networks of Slovenian PhD students and their supervisors. We specify three regression models to predict PhD student's academic performance on the basis of these duocentered network measures for different relations such as advice, collaboration, emotional support, and trust. The results show that absolute duocentered measures predict performance best. When compared with egocentered network measures a higher predictive power of duocentered networks is revealed.

The strategic management of operations system performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations strategy; performance measurement; strategic management		The enterprises' operations systems environments, characterised by their complexity and dynamics, are challenging the strategic management models. This paper presents the development of a theoretical framework, organised as a set of design recommendations to guide the performance measurement system capabilities development. The developed theoretical construction is based on the literature review. A framework is constructed to represent the relationships between roles, capabilities and design recommendations of a performance measurement system. The measurement system is studied in the context of an Operations Strategic Management System (OSMS) and three different levels of analysis are used to organise the findings of this study. The results are presented in tables that identify the main roles that the measurement system should perform; establish the relationships between roles and required capabilities and generate a list of design recommendations. Based on the mediating function of the required organisational capabilities, the causal links are identified and the framework is generated.

Developing and Aligning a Knowledge Management Strategy: Towards a Taxonomy and a Framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						knowledge integration; knowledge management; knowledge process; information in organizations; IS success model; strategic information		Knowledge capitalization has become a major economic driver in business today and has created enormous requirements for organizations as they reconsider their goals and adapt their business strategies. However, the definition of knowledge management in an organizational context is a difficult task to realize (Spiegler, 2000). Although knowledge is a critical resource, it is generally poorly managed (Earl, 2001). Good knowledge management can help with achieving business goals, as it requires an alignment of KMS and BS. Researchers in KM suggest a taxonomy to better define the field (Earl, 1983; Galliers, 1987; Hansen et al, 1999; Maier, 2001; Yu et al, 2004). This paper provides a KMS and BS alignment framework and taxonomy with concepts, links (contextual links among concepts), actors, actions and processes for effective knowledge management through alignment and interaction in an organization.

Design/methodology/approach - Inductive case study (of a large American convention hotel), highlighting the strategic crafting of a service-firm culture, both descriptively (in terms of what took place) and analytically (in terms of various OB-literatures). Findings - Describes how organizational culture can be part of strategizing in terms of aligning cultural expressions regarding various employees' practices, including continuous organizational improvement. Analyzes and integrates various extant culture insights on service cultures and culture strength. Research limitations/implications - Insights are applicable to a wide variety of work settings beyond the hospitality and service sectors; it expands the view of organizational culture to the broader and more complex, strategic issue of how organizations can craft or amend cultures that fit their missions. Practical implications - One may learn from this case (including the authors' reflections), how to put a well-articulated service mission into operational practice: through taking a particular, desired culture quite seriously when creating employee experiences, so that they are effectively focused on that mission. Originality/value - The paper illustrates specific tactics for implementing culture plus the value of developing a strategic approach to creating a particular culture. It offers a template of crafting a culture, based on the strategic pairing of managerial mission with action (or employee and client experiences). Strategizing with culture, also referred to as firm-cultural content shaping, is meant for researchers and practitioners seeking to help develop a mission-focused organizational culture.

J	Hsu, JL; Chang, KM				Hsu, Jane Lu; Chang, Kai-Ming			Purchase of clothing and its linkage to family communication and lifestyles among young adults	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication processes; Family; Lifestyles; Clothing and accessories; Fashion		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how family communication patterns and lifestyles are linked to purchases of sports shoes and casual clothing for young adults. Design/methodology/approach - The survey was conducted in 2005, and total valid samples were 576. Differences in purchasing decisions among various segments of young adults are analysed for two product categories: sports shoes and casual clothing. Findings - This study segments the respondents into two clusters, pragmatic and fashion-cognisant. The family communication patterns for respondents in the pragmatic cluster are more likely to be low concept-oriented, Protective and Laissez-faire. The respondents in the pragmatic cluster purchase sports shoes and casual clothing less frequently, and pay less attention to marketing-related information. The fashion-cognisant respondents pay special attention to the marketing-related information and brands can be influential in decisions. These fashion-cognisant young adults are considered to be opinion leaders, and purchase sports shoes and casual clothing more frequently with higher budgets. The family communication patterns of respondents in this cluster are high concept-oriented: Pluralistic and Consensual. Practical implications - Strategic marketing designed to attract pragmatic young adults can follow two directions: atmosphere in stores and discounts. For young adults who are fashion-cognisant, directions of strategic marketing are to strengthen the brand image and utilise advertising to disseminate information. Originality/value - This study provides new insights into the area that has not been studied exclusively, the linkages of family communication patterns and lifestyles to purchases of sports shoes and casual clothing.

J	Kantabutra, S				Kantabutra, Sooksan			Vision effects in Thai retail stores: practical implications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Transformational leadership; Leadership; Strategic alignment; Retailing; Thailand	CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP; WORK; SATISFACTION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between vision attributes and content, and customer and staff satisfaction in Thai retail stores, taking into account vision realization factors of vision communication, organizational alignment, motivation of staff and empowerment of staff. Design/methodology/approach - Variables of vision attributes and content, vision communication, organizational alignment, motivation of staff and empowerment of staff were derived from the literature. Data were from store managers, staff and customers of 126 apparel stores in Bangkok. These variables were tested for significant relationships through regression analyses. Findings - Vision attributes is an indirect predictor of improved staff and customer satisfaction. Visions containing images about leadership were positively correlated with customer satisfaction. Motivation of staff is the only direct predictor of enhanced staff satisfaction, while vision, empowerment of staff, organizational alignment, and vision communication are four indirect predictors of improved staff satisfaction. On the other hand, vision, vision communication, empowerment of staff, motivation of staff, and staff satisfaction are five indirect predictors of enhanced customer satisfaction. Practical implications - Retail store managers should develop a store vision characterized by the vision attributes and containing reference to market leadership. They should communicate their vision, align organizational components with the vision and empower and motivate staff according to the vision. Originality/value - While vision is core to vision-based leadership theories, little is known about what characterizes an effective vision. This study explains this unknown.

J	Lee, S; Kang, S; Park, E; Park, Y				Lee, Sungjoo; Kang, Sungryong; Park, Euisuk; Park, Yongtae			Applying technology road-maps in project selection and planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project planning; South Korea		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that existing project portfolio management methods have failed to take firms' long-term strategies into account. To overcome this limitation, it is proposed to suggest technology road-maps (TRMs) as a tool to assist with project selection and planning. Design/methodology/approach - Based on bibliographic and qualitative analysis, the paper develops a systematic process of building TRMs for project portfolio management. The proposed process was applied to the project selection and planning process of a Korean government R&D program. Findings - The paper finds that the suggested process can support strategic planning by assuring that an organization is implementing the right projects at the right time. During this process, the selection of experts, the flexibility of the process, the periodical updating of the TRM, and TRM standardization are regarded as critical issues for high-quality technology road- mapping. Research limitations/implications - The approach in the paper does not deal with the cost and profitability aspects of a project as part of its evaluation, nor does it consider complex relations between technologies in different projects. Practical implications - The findings in the paper are expected to be helpful in establishing R&D strategy and setting priorities among projects, and in fostering coordination in project implementation. Originality/value - This paper is one of the earliest attempts to systemize TRM methods specifically for project portfolio management, and is expected to make it easier for companies to adopt and apply TRMs effectively.

J	Rao, PM				Rao, P. M.			The emergence of the pharmaceutical industry in the developing world and its implications for multinational enterprise strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND HEALTHCARE MARKETING			English	Article						Developing countries; Pharmaceuticals industry; Multinational companies; Patents; Intellectual property; India		Purpose - The purpose of this paper, focusing mainly on India - and a lesser extent on China - is to examine, broadly, two related issues concerning the rise of pharmaceutical industry in the emerging economies: the strategic response of the emerging-country pharmaceutical firms to the new patent regime that recognizes and enforces product patents; and its implications for multinational enterprise (MNE) strategies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on extensive review of the relevant conceptual and empirical literature and secondary data. Findings - The strategic response of pharmaceutical firms in the emerging economies (India and China, for example,) to the new patent regime is to develop multiple competencies and position themselves to simultaneously compete and collaborate globally with the MNEs - large firms rapidly moving towards discovery and development of new drugs, and medium and small firms engaged in the production of off-patent generics and contract manufacturing, respectively. Practical implications - The trend towards greater collaboration between the emerging-country firms and the MNEs in the new patent regime raises serious concern about prescription drug prices in the developing as well as developed countries. Given the importance of the pharma industry to the health of nations, firms in rich and poor countries alike will continue to come under public pressure to develop and market the needed drugs at affordable prices. Originality/value - The paper would be of value to practitioners and scholars interested in the implications - for MNE pricing, outsourcing and R&D strategies, for example - of the rapid rise of pharmaceutical industry in the developing countries such as India and China.

J	Todorovic, ZW; Ma, J				Todorovic, Zelimir William; Ma, Jun			Entrepreneurial and market orientation relationship to performance The multicultural perspective	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY			English	Article						Entrepreneurship; Culture; Organizational performance	CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; RESOURCE; CULTURE; FIRMS; CAPABILITIES; ENVIRONMENT; CONSTRUCT; NETWORKS; LINKING	Purpose - First, this paper aims to examine the role culture plays on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and market orientation (MO) and its consequent impact on firm organizational performance. Second, the nature of the EO-MO correlation itself and its effect on organizational performance is considered. Design/methodology/approach - Reviews of literature in EO and MO serve as a foundation of the development of conceptual arguments. Utilizing Hofstede's data, five countries with the lowest GDP and five countries with the highest GDP were plotted on a two dimensional plot to validate the findings. Findings - Entrepreneurial organizations in collectivist societies face lean resource environments. The effectiveness of strategic orientations (EO or MO) should not be assumed to be uniform. Research limitations/implications - This paper does not include empirical validation of the argument. Further empirical research should be done in different cultural contexts. Practical implications - There has been relatively little research that examines the relationship between strategic orientations, such as EO and MO, and their antecedents and consequences on organizational performance in different cultural contexts. This paper represents an attempt to do so from multicultural perspectives. Originality/value - This paper informs entrepreneurs of how their EO, MO, and their firms' performance are influenced by one cultural dimension: individualism/collectivism.

J	Wills-Johnson, N				Wills-Johnson, Nick			The networked firm: a framework for RBV	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Resources; Social interaction; Capital		Purpose - This paper aims to examine a potential approach to introduce a topology to the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm to address the issue of the formation of intangible assets and predictions of the growth of the firm by RBV, both issues that have been identified in the literature as shortcomings of the RBV approach. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a conceptual paper. It provides a brief review of and introduces concepts from the social networks literature, suggesting ways in which viewing the firm as a connected network of resources might usefully augment RBV theory. Findings - Viewing the firm as a network is a potentially powerful tool for analysing the notion of intangible assets in the RBV and for providing a theory of the growth of the firm. Originality/value - The paper provides a useful framework for further work in the RBV field to assist in understanding what makes assets strategic and how firms grow through the accumulation of strategic assets, and highlights possibilities for cross-fertilisation between the social networks and RBV literature.

Advances and Challenges in Strategic Management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						Strategic management; Social values; Forecasting; Externalities; Decision making; Search; Informal economy; Global environment, climate, sustainability	NATURAL-ENVIRONMENT; STAKEHOLDER THEORY; BUSINESS; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; INDUSTRY; GREEN; MODEL; DETERMINANTS; MULTILEVEL	The field of business policy/strategic management has offered a variety of frameworks and concepts during the last half century, many aimed at "taking business and its management seriously." Research conferences and resulting books and journals have provided intellectual momentum, augmented by stimulation from challenges to "conventional wisdom" experienced in the global market. Almost two decades ago, a committee of faculty from several universities critically evaluated the state of doctoral education for strategic management (Summer et al., 1990). They made a number of suggestions to improve strategic management education and research, upon which this special issue of the International Journal of Business seeks to build. The committee chaired by Charles Summer developed a series of recommendations for research on organizations as such. Among these were extended longitudinal studies of organizations, statistical analysis of organizational behavior and performance, and the refinement of organizational performance indices. Many of the authors cited here heeded the committee's suggestions but found it necessary to expand on them due to evolving realities of "transitional economies," advancing technologies, and environmental considerations. These factors have created new research and entrepreneurial challenges in the field of strategic management. Scholars are confronted by issues such as government supported firms, social and economic effects of climate change, nanotechnology, internet-based piracy, shifting societal values and disruption of business by terrorism. Associated with changing problems of commerce is a need to develop more comprehensive and realistic measures of organizational performance. While some researchers have made progress in measuring risk-adjusted "real" returns to shareholders, others are focused on returns to a variety of stakeholders and are developing broader performance criteria. For example, some firms are progressing toward reducing their " ecological footprints," and others have an aim of becoming "carbon neutral." They are attempting to satisfy stakeholders who wish to minimize an "intergenerational conflict" if the current generation of adults were to leave their children a " greenhouse gas legacy" that would be very costly to remedy (Grant, 2006; Holdren, 2006; Stead and Stead, 2004). As consequences of corporate activity for the broader society become increasingly understood, researchers are quantifying key constructs and analyzing them in ways which take us closer to valid measures of comprehensive strategic performance. This article provides information for those seeking to improve strategic performance while accounting for impacts upon multiple levels and sectors of society.

J	Cheng, YH; Yeh, CY				Cheng, Yung-Hsiang; Yeh, Chian-Yu			Core competencies and sustainable competitive advantage in air-cargo forwarding: Evidence from Taiwan	TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL			English	Article							RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; CAPABILITIES; FRAMEWORK; SERVICES; STRATEGY	This study aims to identify the core competencies of the air-cargo forwarding industry and to investigate the relationship between core competencies and sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). This study therefore adopts the resource-based view of the firm to examine the cause-and-effect relationships of internal dimensions such as resources, capabilities, and logistics services on SCA in the air-cargo forwarding industry. In addition, several external factors affecting SCA were examined. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis between the survey data and theoretical framework. Results indicate that resources, capabilities, and logistics services all positively influence SCA. Capabilities are considered to be the most essential internal dimension influencing the SCA of air-cargo forwarders. In terms of the capabilities dimension, staff capability to provide better customer service was the critical factor. In addition, strategy alliances are regarded as the essential source of external assistance in achieving SCA. The results of this study will be useful for conducting future strategic planning of air-cargo forwarding.

J	Helm, C				Helm, Clive			From tech-led to brand-led-has the internet portal business grown up?	JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-business; e-branding; internet portals; product life cycle		The internet is a young industry. Although its origins go back to the 1960s, commercial and consumer use of the worldwide-web really began only in the mid-1990s, little more than a decade ago. Even in this short time, however, a number of online businesses have grown to become major global brands in their own right. In leading brand consultancy Interbrand's 'Top One Hundred Global Brands for 2005', for example, net brands Google, Yahoo! and Amazon.com were ranked at numbers 38, 58 and 68 with values of US $8.5bn, 5.3bn and 4.2bn, respectively. Historically, it is probably fair to say that the net industry has been technology led-some of the most successful brands, notably Google, were famously started by young engineers or 'techies'. But does the emergence of major brands in this sector mean that online business is going through a transformation, moving from the tumultuous, technology-led growth of the 1990s towards a more mature stage where competences in marketing and brand management rather than technology will become even more important to success? Focusing on portal websites as a product category, this paper raises two main questions; what phase of its life cycle is the portal sector of e-business at and what are the strategic implications for managing portal brands? It takes an overview of secondary industry growth data and draws on developments in life cycle theory and the notion of 'completeness' that characterises fully mature products to make an exploratory and qualitative attempt to provide an answer. The main findings are that there are indications that portals may be approaching maturity in terms of industry growth, but that they still continue to show the signs of significant technological innovation and product development that characterises a sector still in a growth phase. It concludes by highlighting some future, strategic issues for brand management in the portal industry.

J	Freeman, S; Cray, D; Sandwell, M				Freeman, Susan; Cray, David; Sandwell, Mark			Networks and Australian professional services in newly emerging markets of Asia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICE INDUSTRY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						professional services; networking; decision making; market entry; emerging markets; Australia	INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS; MODEL	Purpose - To understand better how professional services firms (PSFs) use networks to gain entry into newly emerging markets (NEMs), to analyze how such firms are assisted in this process by prior networks and to provide a framework of this process. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology utilised in this study is qualitative and exploratory. Ten interviews across three large firms (legal, finance and media consulting) were used for the data gathering. Analysis incorporated open, axial and selective coding. Findings - Prior networks provide impetus to the foreign entry aspirations of PSFs and are critical to the process. The specific functions of network actors in the entry process are to influence the firm and to provide intelligence-gathering, arising from their participatory role in the foreign market. A framework is presented, supporting network theory as a key theoretical underpinning of strategy formulation, decision-making and implementation by PSFs entering NEMs. Research limitations/implications - The framework presented in this paper could be tested most appropriately by analysing an extended number of cases, still within a qualitative approach, prior to survey-testing the extent of the phenomena. Within the scope of the current study, however, the framework is supported by these preliminary findings. Practical implications - Networks are perceived by PSFs as a medium for capturing market knowledge and as a basis for strategic decision-making in NEMs. Originality/value - Network theory is posited as a key theoretical underpinning of core strategy formulation, decision-making and implementation by professional services entering NEMs.	Monash Univ, Dept Management, Caulfield, Australia; Carleton Univ, Sprott Sch Business, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada		Freeman, S (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Management, Caulfield, Australia.	susan.freeman@buseco.monash.edu.au	Freeman, Susan/K-2137-2015	Freeman, Susan/0000-0003-2272-9065			ALAVAREZGIL MJ, 2003, INT J BANK MARK, V21, P109; Altinay L, 2004, INT J SERV IND MANAG, V15, P426, DOI 10.1108/09564230410564911; ANDERSEN O, 1993, J INT BUS STUD, V24, P209, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490230; Axelsson B., 1992, IND NETWORKS NEW VIE; BLANKENBURG D, 1995, BUSINESS MARKETING I; Buckley PJ, 1976, FUTURE MULTINATIONAL; Chadwick M., 1989, SERV IND J, V9, P79, DOI DOI 10.1080/02642068900000005; Chetty S., 2004, EUR J MARKETING, V37, P796; Conte APD, 2003, BRAZ J MICROBIOL, V34, P1, DOI 10.1590/S1517-83822003000100001; Coviello N.

J	Hong, JJ; Chin, ATH; Liu, BL				Hong, Junjie; Chin, Anthony T. H.; Liu, Binglian			Logistics service providers in China Current status and future prospects	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Service delivery; Management standards; China; Competitive strategy		Purpose - The article attempts to study the current status and future prospects of logistics providers in the whole country as well as a comparatively developed Chinese city (Tianjin); reveal the disparities between China and Tianjin, as well as local firms and their foreign counterparts; and identify the challenges faced by Chinese logistics providers and offer managerial implications for logistics providers in an increasingly competitive environment. Design/methodology/approach - This research is based on two surveys conducted in China and Tianjin, respectively, under the support from government authorities. Comparative analyses were conducted to ascertain the differences between logistics firms in China and developed countries, as well as regional differences within China. Findings - The results reveal that Chinese logistics providers depend heavily on transportation and warehousing businesses but lack value-added services and logistics information management. Rate setting ranks highly in provider priority while the importance of lead-time performance is largely ignored. Significant regional differences in logistics exist and there is a long way for Chinese logistics providers to go in achieving international service standards. Most local firms wish to establish strategic alliances to enhance competitiveness. Originality/value - This research enriches the literature by investigating the current status and future prospects of logistics service providers in a transitional economy. China being an emerging player in the world economy, an understanding and assessment of China's logistics service providers is appropriate and timely. It offers invaluable information and implications for local providers, government authorities and foreign logistic service providers that are interested in the market.

J	Howard, M; Lewis, M; Miemczyk, J; Brandon-Jones, A				Howard, Mickey; Lewis, Mike; Miemczyk, Joe; Brandon-Jones, Alistair			Implementing supply practice at Bridgend engine plant - The influence of institutional and strategic choice perspectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						best practice; United Kingdom; automotive industry; innovation; engine components; suppliers	MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; QUALITY MANAGEMENT; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; CONTEXT; INVOLVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; DIFFUSION; INDUSTRY; BUNDLES; IMPACT	Purpose - This paper investigates the stalled adoption of a supplier park at Bridgend Engine Plant in the UK. It starts from the position that not all firms can or should implement the same set of practices. Design/methodology/approach - Critical incident technique and semi-structured interviews over five years were used to understand the influence of institutional and strategic choices during the implementation of a supplier park. A conceptual framework was developed to incorporate practices broadly associated with parks, i.e. improving supply stability, supply coordination, redefining the OEM/supplier boundary and enhancing interaction between co-located firms. Findings - The findings demonstrate a limited implementation of supply practices at Bridgend with only one component supplier brought onto the site. The original plan was to create a supplier park that would "grow" to an industrial park, creating an automotive sector in the area. However, a combination of operational, processual, and contextual factors have conspired against the plan. Research limitations/implications - The combination of a broad range of theoretical and practical elements means there are associated discussions that could be more fully explored. Condensing the interview notes has resulted in the researchers' own interpretation of events becoming a significant reality filter. Whilst single case studies raise inevitable concerns over comparability, our focus is on theoretical generalizability through richness of empirical data. Originality/value - As firms continue to use best practice as a core ingredient of strategy, researchers must respond with robust theoretical concepts explaining adoption and implementation. This paper integrates disparate perspectives across multiple levels in order to build a richer and more believable picture of a stalled initiative. Three key conclusions can be drawn: the contingent nature of "bundles of practice" implications of political ambiguity over the efficiency argument and the effect of isomorphic or bandwagon responses by firms.

J	Matthews, JI; Thomas, PT				Matthews, Jean I.; Thomas, Paul T.			Managing clinical failure: a complex adaptive system perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Knowledge capture; Learning; Complexity theory; Risk management; National Health Service; Wales		Purpose - The purpose of this article is to explore the knowledge capture process at the clinical level. It aims to identify factors that enable or constrain learning. The study applies complex adaptive system thinking principles to reconcile learning within the NHS. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a qualitative exploratory study with an interpretative methodological stance set in a secondary care NHS Trust. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare practitioners and managers involved at both strategic and operational risk management processes. Findings - A network structure is revealed that exhibits the communication and interdependent working practices to support knowledge capture and adaptive learning. Collaborative multidisciplinary communities, whose values reflect local priorities and promote open dialogue and reflection, are featured. The main concern is that the characteristics of bureaucracy; rational-legal authority, a rule-based culture, hierarchical lines of communication and a centralised governance focus, are hindering clinical learning by generating barriers. Practical implications - Locally emergent collaborative processes are a key strategic resource to capture knowledge, potentially fostering an environment that could learn from failure and translate lessons between contexts. What must be addressed is that reporting mechanisms serve not only the governance objectives, but also supplement learning by highlighting the potential lessons in context. Managers must nurture a collaborative infrastructure using networks in a co-evolutionary manner. Their role is not to direct and design processes but to influence, support and create effective knowledge capture. Originality/value - Although the study only investigated one site the findings and conclusions may well translate to other trusts - such as the risk of not enabling a learning environment at clinical levels.

This research attempts to prove the relationship by studying the managerial implication of design orientation as it relates to market orientation. After analysing 28 case studies of Spanish companies well-known for their business excellence and their design orientation, a management model is proposed. The model is a management tool that offers companies a scheme for auto-diagnosis and a review of best-in-class design practices that have shown to improve business results.

J	Otsuka, N; Reeve, A				Otsuka, Noriko; Reeve, Alan			Town Centre Management and Regeneration: The Experience in Four English Cities	JOURNAL OF URBAN DESIGN			English	Article								There is a growing recognition of Town Centre Management (TCM) as one of the several mechanisms to regenerate town centres in the UK context. However, in practice the role of TCM is diverse, ranging from day-to-day maintenance of urban centres to strategic contributions to economic regeneration and developing future vision of the town as a whole. TCM's contribution and capacity to regenerate town centres depends both on the nature of the TCM strategy applied on local regeneration problems and challenges and on local socio-economic circumstances. Drawing on research completed in 2005, this paper presents evidence from four contrasting town centres of the distinctive roles played by TCM in town centre regeneration. The paper demonstrates that under certain conditions TCM has the potential to go beyond its typical focus on town centre enhancement and leverage, to a focus much close to the wider social objectives of regeneration in the UK context. The paper also outlines a predictive model for understanding which types of town centre are likely to benefit from TCM as an approach to regeneration.

J	Santini, C; Cavicchi, A; Rocchi, B				Santini, Cristina; Cavicchi, Alessio; Rocchi, Benedetto			Italian wineries and strategic options: the role of Premium Bag in Box	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WINE BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Wines; Packaging; Premium products; Italy		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to give some enlightenments on value innovation in the wine industry and, more specifically in the US wine market, in order to suggest new strategic options to Italian wineries. Design/methodology/approach - After having provided a theoretical framework about value innovation and the US Premium Bag in Box (PBIB) wine market, a case study about a leading firm is presented. Findings - The adoption of a new packaging concept may help traditional Italian wineries to develop their sales. Understanding the dynamics and benefits of value innovation, would help wineries in getting over the obstacles for introducing innovation, and developing a truly perception of consumers' preferences and new managerial skills. Research implications/limitations - This research implies new studies in consumers' perceptions and willingness to pay for Italian wines in the USA. On the firms' side, it is important to understand wineries costs and organization structure in order to evaluate the possibility of new packaging introduction. Understanding the dynamics of value innovation in the wine industry would lead to gain a competitive advantage. Further researches should focus on the linkage between firms' structure and resources and the paths they choose to adopt. Practical implications - This paper can offer a valid suggestion for those firms whose export is suffering "New World" wineries aggressive strategies. Through PBIB wineries can adopt a "me-too strategy" or develop a further niche in this market. According to the strategy chosen, wineries have to face many concerns, mainly pertaining to finances, organization, and production. Originality/value - Value innovation and its exploitation under a strategic viewpoint have not been deeply considered in wine business literature.

J	Schlosser, FK; Mcnaughton, RB				Schlosser, Francine; Mcnaughton, Rod			Internal stakeholder views of a market orientation strategy: implications for implementation	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						Market orientation; internal stakeholder; stakeholder; employee attitudes; strategy; services marketing	CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; ANTECEDENTS; PRINCIPLE; CULTURE	The market orientation literature focuses upon external stakeholders as the content or target of a market orientation strategy. This is problematic for understanding the successful implementation of a market orientation strategy because internal stakeholders provide the link between strategy-makers and external stakeholder targets. Anchored in market orientation, dynamic capabilities, and stakeholder research, the study describes how internal stakeholders in a market orientation process can impede or encourage the achievement of market-oriented objectives by a market-oriented company. Focus groups were conducted with both management and non-management employees of a large market-oriented financial services organisation that recently introduced a market-oriented agency call program. The extent to which the company is market-oriented was determined through preliminary interviews with senior executives and distributor/customers. Results highlight: (1) program antecedents related to employee disposition and control; (2) potentially competing program objectives (relationship and knowledge acquisition); (3) issues of role conflict, time constraints; and (4) the need to confirm program value through feedback solicited from other stakeholders.

J	Tanure, B; Gonzalez-Duarte, R				Tanure, Betania; Gonzalez-Duarte, Roberto			Managing people in radical changes (M&As) - The adoption of intrinsically consistent HRM strategies in Brazilian companies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER			English	Article						acquisitions and mergers; human resource management; banks; Brazil	MERGER	Purpose - The aim of this paper is to look at why and how HRM may take on a more strategic role within mergers and acquisitions (M&As) processes. Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses the ABN AMRO Bank case. The Dutch bank first acquired one of the largest Brazilian banks and, later, the Brazilian subsidiary of an Italian bank. The paper seeks to understand to what extent the successful integration of the acquired banks by the acquiring one was determined by the consistency among three factors: the determining reason for the acquisition; the integration strategy adopted; and the HRM policies for the management of people. Findings - The case has evidenced that, in processes of radical change, such as acquisitions, the president, as well as the top management of the acquiring company, has a critical role of establishing an understanding that people constitute, in fact, a key asset of the company, thereby opening avenues for HRM to assume a strategic role within companies. Practical implications - Even though the HR managers should seek to undertake a more active and strategic role in M&As, contributing effectively to the performance of the organization, their actions are shaped by the consistency between discourse and practice of CEOs regarding the importance of people within organizations. Any disparity between this discourse and practice is likely to affect the role played by HRM within organizations. Originality/value - This paper will be valuable for those attempting to link both streams of literature - HRM and post-acquisition integration.

J	Zheng, CN; Soosay, C; Hyland, P				Zheng, Connie; Soosay, Claudine; Hyland, Paul			Manufacturing to Asia: who will win the emerging battle for talent between Dragons and Tigers?	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Manufacturing industries; Recruitment; Skills; Multinational companies; Asia	TRANSITION; RESOURCES; MARKETS	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the issues relating to recruiting highly skilled managerial and professional staff experienced by multinational companies (MNCs) manufacturing in six Asian countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Design/methodology/approach - Data collected from 529 MNCs were used to examine critical human resource planning and recruitment concerns of companies operating in high growth "Dragon" and newly developed "Tiger" economies. The study examined the differences in recruitment practices between manufacturing and service companies and the issues relating to how manufacturers maintain an adequate skills basis. Findings - There appears a considerable extent of battle for talent among Dragon and Tiger economies with the latter required to be more aggressive as they attempt to sustain growth. Manufacturing companies are experiencing a higher demand for more job-related managerial and technical capabilities whilst competing with service companies that are also in need for more talent. To succeed, manufacturing MNCs will need to adopt a strategic approach for recruitment and retention, and internal capability training to maintain their skilled employees in order to sustain competitive advantage.

J	Chastain, JR				Chastain, James R., Jr.			Methodology for Locating Monitoring Stations to Detect Contamination in Potable Water Distribution Systems	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Safety; Infrastructure; Terrorism; Water distribution systems; Water supply; Risk management	ACCIDENTAL CONTAMINATIONS	The requirements to protect public water systems from external contamination have expanded in the years following September 11, 2001. The areal extent and nonlinear nature of fluid demand and movement in the distribution system makes efficient location of sampling points difficult. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that contamination conceptually can occur at any time and at any point within the distribution system. This paper proposes a methodology to identify strategic locations within the system that can be established as critical detection points for such occurrences. This methodology is different from others in that it uses computer simulations to create a database of water system responses to contamination generated at every node in the system. A process is developed to mine this database systematically after considering concentration thresholds and "time since injection" parameters. The result is a network of monitoring locations that provide efficient coverage of the system under the conditions imposed.

The continuous rise of business opportunities and increase of global competition demand proactive strategy making, recognition of new opportunities, and an ability to continuously renew the capabilities to face the changing business environment. The radically changing business environment of the electricity distribution industry in Finland opens up new interindustrial business opportunities and forces organizations to renew their strategies and operations. To exploit the emerging opportunities, organizations need to have methods and practices, which help them to be aware of changes in the business environment and to facilitate the development of their capabilities. This paper presents the scenario process as a tool for assessing the requirements of the changing business environment, and identifying the capabilities needed in alternative future scenarios resulting suggestions for the companies as well as for the authorities where to direct their future activities.

J	Wander, N; Malone, RE				Wander, Nathaniel; Malone, Ruth E.			Making big tobacco give in: You lose, they win	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							WARNING LABELS; INDUSTRY; DIVESTMENT; BEHAVIOR; BOYCOTT	Objectives. To better understand how the tobacco industry responds to tobacco control activists, we explored Philip Morris's response to demands that consumers in developing countries be informed about smoking risks, and analyzed the implications of negotiating with a tobacco company. Methods. We reviewed internal tobacco industry documents and related materials, constructed a case history of how Philip Morris responded to a shareholder campaign to require health warnings on cigarettes sold worldwide, and analyzed interactions between (1) socially responsible investment activists, (2) Philip Morris management, (3) institutional investors, and (4) industry competitors. Results. After resisting for 11 years, Philip Morris unilaterally reversed direction, and proposed its own labeling initiative. While activists celebrated, Philip Morris's president detailed privately how the company would yield little and benefit disproportionately. Activists portrayed the tobacco industry as preying on the poor and uneducated and used delegitimization to drive a wedge between the industry and its financial and political allies. When Philip Morris "gave in" to their demands, it exchanged negative publicity for positive public relations and political credibility. Conclusions. Tobacco companies can appear to accommodate public health demands while securing strategic advantages. Negotiating with the tobacco industry can enhance its legitimacy and facilitate its ability to market deadly cigarettes without corresponding benefits to public health.

Nitrate contamination in Oregon Well Water: Geologic variability and the public's perception	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						drinking water; geospatial analysis; ground water management; nitrate; public perception survey; water quality; wells	DRINKING-WATER; CANCER MORTALITY; GROUNDWATER; RISK	Approximately 4.5 million people in the United States who rely on well water are exposed to nitrate-N concentrations exceeding the 10 mg/l standard. In this study in the Southern Willamette Valley in Oregon we reassessed nitrate-N in rural wells sampled in 2000-2001, compared nitrate-N concentrations among geological units, and surveyed residents about their perceptions of well water quality. Nitrate-N concentrations were again sampled in 2002 and found to have increased significantly from the previous period. With rapid population growth in the area, the potential health risk in drinking well water that exceeds 10 mg/l nitrate-N warrants continued public education. Nitrate-N concentrations were found to be higher in the Holocene alluvium of the Willamette River and the Pleistocene sand and gravel post-Missoula Flood deposits. Researchers conducting future studies may choose to stratify and monitor wells by geologic unit and by other parameters that estimate input of nutrients to the environment. Opinions differed between agricultural landowners and nonagricultural landowners with regard to the impact that agricultural fertilizers may have on water quality. Participants were supportive of a range of regulatory actions that might be used by homeowners or landowners to address ground water contamination. Given that the area is now designated a Groundwater Management Area, understanding local stakeholders' perceptions is critical and strategic and has the potential to help public agencies manage potential Conflicts of opinion among stakeholders, build consensus, and help guide the approach to restoring ground water quality.

A proposal for managing wastewater in Harare, Zimbabwe	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						integrated water management; Lake Chivero; pollution prevention; staged approach; three-step strategic approach; wastewater management strategies		This paper deals with wastewater management in Harare, in the Lake Chivero catchment area of Zimbabwe. It aims at developing a sustainable system for managing water and nutrients and is based on the literature and a water quality monitoring Study conducted from June 2000 to December 2001. This study has shown serious water pollution problems due to urbanisation in the catchment. A 1 three-step strategic approach' 10 urban (waste)water management was used as a basis for formulating solutions. The short-term Solutions include reduction of wastewater volume in industries and households, reducing wastewater flows by 24% and total phosphorus by 5%. The medium-term solutions involve treating wastewater to high standards, resource recovery and reuse, and controlling upstream sources of pollution, and thus would reduce the lake total nitrogen and total phosphorus levels to about 0.4 and 0.07 mg/L, respectively. A long-term solution was suggested based on pollution prevention and direct reuse, treatment at onsite and decentralised levels followed by reuse, and minimal disposal of the remaining effluents combined with the stimulation of the self-purification capacity of the receiving rivers. it was concluded that it is feasible to reduce pollution levels in the catchment by applying these phased developments.

J	Martin, TG; van Klinken, RD				Martin, TG; van Klinken, RD			Value for money? Investment in weed management in Australian rangelands	RANGELAND JOURNAL			English	Article						arid landscapes; biodiversity conservation; exotic; non-native; pastoral		Increased awareness of the threat posed by non-native species to biodiversity and productivity has prompted an unprecedented commitment and investment in weed management activities throughout rangeland Australia. Since the launching of National Weeds Program in 1996 under the first phase of the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT), there has been a substantial increase in coordinated and strategic investment in weed management across the rangelands. Almost AU$25 million of Australian Government funding has been invested in projects specifically targeting Weeds of National Significance (WONS) that occur in the rangelands (14 species) and a further AU$56 million on projects conducted in the rangelands that included a weed management component. Substantial funding has also been invested by other levels of government, non-government organisations and landholders. We review this investment in relation to the level of funding, the types of weeds targeted, the range of projects undertaken and the effectiveness of these projects within Australia's rangelands. Achievements include successful eradications, preventions, early interventions, containments, mitigation of impacts, increased awareness of weed threats and general capacity to respond to weed management issues. Our review highlights several areas that, if addressed, will result in a substantial increase in the effectiveness of weed management efforts. These include: addressing discrepancies between states/territories in terms of funding and commitment to weed management; resolving conflicts between stakeholders in relation to the cost-benefit of non-native pasture grasses; encouraging projects that consider the broader natural resource management context of weed infestations; encouraging projects that examine weed complexes or the impacts of weeds in habitats with high biodiversity values such as riparian zones; and detecting and controlling weeds in the early stages of establishment. Finally, the collection of baseline information and alignment of reporting schedules with the longer term benefits of weed management projects will allow an assessment of the effectiveness of weed management projects and more strategic allocation of resources in the future.

J	Mishra, BK; Prasad, A				Mishra, Birendra; Prasad, Ashutosh			Minimizing retail shrinkage due to employee theft	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Theft; Employee behaviour; Retailing		Purpose - Employee theft is a major component of retail shrinkage. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the use of two methods, internal control and random inspections of the locations at which employees work, to deter employee theft. An inspection strategy is designed in which retailers try to minimize their costs while trying to prevent employees from stealing. Design/methodology/approach - We employ an analytical approach. The employees are assumed to be strategic, i.e. they respond to the decisions made by the retailer, and likewise the retailer is strategic. Consequently, game theory is used to model their interaction, and to obtain the best decisions for both the retailer and employee after taking into consideration the other's actions. Findings - The solution of the game depends upon various parameters such as the cost and effectiveness of random inspections and of the internal control system. The paper determines the optimal frequency of inspections, the total budget to be spent on inspections and the total expected retail shrinkage due to employee theft. The paper also shows the extent to which an effective internal control system and the recruitment of honest employees can benefit retail organizations in preventing losses due to employee theft. Practical implications - The paper provides normative guidelines for decisions such as the frequency of inspections. Retailers can limit employee theft but eliminating theft altogether turns out to be too expensive if the goal is to minimize organizational losses. The retailer should try to reduce inspection costs and increase their effectiveness. Adding honest employees helps the retailer, but note that adding just a few is not beneficial because organizational losses remain unchanged, but adding a larger number qualitatively affects the equilibrium outcome and lowers organizational losses. The paper describes when investing in better internal control systems is appropriate. Originality/value - The underlying assumption is of strategic retailers and employees. This gaming analysis brings a new perspective to examining retail crime problems than has been hitherto the case. This work follows in the tradition of the economics of crime literature, which views crime as a rational choice decision made by potential offenders. The study examines employee crime in the context of retail organizations, and provides several new insights. Although the idea of random inspections is not new, features of the retail environment such as internal control system, employee dissatisfaction and the ability to recruit honest employees have no direct parallels in the economics of crime literature, and are being touched upon for the first time.

J	de Pablos, PO				Ordonez de Pablos, Patricia			Knowledge flows and learning at interorganisational level: implications for management in multinational corporations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						competitiveness; international business; knowledge management; multinational companies; organisational learning		Strategic management literature states that organisational knowledge is a valuable source of competitive advantage for the organisation. Thus, firms must know how to manage this strategic resource in an effective and efficient way as well as how to renew their source of competitive advantage through organisational learning. On one hand, the analysis of organisational knowledge encompasses two dimensions. First, the epistemological level differentiates between tacit and explicit knowledge. Second, the ontological level traditionally encompasses learning at individual, group and organisational level. On the other hand, organisational learning represents a multiprocess where the following knowledge-related processes take place: intuition and interpretation, integration and institutionalisation. Finally, in an international context, the analysis of organisational learning becomes even more complex when an additional level of analysis is added: the interorganisational level.

J	Porrini, P				Porrini, P			Are investment bankers good for acquisition premiums?	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						investment banker; acquirer; acquisition premium	JOINT-VENTURES; AGENCY THEORY; PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY; BANKING; MERGERS; CHOICE; WEALTH; FIRMS	Since the 1980s, the number of acquisition deals has increased as has the use of investment bankers. Among their many strategic and financial advisory roles, investment bankers negotiate acquisition premiums. Studies have found support for agency conflicts between acquirers and their bankers, resulting in bankers being associated with acquirers' payments of higher acquisition premiums. This study investigates the transaction-specific attributes under which acquirers' bankers are associated with greater acquisition premiums and whether bankers' first-tier status attenuates the premium paid by acquirers when they use bankers. The study examines a sample of 481 acquisitions completed between 1988 and 1998 and finds that the presence of acquirers' bankers along with transaction-specific attributes can influence acquisition premiums.

J	Yang, J; Lai, FJ				Yang, J; Lai, FJ			Harnessing value in knowledge acquisition and dissemination: strategic sourcing in product development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th ISPIM Conference on Innovation Through Collaboration	2003	Manchester, ENGLAND	ISPIM		knowledge acquisition; knowledge dissemination; new product performance; knowledge management; additivity and variance stabilising transformation	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MARKET ORIENTATION; JAPANESE FIRMS; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; TRANSFORMATIONS; DETERMINANTS; ANTECEDENTS; INTEGRATION	Knowledge acquisition and dissemination have been considered as two endpoints of knowledge management (KM) process. Knowledge management affects new product performance through the two endpoints on the knowledge value chain. This study attempts to find how the knowledge acquisition and dissemination are related to new product financial performance. Employing additivity and variance stabilisation (AVAS) analysis, this paper examines the relationship between KM and the new product financial performance, and identifies different hidden patterns in which knowledge acquisition and dissemination affect new product financial performance. These findings imply that if organisations fail to understand the subtle ways by which different dimensions of knowledge acquisition and dissemination influence new product performance, they may fail to harvest the full value of KM in developing new products.

This article reviews the development of the Ontario Health Plan for an influenza Pandemic (OHPIP), released in June 2005. Some key points arising from the provincial planning process include the necessity to: ensure a broad and inclusive development process; ensure the pandemic plan identifies: 1) clear roles and responsibilities of federal, provincial/territorial and municipal levels of government, 2) the approach to occupational health and safety issues and ethical decision-making, 3) a communications strategy linking all affected sectors and levels of government and health sector; 4) any commitments to antiviral stockpiling, vaccine and antiviral allocation and use, and an approach for drug delivery from provincial stockpiles to local pub health units; 5) health human resource management and supplementation; and 6) key programs/services to be scaled back to maximize surge capacity; address best practices (e.g., involve all sectors of the health care system at the outset, acquire strategic expertise, coordinate/advocate with broader emergency response system, etc); and, outline future stages that include strengthening the delivery of clinical care to influenza cases; clarifying the role of primary care practitioners during a pandemic; leveraging Ontario's significant e-Health investments. Ontario's pandemic planning process aims to provide a robust, detailed document that will offer useful advice and information well beyond its borders.

The case organisation is a global consulting firm that has been on the forefront of knowledge management and has won several knowledge management related international acclaims. Our analysis shows that there are strong disincentives in place for departments to share knowledge. We found that the nature of the businesses of the departments was very different and so were their knowledge requirements and their preferred ways to seek knowledge. Additionally, confidentiality agreements with clients and lack of cross-departmental interaction inhibited knowledge sharing outside departmental boundaries. Contrary to the common belief in the organisation, we found that one single IT system could not satisfy the contextspecific knowledge-sharing needs of the different departments.

From a database made up of 250 companies in Spain and by means of a regression analysis, we test empirically whether human resource practices generate positive results under any circumstance or if their effectiveness depends on certain contexts. In this respect, focusing the study on the activity sector and the environment, we analyse whether high levels of competition in the environment and service companies constitute more attractive contexts for the adoption of high involvement practices.

J	Nielsen, RP; Dufresne, R				Nielsen, RP; Dufresne, R			Can ethical organizational character be stimulated and enabled? "Upbuilding" dialog as crisis management method	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						ethics; organizational character; crisis; Kierkegaard	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; DIALECTICAL INQUIRY; DEVILS ADVOCACY; PERFORMANCE; CONSENSUS; PARADOX	Crisis management can be simultaneously a content specific problem solving process and an opportunity for stimulating and enabling an organization's ethical tradition. Crisis can be an opportunity for ethical organizational development. Kierkegaardian "upbuilding'' dialog method builds from within the internal ethical tradition of an organization to respond to crises while simultaneously adapting and protecting the organization's tradition. The crisis itself may not be a directly ethical crisis, but the method of responding to the crisis is built upon the ethical foundations of an organization's tradition. A limitation of this method is that it may be less applicable to organizations with questionably ethical traditions. The concept of "upbuilding'' dialog is derived from Kierkegaard, but here is applied to organizational crisis management. The method is illustrated and discussed in the context of a wrongful death crisis of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a nonprofit organization, and an economic survival crisis at Ben and Jerry's, a business organization.

J	Arnaboldi, M; Azzone, G				Arnaboldi, Michela; Azzone, Giovanni			Incrementalism and strategic change: a university's experience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic change; Universities; Organizational change; Italy		Purpose - The processual interpretation of strategic change has been often applied to private companies searching for a logic behind their apparent chaotic transformation. The purpose of this paper is to report on an experience in a public organisation, an Italian university, where this perspective is exceptionally reflected, entailing a refining process towards a new strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The longitudinal case study was carried out analyzing different subunits within this institution, investigating the way in which top managers have tried to re-position the organisation, taking advantage of the increased autonomy given by a series of reforms of the academic system. Findings - The results show an incremental process towards autonomy and accountability, through which top managers have transformed the organisational structure, identified responsibilities, and introduced a new set of managerial techniques. Originality/value - This study shows how the combination of three elements - logic, incrementalism and accounting - has guided the institution in the trajectory of its transformation.

J	Awny, MM				Awny, MM			Technology transfer and implementation processes in developing countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						developing countries; technology management; technology acquisition		In their struggle to survive, enterprises in developing countries are rushing to keep abreast with the technological advancements. As the indigenous technological capabilities of developing countries are weak by default, they intend to import technology internationally. Experience showed that, in doing so, a number of obstacles might render the technology acquisition process by them, less effective, or even sometimes, a failure economically and/or technically. Cases in developing countries show that the technological capabilities of the technology recipient country are a decisive factor in successfully transferring and absorbing of the particular technology. Many other factors affect the process, such as education, culture, legislations, enabling environment, etc. Building the indigenous technological capabilities should be the ultimate goal of the development countries in order to cope with the aggressive competing world. Government of developing countries should review their strategic plans in order to consider the fast moving technology advancements.

J	Brown, P				Brown, Paul			The evolving role of strategic management development	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Corporate strategy; Management development		Purpose - To validate conceptual frameworks for strategic management development. Also, to test the hypothesis that the objectives and design of a strategic management development programme need to match the organisation's level of commitment to strategic management and the degree of maturity of its strategic management processes and competencies, in order that the programme can be effective in enhancing the strategic capability of the organisation. Design/methodology/approach - Earlier work by the author (based on literature review and one case study) had generated two conceptual models which could help in the understanding of strategic management development. One provides a life-cycle typology matching an organisation's level of commitment to strategic management with the design of an effective strategic management development programme. The second provides a causal network showing how strategic management capability may be developed. In this paper case study research is reported from six organisations to provide data, which are mainly qualitatative, to test the hypothesis and conceptual models. Findings - Both the life-cycle typology and the conceptual models are supported by the further case study work. It was also found that the dominant strategy-making mode in the organisation can influence the potential for strategic management development. Where the command mode of strategy making is dominant the strategic aspects of a management development programme are inhibited because this is not consistent with the command culture. Research limitations/implications - The generalisability of the findings is constrained by the small sample size of six organisations. However, given the paucity of theory in the field of strategic management development, the findings contribute to the conceptual understanding of this subject. Originality/value - The models proposed give insights into the complexities of strategic management development and can be used to inform analysis and planning of more effective strategic management development interventions.

J	Heinrich, B				Heinrich, Bernd			Transforming strategic goals of CRM into process goals and activities	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Customer relations; Process planning; Banking		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address two questions: what is the difference between relationship processes and purely product-oriented processes? And to answer this question we should bear in mind what we mean by relationship, and why a customer is willing to establish and maintain a relationship at all. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical analysis subjected the motives of customers and factors for the establishment and expansion of customers' relationships. In this context the relationship motives and factors can act as base to derive strategic goals of CRM and relationship processes in a further step. Findings - Based on strategic relationship goals the paper will give answers to a systematic identification and engineering of relationship activities and processes. Thereby relationship-oriented activities complement present product-oriented processes. In contrast to this we derive purely relationship-oriented processes as well, such as the customer recovery process. Such processes do not target product sales any more than rather the sustainability of relationship (in particular to valuable customers). Originality/value - The benefit of the paper is an integrated and goal-oriented derivation and design of relationship processes and activities. An example in financial services illustrates the approach and shows its application in parts.

J	Johansen, J; Riis, JO				Johansen, J; Riis, JO			The interactive firm - towards a new paradigm - A framework for the strategic positioning of the industrial company of the future	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						manufacturing systems; innovation; strategic manufacturing; knowledge organizations; Denmark		Purpose - The article discusses the characteristics of the future industrial company, the so-called interactive firm, and the challenges awaiting it down the road. To this end, a framework for the strategic positioning of tomorrow's industrial company is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - In order to illustrate that the interactive firm may take on different forms, three archetypal, future-oriented firms have been identified and tested in a panel of industrial managers to flesh out this framework. Findings - The article provides a detailed picture of the strategic roles and functioning of the interactive firm. Practical implications - Individual firms may use the framework as a guide to position themselves in the industrial climate of the future. The framework also includes five different strategic production roles that an industrial firm should consider. Originality/value - The value of the article is that it triggers both scholars and practitioners to study and consider different forms as well as key characteristics of the industrial enterprise of the future.

J	Landrum, NE; Gardner, CL				Landrum, NE; Gardner, CL			Using integral theory to effect strategic change	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic change; strategic management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the need for integration of Wilber's all levels, all quadrants (AQAL) approach into the strategy of a corporation. Organizations have incorporated elements of his theory at various levels, but none has fully incorporated all four quadrants. We explore how each quadrant can be used in strategic change to aid organizations in their quest for sustainable competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach - Using Wilber's AQAL approach, we present suggestions on how corporations can use each quadrant in strategic change efforts. Findings - Several strategic planning methods which try to be all-inclusive are discussed. Several companies are also discussed that have incorporated progressive approaches throughout the organization, However, no example yet exists of a company that has used a full integrally-informed approach to strategic change and transformation. Originality/value - The authors seek to present an example of how each quadrant can be used in strategic change to aid organizations in their quest for sustainable competitive advantage.

J	Tsan, WN; Chang, CC				Tsan, Wen-Nan; Chang, Chao-Ching			Intellectual capital system interaction in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL			English	Article						Intellectual capital; Communication technologies; Knowledge management; Taiwan		Purpose - Confronted with the transformation of industrial economies, the Taiwanese information technology (IT) industry has to upgrade from production to innovation orientation. The paper seeks to explore what is the core competence of the Taiwanese IT industry. In brief, what kind of intellectual capital (IC) is embedded in the Taiwanese IT industry and how this IC is managed effectively. The point is to discover how the Taiwanese IT industry should start to accumulate or enhance the core resource and strategic capability for future competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach - The study selected a relatively representative number of IT firms in Taiwan covering six industries. This study conducted a two-stage survey to construct a measurement model and explored the IC profile of the Taiwanese IT industries. Findings - This study was able to identify eight IC factors as a measuring model in exploring the IC profiles of four Taiwanese IT industries. The findings indicate the stronger IC in the Taiwanese IT industry as well as the weaker side. Research limitations/implications - The research was limited by the sample within the Taiwan information communications technology industries. It needs to be extended across further industries in the future. It should also be compared with other countries' industrial IC under similar assessment and measurement. The significant differences between industries could be explored by case study methodology. Practical implications - Innovation capability plays an important role in confronting the knowledge-based economy in Taiwanese IT industries. However, there is no compelling evidence to show that investment in research and development will help to achieve the goal of establishing Taiwan as an "Asia Pacific Electronic Information Industry Resource Integration Center". Originality/value - This research indicates that the IC System Model developed would help us to identify the interactions among IC elements. It could help to explore whether it is true that, the higher the IC management, the higher is the influence from the input of IC to the output.

J	Vainio, AM				Vainio, Anu Marianne			Exchange and combination of knowledge-based resources in network relationships A study of software firms in Finland	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						Knowledge management; Finland		Purpose - To gain a better understanding of various network relationships in the software industry by classifying relationships by type and identifying distinctions with respect to the business potential of those relationships. Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of literature, the study presents a framework for the tasks of combining and exchanging knowledge-based resources in network relationships. In the empirical research setting, the relationships of nine Finnish software firms are first classified and placed in the framework, and then the organisational effectiveness of the relationships is measured. Findings - The findings reveal three relationship types, each leading to different effectiveness profiles. Research limitations/implications - It is recognised that this exploratory multiple-case study raises the concern of generalisability and, thus, a statistical research using more accurate quantitative methods could be useful in checking the validity of the findings. Further, the selected cases exclude non-networking companies, which is why future researchers may wish to consider whether the conclusions are valid across all firms and not just for those already in relationships. Practical implications - A very useful information for new software firms having and planning partnerships in the software industry. For a new venture with limited resources, in particular, the partnerships may offer valuable resources. The study advances the identification of those benefits. Originality/value - This study extends the understanding of management in strategic networks, particularly in the software industry, by classifying network relationships by type, describing the potential of these relationships, and indicating the capabilities needed for managing specific types of relationships.

HIV/AIDS is increasing dramatically in eastern Europe. HIV-related tuberculosis (TB/HIV) morbidity and mortality are expected to accelerate significantly in the future. This framework aims to guide European countries in developing their national plan for reducing TB/HIV morbidity and mortality. It results from an extensive consultation process undertaken by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe and by those responsible for HIV/AIDS and TB programmes and their partners. It builds on strategies developed globally and in Europe for TB control and for HIV/AIDS prevention and care. This framework sets out the rationale for effective collaboration between HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis national programmes. It identifies five strategic components (political commitment, collaborative prevention, intensified case-finding, coordinated treatment and strengthened surveillance) and eight key operations (central coordination, policy development, surveillance, training, supply management, service delivery, health promotion and research).

J	Costello, C; Karp, L				Costello, C; Karp, L			Dynamic taxes and quotas with learning	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL			English	Article						prices; quantities; asymmetric information; searching	PRICES; POLICY	We compare dynamic taxes and quotas when a regulator and non-strategic firm have asymmetric information. The regulator learns by using either a tax or a quota that can be slack. With a tax, the information asymmetry is resolved in one period. Optimal learning using a quota is less transparent, but we show that learning never takes place gradually. In the first period, the regulator either acts myopically, or he tries to improve his information, but he never experiments in subsequent periods. We use this result to assess the informational advantage of taxes compared to quotas under asymmetric information. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cannon, AR; St John, CH				Cannon, AR; St John, CH			Competitive strategy and plant-level flexibility	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; BUSINESS STRATEGY; ENVIRONMENTAL JOLTS; GENERIC STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; COMPETENCE; INDUSTRY; FIRM; ORGANIZATION	Choosing how and where to be flexible is a critical issue for manufacturers, particularly as competition becomes more intense and environments become more turbulent. Unfortunately, attempts by scholars to make useful prescriptions remain hampered by the fragmented nature of the literature on flexibility. The present paper integrates a review of that literature with concepts from organization theory and competitive strategy in proposing two types of flexibility-tactical and strategic-at the plant level. Using canonical correlation analysis and data gathered from multiple US industries, the relationship between competitive strategy and the perceived value of tactical and/or strategic flexibility is explored. Results tentatively indicate significant strategic effects on the choice of flexibility emphasis at the plant level.

Although this model has classic status in operations management, it is little tested in practice. A questionnaire derived from the model was administered in a large-scale postal survey of managers in a variety of UK manufacturing and service organisations. Analysis of the responses indicates that only a little over half of respondents were able to provide an assessment of their organisation's operations that fitted the logic of the four-stage model This seems to imply that managers have difficulty in assessing the strategic role, played by their operations in an internally consistent and coherent manner. The results question the utility of the model and raise concerns about its validity.

J	Bay, BK; Tang, NKH; Bennett, D				Bay, BK; Tang, NKH; Bennett, D			An empirical study of the imperatives for a supply chain implementation project in Seagate Technology International	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						supply chain management; distribution management; manufacturing systems; strategic planning; Singapore	OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; PERSPECTIVE	Singapore's electronics manufacturers are facing many questions. In the computer hard-drive industry; where the problem of obsolescence is common and where a product's lifecycle may be only six months, manufacturers are anxious to know what the next order-winning criteria will be. Since low labour costs are no longer a key factor, many organisations are developing their competencies in research and development, sales and marketing, logistics and supply chain management in order to maintain competitiveness. This paper illustrates how Seagate has envisaged a climate of cooperation and collaboration to better serve its customers in the areas of technology, cost and delivery. The paper is based on observations and findings following a longitudinal case study approach at the Seagate Storage Product Group (SPG) in Singapore. The seven-stage implementation framework adopted by Seagate in their SCM project is discussed, together with the process of how Seagate has created a paradigm shift towards a new culture of teamwork-based collaboration.

J	Wang, ZM				Wang, ZM			Managerial competency modelling and the development of organizational psychology: A Chinese approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							SELF; LEADERSHIP; CULTURE; JUSTICE; STYLES	In recent years, China has undergone rapid economic reform and dynamic organizational changes. Several major developments have given special momentum to those changes: China entering the WTO, opening the western regions of China, building up an information network, transforming new management systems nationwide, and encouraging innovations and entrepreneurship. These developments call for more comprehensive and adaptive competencies and new approaches to organizational psychology in China. This provides a national and cultural context of personnel assessment, selection, and development of organizational psychology. Organizational psychology is one of the most active fields for research and application in psychology in China. Three aspects of recent trends are described under a framework of managerial competency modelling. (1) Leadership competence assessment for personnel selection and development has become one of the key aspects of human resources (HR) management in China. Based upon the results from the structured interview and strategic hierarchical job analysis, a model of leadership competency with four dimensions of leadership characteristics and the managerial performance was proposed. The four dimensions are: psychological traits; leadership predispositions; managerial skills; and professional knowledge. (2) HR competency for person-job-organization fit. This includes competencies for compensation and motivational strategies, organizational commitment and career management competence, team competence, and group decision-making skills. (3) Organizational competency for culture and change. This includes an integrative approach to link values with culture, and cross-cultural leadership skills. On the basis of the recent practice and research developments, a Chinese approach to organizational psychology with important characteristics is summarized: active theoretical development and conceptualization; continuous methodological improvement; close link with HR and management practices; and systematic cross-cultural socioeconomic perspective. This becomes a key framework for understanding organizational psychology. New directions for research and application in China are highlighted.

J	Rosental, C				Rosental, C			Certifying knowledge: The sociology of a logical theorem in artificial intelligence	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article							FUZZY-LOGIC; MATHEMATICS; PROOF; PARADOXES; BLIND	This study examines the concrete modalities of the production and recognition of a specific logical theorem in the field of artificial intelligence in the 1990s. Ethnographic observations, interviews, and textual analysis, reveal the impact of a heterogeneity of practices of evaluation and other forms of interaction between the author of the theorem and a varied community of interlocutors, especially during the draft stage of the theorem. Individual and collective representations of the theorem were structured by the proliferation and polysemy of its reformulations, by the imperfect access to proofs and counterproofs, and by the coordination of action within opposed groups. The stabilization of debates over and the certification of the theorem were not based on the simple victory of one side over another but on relatively unified responses by critics and by the author's responses to critiques-responses that tended to allow for multiple interpretations. This ethnography of logic in development illustrates why sociologists should not consider logic to be just a methodological tool; it is also a privileged object that enables exploration of the material and social forms of intellectual work, including the building of credibility.

To determine whether participation in the project was associated with better outcomes and to identify team characteristics that were associated with high performance, we obtained centrally collected facility-level performance measures on quality and timeliness of the examinations. To determine factors associated with team success, we compared measures of leadership support reported by teams with high and low performance outcomes. Thirty teams representing 34 VA medical centers and 22 Veterans Benefits Administration's regional offices participated in the project. Monthly volumes were significantly higher for participating teams, and volumes increased significantly over time for both groups. At the beginning of the project, examination timeliness was substantially worse for participating teams (34.1 versus 29.9 days, p=.03); by the end, participants had better performance (28.5 versus 30.3 days, p=.00). Quality measures were maintained. By the end of the project, high performers reported improved leadership, frontline support, resource availability alignment with strategic goals, and leadership mandate when compared to performance at the beginning of the project, low performers reported the opposite. These results suggest that the principles of clinical improvement can be applied successfully to teach teams how to achieve process improvements within a large healthcare organization. Visible, ongoing support by leadership and alignment of project objectives with strategic goals are associated with improved project outcomes.

J	Chatterjee, S; Heath, TB; Basuroy, S				Chatterjee, S; Heath, TB; Basuroy, S			Failing to suspect collusion in price-matching guarantees: Consumer limitations in game-theoretic reasoning	JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							REFUND POLICIES; NEED; COGNITION; INFORMATION; QUALITY; PERSPECTIVE; WARRANTIES; PERSUASION; STRATEGY; SIGNALS	Marketers often commit to matching competitors' prices by offering price-matching guarantees (PMGs). Theory, however, shows that PMGs can either foster price competition and lower market prices or facilitate price collusion and raise market prices. In 3 experiments, we tested if consumers suspect collusion in such tactics and if this suspicion in turn affects their preferences for PMGs. Experiment 1 showed that consumers prefer markets where sellers offer PMGs over those that do not, suggesting little or no suspicion of collusion. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and extended them by showing that although most consumers prefer PMG markets, consumers higher in need for cognition (NFC) do, consistent with the greater suspicion hypothesized, prefer PMG markets more weakly. However, this weakened preference emerged from concerns over lower product quality in PMG markets more so than expectations of unduly high prices. Experiment 3 then tested the collusive potential of PMGs by placing participants in the role of a government regulator charged with finding collusion in various markets. Regardless of explicit primes and NFC, participants perceived PMGs as competitive devices that reduce prices rather than collusive devices that raise them. In contrast to the assumptions underlying game-theoretic models, consumers often lack the strategic sophistication necessary to detect the collusive potential of PMGs, a limitation that implicates legislation to moderate the use of such devices.

The possibility of individually strategic behavior in the presence of private information leads to game-theoretic predictions of less than full efficiency. We present a one-stage, simultaneous offers bargaining game in which buyers and sellers have independent, privately held valuations for the item being sold (i.e. a bilateral auction with two-sided private information). In three communication treatments, parties are: (a) allowed face-to-face communication prior to submitting offers; (b) allowed written communication prior to submitting offers; or (c) allowed no-communi cation prior to submitting offers. When parties are allowed pre-play communication, we find nearly full efficiency (98%). We examine two systematically predictable aspects of dyadic interaction-disclosure and reciprocity-to explain how negotiators achieve this efficiency. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Pass, S; Ronen, B				Pass, S; Ronen, B			Management by the market constraint in the Hi-Tech industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article								This paper presents a systematic approach to managing by the market constraint in the Hi-Tech industry. In line with the Theory of Constraints methodology, it is argued that in a market-constrained environment, the marketing and sales department together with the research and development department are Permanent Bottlenecks and need to be managed as such. The paper modifies the Theory of Constraint's five focusing steps to accommodate the market constraint. It describes the Strategic Gating and Tactical Gating that enable the firm to increase shareholder value, emphasizing that even though the company has to seek pro. table orders in the competitive market, management can control the situation by the focusing methods presented. The paper also suggests a way to reduce costs in non-critical areas and stresses the need for lead-time protective buffers.

J	Hinterhuber, HH; Friedrich, SA				Hinterhuber, HH; Friedrich, SA			The technology dimension of strategic leadership - The leadership challenge for production economists	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						leadership; managerial excellence; production economics; production economist	ORGANIZATION	Achieving sustainable competitive advantage and increasing the economic value of a firm in the 21st century's global economy will be a complex, challenging, and knowledge-based task. It can be thought of as revolving around the interplay of three basic forces: (a) a dynamic environment, filled with opportunities and threats, (b) an innovative and agile organizational system, and (c) strategic leadership whose role is to mediate between these two forces, to optimize existing processes and systems and, at the same time, to discover new opportunities and to capitalize on them. The purpose of this paper is to evidence the technology dimension of strategic leadership and to analyze new perspectives for production economics. We describe first the rules of the game in a dynamic and hypercompetitive environment. By examining the differences between leadership and management, it is possible, first to identify and understand the different roles of production economists and second to analyze the two most critical tasks of production economists: (a) as a manager, to optimize existing processes and systems, and (b) as a leader, to invent the future and to inspire people to work enthusiastically for achieving challenging goals. The message of the paper is that a comprehensive conceptual framework for integrating technology into strategic leadership increases the probability that a firm can achieve superior long-term performance.

J	Mitsuyasu, R				Mitsuyasu, R			Immune therapy: Non-highly active antiretroviral therapy management of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients	JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							DOSE SUBCUTANEOUS INTERLEUKIN-2; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL; HIV GENE-THERAPY; CD4(+) T-CELLS; HIV-1-INFECTED PATIENTS; VIRAL-SUPPRESSION; TREATMENT INTERRUPTIONS; DNA VACCINATION; IN-VITRO; TYPE-1	The complexity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunopathogenesis has prompted multiple strategic approaches to re-establish normal immune responses. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can control viral replication, but it is unable to restore HIV-specific immunity. Newer approaches for managing HIV infection are focusing on cell-mediated immune responses, including the potential for improved immunologic control over HIV replication. Cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12, are being evaluated for their ability to enhance cell-mediated immunity, which is thought to be critical for immunologic control. Initial studies with IL-2 have demonstrated an improvement in CD4 cell counts, and large randomized trials are underway to determine the long-term clinical efficacy of IL-2 in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including HAART. Stimulating the immune response against HIV by use of exogenous (therapeutic vaccination) or endogenous (structured treatment interruption) antigens with or without immune adjuvants or cytokines, such as IL-2, is another approach currently being explored.

J	Schwarz, M; Nandhakumar, J				Schwarz, M; Nandhakumar, J			Conceptualizing the development of strategic ideas: A grounded theory analysis	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATION; RESOURCES; KNOWLEDGE	This paper presents the findings of a grounded theory study on the development of strategic ideas in a multinational organization. By drawing on the rich data generated from this longitudinal in-depth field study, this paper provides a theoretical framework for the development of strategic ideas. The theoretical framework developed offers an interesting and useful way of understanding and explaining the complex process of the early steps of the strategic decision process. This research illustrates the development of strategic ideas through strategic debate, the key theme that emerged from the study and the interaction of its four constituent themes: strategic warriors, patterns of interaction, strategic language and strategic syntheses. Drawing on the empirical findings, this study also discusses some implications for developing strategic ideas in managerial practice.

J	Barry, M; Fourie, C				Barry, M; Fourie, C			Analysing cadastral systems in uncertain situations: a conceptual framework based on soft systems theory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								Based on experiences in South Africa, a conceptual framework is described which makes it possible to analyse how a cadastral system interacts with other land management sub-systems in volatile, changing situations. Soft systems theory, strategic management theory and existing cadastral theory underlie this framework. The soft systems approach, when applied to the cadastral field, makes it possible to move away from the conventional simplistic, hard interventionist, sub-system-focused design exercises and instead undertake holistic analyses of complex situations, which include human behaviour and a range of non-static land management sub-systems. It is also possible to analyse technical processes from different points of view, or contexts, over time, which facilitates more robust and sustainable cadastral systems' design and management.

The project sought to examine and compare the organisational processes adopted in different operating blocks, i.e. complex organisational units comprising many different actors whose performance often has a significant influence on the level of work of the overall structure. The organisational survey was carried out by means of interviews with head nurses, surgeons and anaesthetists. In order to identify the managerial significance of activities and processes, a theoretical model of the operating block was developed, together with an appropriate performance measurement system. On the basis of this model and using analytic hierarchy process, we together with experts from the sector were able both "to measure" the strategic importance of the activities and to identify the best practices.

This paper presents a cross-cultural analysis of a hybrid model of information systems success within the cultural context of North America and a former Soviet Republic, Latvia. The results of the analysis indicate that some of the factors that impact on managerial information system success have built-in value biases reflecting the value orientations of the culture in which they are developed.

J	Anderson, EG				Anderson, EG			Managing the impact of high market growth and learning on knowledge worker productivity and service quality	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						personnel; services; dynamic programming; control theory; system dynamics		Many high technology firms in the information technology, engineering, and internet content industries experience exponential growth but are also dependent on knowledge workers requiring extensive periods of training or apprenticeship. Under these conditions productivity management becomes a critical yet dynamically complex issue. This paper uses control theory techniques to dynamically solve this staffing problem at a strategic level. The novelty of this paper's formulation of the staffing problem lies in the use of time-discounting in combination with a special cost structure. The resulting optimal policy reflects the influence of both capacity shortfall and salary penalties. Under most real-world conditions, it will drive capacity and employment levels asymptotically towards a constant fractional shortfall. An illustration is presented using enterprise requirement planning (ERP) project implementers. One important managerial implication is that the interaction of extensive training requirements with market growth can cause firms to under-perform by delivering low levels of service at a high cost. Further this underperformance will escalate with increases in either market growth or training requirements. Finally, the paper puts this research into a framework with the experience curve and technology supply chain literatures to outline possible directions for future research.

J	Martinsons, MG; Everett, JE; Chan, K				Martinsons, MG; Everett, JE; Chan, K			Mapping the scholarly development of strategic management	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							BUSINESS POLICY SCHOLARS; POISSON ASSUMPTIONS; CITATION ANALYSIS; EMERGING FORUM; JOURNALS; MODEL; ECONOMICS; BEHAVIOR; VALIDITY; IMPACT	In an effort to move from speculative to scientific discourse, a key meta-issue in strategic management is addressed by systematically tracing the intellectual development of this sub-discipline. The flow of scholarly knowledge is mapped over time by combining multivariate statistics and other techniques. Observed citation frequencies are fitted to a chi-square model of importance, receptivity and similarity, while cluster analysis is employed to map changes in journal relationships over time. The results contradict at least one widely espoused and previously uncontested assertion, by revealing that the strategic management sub-discipline has evolved from a receptor to a transmitter of interdisciplinary knowledge and entered the mainstream of social science. The study demonstrates the potential to shed objective light on the social construction of knowledge and to address important issues in other scholarly disciplines.

J	Calori, R; Melin, L; Atamer, T; Gustavsson, P				Calori, R; Melin, L; Atamer, T; Gustavsson, P			Innovative international strategies	JOURNAL OF WORLD BUSINESS			English	Article							ORGANIZATION	The analysis of practitioners' narratives in four industries-cables and wires, paint, footwear chocolate, and sugar confectionery-shows that innovative international strategies drive the dynamics of international competition. The four industry case studies suggest an empirical classification of innovative international strategies based on four main dimensions: nature of the firm's competitive advantage, process of internationalization, segment scope, and level of coordination across borders. From these dimensions derive six types of innovative international strategies that change the rules of competition. The findings support a proactive view of economic development and strategic management This framework cart inspire decision makers in charge of crafting consistent and effective international strategies, as it shows that strategic choice can transform industry structure.

J	Hozier, GC; Schatzberg, JD				Hozier, GC; Schatzberg, JD			Advertising agency terminations and reviews: Stock returns and firm performance	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article							CLIENT RELATIONS; EVENT	A hey element in generating firm cash flows is the marketing strategy developed by a firm's advertising agency. This study examines both the stock market reaction and selected firm performance measures associated with Wall Street Journal announcements of advertising agency terminations and accounts placed in review (potential terminations). Besides finding a negative investor response to each event type, we report a significant decline in stock market values before such announcements. An examination of time series accounting data reveals a deterioration infirm sales growth before and after the announcement. Declines also occur in both liquidity and operating income. Our evidence is mixed regarding whether industry trends are responsible for these changes in financial position. We do not find an improvement infirm performance following the agency termination or potential termination. Strategic implications and directions for future-research are discussed.

KAGes has purchased a new hospital information system (HIS) for its hospitals. Within the strategic IT plan and the 'system structure new' (SSN) project, a methodology was developed for making an effective HIS purchase. Several steps of this project are described in the paper, request for product information, evaluation of vendor proposals, product presentations, test site evaluation, reference site visits and selection of vendor finalists. The authors present the internal project management methodology, including the structure of the project team, project information management through intranet, criteria for different steps of the evaluation and evaluation site organization. Four major HIS vendors with leading HIS products qualified for this stage of the project (evaluation site). About 60 teams with 400 members (end users and IT-experts) have assessed all the products installed, during one or more, repeated test sessions. The decision on which new HIS to purchase were based on the recommendations derived from this evaluation. After completing SSN-project with the suggestion to KAGes-top-management for negotiations with two vendor finalists, the new project named MEDOCS was started mid-1999. Two pilot installations (one general hospital and one teaching hospital department) are nowadays in the pilot implementation and subsequent roll-out (including substitution of the legacy system) is scheduled until the year 2003.

J	Gould, SJ				Gould, SJ			The state of IMC research and applications	JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING RESEARCH			English	Article								When Cornelissen and Lock offer us their criticism of IMC, they follow in a longstanding tradition of such criticism. While I heartily support their call for more research on IMC, I am far less approving of their dismissive attitude toward its role as a strategic tool. IMC, as a major strategic concept, is not that much different from other marketing and management tools, that in spite of their flaws and evolutionary transformations, nonetheless drive managerial behavior and provide frameworks for educating future managers. In stating what I see as the role of IMC in influencing a whole generation of marketing communications managers, I leave it to the reader to try and imagine what the field would be like without it.

A study of information technology, investments and manufacturing performance. Washington, DC: International Center for Information Technologies, Information Systems Research, 3(4), 307-333) work by categorizing IT investment into four types of management objectives: transactional, strategic, informational and threshold. The relationships between these management objectives and firm's role (defined in terms of traditional, evolving and strategic) are investigated through a questionnaire survey of managers in the service sector. As expected, firms adopting a traditional role seem to favor investment in transactional IT. However, there appears to be an increasing emphasis on strategic IT investment for all three types of firms, regardless of the role of ET. Implications of the results are discussed.

J	Czaban, L; Whitley, R				Czaban, L; Whitley, R			Incremental organizational change in a transforming society: Managing turbulence in Hungary in the 1990s	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article							TRANSITION; ECONOMY; PARTY	The rapid liberalization of the former state socialist economics of Eastern Europe coupled with privatization were thought Ly many in the early 1990s likely to generate effective capitalist firms quite quickly However, the radical institutional transformation and collapse of Soviet markets resulted in considerable uncertainty for most companies which, together with high sunk costs and lack of resources, inhibited organizational restructuring and strategic change. Despite high levels of foreign ownership and control by the mid-1990s, many Hungarian companies con; tinued to produce much the same kinds of products for mostly the same customers with inputs from mostly the same suppliers as in 1990. While most had reduced employment substantially and many had disposed of ancillary organizational units, the bulk of the companies considered here had not greatly altered their work systems and overall organizational structures. In the few enterprises where the production process had been extensively reorganized by 1996, this was funded and directed by foreign firms who had taken them over. These foreign firm-controlled companies also tended to have new top managers from outside the enterprise. They additionally introduced new products more often than Hungarian firms, albeit within rather narrow product lines that usually dominated the domestic market. Overall, most of the enterprises studied were still doing much the same set of activities in the mid-1990s, though with fewer staff, as at the start of the decade, and privatization per se had not led to major shifts in enterprise structure and strategy, nor did it seem likely to do so in the foreseeable future.

J	Tenhagen, BA; Birkelbach, E; Heuwieser, W				Tenhagen, BA; Birkelbach, E; Heuwieser, W			Serum progesterone levels in post-partum dairy cows after repeated application of the prostaglandin F-2 alpha analogue D (+) cloprostenol sodium	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE SERIES A-PHYSIOLOGY PATHOLOGY CLINICAL MEDICINE			English	Article							LUTEAL FUNCTION; UNOBSERVED ESTRUS; OVARIAN ACTIVITY; ENERGY-BALANCE; CORPUS-LUTEUM; CATTLE; MILK	Reproductive management programmes based on strategic use of prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) to induce and synchronize oestrus in post-partum dairy cows are widespread. Repeated shortening of the oestrous cycle during early lactation in high-yielding dairy cows, however, could impair corpus luteum function and thus decrease fertility. The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of repeated treatments with the prostaglandin F-2 alpha analogue D (+) cloprostenol sodium on progesterone concentrations indicative of a functional corpus luteum in post-partum dairy cows. Furthermore, the influence of milk production, parity and endometritis on progesterone concentrations under these circumstances were studied. Eighty-four cows of a commercial dairy operation were treated three to four times with D (+) cloprostenol sodium (Preloban(R); Hoechst Roussel Vet, Wiesbaden, Germany) at 14-day intervals, starting 22-28 days postpartum. Blood samples were collected prior to treatment 1 (sample 1) and 14 days after treatments 1, 2 and 3 (samples 2-4) and serum progesterone (P4) levels were determined. The percentage of cows with P4 levels < 1 ng/ml decreased from 51 % in sample 1 to 23 % in samples 3 and 4. More primiparous cows had low P4 levels 14 days after the second treatment than older cows (P < 0.05). Cows with low progesterone levels in sample 3 or 4 had lower protein contents in milk on the second milk test day postpartum and in their cumulative milk yield of the first 100 days of lactation. Clinical endometritis at postpartum examination did not influence progesterone levels after treatment with PGF(2 alpha). Repeated application of PGF(2 alpha) (more than twice) in the post-partum period does not influence serum progesterone levels 14 days after treatment. Failure to develop luteal tissue after treatment contributed to the conception failures after first service.

J	Yamaguchi, K				Yamaguchi, K			Power in mixed exchange networks: a rational choice model	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article								Using the logic of rational choice and extending the models of exchange introduced by Taylor and Coleman (1979) [Taylor, D.G., Coleman, J.S., 1979. Equilibrating process in social networks: a model for conceptualization and analysis. In: Holland, P.W., Leinhardt, S. (Eds.), Perspectives on Social Network Research. Academic Press, New York, pp. 257-300.] and Yamaguchi (1996) [Yamaguchi, K., 1996. Power in the network of substitutable/complementary exchange relations: a rational-choice model and an analysis of power centralization. American Sociological Review 61, 308-332.], this paper clarifies some major principles regarding the distribution of power in mixed exchange networks. Mixed exchange networks are exchange networks where both substitutability and complementarity exist among multiple exchange relations of an actor. Illustrative examples of 15 distinct dating networks consisting of two boys and two girls are used for the purpose of clarifying and applying those principles. General implications for both network studies and rational choice theories of the theory developed in this paper are also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Stroeken, JHM				Stroeken, JHM			Information technology, innovation and supply chain structure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information technology; supply chain innovation; process innovation; SMEs; supply chain integration and reversal		The link between IT, innovation and supply chain structure is central here. This article is divided into three parts. First, a theoretical analysis of the role of IT in innovation processes. Actually, it involves the total innovation of the supply chain, not merely logistic innovation. The introduction of IT first of all leads to process innovation (internal and external), followed by product innovation in the sense of more diverse, cheaper and customer specific products. Process innovation can best be described in terms of standardization, differentiation, specialization and (vertical and horizontal) integration. Furthermore, a presentation of the empirical results from the following sectors in the Netherlands: hairdressing, dentistry, building, banking, textile industry and car production. The supply chain classification underlying the analysis has been deduced from the composition and the functions of the actors in the supply chain. Supply chain integration and reversal are the central concepts. Finally, we will discuss the success conditions for innovation and the possible incentives, focussing especially on the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME). The conditions for success in IT, innovation and supply chain structure concern the extent of vertical and horizontal integration, the comparative importance of information, the extent of (international) pressure and innovative regulations, and, of great importance, the extent of strategic and organizational insight on the part of management and personnel.

J	Iacovou, CL				Iacovou, CL			The IPACS project: when IT hits the fan	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference on Information Systems	DEC 13-16, 1998	HELSINKI, FINLAND					This case summarizes a failed systems development project at Green Valley Hospital. The project was part of a large strategic information systems plan aiming to lower costs, improve the quality of patient care and re-engineer the hospital's operations. To implement the project, the president of the hospital selected a $5.9 million system by Ibax. The users, who felt that the selected system did not satisfy their needs, rejected it during the testing process. As a result, the project was abandoned 3 years after its initiation. This case describes the key factors and behaviours that led to the failure and invites readers to apply their project management and crisis management skills and creativity in managing the aftermath of the project's failure.

J	Minehart, D; Neeman, Z				Minehart, D; Neeman, Z			Termination and coordination in partnerships	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							DAMAGE MEASURES; BREACH; INTEGRATION; CONTRACT	It is common practice for firms to pool their expertise by forming partnerships such as joint ventures and strategic alliances. A central organization problem in such partnerships is that managers may behave noncooperatively in order to advance the interests of their parent firms. We ask whether contracts can be designed so that managers will maximize total profits. We characterize first best contracts for a variety of environments and show that efficiency imposes some restrictions on the ownership shares. In addition, we evaluate the performance of two termination contracts that are widely used in practice: the shotgun rule and price competition. We find that although these contracts do not achieve full efficiency, they both perform well. We provide insight into when each rule is more efficient.

J	Wilbon, AD				Wilbon, AD			An empirical investigation of technology strategy in computer software initial public offering firms	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technology management; technology strategy; R&D management; initial public offering (IPO); content analysis	TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVE STRATEGY; VENTURE PERFORMANCE; SALES GROWTH; POLICY; INNOVATION; MARKET; ENTRY; INFORMATION	Strategic management of technological resources plays a significant role in the success of firms in computer-related industries. To expand the literature on technology management in growing organizations, this paper presents a study of the relationships among select technology strategy dimensions and perceived performance of initial public offering (IPOs) computer software firms. Using content analysis, technology strategy data were collected from the prospectus of 31 computer software firms who committed IPOs in 1996. Empirical analysis shows support for propositions that a firm's technology posture and executive level technology experience influence investor reactions to IPOs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

A system dynamics model was built using regressions on business, system and productivity metrics coupled with business projections. The model generated expected demands for development, support and infrastructure rollout. IT management was provided with a dashboard of strategic factors that could be adjusted to determine the impact on workloads and productivity of the IT organization. Model outputs were judged acceptable by management for order-of-magnitude budget and planning estimates. More important, the exercise galvanized IT management's commitment to process improvements and architecture and focussed attention on human resource strategies. (C) 1999 Federal Express Corporation.

J	Morecroft, JDW				Morecroft, JDW			Management attitudes, learning and scale in successful diversification: a dynamic and behavioural resource system view	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						core business; corporate policy; diversification; dynamic resource system; multi-business investment decisions; portfolio management; resource-based view; system dynamics; simulation	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; PERFORMANCE; FIRM; FEEDBACK	The paper presents a system dynamics model to examine an enduring puzzle of corporate strategy. Why do extensive empirical studies continue to show a weak relationship between diversification and performance, despite persuasive arguments suggesting performance should improve? And why do well-intentioned executives seemingly turn a blind eye to the available empirical and anecdotal evidence that diversification rarely pays-off! Some diversification strategies go seriously wrong. Could it be that researchers and executives are misled by the complexity of dynamic multi-business investment decisions? The model draws on case material describing Goodyear's move out of its core tyre business into oil and gas in the late 1980s. Two versions of the model compare the fortunes and performance of hypothetical twin firms, FocusCo and DiversiCo, each facing an identical downturn in their traditional core business, and starting with identical levels of strategic resources. FocusCo invests strictly in its core business while DiversiCo has the option to invest in non-core business if managers view the performance of the core to be unsatisfactory. Simulations show how DiversiCo's success (relative to FocusCo) depends both on business fundamentals (real profitability and relative scale of the core and non-core) and behavioural traits of typical corporate investment policy covering target setting, managers' expectations, limited foresight, prior beliefs, optimism, confidence and learning style. There are some surprises such as the very long time delay in recognising clear winners, and counterproductive effects on performance of seemingly positive traits such as optimism and fast learning. The paper ends with comments on the implications of the results for practice and research.

J	Pilkington, A				Pilkington, A			Strategic alliance and dependency in design and manufacture - The Rover-Honda case	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						design; engineering; international business; joint ventures; manufacturing strategy	JOINT VENTURES	The movement of firms toward; joint ventures and collaborative projects has been a feature of the 1990s. Such agreements allow a means of spreading the costs and risks associated with new product development, sharing costly manufacturing capacity and facilities, and may also provide access to new capabilities. However there are examples when the relationship is not a success for one of the parties involved If firms enter joint ventures from a position of weakness or without a concerted strategy, they can become reliant on their partner. This was the case with Rover and its links to Honda Because of financial weakness Rover's design and manufacturing capabilities were eroded as the majority a its products were replaced with Honda developed models. This case provides important lessons and warnings Jar other firms seeking strategic alliances, and gives researchers an insight into the complex interaction between firms involved in such a relationship.

J	Dubow, JS; Childs, NM				Dubow, JS; Childs, NM			New Coke, mixture perception, and the flavor balance hypothesis	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL-MEASUREMENT; TASTE; SWEETNESS; INTENSITY; SUPPRESSION; INTEGRATION; SWEETENERS; STIMULI; SUCROSE; SODIUM	The Coca-Cola Company's 1985 decision to change the formula of Coca-Cola is examined in the context of "mixture perception"-that domain of psychophysics, which deals with the taste of substances in mixtures. The decision-making process at Coca-Cola is discussed, and the presence of an alternative strategy that was rejected is revealed-a "gradualist approach," which would have changed the formula in a series of small steps, without announcing the change. A working hypothesis that was involved (but never tested) to reject the gradualist approach is also revealed-the flavor balance hypothesis (FBH). The FBH asserted that, due to mixture perception, one of the physically small changes of the gradualist approach would be perceptually large and detectable. A test of the FBH using new Coke (aka Coke II) and the original formula (Coke classic) is reported. The results suggest that the FBH was invalid for Coke versus new Coke, and that The Coca-Cola Company could have successfully used the gradualist approach, unannounced.

It is also often the case that vendors specify minimum purchase quantities for physical (for example, packaging) or strategic reasons. When inventory systems recommend order quantities below the prescribed minimum, a decision must be made on whether or not to order. We describe how this environment can be modelled and employ an extensive factorial experiment involving a simulation to demonstrate situations in which a common simple 'rounding up' decision rule performs poorly, In this paper, we discuss financial implications and implementation issues.

J	Shepherd, A				Shepherd, A			Drought contingency planning: Evaluating the effectiveness of plans	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article							MANAGEMENT	This article reports results from a two-year research project to evaluate the effectiveness of drought contingency plans. The research developed a metalevel framework for evaluating plans before a drought. In addition, it applied this framework to an in-depth case study of a major metropolitan region, Atlanta, Georgia. This research discovered that drought plans have limited effectiveness when disconnected from larger scale and longer term planning. The requirement to prepare a plan does not necessarily invoke a substantive drought planning process. Disjointed local level plans, instead of coordinated planning effects, have limited ability to mitigate impacts in widespread drought. Because the faith placed in plans may be misplaced, metropolitan regions may be unwittingly poised for a disaster. Recommendations include stronger links between drought plans and drought planning, inclusion of stakeholders and agency expertise, mechanisms for interagency coordination, and improved integration between drought plans and strategic water resources plans.

J	Solnik, B				Solnik, B			Global asset management	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Currency risk is low in the long term, as exchange rates tend to revert to fundamentals over the very long run, but the contribution of currencies to the longterm performance of a global portfolio never gets to be nil. Currency risk premiums exist in the long run and are consistent with world market equilibrium and finance theory. The author argues that if the plan sponsor sets a benchmark for a very long-term horizon (say, fifty years), it should probably be unhedged as currency returns provide only a small, positive or negative, contribution to total return, while systematic currency hedging is a cumbersome process. If the plan sponsor has in mind a shorter strategic horizon (say, five years), the ideal currency allocation in the strategic benchmark is, and will remain, a question open to debate. Applying some universal hedging rule is questionable in the presence of the complex,correlation structure of stock prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. Finally, the author explains that if the plan sponsor believes in active management, currencies should be an integral part of the tactical asset allocation and security valuation process.

The literature on social relationships with institutions has been limited by the use of biased samples, simplistic measures and exclusion of patients unable to respond to verbal or written questionnaires. The methodological aspects of a whole network study of chronic care hospital patients are discussed with a particular emphasis on network sampling and non-response bias. The substantive aspects of the present analyses focus in the different patterns of relationships of patients, family and employees in a hospital setting. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Schneider, SA; Chen, VW; Pardo-Castellote, G; Wang, HH				Schneider, SA; Chen, VW; Pardo-Castellote, G; Wang, HH			ControlShell: A software architecture for complex electromechanical systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH			English	Article								Real-time system software is notoriously complex. Large projects must balance the special needs of real-time software-such as clock management, control systems, and strategy-with the needs of interacting teams of programmers, managers, and long-term maintenance personnel. Successful projects require a solid software architecture, an intuitive graphical programming paradigm, a well-developed reuse system, and powerful system services. This paper walks through the methodology and application of ControlShell, the component-based real-time programming system. ControlShell provides an integrated development environment for building complex electromechanical systems. II targets complex systems that require both cyclic data processing and strategic event management and sequencing. ControlShell is specifically designed to facilitate team development of complex electromechanical systems. Teams must share and reuse code; ControlShell provides component-level code sharing and reuse. Complex systems require flexibility; ControlShell gains flexibility by supporting independent module-level code generation. Large systems are most easily designed as independent parts; ControlShell encourages easy interconnectivity of objects. Finally, complex systems are modal; ControlShell features a unique configuration-control system for changing operating modes. The paper concludes by examining the application of this framework to a dual-arm robotic work cell, a subsystem of the Space Shuttle Launch Processing System, and an underwater autonomous vehicle.

Game-theoretic analysis predicts a different relationship between relative prices and backlog levels than does analysis that ignores the sorts of interactive considerations emphasized by game theory. Empirical analysis based on data for the U.S. market for large turbine generators between 1951 and 1963 corroborates the game-theoretic prediction.

After reviewing a simple static model of insurer solvency (in which all customers have inelastic demand), we present a one-period game in which both the buyers and sellers of insurance make strategic bids to determine market price and quantity. For the case in which both buyers and sellers are characterized by constant absolute risk aversion, we show that a unique market equilibrium exists under certain conditions. For the special case of risk-neutral insurers, we then consider how both the price and quantity of insurance, as well as other quantities of interest to public-policy decision makers, are affected by the number of insurance firms, the number of customers, and the total amount of capital provided by investors.

J	Oates, GL				Oates, GL			Self-esteem enhancement through fertility? Socioeconomic prospects, gender, and mutual influence	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; ATTITUDES; ADOLESCENTS; PARENTHOOD; PREGNANCY; CHILDREN; WOMEN	I analyze data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), using a LISREL model to examine whether having children influences one's self-esteem, whether the effect of children on self-esteem is stronger among the less socioeconomically privileged and among women, and whether there is evidence of mutual influence in the relationship between having children and self-esteem. I find that the number of children does not affect self-esteem, this holds true for both women and men, and for different socioeconomic groups. There is no evidence of nonlinearity in the relationship between number of children and self-esteem. Further, self-esteem does not affect whether men or women have children.

J	Patterson, JD; Allen, MW				Patterson, JD; Allen, MW			Accounting for your actions: How stakeholders respond to the strategic communication of environmental activist organizations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED COMMUNICATION RESEARCH			English	Article							IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT; LEGITIMACY; CRISIS	This study examined how stakeholders perceive the legitimacy of impression management strategies potentially used by environmental activist organizations following their ''illegitimate'' actions. ''Illegitimate'' actions are those which are seen as undesirable or violate societal norms. A sample of 150 individuals (50 activist organization members, 50 government officials, and 50 college students) completed a questionnaire containing four hypothetical scenarios describing ''illegitimate'' actions. Each scenario was followed by eight message strategies. Respondents rated the perceived legitimacy of each message strategy. Stakeholder groups differed significantly in how legitimate they thought the strategies of Bolstering, Diffusion of Responsibility, Denouncement, Justification, Aesthetisizing, Necessitating, Transcendence, and Intimidation were in accounting for the questionable actions. A significant difference due to level of severity was found for the justification strategy. Implications for environmental advocates as well as researchers interested in extending the organizational-level impression management literature and institutional theory are discussed.

J	Cousens, L				Cousens, L			From diamonds to dollars: The dynamics of change in AAA baseball franchises	JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRATEGIC CHANGE; ARCHETYPES	Sport franchises are challenged to operate within the fast-changing environment of the professional sport industry. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the extent to which these organizations are changing and to understand why some organizations have embraced the competitive strategies and institutional beliefs of their contemporary environment, while others have remained relatively unchanged. The concept of archetypes was used to create two templates for professional apart franchises: The sport-centered archetype and the business-centered archetype. Data were then collected from interviews with representatives of five AAA baseball franchises, documents were retained from the league's public relations firm and the franchises themselves, and information was assembled from newspapers and trade magazines. The results of the research indicated that one organization was in the sport-centered archetype. three were in the business-centered archetype, and one was between the two archetypes. It was found that a trigger for change and the ownership of the franchise impacted heavily on the ability of the franchises to adapt to their contemporary environment.

J	Karlberg, M				Karlberg, M			Testing transitivity in graphs	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							MODELS	The situation is considered whether a graph can be assumed to have been generated by a random model capturing more transitivity than a simple uniform model. Three different test quantities based on induced triad counts and local densities are used. A simulation study is made in order to estimate critical values of the tests for different significance levels. The powers of the tests are estimated against the Bernoulli triangle model, a simple random graph model in which the clustering and transitivity is higher than in the uniform model. The test based on the proportion of transitive triads has the highest power in most cases, but the test based on density difference (the difference between mean local density and overall graph density) is more powerful against models with high transitivity. The tests are applied to a large set of school class sociograms. In this situation, uniform randomness is rejected in favor of transitivity most frequently when the test based on the proportion of transitive triads out of the non-vacuously transitive triads is used. It is concluded that this test, which also performed reasonably well when applied to random data, is the best at detecting transitivity. Although the Bernoulli triangle model fits to the empirical data set better than the uniform model, there are fewer truly intransitive triads in the data than could be expected under either of the models.

J	Campos, JE; Pradhan, S				Campos, JE; Pradhan, S			Evaluating public expenditure management systems: An experimental methodology with an application to the Australia and New Zealand reforms	JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This article examines how institutional arrangements affect the size, allocation and use of public expenditures. It identifies a set of arrangements that can address underlying problems and affect three levels of expenditure outcomes-aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic prioritization, and technical efficiency in the use of resources. A diagnostic questionnaire is constructed which produces index values for each arrangement. This methodology is used to analyze the radical reforms introduced by New Zealand and Australia. The results show that New Zealand sought to achieve aggregate fiscal discipline and enhance technical efficiency through formal mechanisms for transparency and accountability. The Australian reforms sought to improve strategic prioritization through transparency of the medium-term costs of competing policies, and the devolution of detailed program decisions to line ministries within hard budgets.

We provide an axiomatic system in first-order logic that derives the theory's predictions as theorems from a set of underlying assumptions. First-order logic is widely seen as a standard language for the formalization of scientific theories; it couples considerable expressive power with acceptable computational properties. Our axiomatization increases the understanding on the scope and the limits of Organization Ecology, and yields a consistent theory of propagation strategies with a sound explanatory structure.

This region is experiencing a strong economic growth and technological development with a view to maintaining the competitiveness of its firms. The major problem is to formulate a strategic framework for future technology development and transfer taking into account both external and internal factors in countries of the ASEAN. The literature available is reviewed with a view to developing a suitable model for technology development and transfer. The model is illustrated with the help of the experiences obtained from Malaysia on technology development and transfer. A list of strategic options is discussed for effective transfer of technology to developing countries from Malaysian perspectives.

J	Duquenne, V				Duquenne, V			On lattice approximations: Syntactic aspects	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Annual International Sunbelt Social Networks Conference	1992	SAN DIEGO, CA					Lattice theory and Galois lattices can help in formalizing the sharing of properties by subjects, together with the corresponding group intersections, by means of a well-known-since the early 1970s - duality which formalizes intensional/extensional approaches, as well as implication models, by means of another natural lattice/implications duality. As Galois lattices may grow exponentially, this construction calls for some approximation procedures, for which we suggest making homomorphic reductions by constructing (sub-)-semilattices, which can be defined by revising the original lattice by an extra list of 'quasi-implications' that are contradicted by only a few counter-examples in the original data. These claims and procedures are illustrated on a classic example of network theory with some appropriate outputs from our graphic program GLAD.

J	White, DR				White, DR			Statistical entailments and the Galois lattice	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Annual International Sunbelt Social Networks Conference	1992	SAN DIEGO, CA					Statistical entailment analysis (White, 1984; White and McCann, 1988 Social Structures: Form and Behaviour in Social Life) (Cambridge University Press) pp. 380-404) aims first at a rigorous evaluation of null hypotheses of statistical independence as a potential source of binary data structure, and second at constructing a discrete structure (Boolean) model of those statistical interactions that remain when the null hypothesis is rejected for particular subsets of variables. Signal detection theory, rather than a conventional significance level, is used to specify optimal cutoffs given an ordering of ratios of actual to expected across levels of exception and relevance. Bivariate entailment analysis is generalized here to improve its utility for use in lattice approximation. Generalized statistical entailment analysis describes Boolean patterns in a set of data in terms of those that occur with greater frequency than expected by chance according to a model of complete statistical independence (the specific model of independence derives from a distribution of randomly permuted entries in the columns of the data matrix marginals, i.e. keeping univariate marginals fixed). This expands on the initial design of entailment analysis (White, 1984) to deal with partial orders of quasi-implication in pairs or chains of dichotomous variables, supported by statistical evidence of departure from bivariate independence and conformity to the rules of transitivity. Statistical approximations simplify a lattice representation of discrete structure by forcing quasi-implications (ignoring exceptions), for example, but they also provide information about those implications in the lattice that represent statistically significant tendencies. Given a lattice representing the discrete structure of a raw data matrix, the findings of entailment analysis describe additional structural regularities (tendencies towards further statistical constraints on Boolean patterns that occur in the data) that can be used to simplify (by approximation) the lattice of empirical patterns. As demonstrated with studies of dual orderings of material possessions (possessions stratify people; people possessions), the statistical interpretability of discrete structure lattices is enhanced by using the results of entailment analysis for cansensus-simplification of statistically strong or significant implicational relations.

J	Blau, JR				Blau, JR			Organizations as overlapping jurisdictions: Restoring reason in organizational accounts	ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY			English	Article								As Stern and Barley suggest, what is social about organizations is currently undertheorized given the aspatial character of administration and financing, reliance on external labor markets, and the global character of production and distribution. Nevertheless, organizations are social entities and deal with social accounts that accompany and supplement their legal responsibilities and rights. The concept of ''jurisdictions'' provides a framework for considering organizations' social character in the context of the contemporary economy, while relying on insights from classical theorists..

It has thus become important for researchers to better understand how these firms adopt and implement new technologies. This paper presents a case study analysis of the technology adoption decision in 14 Canadian enterprises. Based on an analytical framework comprising 85 factors regrouped into 18 variables, three distinct profiles are identified in terms of strategic advantage, technological expertise, the decision-making process and organizational capabilities. These results confirm that thew is no 'one best' strategy of technological change for SMEs.

J	MARSH, I; GALBRAITH, L				MARSH, I; GALBRAITH, L			THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF THE SYDNEY GAY AND LESBIAN MARDI-GRAS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article								This paper evaluates the political impact of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, now in its fifteenth year. The paper summarises the evolution of Mardi Gras from a protest march into a month long festival, culminating in a street parade. It traces the development of governance and organisational arrangements. The impact of this event in five contexts is then discussed: the political consciousness and organisational mobilisation of the gay and lesbian community; public attitudes; the major political centres; and the state. In particular the evolution of relations with the NSW state government, at political and executive levels, and with the police is reviewed. The paper concludes Mardi Gras has played a pace-setting role in each context. The success of Mardi Gras, at least in terms of attracting public attention, does however create new strategic challenges for its sponsors.

J	JEGER, MJ; CHAN, MS				JEGER, MJ; CHAN, MS			THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF EPIDEMICS - USES OF ANALYTICAL MODELS TO MAKE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT DECISIONS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PHYTOPATHOLOGIE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Congress of Plant Pathology	JUL 28-AUG 06, 1993	MONTREAL, CANADA					The uses of modelling in predicting and understanding plant disease epidemics have diversified and changed in emphasis in response to theoretical advances and in appreciation of practical constraints. A case is made in this paper for the relevance of theoretical models to strategic disease management decisions. Mathematical analysis of systems of equations describing different categories of disease (e.g. latent, infectious and post-infectious) allows predictions of the eventual size of an epidemic (e.g. final disease intensity), determination of criteria for an epidemic to occur, and the likely impact of a control practice on the epidemic. These ideas are illustrated with respect to theoretical models of plant virus disease epidemics subjected to management interventions involving: planting with isolation distances; and roguing of diseased plants with replanting of healthy ones. Conclusions are related to data obtained from the literature for four plant virus diseases, cocoa swollen shoot, plum pox, citrus tristeza, and banana bunchy top, although in each case the kinds and availability of epidemiological data may limit the uses of theoretical models.

PBM is a method well-suited to support managers in their strategic decision-making processes, in particular in the field of operations management, because it provides support in dealing with both the technical and organizational complexities of strategic decision making. Presents a case study where PBM was used to assist in the development of a European logistics strategy for an American pharmaceutical firm setting up operations in Europe. Discusses findings from the analysis of the evaluation interviews with project participants, which contain valuable lessons, not just for the PBM method itself, but also for the theory of strategic decision making that lies at the base of the PBM method.

The analysis is based on a simple framework in which policymakers are concerned about inflation and external competitiveness. Price setters in the nontradable sector of the economy engage in a strategic game against the authorities. The model generates a 'devaluation bias' which undermines the credibility of a fixed exchange rate. The role of reputational factors, signaling considerations, and joining a currency union as possible solutions to this bias is examined.

J	COMER, DR				COMER, DR			A CASE AGAINST WORKPLACE DRUG-TESTING	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						DRUG TESTING; PRIVACY; EMPLOYEE ATTITUDES	JOB-PERFORMANCE; ATTITUDES; EMPLOYEES; MARIJUANA; OUTCOMES; COCAINE; BLACK; WORK; RACE	Workplace drug testing, particularly urinalysis, has proliferated in the last few years. Despite widespread support for biological testing, research suggests that not all drug use diminishes performance and that testing may fail to deter the most potentially harmful substance abuse. There is no solid empirical evidence that drug testing is associated with enhanced organizational productivity and safety, and findings that persons who fail drug tests are inferior workers may be rooted in ethnic discrimination. Further, because drug testing detects exposure to a drug but cannot assess an individual's ability to perform, it is an inappropriate gauge for judging the suitability of employees or applicants. Drug tests may violate current and prospective employees' right to privacy and, according to a growing body of literature, may adversely affect their work attitudes and behaviors. Skills testing, which assesses employees' performance fitness less intrusively, is discussed as an alternative to biological testing.

Facilitating the implementation of customer-based inter-organizational systems: an empirical analysis of innovation and support factors	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						implementation success; inter-organizational systems; organizational innovation; strategic information systems; support factors; survey		Inter-organizational systems, which represent the majority of competitive information systems, have received increasing attention from researchers. This study focuses on the implementation of customer-based inter-organizational systems (CIOS). A model is constructed and tested, based on literature in IS implementation and organizational innovation. Data from 73 organizations who have implemented such systems are gathered through a questionnaire. Two classes of independent variables, innovation factors and support factors, are examined for their influence on CIOS implementation success. While no innovation factors emerge as important, support factors, such as customer training and top management support, are found to significantly facilitate successful implementation of such systems. Implications for research and practice are discussed.	[Grover, V.; Teng, T.

J	WEAKLIEM, D				WEAKLIEM, D			CLASS-CONSCIOUSNESS AND POLITICAL-CHANGE - VOTING AND POLITICAL-ATTITUDES IN THE BRITISH WORKING-CLASS, 1964 TO 1970	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article							STABILITY; BLACK; WHITE; MODEL	Most research suggests that changes in political preferences and public opinion are similar for all social groups. I investigate the possibility that prior views of the world, or ''ideology, '' affect responses to new information, and hence changes in opinion. I focus on one type of ideology, levels of class consciousness, using data from opinion surveys of British manual workers in the election years of 1964, 1966, and 1970. Results from a latent class model indicate that changes in political and economic opinions vary with degree of class consciousness. Workers who identified with the working class but held negative attitudes toward unions became considerably more pessimistic about economic conditions and the policies of the Labour Party. This group's behavior may represent either instrumentalism or a perceived conflict between the interests of the working class and the interests of society as a whole. These results cast doubt on conventional views of the relationship between workers' economic interests and support for parties of the left.

J	FRANCIS, A				FRANCIS, A			THE PROCESS OF NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL REGENERATION AND COMPETITIVENESS	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						COMPETITIVENESS; NEOINSTITUTIONALISM; PROCESS; STRATEGY		The paper reviews two streams of work on the issue of industrial regeneration and competitiveness-that from within the management research field, and that from economists, economic historians, and political scientists. It is argued that these streams have in the past been independent but there is much to be gained by sharing insights from each and applying them to the process within firms of generating competitiveness for that firm. By using insights from the newly emerging institutionalist school it is possible both to explain national differences in competitiveness and generate useful ideas for the managers of individual firms. The paper ends by setting out a research agenda, applying the insights from institutional analysis, for furthering our understanding of the strategic processes available to managers for regenerating and enhancing the competitiveness of the individual firm.

Building on the assumptions that relative ROA and sales growth are valid indicators of competitive position and industry attractiveness, this study examines whether an investment strategy that is consistent with prescriptions from the general portfolio model is associated with excess returns to shareholders. Evidence reported in this study indicates that this strategy is actually associated with subpar returns to shareholders. The implications of this finding for scholars and managers are discussed			SLATER, SF (corresponding author), UNIV COLORADO,COLL BUSINESS & ADM,DEPT STRATEG MANAGEMENT & MKT,POB 7150,COLORADO SPRINGS,CO 80933, USA.

The 766 abstracts were classified into a series of strategic categories to identify their contribution to specific phases of the Strategic Planning process. A functional classification was used to indicate the key issue or type of problem involved. Industry, publication date, and publication source were also considered. To identify potential application areas for the MS tools, beyond those found in this sample, a gap analysis was performed using Reisman's methodology for finding researchable topics.

The modeling of optimal behavior under such conditions is the subject of noncooperative game theory, of which a cornerstone is Harsanyi's formulation of games of incomplete information. In an incomplete-information game, uncertainty may surround the attributes as well as the strategic intentions of opposing players. Harsanyi develops the concept of a Bayesian equilibrium, which is a Nash equilibrium of a game in which the players' reciprocal beliefs about each others' attributes are consistent with a common prior distribution, as though they had been jointly drawn at random from populations with commonly-known proportions of types. The relation of such game-theoretic solution concepts to subjective probability theory and nonstrategic decision analysis has been controversial, as reflected in critiques by Kadane and Larkey and responses from Harsanyi, Shubil, and others, which have appeared in this journal. This paper shows that the Bayesian equilibrium concept and common prior assumption can be reconclied with a subjective view of probability by (i) supposing that players elicit each other's probabilities and utilities through the acceptance of gambles, and (ii) invoking a multi-agent extension of de Finetti's axiom of coherence (no arbitrage opportunities, a.k.a. "Dutch books"). However, the Nash property of statistical independence between players is weakened, and the probability distributions characterizing a solution of the game admit novel interpretations.

J	DUNIVAN, L				DUNIVAN, L			IMPLEMENTING A USER-DRIVEN HUMAN-RESOURCE INFORMATION-SYSTEM	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Today, 30 years after computers were first adopted into the everyday operations of organizations, many human resource (HR) departments have yet to fully realize the benefits of IT. Compared to departments with direct profit/loss responsibilities, HR has come late to the party. There are two main reasons HR has been slow to apply computerization to its operations: 1) until recently, most HR systems have been difficult for non-technical professionals to understand and use, and 2) management has not viewed HR as being strategic to the organization's business objectives. This article discusses how the involvement of HR professionals in the development and implementation of HRISs can result in a more efficient and effective HR function.

J	D'Angelo, A; Ryan, L				D'Angelo, Alessio; Ryan, Louise			The presentation of the networked self: Ethics and epistemology in social network analysis	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							POLISH MIGRANTS; REFLEXIVITY; APPRENTICESHIP; MODEL	Drawing on the seminal work of Goffman, Krackhardt and others, this paper argues that there is a crucial step in between participants' perceptions and the collection and visualisation of data - i.e. what we call the presentation of the networked self. We employ examples from our own empirical work in the UK to argue that the presentation of the networked self requires researchers to adopt a highly reflexive approach. Framing our analysis within the context of contemporary society - including the impact of social media on a 'networking mindset' - we explore the range of ethical dilemmas which can emerge during a research encounter.

A comprehensive library of exchange-correlation functionals, along with a suite of correlated many-body methods, continues to be a hallmark of the Q-Chem software. The many-body methods include novel variants of both coupled-cluster and configuration-interaction approaches along with methods based on the algebraic diagrammatic construction and variational reduced density-matrix methods. Methods highlighted in Q-Chem 5 include a suite of tools for modeling core-level spectroscopy, methods for describing metastable resonances, methods for computing vibronic spectra, the nuclear-electronic orbital method, and several different energy decomposition analysis techniques. High-performance capabilities including multithreaded parallelism and support for calculations on graphics processing units are described. Q-Chem boasts a community of well over 100 active academic developers, and the continuing evolution of the software is supported by an "open teamware" model and an increasingly modular design.

J	Behnam, M; Hollebeek, LD; Clark, MK; Farabi, R				Behnam, Mohsen; Hollebeek, Linda D.; Clark, Moira K.; Farabi, Reza			Exploring customer engagement in the product vs. service context	JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES			English	Article						Customer engagement; Customer cocreation; Relationship quality; Customer learning; Customer knowledge sharing; Goods; services; Sports		Though customer engagement (CE) is heralded as a strategic organizational imperative, empirically derived insight into its nomological network remains sparse. Extending existing research, we therefore test service dominant logic-informed CE vis-`a-vis its key antecedents of knowledge sharing and learning, and its consequences of customer cocreation and relationship quality. We also envisage the existence of CE-based differences across physical goods (versus service) contexts, leading us to include the nature of the offering (good vs. service) as a moderating factor in our model, making a novel contribution. To test the model, a survey was conducted in the tangible sports goods (i.e., sports retail) and-service (i.e., sports club) contexts. The findings substantiate a positive effect of customer learning and knowledge sharing on CE, thus empirically validating conceptual literature-based claims. In addition, CE was found to exert a favorable effect on customer cocreation and relationship quality. Moreover, the results confirm our hypothesized moderating effect by revealing the framework?s stronger associations for service-(vs. product-based) CE. We conclude by discussing key implications that arise from our analyses.

J	Kumar, P; Singh, RK				Kumar, Pravin; Singh, Rajesh Kumar			Strategic framework for developing resilience in Agri-Food Supply Chains during COVID 19 pandemic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Agri-Food Supply Chains; COVID-19; Resilience; Best-Worst Method; Quality Function Deployment; Supply chain strategies		The Agri-food Supply Chains (AFSC) dealing with perishable items have suffered a lot due to the COVID 19 pandemic. During this uncertain time, developing resiliency has become a priority for management. Therefore, the main purpose of the study is to explore the impact of COVID-19 on AFSC and the possible strategies for improving the resilience of the AFSC. Impacts on AFSC and possible strategies are explored through the literature review and experts' opinions. The importance rating of impacts of COVID-19 on AFSC is determined using the Best-Worst Method (BWM). These impacts are further correlated with the strategies for improving the resilience of AFSC using Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The findings of the study will help farmers, food processors, distributors, and retailers to maintain the uninterrupted flow of food items from farmers to end-users during the uncertain business environment. It will also contribute to formulating effective policies by the government and other stakeholders for improving the resilience of AFSCs.

J	Tykkylainen, S; Ritala, P				Tykkylainen, Saila; Ritala, Paavo			Business model innovation in social enterprises: An activity system perspective	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Social enterprise; Business model innovation; Process; Activity-based approach; Activity system	OF-THE-ART; HYBRID ORGANIZATIONS; ENTREPRENEURIAL PROCESSES; MISSION DRIFT; CHALLENGES; CONTEXTS; TENSIONS	Social enterprises aim to create both social and financial value, requiring the creation of business models that allow both objectives to be pursued simultaneously. However, the tensions between these objectives can make this a challenging task in terms of issues such as mission drift and commercial failure. Our multiple case study of seven social enterprises operating in Finland examines business model innovation in social enterprises from an activity system perspective to identify different patterns of activity through which social and financial goals are developed, discarded, and reconfigured. We find that the process involves variety of hybrid logics, with both sequential and parallel combinations of social and financial value, as well as gradual and discontinuous progressions. The findings also provide evidence of how social and financial goals guide the strategic framing of the business model in social enterprises by setting mutually constraining boundary conditions, restricting or guiding opportunities for business model innovation.

J	Lei, YW				Lei, Ya-Wen			Delivering Solidarity: Platform Architecture and Collective Contention in China's Platform Economy	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						platform economy; labor control; collective action; grievance; gig platform; technology; law; China		This study examines how and when labor control and management leads to collective resistance in China's food-delivery platform economy. I develop the concept of "platform architecture" to examine the technological, legal, and organizational aspects of control and management in the labor process and the variable relationships between them. Analyzing 68 in-depth interviews, ethnographic data, and 87 cases of strikes and protests, I compare the platform architecture of service and gig platforms and examine the relationship between their respective architecture and labor contention. I argue that specific differences in platform architecture diffuse or heighten collective contention. Within the service platform, technological control and management generates work dissatisfaction, but the legal and organizational dimensions contain grievances and reduce the appeal of, and spaces for, collective contention. Conversely, within the gig platform, all three dimensions of platform architecture reinforce one another, escalating grievances, enhancing the appeal of collective contention, and providing spaces for mobilizing solidarity and collective action. As a result, gig platform couriers are more likely to consider their work relations exploitative and to mobilize contention, despite facing higher barriers to collective action due to the atomization of their work.

In this context, industrial production processes are changing thanks to the development of green strategies. The selection of a new production solution is a crucial strategic decision and the introduction of new technologies could cause deep changes to the entire supply chain configuration. This paper introduces a new approach designed to understand the importance of supply chain considerations for a suitable technology assessment. It is aimed at proposing a quantitative model for the evaluation of different structure of supply chains based on different production technologies. In particular, by defining a set of Key Performance Indicators and applying a multi-criteria decision method, a final score is computed, giving important information about both environmental and economic aspects. A numerical example regarding the comparison between Additive and Traditional Manufacturing processes is presented in order to demonstrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that additive solutions bring evident reduction in Carbon Emission and better supply chain and logistics performance. Anyway, production volume strongly influences the economic results and the competitiveness of additive manufacturing remains limited when compared to the traditional manufacturing.

Strategic antecedents of innovation: Variance between small and large firms	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIUM; MARKET-STRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; MICROFOUNDATIONS; ARCHITECTURE; EXPLORATION	Our study explores differences in enhancing innovation based on firm size. Framed through the resource-based view, we theorize and test antecedents of innovation including dynamic capabilities, strategic planning, and organizational structure. We operationalize firm size based on number of employees and also include firm revenues as an alternative proxy. We find that dynamic capabilities partially support innovation in both small and large firms. Secondly, we find strategic planning is valuable for small firm innovation and that organizational structure has a positive effect on large firm innovation. Results are largely consistent when comparing number of employees to revenues.

The Organizational Improvisation Landscape: Taking Stock and Looking Forward	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						organizational improvisation; organizational learning; innovation; entrepreneurship	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE; VENTURE PERFORMANCE; JAZZ IMPROVISATION; DECISION-SUPPORT; SOCIAL BRICOLAGE; PRODUCT; MARKET; MODEL; BEHAVIOR	Over the past 25 years, scholars have produced a wide variety of organizational improvisation (OI) scholarship from multiple fields that has improved our understanding of the OI phenomenon. However, because of its complexity and the heterogeneity of approaches used to study it, OI remains challenging to grasp. This makes it difficult for scholars to understand the contributions of this literature both in terms of extant findings as well as potential gaps and future areas of inquiry. Accordingly, we take stock of the extant literature by reviewing 186 peer-reviewed scholarly articles on OI primarily from management and related fields such as entrepreneurship and marketing as well as other disciplines such as information systems and communications. We introduce an aggregate framework that emphasizes the sequential process of OI. We also identify specific theoretical and associated empirical gaps in each of the pre-, during, and post-phases of an OI episode. We specifically address questions surrounding the origination and content of initial improvisational actions, conceptual ambiguity regarding the prevalence of OI, and the confounding of causal factors that impact the outcomes following an OI episode.

The objective of this research was to evaluate whether the adoption of CPP by large textile industries (LTI) has a positive effect on economic, environmental and operational performance. The research method adopted was expert analysis, survey application in more than 100 companies, with data analysis established on structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing and Pearson correlation analysis of the variables. It was determined that the adoption of CPP improved the operational, environmental and economic performance of the LTI. This research innovates the state of the art because it measures the impact of the adoption of CPP on operational, environmental and economic performance in LTI; It is concluded that the main performance of LTI is to meet the supply needs of the global market, and it is important to accept environmental intervention in decisions through CPP adoption, in addition to communicating to stakeholders about the positive results to promote green marketing in terms of environmental responsibility to gain competitive advantage. It is also concluded that LTI shareholders could establish strategic planning with goals and communication to stakeholders about the performance improvements obtained through CPP adoption in terms of increased productivity and product quality, improvements in worker health and safety, water reuse, minimization of waste, reduction of environmental accidents and replacement of toxic materials. With this, the adoption of CPP is a relevant way to conquer the natural monopoly, aiming to guarantee the purchase contract with captive customers and obtain government subsidies.

In our study of the introduction of an algorithmic technology in a sales organization, we found that such symbolic conformity led unintendedly to the full implementation of the suggested technological change. To explain this surprising outcome, we advance a regime-of-knowing lens that helps to analyze deep challenges happening under the surface during the process of technology introduction. A regime of knowing guides what is worth knowing, what actions matter to acquire this knowledge, and who has the authority to make decisions around those issues. We found that both the technologists who introduced the algorithmic technology, and the incumbent workers whose work was affected by the change, used symbolic actions to either defend the established regime of knowing or to advocate a radical change. Although the incumbent workers enacted symbolic conformity by pretending to comply with suggested changes, the technologists performed symbolic advocacy by presenting a positive side of the technological change. Ironically, because the symbolic conformity enabled and was reinforced by symbolic advocacy, reinforcing cycles of symbolic actions yielded a radical change in the sales' regime of knowing: from one focused on a deep understanding of customers via personal contact and strong relationships, to one based on model predictions fromthe processing of large datasets. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for the introduction of technology at work and for knowing in the workplace.

The design of a hazardous waste management system involves several important decisions, i.e., the determination of the locations and sizes of treatment, recycling and disposal facilities, and organizing the transportation of hazardous waste among different facilities. In this paper, we proposed a novel stochastic bi-objective mixed integer linear program (MILP) to support these decisions in order to reduce the population exposure to risk while simultaneously maintaining a high cost efficiency of the transportation and treatment of hazardous waste. Moreover, considering the inherent uncertainty within the planning horizon, the cost, demand and affected population are defined as stochastic parameters. A sample average approximation based goal programming (SAA-GP) approach is used to solve the mathematical model. The proposed model and solution method are validated through numerical experiments whose results show that uncertainty may not only affect the objective value but also lead to different strategic decisions in the network design of a hazardous waste management system. In this regard, the strategic decisions obtained by the stochastic model is more robust to the change of external environment. Finally, the model is applied in a real-world case study of healthcare waste management in Wuhan, China, in order to show its applicability. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The role of internationalization in enhancing the innovation performance of Chinese EMNEs: A geographic relational approach	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Emerging countries; China; Innovation performance; Internationalization; Geographic relational approch	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; EMERGING MARKET MULTINATIONALS; FIRM SIZE; CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; LOCATION CHOICES; OUTWARD FDI; KNOWLEDGE; SUBSIDIARIES; EXPANSION; ENTRY	In attempting to integrate theory on developed and emerging countries, prior research has focused on the antecedents of specific internationalization decisions of Emerging Multinational Enterprises (EMNEs) rather than conceptualizing internationalization as a recurring process. This approach limits the understanding of the ways through which different internationalization paths lead to different performance outcomes. Using a geographic relational approach and a portfolio-level analysis, we demonstrate that the ability of Chinese EMNEs to increase innovation performance is driven by how and where they choose to internationalize over time. Our framework resolves these two strategic choices into six dimensions; namely, entry mode, geographic breadth and depth, cultural and institutional distance, and the economic state of the host country. Accordingly, it explains the geographic relational mechanisms through which these six dimensions influence the benefits and challenges of internationalization and, in turn, innovation performance. Results show that Chinese EMNEs improve their innovation performance where they have a portfolio of subsidiaries that (1) is built through M&As (rather than greenfield investments), (2) is distributed across multiple countries (rather than located in fewer locations), (3) is distant from home in terms of culture (but not in terms of institutions), and (4) is located in emerging (rather than developed) countries, although M&As perform better in developed countries.

A robust two-stage integer non-linear program is developed. The primary goal tends to reduce the waste production. The generated waste should be preferably recycled as much as possible and the resultant residual waste might be used for energy recovery. Only some waste residues are appropriate for landfilling. The aim is to propose the near-optimal waste allocation for its suitable processing as well as waste transportation plan at an operational level. In addition, the key strategical decisions on waste treatment facilities location must be made. Since waste production is very often hard to predict, it is modeled as an uncertain decision-dependent quantity. To support the circular economy ideas, advertising and pricing principles are introduced and applied. Due to the size of available real-world data and complexity of the designed program, the presented model is linearized and uncertainty is handled by a robust optimization methodology. The model, data, and algorithm are implemented in MATLAB and Julia, using the state-of-the-art solvers. The computational result is a set of decisions providing a trade-off between the average performance and the immunization against the worst-case conditions.

Like rural areas in many countries, Chinese rural society is experiencing a decline in all spheres due to depopulation, aging, lack of economic opportunity, and so on. Aiming at solving the serious rural issues, China proposed the implementation of a rural revitalization strategy and the promotion of an integrated urban-rural development for the first time in 2017. This proposal marks the transformation of the urban-rural relationship, and the integrated urban-rural development reflects a significant conceptual change. Researches on issues of rural decline are urgently needed to determine the most effective method for rural revitalization and development from the perspective of the urban-rural dynamics. In this context, this paper focuses on studying the theory, technology and management of rural revitalization and development. We construct a theoretical framework for urban-rural integration based on population-land-industry-right between the urban and rural systems, regarding land engineering for land capacity building as the technical support and the rural land system reform and reconstruction as the policy support for management. This research will provide theoretical support for the implementation of China's rural revitalization strategy.

We shift attention to an indirect process we call "portfolio spillover"-the extent to which activist behavior targeted toward a firm in an investor's portfolio of holdings influences actions by other firms that are not presently targeted for activism. We examine portfolio spillover by extending the awareness-motivation-capability framework from its traditional domain of competitive dynamics to the governance arena. We theorize that firms will be more likely to respond to investors targeting other portfolio members to the extent that those firms become aware of the implicit threat of activism. We also develop and test theory about how the capability of activists to launch a successful campaign and the motivation of firms to react can moderate this relationship. Using data from a sample of S&P 1500 companies from 2000-2013, we find that firms restructure and reduce growth in response to portfolio spillover. These relationships are stronger when activist investors have capability to attack and firms have motivation to respond.

Drawing on the literature of information systems and marketing, complemented with data-driven methods, we propose a number of visual and textual content features including complexity, similarity, and consistency measures that can play important roles in the persuasiveness of social media content. We then employ state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as deep learning and text mining to operationalize these new content features in a scalable and systematic manner. For the newly developed features, we validate them against human coders on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies with a large social media dataset from Tumblr to show the effectiveness of the proposed content features. The first case study demonstrates that both theoretically motivated and data-driven features significantly improve the model's power to predict the popularity of a post, and the second one highlights the relationships between content features and consumer evaluations of the corresponding posts. The proposed research framework illustrates how deep learning methods can enhance the analysis of unstructured visual and textual data for social media research.

Recalibrating pandemic risk leadership: Thirteen crisis ready strategies for COVID-19	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						COVID-19; leadership; risk management; risk communication; crisis communication; crisis management; strategy	ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; SOCIAL MEDIA; COMMUNICATION; TRANSPARENCY; NARRATIVES; EVOLUTION; EBOLA; TIMES; VIEW	Good leadership is widely regarded as a crucial component of risk and crisis management and remains an enduring theme of more than 40 years of inquiry into emergencies, disasters, and controversies. Today, the question of good leadership has come under the spotlight again as a key factor shaping how successfully nations have dealt with the COVID-19 global health crisis. Amidst plummeting levels of public trust, the worst recession of the G7, and the highest death toll in Europe, the UK's pandemic leadership response has faced especially stern accusations of incompetence and culpability for what has been described as the most catastrophic science policy failure for a generation. Addressing these issues, this paper argues for the adoption of a more pluralised UK leadership approach for handling COVID-19. Particularly, it is contended that as COVID-19 is a multifaceted problem that presents many varied and distributed challenges, UK leadership should employ a differentiated range of strategic mechanisms and processes to help improve substantive understandings and decision-making, support collective resilience, and build adaptive capacities as the crisis continues. The paper accordingly identifies and elaborates thirteen strategies, drawing on lessons and insights from the risk and crisis management field, that are proposed to serve as a useful heuristic to help guide UK pandemic leadership in this endeavour. To illustrate the value and application of each strategy, examples are provided of noteworthy leadership responses to COVID-19 observed internationally thus far, as well as leadership problems that have hampered the UK's pandemic response. In conclusion, it is suggested that in as far as the conduct expected of leaders during a pandemic, or any other crisis, should maintain and be reflective of democratic values and standards of legitimacy, these strategies may also provide broadly applicable normative criteria against which leadership performance in handling COVID-19 may be judged as crisis ready.

As a consequence, a 'Decade of Action' was certified by the UN in 2016 to promote the need to end all types of malnutrition. Within food security objectives, this study evaluates the possibility to maximise the nutritional value of agricultural output through the optimal allocation of water and energy resources. Using a hypothetical case study in Qatar, two complementary multi-objective mathematical models are developed to solve various scenarios. Firstly, the goal programming minimises the expected value of negative deviation from the desired target in food groups and nutrients. Secondly, the linear programming model increases the expected value of self-sufficiency percentage in food groups and nutrients. The results indicate the specific dependency of increasing the self-sufficiency of different nutrients on the increased production of dates group and fish group, implying that dates and fish can be considered strategic crops in terms of their contribution towards food security, owing to the fact that they require the least quantity of water and energy resources for production. As poultry and meat groups require the largest quantities of water and energy resources, optimal results do not favour their production. The optimal production mix that increases the satisfaction of nutrients at 40% of the food groups self-sufficiency satisfaction with the same amount of energy and water are as follows: 52378, 47085, 111303 tonnes of dates, milk and dairy products and fish groups respectively. This production mix will achieve 29.18%, 100%, 90.8%, and 2.5% satisfaction percentage of carbohydrates, protein, fats, and fibres respectively.

J	Trenz, M; Veit, DJ; Tan, CW				Trenz, Manuel; Veit, Daniel J.; Tan, Chee-Wee			DISENTANGLING THE IMPACT OF OMNICHANNEL INTEGRATION ON CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IN INTEGRATED SALES CHANNELS	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Omnichannel retail; multichannel retail; channel integration; channel synergies; electronic commerce; convenience; risk	PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; COMMON METHOD VARIANCE; MULTICHANNEL CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT; INTERNET SHOPPING BEHAVIOR; PERCEIVED RISK; E-COMMERCE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; ELECTRONIC CHANNELS; PURCHASE INTENTION; DECISION-MAKING	"Brick-and-mortar" retailers, when expanding their businesses to online channels, can either add a separate online channel or integrate channels to enhance service offerings. Although past studies on channel choice have yielded insights into factors affecting consumers' channel preference, there is a dearth of research that sheds light on when and why massive investments into channel integration would be preferred over online optimizations. To this end, we construct and validate a theoretical model that posits omnichannel integration services for acquisition and recovery as predictors of consumers' online channel preference through influencing their perceptions of convenience and risk. Our experimental study reveals how distinct configurations of cross-channel service offerings affect consumers' channel evaluations and decisions, as well as how complementarities from channel integration across transaction and post-transaction phases can prevail over pure online substitutes. Consequently, this study bridges diagnostic and prescriptive research streams on multichannel and omnichannel retail by attesting to channel integration as a viable channel differentiator. From a practical standpoint, we compare 12 distinct channel configurations with regard to consumers' core evaluative criteria and highlight the value of omnichannel integration since efficiency improvements to the online channel can only serve as a partial substitute to channel integration.

Using a multi-method approach involving event structure analysis and an inductive multiple case study, we find that four key organizational practices-asset multiplication, leveraging human capital, building social embeddedness, and affordable quality-embody thejugaadelements of frugality and inclusivity. Adding to the social entrepreneurship literature, this study demonstrates that thejugaadapproach is conceptually distinct from bricolage and relevant to the study of social enterprises' resource mobilization processes. Managerial Summary How do social enterprises encounter and manage dilemmas over time in emerging markets? The present study responds to this question, finding that social entrepreneurs mobilize resources and overcome dilemmas using the practices ofjugaad, the "Indian method" of problem-solving. Thesejugaadpractices can be used to build and allocate resources and create trade-offs among thejugaadelements of frugality and inclusivity. Based on our results, we recommend that social entrepreneurs pay close attention to how to proceduralize human assets, which would allow these entrepreneurs to build training systems that are highly task-focused and replicated across functions. We also encourage social entrepreneurs to work in rural markets and seek wider resource pools within these markets by building social embeddedness in rural communities.

Swiss-AF Study Investigators	Heart Rate Variability Triangular Index as a Predictor of Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						atrial fibrillation; heart rate variability; morbidity; mortality	ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH; VENTRICULAR RESPONSE; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION; CONCEALED CONDUCTION; ARRHYTHMIC EVENTS; FREQUENCY-DOMAIN; RISK; ONSET	Background Impaired heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with increased mortality in sinus rhythm. However, HRV has not been systematically assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that parameters of HRV may be predictive of cardiovascular death in patients with AF. Methods and Results From the multicenter prospective Swiss-AF (Swiss Atrial Fibrillation) Cohort Study, we enrolled 1922 patients who were in sinus rhythm or AF. Resting ECG recordings of 5-minute duration were obtained at baseline. Standard parameters of HRV (HRV triangular index, SD of the normal-to-normal intervals, square root of the mean squared differences of successive normal-to-normal intervals and mean heart rate) were calculated. During follow-up, an end point committee adjudicated each cause of death. During a mean follow-up time of 2.61.0 years, 143 (7.4%) patients died; 92 deaths were attributable to cardiovascular reasons. In a Cox regression model including multiple covariates (age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, history of hypertension, history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, history of myocardial infarction, antiarrhythmic drugs including beta blockers, oral anticoagulation), a decreased HRV index <= median (14.29), but not other HRV parameters, was associated with an increase in the risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6; P=0.01) and all-cause death (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.02-1.98; P=0.04). Conclusions The HRV index measured in a single 5-minute ECG recording in a cohort of patients with AF is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality. HRV analysis in patients with AF might be a valuable tool for further risk stratification to guide patient management.

J	Ganbold, O; Matsui, Y; Rotaru, K				Ganbold, Odkhishig; Matsui, Yoshiki; Rotaru, Kristian			Effect of information technology-enabled supply chain integration on firm's operational performance	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IT capability; Supply chain integration; Operational performance	E-BUSINESS TECHNOLOGIES; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; SAMPLE-SIZE; EVEN FLOW; STRATEGIC INTEGRATION; LOGISTICS INTEGRATION; INVENTORY MANAGEMENT; EXTERNAL INTEGRATION	Purpose Using the assumptions of the resource-based view, relational view and swift, even flow theories and the overarching principles of supply chain management, the study aims to test the role of information technology (IT) capability (cross-functional application, supply chain application and data consistency) in enabling supply chain integration (SCI; internal, customer and supplier integration) and the impact of SCI on firm's operational performance in terms of quality, delivery, production cost, inventory level, customer service and product-mix flexibility. Design/methodology/approach The structural equation modeling approach is used to test theoretical predictions underlying the relationship among dimensions of IT capability, SCI and operational performance based on data obtained from senior executives of 108 large manufacturing firms listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Findings The results suggest that IT capability has positive impact on SCI, except for data consistency, which is found to have negative impact on internal integration. The results further indicate that SCI, especially customer integration, has positive and significant impact on all operational performance indicators. Practical implications The findings inform future initiatives associated with the SCI improvement via specific IT capabilities. When undertaking such initiatives, managers are advised to consider the differential impact of the following IT capabilities on SCI: cross-functional applications, supply chain applications, and data consistency capability. Originality/value The study makes an empirical contribution to the body of knowledge by demonstrating the value of the multidimensional representation and analysis of IT capability, SCI, and operational performance given a differential and even opposed influence by some of the dimensions in specific business contexts.

J	Nyasulu, J; Pandya, H				Nyasulu, Juliet; Pandya, Himani			The effects of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the South African health system: A call to maintain essential health services	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE & FAMILY MEDICINE			English	Article						COVID-19 pandemic; WHO health systems framework building blocks; health systems; essential services; HIV; EPI	BURDEN; CARE	South Africa had its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on 06 March 2020 in an individual who travelled overseas. Since then, cases have constantly increased and the pandemic has taken a toll on the health system. This requires extra mobilisation of resources to curb the disease and overcome financial loses whilst providing social protection to the poor. Assessing the effects of COVID-19 on South African health system is critical to identify challenges and act timely to strike a balance between managing the emergency and maintaining essential health services. We applied the World Health Organization (WHO) health systems framework to assess the effects of COVID-19 on South African health system, and proposed solutions to address the gaps, with a focus on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) programmes. The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has direct impact on the health system, negatively affecting its functionality, as depletion of resources to curb the emergency is eminent. Diversion of health workforce, suspension of services, reduced health-seeking behaviour, unavailability of supplies, deterioration in data monitoring and funding crunches are some of the noted challenges. In such emergencies, the ability to deliver essential services is dependent on baseline capacity of health system. Our approach advocates for close collaboration between essential services and COVID-19 teams to identify priorities, restructure essential services to accommodate physical distancing, promote task shifting at primary level, optimise the use of mobile/web-based technologies for service delivery/training/monitoring and involve private sector and non-health departments to increase management capacity. Strategic responses thus planned can assist in mitigating the adverse effects of the pandemic whilst preventing morbidity and mortality from preventable diseases in the population.

J	Lawrence, BS; Shah, NP				Lawrence, Barbara S.; Shah, Neha Parikh			HOMOPHILY: MEASURES AND MEANING	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT ANNALS			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; RANDOM GRAPH MODELS; FACE-TO-FACE; FRIENDSHIP NETWORKS; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; FEATHER FLOCK; INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION; INTERPERSONAL-ATTRACTION; PREFERENTIAL ATTACHMENT	Homophily, the tendency to associate with similar others, is a fundamental pattern underlying human relationships. Although scholars largely agree on the definition of homophily, their empirical measures of it vary widely. This both raises the question of whether everyone is studying the same phenomenon and suggests that our understanding of homophily is incomplete. To address this question, we examined the homophily literature from 1954 through 2018 and constructed a typology that includes the empirical measures most commonly used. We found that these measures tend to neglect the meaning that people attribute to and derive from homophilous relationships in three ways. First, measures often do not capture how individuals' interactions with others influence their sense of the world-how social constructions affect meaning. Second, measures often do not capture whether individuals interpret and attach importance to their associations or similarities the same way researchers do. Finally, measures often do not capture the meaning-related ambiguities introduced by studies of multiple types of social contexts, associations, and similarities. Because homophily remains a central construct in social science, this divergence between measures and meaning suggests a need for refinement.

THE EMERGENCE OF MORAL LEADERSHIP	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article							ETHICAL LEADERSHIP; RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP; INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE; BUSINESS ETHICS; BOUNDARY WORK; IDENTITY; VALUES; SYSTEMS; CONSTRUCTION; ORGANIZATION	The emergence of "moral leadership," discussed here as a situation wherein individuals take a moral stance on an issue, convince others to do the same, and together spur change in a moral system, abounds in practice. Existing ethical and moral leadership theories, however, have remained confined to micro-level behavioral research. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a process theory of the socially situated emergence of moral leadership and its development into a broader movement affecting moral systems within and across formal organizations. We theorize the pathways through which moral leadership emerges; the triggers that bring about moral awareness and the moral courage to offer an alternative moral stance toward an issue, and leaders' ability to deftly connect followers and their moral convictions into a broader movement, such that a moral system changes from within. With our process theory, we bridge between micro and macro levels of analysis, and highlight the crucial ability of leaders to be both principled and pragmatically savvy, and thus capable of bridging between their own moral convictions and those of others in order to develop a common and mutually binding ground toward change.

Through the lenses of contingency and evolutionary theory, the paper addresses the underexplored supply chain dynamics that enhance or inhibit sustainability trajectories. Design/methodology/approach Using in-depth multi-case studies for theory elaboration, five supply chains were studied through open-ended interviews with SC members, secondary data collection and site visit observation. The design consists of a combination of deductive and inductive approaches to elaborate theory on supply chain dynamics and enhanced sustainability trajectories. Findings The empirical study shows that learning is a fundamental condition for supply chains as they implement sustainability initiatives, and that exploitation capabilities are more frequently used than exploration capabilities. Path dependence plays a role in the outcomes of supply chain sustainability initiatives, which are influenced by both path dependence and contingencies of the contexts in which these systems operate. Research limitations/implications This paper puts forward five propositions that emerge from the literature and from the field study results. Although this is an exploratory research bounded by geographical limitations and the limited number of SC cases, the goal of elaborating theory may open up several promising avenues for future large-scale and longitudinal research studies. Practical implications By enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of supply chain sustainability trajectories, decision-makers, scholars and policy-makers can better understand how supply chains learn, how they employ SC member capabilities and how they deal with stakeholder resistance. Originality/value This paper extends supply chain sustainability theory by addressing the knowledge gap that exists with regard to understanding the dynamics of evolving supply chain sustainability trajectories. This paper sheds additional light on this important topic and contributes in multiple ways to the sustainable supply chain management literature.

Progress in operational tools that help with environmental management and decision-making is slower and more complex than expected. The objective of the research is to show the usefulness of calculating composite indicators of environmental sustainability as a management tool. The proposed scientific model applies a multicriteria analysis, in an aggregate approach, with a double reference point (reservation and aspiration levels), incorporating the opinions of experts, and making the concepts of strong and weak sustainability operational. The method is applied to the eight provinces of Andalusia (Spain), using the official data published by the Regional Ministry of Environment. The results show that the indicators obtained are especially useful for the management of the territory, because they serve as an absolute measure of environmental sustainability. Besides, they enable global and specific analyzes of each indicator, they easily identify the strengths and weaknesses of each territory, and they provide an alert system to prevent problems and help to make strategic decisions.

Spectroscopic and thermogravimetric analyses showed that the replacement of pulverised fly ash and incinerated sewage sludge ash promoted the generation of magnesium silicate hydrates gel via pozzolanic-like reaction. The incorporation of mussel shell densified the microstructure as illustrated from scanning electron microscopy. Therefore, these modified particleboards presented satisfying flexural strength (>9 MPa) and thickness swelling (<2%). However, the spontaneous hydration of blast furnace slag manifested a competition against magnesia cement hydration and resulted in strength reduction. Furthermore, carbon dioxide curing promoted the transformation from magnesium hydroxide to additional magnesium carbonate and hydrated magnesium carbonates, which significantly enhanced early strength. However, the carbonation process consumed magnesium hydroxide, unavoidably suppressing the pozzolanic reaction. By contrast, blast furnace slag-incorporated samples showed synergetic hydration and carbonation. In summary, pulverised fly ash materials are promising substitutes in air curing condition, whereas blast furnace slag is suitable for accelerated carbonation of magnesia cement-based particleboards.

J	Jahanshahi, AA; Brem, A				Afshar Jahanshahi, Asghar; Brem, Alexander			Entrepreneurs in post-sanctions Iran: Innovation or imitation under conditions of perceived environmental uncertainty?	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Perceived environmental uncertainty; Imitation strategy; Innovation strategy; Entrepreneurs; Iran; Sanctions	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; DECISION-MAKING; INTERORGANIZATIONAL IMITATION; OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; UPPER ECHELONS; PRIVATE FIRMS; STRATEGY; MANAGEMENT	We examined the relationships between perceived environmental uncertainty and firm strategies (innovation vs. imitation) with a sample of 143 Iranian entrepreneurs. By using longitudinal data, we hypothesized that perceived environmental state uncertainty increases the possibility of pursuing innovative strategies and that the perceived effect and response of uncertainty increases the possibility of pursuing imitative strategies by Iranian entrepreneurs during the post-sanction period. Our results extend previous research by not only highlighting the importance of perceived environmental uncertainty in shaping firms' strategic behavior, but also indicating how each dimension of perceived environmental uncertainty either enhances or inhibits the innovation/imitation strategy. Since perceived environmental uncertainty is a multidimensional and broad concept that usually stems from different sources, ignoring the exact types of uncertainty faced by entrepreneurs during strategy formulation could lead to unproductive investments and higher costs that may hurt firm performance in the long term. Our findings are in general consistent with the predictions of upper echelons theory and confirm that the strategy of a firm varies according to the types of uncertainty perceived by entrepreneurs.

Early detection of high-risk individuals is the key to prevent suicidal behavior. There is increasing evidence that the Internet and social media provide clues of people's emotional distress. In particular, some people leave messages showing emotional distress or even suicide notes on the Internet. Identifying emotionally distressed people and examining their posts on the Internet are important steps for health and social work professionals to provide assistance, but the process is very timeconsuming and ineffective if conducted manually using standard search engines. Following the design science approach, we present the design of a system called KAREN, which identifies individuals who blog about their emotional distress in the Chinese language, using a combination of machine learning classification and rulebased classification with rules obtained from experts. A controlled experiment and a user study were conducted to evaluate system performance in searching and analyzing blogs written by people who might be emotionally distressed. The results show that the proposed system achieved better classification performance than the benchmark methods and that professionals perceived the system to be more useful and effective for identifying bloggers with emotional distress than benchmark approaches.

TOKEN FEMALE VOICE ENACTMENT IN TRADITIONALLY MALE-DOMINATED TEAMS: FACILITATING CONDITIONS AND CONSEQUENCES FOR PERFORMANCE	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							MINORITY INFLUENCE; DECISION-MAKING; GENDER STEREOTYPES; EMPLOYEE VOICE; LEADERSHIP-BEHAVIOR; PROHIBITIVE VOICE; INTEGRATIVE MODEL; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; LEVEL DIVERSITY; MAJORITY	When is a token female's voice incorporated into the actions of a traditionally male-dominated team, and to what ends? Drawing from the tokenism, gender stereotypes, and minority influence literatures, we advance a model that specifies the conditions that facilitate token female voice enactment and when enacting the female's voice enhances team performance. Using a sample of active-duty military men and women, we employed live observation techniques to study voice enactment in all-male teams versus female-token teams (i.e., teams with a token female member) throughout a series of complex and physically demanding tasks. Our findings revealed that (a) token female voice enactment was higher when team leaders possessed more favorable beliefs about women's capabilities in the military, and (b) token female voice enactment enhanced team performance in more complex tasks but harmed team performance in less complex tasks. Additionally, our supplementary analyses revealed that female-token teams were more reflective before engaging in action relative to all-male teams, as the latter tended to engage in agentic, "action-first" strategies. Theoretical and practical implications for facilitating female voice enactment in traditionally male-dominated contexts are discussed.	[Farh, Crystal I.

This paper examines the technology trends in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and identifies the key indicators behind the creation of a strategic map for the fourth-generation banks and their readiness to enter Industry 4.0. This paper examines a systematic review of fully integrated Banking 4.0 and the application of the technologies of Industry 4.0 and illustrates a distinct pattern of integration of Banking 4.0 and Industry 4.0. One of the prominent features of this article is the performance of successful global banks in applying these technologies. The results showed that Banking 4.0 in Industry 4.0 is an integrative value creation system consisting of six design principles and 14 technology trends. The roadmap designed for banks to enter Industry 4.0 and how they work with industrial companies will be a key and important guide.

We embrace a holistic view of the performance implications of these behavioral logics, theorizing and empirically testing their impact not only on the level of firm performance but also on its variability. The findings suggest that emerging market conditions create significant contingencies in the relationships between effectuation, causation, and firm performance, substantively affecting their effectiveness. In particular, we demonstrate that for the firms affected by adverse conditions, causation brings marginal performance improvements while also making it highly unreliable (variable), whereas effectuation leads to performance improvements coupled with higher reliability. Managerial Summary Entrepreneurial actions can be based on one of two behavioral logics: causation (rigorous forward-looking analysis, relying on well-prepared plans, pre-defined goals, and required resources) or effectuation (leveraging the existing resources and controlling the environmental uncertainty through creating new markets, products, and opportunities). We investigate the effectiveness of these logics for Russian SMEs navigating adversity in the emerging market context. The results suggest that causation leads to performance improvements, yet these become marginal and highly unreliable if a firm finds itself in adverse conditions. Effectuation, on the other hand, is a costly and unreliable strategy in stable times, yet leads to reliable performance improvements in volatile contexts.

J	Bien, C; Sassen, R				Bien, Colin; Sassen, Remmer			Sensemaking of a sustainability transition by higher education institution leaders	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			Welsh	Article						Sustainability transition; Sensemaking; Power through discourses; Conceptualising sustainability; Organisational change management for sustainability	STRATEGIC CHANGE; UNIVERSITIES; IDENTITY; IMAGE; ORGANIZATIONS; AMBIGUITY; BARRIERS; FACULTY; STAFF; MODEL	The understanding of meaning-creation processes according to sensemaking theory and its role in conceptualising sustainability in higher education institutions is limited. The idea of sustainability obliges organisations and people to rethink worldviews and justify actions. This may ultimately introduce organisational change, often associated with a redistribution of power. Its extent depends on, among other factors, the prevailing definition of sustainability within the organisation. Through a process of sensemaking and sensegiving, academic leaders impose their own understanding of science, the university and sustainability upon others, while conceptualising sustainability to maintain or increase power. A principal medium for the reproduction and maintenance of power in organisations are discourses. Based on qualitative field research at a large German university, we examined how academic leaders make sense of and give sense to ambiguous fields of meaning in conceptualising a sustainable university. We identified three aggregated dimensions that form the change context of the transition: (1) discourse strategies applied to make and give sense, (2) triggers of resistance and (3) determinants of a collective sensemaking process. We reflected our findings on the existing literature on organisational change management for sustainability in higher education and present first considerations for a systematic meaning-creation process that guides the definition of a commonly shared vision for a sustainable university.

Prioritizing conservation actions for Pacific salmon in Canada	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						conservation planning; decision-support tool; Indigenous knowledge; Pacific salmon; Priority Threat Management; recovery planning; stream restoration; Wild Salmon Policy	CHINOOK SALMON; RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT; RECOVERY; BENEFITS; SCIENCE; COSTS	Current investment in conservation is insufficient to adequately protect and recover all ecosystems and species. The challenge of allocating limited funds is acute for Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. in Canada, which lack a strategic approach to ensure that resources are spent on actions most likely to cost-effectively recover diminished populations. We applied the Priority Threat Management framework to prioritize strategies most likely to maximize the number of thriving Pacific salmon populations on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. These included 79 genetically, ecologically and spatially distinct population groups called conservation units (CUs) for five salmon species. This region has high salmon biodiversity and spans the territories of four First Nations: the Heiltsuk, Nuxalk, Kitasoo/Xai'xais and Wuikinuxv. Using structured expert elicitation of Indigenous and other experts, we quantified the estimated benefits, costs and feasibility of implementing 10 strategies. Under a business-as-usual scenario (i.e. no additional investments in salmon conservation or management), experts predicted that only one in four CUs would have >50% chance of achieving a thriving status within 20 years. Limiting future industrial development in salmon habitats, which was predicted to safeguard CUs from future declines, was identified as the most cost-effective strategy. Investment in three strategies: (a) removal of artificial barriers to fish migration, (b) watershed protection and (c) stream restoration-at 11.3M CAD per year-was predicted to result in nearly half (34 of 79) of the CUs having a >60% chance of meeting the conservation objective. If all conservation strategies were implemented, experts estimated a >50% probability of achieving a thriving status for 78 of 79 CUs, at an annual cost of 17.3M CAD. However, even with the implementation of all strategies, most sockeye salmon CUs were unlikely to achieve higher probability targets of reaching the objective. Policy implications. We illustrate how Priority Threat Management can incorporate the perspectives and expertise of Indigenous peoples and other experts to prioritize conservation strategies based on their cost, benefit and feasibility. Implementation of this framework can help safeguard and recover Pacific salmon in Canada, and could also be used to prioritize actions for other conservation issues globally.

However, their impacts are yet to be quantified for eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), a popular drought tolerant vegetable crop grown in water scarce Deccan Plateau of India. We conducted field experiments during 2016-17 and 2017-18 in a drought prone region of Deccan Plateau, India to evaluate the interactive effect of PGRs viz., 1.38 mg L-1 salicylic acid (SA), 1.5% potassium nitrate (PN), 500 ppm thio-urea (TU) and 100 ml L-1 bio-stimulant (BS) and varied levels of DI generated using line source sprinkler system. The marketable fruit yields were reduced to 86, 74, 50, 30, 12 and 8% with increased level of DI i.e. when the applied irrigation water (IW) equalled 0.00, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45, 0.60 and 0.75 times the cumulative open pan evaporation (CPE) against the recommended irrigation practice (IW:CPE 0.90). Application of PGRs improved fruit yields by 7.3-22.7% and their role to alleviate water stress was indicated by lower canopy temperatures, maintaining higher leaf relative water content, modulation of stomatal opening and higher consumptive use of water. Particularly SA and TU were superior under low to medium water stress (IW: CPE 0.45-0.75) whereas PN was effective in severe water stress (IW:CPE 0.0-0.44) while the effect of BS was almost similar with PGRs like TU under medium stress conditions. The maximum water productivity (WP) varied between 5.50 and 6.77 kg m(-3) for different PGRs and it was 5.16 kg m(-3) without PGRs indicating water savings to the order of 28.8-57.4% with the former. The fruit quality attributes such as mean diameter, sphericity, fruit weight and firmness traits declined with water stress while these were considerably rectified with PGRs. Higher accumulation of dry matter, sugar, protein, total phenolics, flavonoids and improved rehydration quality as well as potentially affecting enzymatic activity were monitored with PGRs. It is concluded that exogenous application of PGRs like SA and PN along with medium levels of DI can help in rational utilization of water resources and could effectively improve yield and post-harvest quality of eggplant fruits especially under water scarce environment of Deccan Plateau.

J	Lobel, LM				Loebel, Lea-Maria			Family separation and refugee mental health-A network perspective	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Refugees; Mental health; Personal network analysis; Ego-centered network; Spatial dispersion	SOCIAL SUPPORT; PERSONAL NETWORKS; ASYLUM-SEEKERS; PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA; MIGRATION; TIES; RESETTLEMENT; IMPACT; INTEGRATION; MIGRANTS	How do the structure and relational features of family networks affect refugees' mental health after migration, particularly when refugees are geographically separated from their family? Using the first wave of the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees, which is representative of the population of refugees who arrived in Germany between 2013 and 2016, this study finds that the size of the nuclear family has a significant positive relationship with refugees' mental health, whereas family separation has a significant negative relationship. In addition to members of the nuclear family, only fathers show a significant positive correlation with refugees' mental health. The structural and relational aspects are discussed in light of health literature focusing on migration stressors and their relationship with mental health as well as in the context of changing family reunification policies in Germany amid the increase in immigration of refugees since 2015.

J	Shestak, O; Shcheka, OL; Klochkov, Y				Shestak, Olga; Shcheka, Oleg L.; Klochkov, Yury			Methodological aspects of use of countries experience in determining the directions of the strategic development of the Russian Federation arctic regions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Arctic region; Regional development strategy; Comparative analysis	INVESTMENT PROJECTS; UNITED-STATES; SYSTEM; CANADA; NORTH; MODEL	The Arctic zone of Russia has an area of more than 9 million square kilometers (4.9 million sq. km continental part, 4.0 million sq. km-sea, 0.2 sq. km-islands). The land areas of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation include the Nenets, Yamalo-Nenets, Chukotka Autonomous Districts (hereinafter-AD), the Murmansk Region and most of the municipal entities of the Arkhangelsk Region, as well as coastal municipalities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the Komi Republic and the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). About 2.5 million people live here (less than 2% of the country's population, but about 40% of the population of the entire Arctic). Almost 15% of Russia's gross domestic product (hereinafter referred to as GDP) is produced here. About 1/5 of Russian exports are being created in the Russian Arctic. The continental shelf of the Arctic Ocean contains approximately 25% of the world's shelf reserves of hydrocarbons. According to the US Geological Survey of 2008, up to 134 billion barrels of oil (about 18 billion tons) and almost 47 trillion m3 of natural gas may be deposited in the northern regions. In 2017, the Russian Arctic accounted for up to 60% of all-Russian copper and oil production, almost 100% of natural gas, 100% of diamonds, barite, platinum, nickel, cobalt, rare earth elements, vermiculite, and apatite concentrate. However, to increase the potential of the land Arctic territories of Russia, it is necessary to implement large-scale projects for the extraction, processing and supply of hydrocarbon fuels, the development of energy and transport infrastructure, the formation of an innovative economy based on high technologies. This experience allows us to obtain new knowledge of the mechanisms for regional development of the Arctic territories, as well as to take into account the accumulated foreign experience in developing the decisions in the field of regional Arctic policy. A comparative analysis of the territories of foreign countries that are in comparable natural-geographical, socio-economic, geopolitical conditions, but differing in the level of economic development and social attractiveness, has been done the basis of identifying the main directions of development of the Arctic regions of the Russian Federation, defined in federal and regional strategic documents. The use of this experience of territorial development may be useful for the Russian Arctic regions.

The pulse has three distinct emission components, which vary with frequency across our 1.0-1.5 GHz observing band. We measure the peak flux density to be >0.065 Jy and the corresponding fluence >0.2 Jy ms. Based on the observed dispersion measure of 1812 cm(-3) pc, we infer a redshift of similar to 1.9. From this, we estimate the peak luminosity and isotropic energy to be less than or similar to 2 x 10(43) erg s(-1) and less than or similar to 2 x 10(40) erg, respectively. With only one FRB from the survey detected so far, our constraints on the event rate are limited. We derive a 95% confidence lower limit for the event rate of 900 FRBs per day for FRBs with fluences >0.025 Jy ms. We performed follow-up observations of the source with FAST for four hours and have not found a repeated burst. We discuss the implications of this discovery for our understanding of the physical mechanisms of FRBs.

J	Paul, J; Jadhav, P				Paul, Justin; Jadhav, Pravin			Institutional determinants of foreign direct investment inflows: evidence from emerging markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS			English	Article						Globalization; Emerging markets	INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION; POLITICAL DETERMINANTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PANEL-DATA; FDI; CORRUPTION; SPILLOVERS; LOCATION; AFRICA; POLICY	Purpose Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a strategic decision for achieving competitive advantage by multinational enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of institutional determinants of FDI using data from 24 emerging markets including China, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia and Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach In order to identify factors that attract FDI in emerging markets, this study has used data from sources such as the World Bank, Index of Economic Freedom and UNCTAD. Findings The findings of this research indicate that infrastructure quality, trade cost measured by tariff and non-tariff barriers, institutional quality measured by effective rule of law, political stability, regulatory quality and control on corruption are significant determinants of FDI in emerging markets. Originality/value This is the first study to analyze the sectoral institutional determinants of Inward FDI in the important emerging economies, to the best of authors' knowledge.

J	Jeong, JS; Gonzalez-Gomez, D				Jeong, Jin Su; Gonzalez-Gomez, David			A web-based tool framing a collective method for optimizing the location of a renewable energy facility and its possible application to sustainable STEM education	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Renewable energy; Sustainability; Cleaner production; Decision support system; Web tool; STEM education	MULTICRITERIA DECISION-ANALYSIS; FUZZY DEMATEL; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUPPLY CHAINS; BIOMASS; MANAGEMENT; LOGISTICS; EVALUATE	In this study, a prototype web-based tool is introduced for the estimation of the Location Suitability Assessment of a Biomass Plant (LSABP): input demands, inner procedures, and output results in response to various levels of government strategies. A collective methodology of Geographic Information System-Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) and the Fuzzy-DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) is presented. After implementing the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and two-way sensitivity analysis, we accomplish the most suitable biomass plants' locations. The developed web-based tool framing the collective method targets and generates Multi-Criteria-Spatial Decision Support System (MC-SDSS). Precisely, four main sections are described as general overview, MC-SDSS, two-way sensitivity analysis, and final result section for the LSABP. In final result section, users particularly test the location suitability option for five biomass plants with the chosen criteria. The results confirm that the suitable locations of biomass plants are situated near forests and in zones with low transport costs, which comprise only 9.25% highly suitable area. Five plants are not located in the highly suitable areas. The most influential criteria of the LSABP are the vegetation cover, agricultural area, transport cost, and potential demand criteria. By assessing diverse alternatives, the LSABP assists certain decisions for adjusting and analyzing the setting of biomass facilities on a strategic, tactical, and operational level. Therefore, this work demonstrates the novelty of framework development as a cleaner production for integrating globally accessible spatial and environmental algorithms and datasets in computing with newly designed and implemented an interactive web-based tool for the evaluation purpose of various personal and government levels. Particularly, it is necessary to apply its experience to the possible sustainable Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, which requires constant acquisition of knowledge and its dissemination.

J	Arikan, I; Arikan, AM; Shenkar, O				Arikan, Ilgaz; Arikan, Asli M.; Shenkar, Oded			Nation-dyadic history and cross-border corporate deals: Role of conflict, trade, generational distance, and professional education	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						conflict; cross-border deals; decision making; history; identities; international relations and trade; sentiments; socialization	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS EDUCATION; TOP MANAGEMENT TEAM; GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE; COOPERATION; ORGANIZATION; RISK; WAR; INTERDEPENDENCE; DETERMINANTS	Research Summary This paper explores why and how nation-dyadic history impacts aggregated firm decisions involving cross-border activities (acquisitions, joint ventures, and alliances). We contextualize history and illustrate the negative effect of historical conflict on cross-border deals. Nation-dyads with historical conflict incorporate negative sentiments into their social and collective memories and national identities. Members of society assume the socially constructed national identity via primary and secondary socialization. National identities incorporate sentiments towards other nations and condition individuals' preferences, culminating in a preference-biased search for or preference-supporting evaluation of information concerning cross-border deals. An increased generational distance from prior conflict and a higher percentage of graduates with common professional identities constructed by higher education in the social sciences, law, and business dampen the negative influence of historical conflict. Managerial Summary There is a reciprocal relationship between international trade and conflict across two nations: as the potential for conflict increases, trade levels fall, and as trade levels increase, the potential for conflict rises. We disentangle this relationship and determine the implications of historical conflict between two nations for cross-border corporate deals (i.e., acquisitions/joint ventures/alliances). We show that, controlling for other factors, more frequent historical conflict discourages cross-border corporate deals. We see this finding as a result of biased decision making based on preferences which reflect sentiments formed by national identities. Two mechanisms dampen the negative relationship between binational conflict and cross-border deals: a higher percentage of business/law/social sciences graduates and a higher number of generations passed since the last conflict.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic alliances; cooperative strategy; knowledge transfer; social networks; multinational firm coordination	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY; INNOVATION; COLLABORATION; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; COUNTRY; IMPACT; MNC	In this paper, we explore under which conditions subsidiaries of multinational corporations can benefit from the external networks of sister subsidiaries in terms of new knowledge generation. We focus on the phenomenon of unconnected sister alliances-that is, alliances of sister subsidiaries with whom the focal subsidiary lacks a recent history of internal R&D collaboration. Whereas unconnected sister alliances provide knowledge recombination opportunities for the focal subsidiary, realizing them is challenging because of particular knowledge transfer frictions. In this paper, we theorize on how particular conditions (i.e., headquarters proximity, knowledge overlap, size of focal subsidiary's own alliance network) influence the strength of these frictions, resulting in hypotheses on how these conditions moderate the relationship between the number of unconnected sister alliances and the generation of new knowledge by focal subsidiaries. We rely on a panel data set of 2,258 R&D subsidiaries belonging to 118 firms in the pharmaceutical industry to empirically test our hypotheses. Jointly, our findings enrich our current theoretical understanding of how different types of external linkages and their interactions shape subsidiaries' generation of new knowledge. We also illuminate the opportunities and challenges that multistep knowledge transfer processes entail.

Disease recovery in bats affected by white-nose syndrome	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Healing; Heterothermy; Histology; Lipid profiles; Myotis lucifugus; Wildlife disease	FREE FATTY-ACIDS; MYOTIS-LUCIFUGUS; FLIGHT MEMBRANES; BATRACHOCHYTRIUM-DENDROBATIDIS; PIPISTRELLUS-PIPISTRELLUS; GEOMYCES-DESTRUCTANS; DAILY TORPOR; BROWN BAT; CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS; THERMOREGULATION	Processes associated with recovery of survivors are understudied components of wildlife infectious diseases. White-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats provides an opportunity to study recovery of disease survivors, understand implications of recovery for individual energetics, and assess the role of survivors in pathogen transmission. We documented temporal patterns of recovery from WNS in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) following hibernation to test the hypotheses that: (1) recovery of wing structure from WNS matches a rapid time scale (i.e. approximately 30 days) suggested by data from free-ranging bats; (2) torpor expression plays a role in recovery; (3) wing physiological function returns to normal alongside structural recovery; and (4) pathogen loads decline quickly during recovery. We collected naturally infected bats at the end of hibernation, brought them into captivity, and quantified recovery over 40 days by monitoring body mass, wing damage, thermoregulation, histopathology of wing biopsies, skin surface lipids and fungal load. Most metrics returned to normal within 30 days, although wing damage was still detectable at the end of the study. Torpor expression declined overall throughout the study, but bats expressed relatively shallow torpor bouts-with a plateau in minimum skin temperature-during intensive healing between approximately days 8 and 15. Pathogen loads were nearly undetectable after the first week of the study, but some bats were still detectably infected at day 40. Our results suggest that healing bats face a severe energetic imbalance during early recovery from direct costs of healing and reduced foraging efficiency. Management of WNS should not rely solely on actions during winter, but should also aim to support energy balance of recovering bats during spring and summer.

Diabetic patients aged between 40 and 64 (n = 1195) were included in the analyses. Risk perception worsened behavioral changes in terms of food habits and depression, whereas self-efficacy and trust improved food habits, exercise, and depression; trust improved exercise and depression. In conclusion, self-efficacy and trust appear to be more beneficial than risk perception for positive behavioral changes and for improving depression in diabetic patients.

J	Pukkala, T				Pukkala, Timo			At what carbon price forest cutting should stop	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Boreal forest; Carbon balance; Carbon sequestration; Carbon subsidies; Optimal forest management	NORWAY SPRUCE; SCOTS PINE; MANAGEMENT; BOREAL; FINLAND; BIOMASS; SEQUESTRATION; ACCUMULATION; SUBSIDIES; DRAINAGE	The carbon sink of boreal forests can be increased by paying forest landowners for carbon sequestration and taxing carbon releases. The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of carbon pricing on optimal forest management when forests are managed for maximal discounted benefits from timber production and carbon payments. A 0.5% random sample of all private forest stands of Finland was used in the analyses (48,842 stands). Calculations were performed for a 100-year time horizon. It was assumed that the carbon balance (difference between sequestrated carbon and released carbon) in the forest (trees and soil) or the carbon balance of forestry (trees, soil and wood-based products) was subsidized (positive balance) or taxed (negative balance) by 0, 50, 100 or 150 euro t(-1), corresponding to CO2 prices of 0, 13.6, 27.3 or 40.9 euro t(-1), respectively. The results showed that paying forest landowners 150 euro t(-1) of carbon sequestrated in forests would lead to the cessation of all cuttings everywhere in Finland for at least 100 years. In the northern part of the country, a carbon price of 100 euro t(-1) would be enough to make the no-cutting management economically optimal. A low carbon price had the highest relative impact (value of increased sequestration divided by the cost of carbon payments). The benefit/cost ratio of carbon subsidies was higher in the northern part of boreal zone than in the southern parts. Subsidizing within-forest carbon sequestration by 50 euro t(-1) would increase the carbon sequestration of Finnish forestry by 50%, ranging from 36% (south Finland) to 116% (north Finland). A payment of 100 euro t(-1) or more would increase carbon sequestration by 70%, which is nearly the maximum possible increase that can be obtained by carbon subsidies.

Serving differently: CEO regulatory focus and firm stakeholder strategy	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						CEO decision-making; corporate social responsibility; regulatory focus theory; stakeholder strategy; upper echelons theory	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMISM; SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM; INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS; TEMPORAL FOCUS; MEDIA COVERAGE; ORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; PREVENTION	Research summary A fundamental question in stakeholder strategy research is why firms adopt certain strategies or approaches to engage with key stakeholders. Recent research suggests that CEOs' characteristics can influence their general decisions to engage with stakeholders, however, this work has yet to consider why CEOs might utilize specific stakeholder strategies. In this article, we demonstrate how CEO regulatory focus influences the nature of a firm's stakeholder strategy. Specifically, we argue that CEO prevention focus is positively associated with engagement in governance-oriented initiatives and receptivity to governance-oriented stakeholder activism, while CEO promotion focus is positively associated with engagement in socially-oriented initiatives and receptivity to socially-oriented stakeholder activism. We find strong support for our hypotheses in a sample of 374 publicly-traded firms. Managerial summary The strategies a firm uses to engage with stakeholders can influence its performance, yet little is known about what makes firms focus on certain stakeholders over others. To better understand this, we examined CEO regulatory focus in a sample of large public companies. Our findings reveal that the way CEOs view decisions-either based on a sense of duty, obligations, and responsibility or as a means to achieve high ideals-influences their tendency to prioritize shareholder concerns or the concerns of a broader array of stakeholders. This suggests that executives should be aware of their own natural tendencies to inject their motivations into their firm's stakeholder strategy and consider avenues to balance their perspectives for the sake of the firm.

J	Butzbach, O; Fuller, DB; Schnyder, G				Butzbach, Olivier; Fuller, Douglas B.; Schnyder, Gerhard			Manufacturing discontent: National institutions, multinational firm strategies, and anti-globalization backlash in advanced economies	GLOBAL STRATEGY JOURNAL			English	Article						comparative capitalism; globalization; institutions; multinational corporations (MNCs); varieties of capitalism	WELFARE-STATE; CAPITALISM; MARKET; CAPABILITIES; FINANCE; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; VARIETIES; BUSINESS; LABOR	Research Summary There is mounting evidence of a widespread popular backlash against globalization in advanced economies, which can hurt multinational companies' (MNCs) interests. In this article, we argue that MNCs are both "culprits" and "victims" of backlash against globalization. Building on the comparative capitalism literature, we argue that national institutions influence the likelihood of a backlash by either encouraging MNCs to embrace a "labor arbitrage" strategy consisting in tapping into cheap labor markets overseas or preventing them from doing so. Where institutional constraints lead firms to adopt an "upgrading" route of using domestic workers, popular backlash is less likely. Such institutional factors help to explain variation in the likelihood of backlash across countries. We also discuss the strategic options available to firms facing backlash. Managerial Summary Multinational companies are increasingly facing a backlash against globalization that, in some countries, may lead to policies that directly hurt their interests. Yet little is known about the link of this phenomenon with firm-level strategies. In this article, we draw on comparative capitalism analysis to show that national institutions play a key role in determining the likelihood of backlash. They do so by inducing/discouraging MNCs to adopt certain strategies that expose non-university-educated workers to globalization pressures, influencing, in turn, the electorate's attitude toward globalization. We also present and discuss the strategic options available to firms facing backlash.

Therefore, this study intended to improve the Asian Emission Inventory, NIER/KU-CREATE, by improving information about the point source emissions, their location, and discharge conditions, in China. By using the Global dataset, we can establish point source location information for Coal Power Plants and Non-Coal Power Plants in the Chinese power sector, and calculate and allocate emissions in the inventory. In addition, the emission inventory of NH3, as a by-product of NOx abatement processing, was regarded as being insufficiently characterized in the previous emission inventory, and has been re-estimated. As a result, 3798 LPSs in China were identified, and NH3 emissions from those power plants have increased significantly. In addition, the vertical distribution of emissions through the allocation stack height parameters showed atmospheric injection heights of between 250 m and 1000 m. Using this information, HY-SPLIT trajectory modeling found that during periods of active westerly from China to Korea, emissions from the higher injection height were more prone to move towards Korea, than those from the lower height.

The existing literature primarily focuses on means to achieve flexibility through information system (IS) exploitation. There is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive flexibility evaluation and implementation framework for organizations, engaged in the delivery of software products and services. This paper proposes twenty-three practices graded in six maturity levels to fill this gap. These practices will improve the understanding, evaluation, and implementation of flexibility in the organizational setting.

FOUNDER POWER AND EXIT VIA INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							REPORTED BEHAVIORAL REACTIONS; STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; TOP MANAGERIAL PRESTIGE; WORK-FAMILY CONFLICT; ORGANIZATIONAL FRUSTRATION; EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION; ENTREPRENEURIAL EXIT; EMPLOYEE WITHDRAWAL; BOARD COMPOSITION; MANAGEMENT TEAMS	Founders can voluntarily exit their ventures via initial public offerings (IPOs). This study builds on power theory to develop and test a model of founder exit using a dataset of 313 founders from 177 entrepreneurial IPOs between 2002 and 2010. We largely find support for the model-a negative relationship between founder power and full exit. To capture the underlying mechanism of the power-exit relationship, we conducted two experiments in which we randomly assigned decision makers to either a high- or low-power condition. We find that decision makers in the low-power condition are more likely to use a full exit via IPO than those in the high-power condition, and that frustration mediates this relationship. However, founders can also engage in partial exits, including a managerial partial exit in which the founder leaves management but keeps ownership, and a financial partial exit in which the founder divests ownership but remains in management. We find that the negative relationship between founder power and exit is more negative for full exits than for partial exits. With this paper, we contribute to the literature on exit by identifying a novel mechanism-frustration-underlying power's influence on the likelihood and type of founder exit.

J	Aujirpongpan, S; Hareebin, Y				Aujirpongpan, Somnuk; Hareebin, Yuttachai			The Effect of Strategic Intuition, Business Analytic, Networking Capabilities and Dynamic Strategy on Innovation Performance: The Empirical Study Thai Processed Food Exporters	JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS			English	Article						Strategic Intuition; Business Analytic; Networking Capabilities; Dynamic Strategy; Innovation Performance; Food Exporter	KNOWLEDGE; DELIBERATE; IMPACT; ORGANIZATIONS; ORIENTATION; PERSPECTIVE; TECHNOLOGY; AGENDA	The purpose of this study is to examine the predictive effects of intuition, business analytic, networking capabilities on innovation performance. The data was collected using a cross-sectional quantitative survey. A total of 292 useable responses were collected from Thai Processed Food Exporters (TPFE). The findings also indicated that the hypothesized relationships between the independent and dependent variables fit the empirical data. Specifically, it is revealed that strategic intuition, business analytic capabilities, network-based capabilities and dynamic capabilities had a direct effect on dynamic strategy. They also had statistically significant direct and indirect effects on dynamic performance. Based on the results of the correlation test, the researchers developed a dynamic capability model for the development of the dynamic performance of the operators, which included concepts, principles, methods, tools and guidelines. Furthermore, the impacts of intuition, business analytic, networking capabilities on dynamic strategy are also examined in this study. It makes a considerable contribution to the existing literature on dynamic strategy of TPFE, particularly in regards to explaining the performance.

In order to facilitate the learning process that will foster social entrepreneurship, however, a more holistic pedagogy is needed. Based on learning theory, we propose that students' social entrepreneurship actions will depend on their learning about CSR and their absorptive capacity. We propose that instructors and higher education institutions can enhance this absorptive capacity by exploiting Web 2.0 technologies. We tested our proposition with a sample of 425 university students using structural equation modeling and found support for the proposed relationships.

According to the first ("reputation hypothesis"), patterns of agreement and disagreement among participants in open production communities are explained by differences in individual reputation for quality of contribution. The reputation hypothesis predicts that participants will tend to agree with more reputable others and disagree with less reputable others thus contributing to establish a stable open production community. According to the second hypothesis ("balance hypothesis"), patterns of agreement and disagreement are explained by membership in sub-communities of "friends" and "enemies." The balance hypothesis predicts that participants in open production communities will agree mainly with friends and disagree mainly with enemies, regardless of considerations about reputation for the quality of their contributions. In this paper, we examine which one of these hypotheses is more consistent with patterns of positive and negative interaction events observed during the production of the complete set of 1,206 English-language Wikipedia articles officially considered controversial. We specify and estimate new models for signed and weighted relational event networks predicting the probability that a user deletes the contributions of another user - thus expressing personal disagreement - and/or protects the contributions of another user against deletion from third parties - thus expressing personal agreement. In an analysis of positive and negative interaction among Wikipedia contributors consisting of more than 60 million observations, we find strong support for the balance hypothesis and for the predictions of the reputation hypothesis that are more consistent with alter-centric interpretations of social status as conferred by alters through observable acts of deference.

J	Roschk, H; Hosseinpour, M				Roschk, Holger; Hosseinpour, Masoumeh			Pleasant Ambient Scents: A Meta-Analysis of Customer Responses and Situational Contingencies	JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						pleasant ambient scents; meta-analysis; expenditures; in-store customer experience; atmospheric stimuli	PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS; OLFACTORY CUES; BEHAVIOR; STORE; ODOR; IMPACT; MUSIC; CONGRUENCY; QUALITY; SMELL	To prevail in the fierce competition of in-store experiences, some firms have focused on providing pleasant ambient scents. However, equivocal results on scent effects make generalizations and managerial guidance uncertain. While efforts to consolidate research findings have been conducted, a comprehensive quantitative integration is notably lacking. In this meta-analysis, the authors integrate 671 available effects from ambient scent experiments and show that exposure to pleasant ambient scents on average produces a substantial increase in the level of customer responses (3%-15%). The effects of ambient scent depend on situational contingencies and are, for example, positively related to congruency, unidimensional aroma structure, ascribed familiarity of a scent, service exchange, proportion of female participants in the sample, and imagined (vs. fictitious) offering. Thus, the authors estimate expenditures would increase by 3% and 23% for an average and a most favorable condition, respectively. The authors also examine effect patterns, identifying, for example, ambient scent as more cognitive than affective and nonlinear effects of perceived concentration. Using the insights, they develop a research agenda and provide clear strategic guidance to leverage ambient scent effects.

J	Charoensukmongkol, P; Tarsakoo, P				Charoensukmongkol, Peerayuth; Tarsakoo, Penpattra			Dimensions of social media marketing capabilities and their contribution to business performance of firms in Thailand	JOURNAL OF ASIA BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						Small- and medium-sized enterprises; Social media; Firm performance; Marketing; Marketing strategy; Capabilities; Resource-based view; e-Business; Survey method; Strategic management	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; EXPORT VENTURES; BRAND EQUITY; USAGE; ORIENTATION; RESOURCES; STRATEGY; ADOPTION; MODEL	Purpose This paper aims to explore the contribution of social media marketing capability on business performance of firms in Thailand. The conceptualization of social media marketing capability was developed using five aspects of the spanning capabilities of Day's strategic framework. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaire data were collected from business entrepreneurs in Thailand who attended seminar and training courses (N = 364). Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data. Findings Among five aspects of social media marketing capability, social media product development capabilities and social media marketing implementation capability were positively and significantly related to customer relationship performance and financial performance; social media marketing communication capability had a significantly positive relationship only with customer relationship performance, whereas social media planning capability was found to have a significantly positive relationship only with financial performance. However, the analysis did not find the significant relationship between social media pricing capability and the two aspects of firm performance. Research limitations/implications - First, the results were obtained using cross-sectional data collection. Second, the data were collected using convenience sampling. Third, the performance variables used in the analysis are perceptual measures. Finally, the study was only conducted in Thailand context and did not lend itself to any general applicability. Practical implications - This research suggests that it is important for Thai companies that rely on social media to develop marketing capabilities and learn how to incorporate social media into their marketing activities. Originality/value This study built a conceptual foundation of social media marketing capabilities based on Days strategic framework which provided a complete and comprehensive view about social media applications that can be integrated into different areas of marketing activities.

J	Augustine, G; Soderstrom, S; Milner, D; Weber, K				Augustine, Grace; Soderstrom, Sara; Milner, Daniel; Weber, Klaus			CONSTRUCTING A DISTANT FUTURE: IMAGINARIES IN GEOENGINEERING	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							GRAND CHALLENGES; CLIMATE; PERSPECTIVE; LEVEL; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; INSTITUTIONS; EXPECTATIONS; CREATION; THINKING; PARADOX	We develop the concept of the distant future as a new way of seeing the future in collective efforts. While a near future is represented in practical terms and concerned with forming expectations and goals under conditions of uncertainty, a distant future is represented in stylized terms and concerned with imagining possibilities under conditions of ambiguity. Management research on future-oriented action has developed around problems of the near future. To explore distant futures, we analyze the case of geoengineering, a set of planetary-scale technologies that have been proposed as solutions to the threat of climate change. Geoengineering has increasingly been treated as if it were a reality, despite continued controversy and the absence of any implementation. We find that societal-level imaginaries that were built on deeply held moral bases and cosmologies underpinned the conception of geoengineering, and that a dialectic process of discursive attempts to reconcile oppositional imaginaries increased the concreteness and credibility of geoengineering so that it has increasingly been treated as an "as-if" reality. We suggest that distant futures orient collective efforts in distinctive ways, not as concrete guides for action but by expressing critiques and alternatives, that can become treated as as-if realities.

J	Blagoev, B; Schreyogg, G				Blagoev, Blagoy; Schreyoegg, Georg			WHY DO EXTREME WORK HOURS PERSIST? TEMPORAL UNCOUPLING AS A NEW WAY OF SEEING	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							PATH DEPENDENCE; TIME; ENTRAINMENT; IDENTITY; ECONOMICS; RHYTHM; MODEL; POWER	This paper develops temporal uncoupling as a new way of seeing the puzzling persistence of extreme work hours, as well as the temporal relations of organizations and their environments. Drawing on a historical case study, we trace and analyze the genesis, reinforcement, and maintenance of extreme work hours in an elite consulting firm over a period of 40 years. We find that a small shift in temporal structuring mobilized two positive feedback processes. These processes consolidated a temporal order that increasingly uncoupled from the traditional workweek. Grounded in these findings, we make two contributions. First, we challenge the orthodox view of entrainment as an ideal synchronous relation between organizations and their environments. Instead, we offer temporal uncoupling as an alternative lens. It enables us to see how both synchrony and asynchrony are potentially viable options, which coexist and sometimes coconstitute each other. Second, we shed new light on temporality as a constitutive force that underpins extremework hours and offer a novel explanation of their persistence as a case of systemic temporal lock-in. We develop positive feedback as a mechanism that explains how small temporal shifts can become consolidated into hardly reversible temporal lock-ins.

RECONCEPTUALIZING WHAT AND HOW WOMEN NEGOTIATE FOR CAREER ADVANCEMENT	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							GENDER-DIFFERENCES; WORK; FAMILY; SALARY; MODEL; CONSEQUENCES; FLEXIBILITY; EMPLOYMENT; PSYCHOLOGY; MANAGEMENT	We propose a conceptual framework for expanding the scope of future research on the role of gender in career negotiations. Extant research on gender in career negotiations emphasizes women's disadvantages relative to men in compensation negotiations. We present an inductive study of what and how women negotiate for career advancement and the attainment of leadership positions in organizations, drawing on data from diverse samples of negotiation accounts by senior executive, mid-level, and early career professionals from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors and six world regions. Integrating insights from six studies, we propose a more comprehensive perspective on what men and women negotiate for career advancement, including their role development and work-family conflicts, as well as compensation. We also identify three distinct negotiating strategies-asking, bending, and shaping-that vary in the extent to which the negotiator conforms to, deviates from, or attempts to redefine organizational norms. Our analyses suggest that the choice of negotiating strategy has implications for men's and women's career progression, particularly for women's navigation of nontraditional career paths and men's and women's leadership claiming. We suggest new directions for research on the role of negotiation in career advancement and in promoting and mitigating gender inequality in organizations.

Genes, Gender Inequality, and Educational Attainment	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						genetics; gender; education; biodemography	COMPULSORY SCHOOLING LAWS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; SEX-DIFFERENCES; COHORT PROFILE; COMPLEX TRAITS; LIFE-COURSE; BODY-MASS; HERITABILITY; TWINS	Women's opportunities have been profoundly altered over the past century by reductions in the social and structural constraints that limit women's educational attainment. Do social constraints manifest as a suppressing influence on genetic indicators of potential, and if so, did equalizing opportunity mean equalizing the role of genetics? We address this with three cohort studies: the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS; birth years 1939 to 1940), the Health and Retirement Study, and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health; birth years 1975 to 1982). These studies include a "polygenic score" for educational attainment, providing a novel opportunity to explore this question. We find that within the WLS cohort, the relationship between genetics and educational outcomes is weaker for women than for men. However, as opportunities changed in the 1970s and 1980s, and many middle-aged women went back to school, the relationship between genetic factors and education strengthened for women as they aged. Furthermore, utilizing the HRS and Add Health, we find that as constraints limiting women's educational attainment declined, gender differences in the relationship between genetics and educational outcomes weakened. We demonstrate that genetic influence must be understood through the lens of historical change, the life course, and social structures like gender.

DYNAMIC SYSTEMS THEORY AND DUAL CHANGE SCORE MODELS: SEEING TEAMS THROUGH THE LENS OF DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							CUTTHROAT COOPERATION; MULTITEAM SYSTEMS; STRUCTURAL MODELS; PARENTAL DIVORCE; LATENT CHANGE; FIT INDEXES; EMPOWERMENT; PERFORMANCE; COMMITMENT; LEADERSHIP	Empirical research examining team development has long lagged behind purely conceptual work. Moreover, traditional designs and logics frequently employed in the organizational sciences generally preclude the possibility of studying the trajectories of various team properties. This is problematic as continuity, nonlinearity, and within-construct feedback are implicit in many eminent conceptualizations of teams. Hence, the present investigation integrates dynamic logic, theory, and methodology from the discipline of developmental psychology-wherein the nature of the topic has necessitated a more careful examination of change over time-into the organizational literature. As a product of this integration, we propose and test a novel theoretical perspective that provides several contributions to teams research. First, we extend theory that has thus far been primarily used to explain intraindividual development in children to detail three testable principles of dynamism in team properties. Second, and utilizing a within-construct logic, we demonstrate that teams are indeed dynamic systems, but that the extent to which any particular team property may be considered dynamic is contingent upon characteristics of the property itself. Finally, we illustrate how teams' unique pasts may be leveraged to predict their asymmetric reactions to disruptive events in the future by employing a contemporary modeling technique.

J	Usman, M; Ahmad, MI; Burgoyne, J				Usman, Muhammad; Ahmad, Malik Imran; Burgoyne, John			Individual and organizational learning from inter-firm knowledge sharing: A framework integrating inter-firm and intra-firm knowledge sharing and learning	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						inter-firm knowledge sharing; intra-firm knowledge sharing; individual learning; organizational learning; inter-firm trust; collaboration purpose	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; HIGH-RELIABILITY; TRUST; NETWORK; TRUSTWORTHINESS; CAPABILITIES; ACQUISITION; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE	Literature has highlighted but not explored links between knowledge sharing and learning at inter-firm and intra-firm levels. Using the single case of an aviation refuelling company as the basis for our research methodology and collecting data through 34 semi-structured interviews, we develop a framework that integrates knowledge sharing and learning at inter-firm and intra-firm levels. We show that intra-firm knowledge sharing capabilities facilitate the diffusion of inter-firm learning within organizations. Moreover, inter-firm trust manifests in different forms that affect individual and organizational learning. The purpose of collaboration determines what a firm learns or discards. The findings are important for organizations facing a shortage of skills. (c) 2018 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Predicting habitat suitability for basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) in UK waters using ensemble ecological niche modelling	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH			English	Article						Basking shark; Ensemble ecological niche modelling; MPA; Habitat suitability; Spatial analysis; Citizen science; Boat transect; Public sightings	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; ZOOPLANKTON; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; SIGHTINGS; ABUNDANCE; TRENDS; WHALE	The basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is an endangered species in the north-east Atlantic, having been historically over exploited. Whilst near-shore aggregation hotspots in the UK have been identified, robust knowledge on species distribution and abundance outside these areas remains limited. Research techniques, such as habitat modelling, could however be used to gain a greater knowledge of the species distribution to inform management plans to aid population recovery. For large mobile species gathering wide-scale distribution data can be financially and logistically challenging. In lieu of conducting an expensive UK-wide strategic survey for basking sharks, we use data from two regional-scale surveys, which were conducted in southwest England and western Scotland, in an Ensemble Ecological Niche Model (EENM) to produce a spatially-explicit map of habitat suitability. When compared against a similar to 20-year database of public sightings of basking sharks across UK coastal seas (to 6 nautical miles offshore), patterns of habitat suitability yielded a statistically significant agreement with areas known to support basking shark sightings. EENMs could be used to advise Marine Protected Area (MPA) selection, as well as to inform environmental impact assessments for offshore developments. The application of EENM outputs could be wide-reaching and benefit not only basking sharks but other large mobile marine species in the north-east Atlantic.

J	Bei, XS				Bei, Xiaoshu			Trademarks, specialized complementary assets, and the external sourcing of innovation	RESEARCH POLICY			English	Article						Trademarks; Complementary assets; External technology sourcing; Innovation	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; SERVICE MARKS; VALUE CREATION; FIRMS; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; COMMERCIALIZATION; CAPABILITIES; INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE	In this article, I study the relationship between valuable trademarks and a firm's technology sourcing strategy. The Profiting from Innovation (PFI) and Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) perspectives have generated competing predictions regarding firms' historical stock of valuable trademarks and their decision to pursue external technology sourcing. To conduct the empirical analysis, I use a sample of innovator firms in the manufacturing sectors from the Division of Innovative Labor survey, matched to the USPTO trademark data. Consistent with the TCE perspective, I find that firms with valuable trademarks are less likely to commercialize external inventions, and are likely to have lower innovation performance if they do so. I further show a boundary condition for PFI such that when firms are new entrants to an industry but already holding valuable trademarks, they are more likely to commercialize external innovations.

J	Carlson, J				Carlson, Jennifer			Revisiting the Weberian Presumption: Gun Militarism, Gun Populism, and the Racial Politics of Legitimate Violence in Policing(1)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							POLICE; STATE; POWER; PERCEPTIONS; PERSPECTIVE; DEMOCRACY; RACE	Focusing on police chiefs in three states, this study revisits the Weberian presumption of the state's monopoly on legitimate violence. Seventy-nine interviews with police chiefs in Arizona, Michigan, and California allow for an examination of their understanding of gun policy. Analysis reveals that they selectively embrace two frames of the state's relationship with legitimate violence: gun militarism for criminal gun activity associated with black and brown communities and drug- and gang-related crime and gun populism with respect to lawfully gun-owning Americans, often marked as white and middle class. Sensitive to state-level sociolegal regimes, gun populism takes the form of antielitism in gun-restrictive California, crime-fighting by proxy in gun-permissive Michigan, and co-policing in gun-lax Arizona. The racial politics of legitimate violence intersect with state-level gun policies selectively to erode police chiefs' investment in the state's monopoly on violence, demonstrating that gun politics is pertinent not only for understanding violence in the United States but also for understanding the racial complexity of U.S. policing.

J	Einhorn, F; Marnewick, C; Meredith, J				Einhorn, Frank; Marnewick, Carl; Meredith, Jack			Achieving strategic benefits from business IT projects: The critical importance of using the business case across the entire project lifetime	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project governance; Business case; Process group; Information technology; Project lifetime	MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK	Business projects with an information technology component are referred to here as 'business IT' projects. Their success rate is found to be unsatisfactory, resulting in wasteful expenditure running to billions of dollars annually. Literature indicates that sound business cases, used effectively throughout the project lifetime, underpin governance and have a major positive impact on the project success rate. However, it also suggests that business case processes are seldom used properly. The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which business case processes are used in practice, and to understand the implications of the pattern that emerges. The data analysis from a survey reveals that business case usage diminishes significantly after approval is given to proceed, with potentially serious negative consequences. The findings offer initial building blocks for project business case theory; they also give valuable insights to management as to the required processes and how to avoid the prevailing pitfalls and achieve the intended strategic project benefits.

J	Fabrizio, KR; Kim, EH				Fabrizio, Kira R.; Kim, Eun-Hee			Reluctant Disclosure and Transparency: Evidence from Environmental Disclosures	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						disclosure; obfuscation; ratings; environmental performance; climate change	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT; MARKET VALUE; PERFORMANCE; READABILITY; FLUENCY; IMPACT; SUSTAINABILITY; CONSTRUCTION; INFORMATION	Strategic management research increasingly examines firms' strategies for corporate environmental and social disclosures. There are benefits to being perceived as having superior environmental performance, but firms face increasing pressure to provide more complete disclosures, potentially exposing information that will be viewed negatively by external stakeholders. We examine linguistic obfuscation as a means to balance this tension. In particular, we argue that firms may intentionally make their disclosures more complex and harder to understand, thereby blurring the negative content and increasing information processing costs of the recipient. In the context in which an information intermediary actively collects information from firms and evaluates them, we find that firms with unfavorable news to disclose use linguistic obfuscation in information disclosure to manage the tension between the pressure for more complete disclosures and the desire to project a positive image. We further demonstrate that obfuscation lessens the negative impact of reporting negative information on environmental performance ratings given by information intermediaries. This suggests that firms can and do use linguistic tactics to influence environmental ratings.

Despite their beneficial values, the overall level of usage (take-up) remains relatively low compared to traditional modes. They are also challenging to evaluate due to behavioral, economical, political, and technical aspects. The literature lacks a methodology framework to guide the government transformation application to improve both internal processes of e-services and institutional transformation to advance relationships with stakeholders. This paper proposes a cognitive analytics management (CAM) framework to implement such transformations. The ambition is to increase users' take-up rate and satisfaction, and create sustainable shared values through provision of improved e-services. The CAM framework uses cognition to understand and frame the transformation challenge into analytics terms. Analytics insights for improvements are generated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A classification and regression tree is then applied to DEA results to identify characteristics of satisfaction to advance relationships. The importance of senior management is highlighted for setting strategic goals and providing various executive supports. The CAM application for the transforming Turkish e-services is validated on a large sample data using online survey. The results are discussed; the outcomes and impacts are reported in terms of estimated savings of more than fifteen billion dollars over a ten-year period and increased usage of improved new e-services. We conclude with future research. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We would like also thank the senior management of Turksat, namely President Ensar Gul and VP Halil Yesilcimen of Turksat for their advocacy and commitment to support the implementation of the various recommendations, without them, the project would not have achieved the e-government goals. The Husni Sawwaf Chair at the American University of Beirut for supporting also the project. Also special thanks go to the Euro Excellence in Practice Award committee for selecting this work to be among finalists at EURO 2015 conference, Glasgow, UK. Finally, sincere appreciations go to the guest editors and the anonymous referees for their critical comments and support that immensely improved the clarity of the presentation of the paper.

J	Nagle, F; Teodoridis, F				Nagle, Frank; Teodoridis, Florenta			Jack of all trades and master of knowledge: The role of diversification in new distant knowledge integration	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						diversification; exploration; innovation; recombination; specialization	COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; INNOVATION; MICROFOUNDATIONS; EXPLOITATION; EXPLORATION; PERFORMANCE; SEARCH; CAPABILITIES; UNCERTAINTY	Research Summary We consider the role of individual-level diversification as a mechanism through which skilled researchers engage in successful exploration-recognizing and integrating new knowledge external to one's domains of expertise. To approach an ideal experiment, we (a) employ a matching procedure and (b) exploit the unexpected adoption of Microsoft Kinect as a motion-sensing technology in research. We evaluate the impact of Kinect and its embodiment of new knowledge on a set of ability-matched, diversity-varying researchers without prior experience in motion-sensing and find that diversified researchers explore more successfully than their more specialized peers. We also examine the role of personal preferences and professional incentives as antecedents of diversification and find that culture, age and intellectual freedom are positively associated with the propensity to diversify successfully. Managerial Summary Organizations where R&D is core to driving competitive advantage face important tradeoffs when hiring researchers. Specifically, diverse combinations of knowledge generate the most impactful discoveries. Yet, coordinating such combinations increasingly requires larger teams as knowledge accumulation causes researchers to specialize in narrower areas. How should organizations achieve the best balance? We argue and show evidence that diversified researchers, individuals routinely criticized for their lack of knowledge depth, are more likely than specialized researchers of similar ability to integrate new knowledge from beyond their domains of expertise to create impactful innovations. Therefore, organizations aiming to create competitive advantage by pushing the boundaries of knowledge should carefully consider the nuanced tradeoffs between specialized and diversified researchers when strategizing about hiring the optimal types of expertise.

J	Dabic, M; Kiessling, T				Dabic, Marina; Kiessling, Timothy			The performance implications of knowledge management and strategic alignment of MNC subsidiaries	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Croatia; Knowledge management; MNC; MNC Subsidiaries	MARKET ORIENTATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATION; ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY; TRANSITION ECONOMY; EASTERN-EUROPE; DYNAMIC THEORY; PRODUCT	Purpose The purpose of this paper was to investigate antecedents and results of strategic choices of multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries in Croatia economy. Hence, the authors examined knowledge management and its association with performance. Additionally, they explored which of the strategies will be most likely chosen by subsidiaries in transitional economies that are characterized by market volatility and uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a survey of 131 MNC subsidiaries operating in Croatia. To test the theoretical correlation between knowledge management capabilities and strategic orientation, the authors used the ANCOVA method and controlled for industry, years in international business and firm size. Findings The results pointed out the recognized necessities for a specific alignment between environment, strategy and knowledge management capabilities. The findings also suggest that there is a positive relationship between knowledge management and performance. Social implications Other firms from Central and Eastern European and developed countries may compare their own environment, strategy and knowledge management practices in MNCs with findings from Croatia to be aware of similarities and market differences. Originality/value The strategic employment of knowledge acquisition, conversion and application are examined across firms using the Prospector, Analyzer, Defender and Reactor strategic orientations.

The retailer decides on shelf-space allocation for the product. Both the players benefit from the greening efforts of the manufacturer. In such a setting, we examine strategic decisions of the players and compare and contrast the performance of the decentralised supply chain with the centralised supply chain. We also examine the effect of collaborative mechanisms by modelling two contracts in which the retailer offers a transportation cost reduction effort based contract and a two-part tariff contract. We find that the decentralised supply chain leads to lower greening efforts and shelf-space allocation decisions. We also find that the contracts improve pack-size reduction effort, transportation cost reduction effort and shelf-space allocation, while also improving the profitability of individual players. The findings demonstrate a scope for supply chain collaboration between manufacturer-retailer pairs in this setting. The paper uniquely combines three critical elements in supply chains, namely, product design, transportation and retailing decisions, and aims to provide insights into the decision making of players considering environmental waste and pollution. The paper also reflects consumer behavior and trade-offs that the supply chain players face.

STRUCTURING REALITY THROUGH THE FAULTLINES LENS: THE EFFECTS OF STRUCTURE, FAIRNESS, AND STATUS CONFLICT ON THE ACTIVATED FAULTLINES-PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							SOCIAL IDENTITY; ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE; DIVERSITY FAULTLINES; SELF-CATEGORIZATION; DECISION-MAKING; TEAM DIVERSITY; DEMOGRAPHIC DISSIMILARITY; INFORMATION ELABORATION; COALITION-FORMATION; INTRAUNIT JUSTICE	We investigate how activated team faultlines represent an informal sensemaking structure through which teammates interpret their social reality. Constructed from intersubgroup comparisons, activated team faultlines likely result in ambiguous or illegitimate status perceptions. Thus, activated faultlines threaten team justice climate, which drives status conflict, impairing team performance. We explore the effects of team structure clarity in providing certainty or legitimacy around status and structure, ameliorating the negative effect of activated faultlines on team justice climate. We test our model using a multi-source (three sources), multi-wave cross-lagged design (four waves) on a sample of 271 employees and 41 leaders in 41 teams. We find that the negative relationship between activated faultlines and team performance is mediated by the team justice climate-status conflict causal chain. We also find that team structure clarity reduces activated faultlines' negative effect on team justice climate. Results highlight the value of using team faultlines, the social identity approach, and justice theories to understand how diverse teams interpret their social reality, which influences their performance. Furthermore, our research provides practical guidance to managers in building clear structures that minimize harmful effects of activated faultlines on justice perceptions and team performance.

IMPRESSION OFFSETTING AS AN EARLY WARNING SIGNAL OF LOW CEO CONFIDENCE IN ACQUISITIONS	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; JOB EMBEDDEDNESS; UPPER ECHELONS; SYMBOLIC MANAGEMENT; STOCK OWNERSHIP; FIRM REPUTATION; MARKET VALUE; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION	Researchers have long been interested in understanding the motives behind CEOs' actions. On the one hand, CEOs may pursue strategic actions because they are confident they will enhance firm value. Alternatively, CEOs may take actions even when they have low confidence in the value of those actions, perhaps driven by self-interest or social pressures. Although research suggests that CEO option exercises following an acquisition announcement are an ex post behavioral outcome of low CEO confidence in the acquisition's value-creation potential, prior research has not identified any ex ante signals shareholders can look for to assess acquiring CEOs' confidence when the acquisition is announced. We address this concern by exploring a potential early warning signal of low CEO confidence: impression offsetting. We theorize that impression offsetting-measured as other unrelated positive announcements made by the firm in the days immediately surrounding the acquisition announcement-may serve as an ex ante signal of low CEO confidence in the acquisition's value-creation potential, and, as such, will be positively associated with CEO option exercises, an ex post behavioral outcome of low confidence. We test our theory with a sample of 491 large acquisitions and find consistent support for our hypotheses.

J	Kim, K; Bui, L				Kim, Karl; Bui, Lily			Learning from Hurricane Maria: Island ports and supply chain resilience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Supply chain; Transportation; Hurricane; Disaster recovery; Islands	TRANSPORTATION; MANAGEMENT; PORTFOLIO; RECOVERY; SELECTION	The restoration of supply chain operations is critical to disaster recovery. When supply chains are disrupted by catastrophic events, island communities encounter problems with response and recovery different from their continental counterparts. Isolation, limited port capacity, lack of alternative facilities and dependence on imports increase the vulnerability of island communities. A focus on islands sheds light on broader challenges related to disaster risk reduction and resilience. This paper addresses these challenges in three ways. First, it connects the literature on supply chain management to disaster risk, recovery, and resilience. Second, it illustrates the unique vulnerabilities of island supply chains by examining two island communities - Puerto Rico and Hawai'i. They are exposed to similar hazards and threats including geographic isolation. Third, it offers key tactical, operational, and strategic actions on supply chain resilience based on the experiences from Hurricane Maria's impacts on Puerto Rico, directed toward emergency managers and planners working not just in island communities, but other isolated locations. A key lesson involves the importance of communications and coordination in restoring lifelines, networks, and social relations following disasters.

J	Kollmann, T; Stockmann, C; Linstaedt, JW				Kollmann, Tobias; Stoeckmann, Christoph; Linstaedt, Jana Wenka			Task Conflict, Narcissism and Entrepreneurial Capability in Teams Planning a Business: A Moderated Moderation Approach to Explaining Business Planning Performance	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; DEEP-LEVEL DIVERSITY; SELF-ESTEEM; DARK TRIAD; INTRAGROUP CONFLICT; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; VENTURE TEAMS; RISK-TAKING; MODEL; PERCEPTIONS	Drawing on the dynamic self-regulatory processing model of narcissism, we hypothesize that in teams planning a business, task conflict relates positively to business planning performance and that this link is reinforced by the team's narcissism. By integrating aspects of human capital theory, this brighter side of narcissism is amplified where the narcissism is aligned with entrepreneurial capability and the team members' belief in their entrepreneurial capability. The findings of the moderated moderation analysis examining 66 teams of entrepreneurship students support the study's assumptions and provide meaningful implications for social psychology and personality researchers in entrepreneurship.

J	Parast, MM; Golmohammadi, D				Parast, Mahour Mellat; Golmohammadi, Davood			Quality management in healthcare organizations: Empirical evidence from the baldrige data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Quality management; Healthcare quality; Malcolm baldrige national quality award (MBNQA); Structural equation modeling	PATIENT SATISFACTION; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; PUBLIC HOSPITALS; NATIONAL-QUALITY; PERFORMANCE DATA; IMPROVEMENT; IMPACT; EXCELLENCE; VALIDITY; CUSTOMER	The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of customer satisfaction and quality results in the healthcare industry using the Baldrige data. We use publicly available data on quality assessment of healthcare organizations that applied for the Baldrige award to examine two research questions: 1) whether the Baldrige model is a reliable and valid model for assessment of quality practices in healthcare organizations, and 2) to determine the relationship between quality practices and their impact on quality results in the healthcare organizations. Using structural equation modeling, the findings suggest that the Baldrige model is a valid and reliable quality assessment model for healthcare organizations. Consistent with previous studies, the findings suggest that the main driver of the system is leadership, which has a significant effect on all quality piactices in the healthcare industry. Controlling for the applicants' year, the findings indicate that 1) Information analysis and knowledge management has a significant impact on Quality results, 2) Workforce development and human resource management has a significant impact on both Customer focus and satisfaction and Quality results, and 3) Strategic planning for quality has a significant impact on Customer focus and satisfaction. The study provides insights and suggestions for healthcare organizations on how to improve their quality systems using the Baldrige model.

Exploratory scenario analysis for disaster risk reduction: Considering alternative pathways in disaster risk assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disaster risk; Scenarios; Stakeholder engagement; Simulation modelling; Risk assessment	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT; FLOOD RISK; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; GLOBAL SCENARIOS; FUTURE; FRAMEWORK; MITIGATION	Disaster risk is a combination of natural hazards, along with society's exposure and vulnerability to them. Therefore, to ensure effective, long-term disaster risk reduction we must consider the dynamics of each of these components and how they change over extended periods due to population, economic and climatic drivers, as well as policy and individual decisions. This paper provides a methodology to capture these factors within exploratory scenarios designed to test the effectiveness of policy responses to reduce disaster losses. The scenarios developed and subsequent analysis of them combine knowledge and insight from stakeholders and experts, and make use of simulation modelling to enable scenarios with qualitative and quantitative elements to be integrated within risk assessment processes and contribute to strategic risk treatments. The methodology was applied to a case-study in Greater Adelaide, Australia, and used to assess how disaster risk for earthquakes, bushfire and coastal inundation changes from 2016 to 2050 under five exploratory scenarios for the future of the region. This analysis can be applied more broadly to consider how future risks impact on regional viability, and suitability for investment related to the need to gain a better understanding of governmental and organisational exposure to physical risks.

Endothelial cells (ECs) acquired a fibroblast-like phenotype and contributed to myofibroblast generation through the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) process. Of note, human adult renal stem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) enhance the tubular regenerative mechanism during AKI but little is known about their effects on ECs. Following LPS exposure, ECs proliferated, decreased EC markers CD31 and vascular endothelial cadherin, and up-regulated myofibroblast markers, collagen I, and vimentin. The coculture with ARPCs normalized the EC proliferation rate and abrogated the LPS-induced EndMT. The gene expression analysis showed that most of the genes modulated in LPS-stimulated ARPCs belong to cell activation and defense response pathways. We showed that the ARPC-specific antifibrotic effect is exerted by the secretion of CXCL6, SAA4, and BPIFA2 produced after the anaphylatoxin stimulation. Next, we investigated the molecular signaling that underlies the ARPC protective mechanism and found that renal progenitors diverge from differentiated tubular cells and ECs in myeloid differentiation primary response 88-independent pathway activation. Finally, in a swine model of LPS-induced AKI, we observed that activated ARPCs secreted CXCL6, SAA4, and BPIFA2 as a defense response. These data open new perspectives on the treatment of both sepsis- and endotoxemia-induced AKI, suggesting an underestimated role of ARPCs in preventing endothelial dysfunction and novel strategies to protect the endothelial compartment and promote kidney repair.-Sallustio, F., Stasi, A., Curci, C., Divella, C., Picerno, A., Franzin, R., De Palma, G., Rutigliano, M., Lucarelli, G., Battaglia, M., Staffieri, F., Crovace, A., Pertosa, G.

J	Todaro, NM; Testa, F; Daddi, T; Iraldo, F				Todaro, Niccolo Maria; Testa, Francesco; Daddi, Tiberio; Iraldo, Fabio			Antecedents of environmental management system internalization: Assessing managerial interpretations and cognitive framings of sustainability issues	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Environmental management system; Substantive internalization; ISO 14001; EMAS	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ISO 14001; SELF-REGULATION; TRADE-OFFS; PERFORMANCE; ADOPTION; GREEN; ORGANIZATIONS; DRIVERS; EMAS	Drawing on Bansal & Roth's model of ecological responsiveness, the study investigates how environmental managers' cognitive framings of sustainability issues and interpretations of field-level contextual factors affect decision-making processes with regard to environmental management system (EMS) internalization. Using data from a survey questionnaire of 457 ISO 14001-certified and EMAS-registered European companies, the research analyses the influence of managers' perceptions of contextual factors (Le. environmental issue salience and governmental regulatory incentives) and managers' cognitive traits (Le. managers' environmental concern and cognitive framings of environmental practices) on internalization. The results highlight that, while managers' perceived stakeholders' concern for the natural environment directly influences substantive internalization, governmental regulatory reliefs fail to influence the internalization of EMS. Similarly, managers' environmental concern emerges as an antecedent of internalization, while managers' adherence to an alignment logic between economic and environmental objectives does not contribute to internalization. Furthermore, the study contributes to the conceptualization of substantive internalization of environmental practices, by highlighting the existence of two distinct dimensions of EMS internalization, i.e. operational and strategic internalization.

Thereby this sector plays a significant role within the transformation process of economic systems, yet the capacities of it remain up till now underestimated. This paper suggests a holistic approach to assess transformation potential of the supply chain and logistics sector towards more sustainable economic systems while defining innovative business strategies to meet future macroeconomic developments. This is achieved through an integrated assessment of production and consumption systems, considering the interests of the key stakeholders. Moreover, the paper combines advanced methods to develop future macroeconomic scenarios and to assess the strategic business opportunities of the supply chain and logistics sector addressing societal developments, e.g. new consumption patterns. The analysis relies on modern theories of Environmental and Ecological Economics, contributing to transformation theories. Moreover, the innovative role of supply chain and logistics management in achieving sustainable macroeconomic goals at regional and international levels is addressed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic capabilities of logistics service providers: antecedents and performance implications	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Firm performance; Organizational learning; Dynamic capabilities; Supply chain orientation	MARKET ORIENTATION; ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; LEARNING ORIENTATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; EVOLUTION; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT; DRIVEN	Purpose Dynamic capabilities (DC) have been linked to firm competitive advantage, but the ways in which firms can create and build these DC are still not clear. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model with organizational learning (OL) and supply chain orientation (SCO) as antecedents of dynamic logistics capabilities and firm performance as the outcome. The study tests this model on a sample of logistics service firms. Design/methodology/approach Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data collected from 103 logistics firms drawn from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transportation of Hong Kong. Findings Results show that OL directly enhances DC and indirectly through SCO. The relationship between OL and SCO is stronger than the relationship between OL and DC. DC are positively related to logistics firm performance. Research limitations/implications - The study relied on perceptual and self-reported data from senior management. Relationships among variables may also be inflated by common method variance but efforts were taken to reduce this threat. Practical implications - Logistics firms should promote a learning culture in the organization. Organization learning enhances a firm's willingness to change and innovate. It also helps employees to gain a better understanding of clients' supply chains and possibilities. SCO helps the firm to direct its reconfiguration and renewal efforts where the returns are the highest. Originality/value There is scant empirical research on the antecedents of DC outside of manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services. The study focused on the logistics services industry. SCO, a necessary strategic orientation for firms in the supply chain, has not been empirically investigated in the previous research. This study addressed these gaps in the literature and contributes to the understanding of the factors giving rise to DC.	[Chen, Ivy S.

J	Jiao, H; Yang, JF; Zhou, JH; Li, JZ				Jiao, Hao; Yang, Jifeng; Zhou, Jianghua; Li, Jizhen			Commercial partnerships and collaborative innovation in China: the moderating effect of technological uncertainty and dynamic capabilities	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dynamic capabilities; Collaborative innovation; Commercial partnership; Technological uncertainty	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY; DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION; INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; SUPPLIER INTEGRATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY	Purpose The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the extent to which two types of commercial partnerships (business partner and non-business partner) affect the collaborative innovation of firms in emerging economies. Specifically, the roles of two commercial partnerships are investigated. Additionally, the study explores the moderating effect of external technological uncertainty and internal dynamic capabilities on the relationship between two commercial partnerships and on collaborative innovation. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 370 high-tech firms in China, the authors applied the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach to model these relationships. Findings The findings reveal opportunities and challenges for companies according to two intensities of commercial partnership for collaborative innovation. The partnership contribution to innovation and competiveness is different within the two routes and ranges. The findings indicate that (1) intense commercial relationships with business partners have a stronger positive significant impact on collaborative innovation than those with non-business partners and (2) non-business partners have a weaker positive impact on collaborative innovation at high external technological uncertainty. It was also found that (3) the positive impact of business partners on collaborative innovation is weakened when a firm has high dynamic capabilities, whereas the positive impact of non-business partners is strengthened. Research limitations/implications - Insight into the roles of two commercial partnerships in achieving collaborative innovation facilitates the advancement of the theoretical understanding of the circumstances under which cooperative innovation can be more effective under different partnerships. Originality/value A key strategic question is whether comprehensiveness enables firms to make better strategic decisions in various environments. In the process of innovation, companies must choose different types and quantities of partners, and they must regulate their partners' innovative behavior by establishing a corresponding network structure and relationship rules. The current study focuses on analysis of how different intensities of commercial partnerships affect collaborative innovation. This research provides a theoretical framework that creates a new classification of commercial relations with regard to collaborative innovation, and it highlights the difference between the two types of partnerships. This study finds that there are many problems in the selection of innovative partners in China's high-tech companies. Therefore, companies should strengthen their understanding of cooperative innovation, and they should build and manage highly efficient innovation networks. This study helps companies, high-tech industry associations, academia and government to take enhanced, informed actions.

Design/methodology/approach Data comprising various aspects of customer-to-customer (C2C) co-creation practices of festival visitors were collected across five UK-based festivals, using participant observation and semi-structured interviews with naturally occurring social units (individuals, couples and groups). Data were analysed using a qualitative thematic analysis procedure within QSR NVivo 10. Findings Private, sociable, tribal and communing practice segments are identified and profiled, using the interplay of specific subject- and situation-specific practice elements to highlight the "minimum" conditions for each C2C co-creation practice. Unlike traditional segments, practice segment membership is shown to be fluid and overlapping, with fragmented consumers moving across different practice segments throughout their festival experience according to what makes most sense at a given time. Research limitations/implications - Although practice-based segmentation is studied in the relatively limited context of C2C co-creation practices at festivals, the paper illustrates how this approach could be operationalised in the initial qualitative stages of segmentation research. By identifying how the interplay of subject- and situation-specific practice elements affects performance of practices, managers can facilitate relevant practice-based segments, leading to more sustainable business. Originality/value The paper contributes to segmentation literature by empirically demonstrating the feasibility of practice-based segments and by evaluating the use of practice-based segmentation on a strategic, procedural and operational level. Possible methodological solutions for future research are offered.

Connecting Eastern and Western Perspectives on Management: Translation of Practices Across Organizations, Institution and Geographies	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						cultural differences; management practices; theoretical reflection; transfer and evolution	INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; LEADERSHIP THEORY; EMERGING MARKETS; BUSINESS; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; EXPLANATIONS	The exchange of academic knowledge increasingly flows in both directions, from West to East and East to West. The result is a rich and ever increasing development of theory and understanding of practice, which is expected only to gain further momentum in the future. This paper seeks to help establish a foundation for further development of this fertile exchange of ideas between East and West. We reflect on the research focus of the main theories in management studies in East and West. We discuss the topics of East and West in selected areas of management studies, including competitive strategy, strategic leadership, and the human resource management to offer avenues for future research. Translating practices between the two contexts creates institutional, leadership, strategy and organizational challenges while providing new promising research avenues and opportunities to integrate East and West perspectives. We also offer a more critical view on the relationship between West and East, focusing specifically on the role of power and power relations in making sense of how management and organization studies treat issues of cultural, institutional and philosophical divergence.

Taking stock of the literature on product categories and drawing on the distinction between the faculties of knowing and judging, we elaborate a framework that accounts for how and why market actors include or exclude normative attributes in a product category definition. Based on a field study of the development of socially responsible investment (SRI) funds in France, we describe the phases and conditions of a judgment framework for category definition for both established and nascent categories. We discuss implications for research on product categories and the workings of markets more broadly.

Certain abdominopelvic cancer surgeries are associated with a six to 14-fold increased risk of DVT versus surgeries for benign disease, and extended thromboprophylaxis using perioperative LMWHs may further reduce VTE rates over standard duration administration. This review assesses the value of extended low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis as a recommended strategy after abdominopelvic cancer surgery. Data sources: Six eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), seven meta-analyses (MAs), and five nonrandomized cohort studies were identified evaluating extended versus standard thromboprophylaxis following abdominopelvic cancer surgery. Findings and conclusions: Available evidence showed significantly reduced rates of VTE for extended versus standard LMWH thromboprophylaxis following abdominopelvic cancer surgery, with some studies showing trends toward reduced rates of symptomatic VTE events.

J	Teixeira, GFG; Canciglieri, O				Gomes Teixeira, Grazielle Fatima; Canciglieri Junior, Osiris			How to make strategic planning for corporate sustainability?	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Sustainability; Corporate sustainability; Strategic planning; Maturity model; Product Development Process	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; ECODESIGN IMPLEMENTATION; ECO-DESIGN; INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS; GREEN; MODEL	Sustainability issues have been force companies to change how they think about their business models if they want to keep a competitive advantage. However, despite the diversity of tools for sustainable production, the integration of its concept has not yet reached a significant number of companies around the world. The reason for this is the need of more knowledge about sustainability integration' importance to the company in the long term, the difficulty to identify the initial point to changes or the difficulty to structure this advance in the improvement process. Based on this scenario, this paper presents the Strategic Planning method for the Sustainability Integration in the Product Development Process which aims to guide, facilitate and accelerate the sustainability integration into the product development process by make changes in the business management with the support of the strategic planning and the continuous improvement process. It is a maturity method that can be applied by any type of company because of their use of a common set of evaluation parameters. The benefits from this research are the improvement, deepening, and systematization of the sustainability issues in the product development process through a maturity view of the strategic planning concept, and, the development of a new guide to assessing the companies' strengths and weakness to drive the implementation of a shared vision between multiples teams. Also, the application of the conceptual method is presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Migliori, S; Pittino, D; Consorti, A; Lucianetti, L				Migliori, Stefania; Pittino, Daniel; Consorti, Augusta; Lucianetti, Lorenzo			The relationship between Entrepreneurial Orientation, Market Orientation and Performance in University Spin-Offs	INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Entrepreneurial orientation; Market orientation; Performance; University spin-offs	STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS; LEARNING ORIENTATION; TEAM COMPOSITION; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; VENTURES; IMPACT; FIRMS	The paper aims to examine the relationship between Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO), Market Orientation (MO) and performance in University Spin-Offs (USOs). Initially, the paper, assesses the existence of a moderating effect of MO in the relationship between EO and performance, next, it analyses the mediation role of MO between EO and performance. To strengthen paper results, we test our hypotheses on a cross-sectional sample of 162 Italian USOs using both perceived and objective performance. Findings suggest that there is no synergistic effect of MO and EO as mutually independent constructs. Instead, our evidences support the idea that EO and MO in USOs occur within the same learning process. Both EO and MO support USO performance, but MO cannot occur without EO as an antecedent condition. At the same time, a significant portion of the EO contribution to performance occurs through MO.

J	Petriglieri, JL; Obodaru, O				Petriglieri, Jennifer Louise; Obodaru, Otilia			Secure-base Relationships as Drivers of Professional Identity Development in Dual-career Couples	ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY			English	Article						secure-base relationships; professional identity development; dual-career couples; dual-earner couples	ADULT ATTACHMENT; WILL FOLLOW; WORK; FAMILY; SELF; GENDER; COMMITMENT; LEADERSHIP; DYNAMICS; BELIEFS	Through a qualitative study of 50 dual-career couples, we examine how partners in such couples shape the development of each other's professional identities and how they experience and interpret the relationship between those identities. We found that the extent to which and how partners shaped each other's professional identities depended on the couple's attachment structure, that is, whether one partner-or both-experienced the other as a secure base. Someone comes to regard another person as a secure base when he or she experiences the other as both dependably supportive and encouraging of his or her exploratory behavior. Couples who had a unidirectional secure-base structure experienced conflict between the development of their professional identities. The partner who received a secure base pursued ongoing professional identity development, while the partner who provided a secure base foreclosed it. Couples who had a bidirectional secure-base structure experienced mutual enhancement of their professional identity development. Both partners engaged in it and expanded their professional identity by incorporating attributes of their partner's. Building on these findings, we develop a model of professional identity co-construction in secure-base relationships that breaks new theoretical ground by exploring interpersonal identity relationships and highlighting their roots in the secure-base structure of a dyadic relationship.

J	Vega, A; Chiasson, M				Vega, Arturo; Chiasson, Mike			A comprehensive framework to research digital innovation: The joint use of the systems of innovation and critical realism	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Digital innovation; Unit of analysis; Systems of innovation; Critical realism; Danermark et al.'s staged model; Morphogenetic approach	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; NATIONAL SYSTEMS; STRATEGY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; TECHNOLOGY; ADOPTION; AGENDA; COLLABORATION; DETERMINANTS; ORGANIZATION	This study addresses calls to expand the boundaries of digital innovation research at multiple levels of society to comprehensively study the structure and evolution of innovation processes and outcomes. We contribute by proposing a framework composed of systems of innovation (SIs)(1) as an alternative and holistic conceptual base and unit of analysis, which accounts for the interconnected components located beyond the organizational microenvironments that ultimately affect innovation in organizations. Given the compatibility of SIs and the ontology of critical realism (CR)(2) as well as some flaws in SI research practice, we also use critical realist research approaches to guide the study of the state and transformation of SIs. We further explain the joint use of SIs and CR by applying them to the area of information systems innovation diffusion.

J	Zhang, YF; He, B; Guo, LL; Liu, DC				Zhang, Yafeng; He, Bin; Guo, Lanlan; Liu, Daochen			Differences in Response of Terrestrial Water Storage Components to Precipitation over 168 Global River Basins	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Statistical forecasting; Anomalies; Trends	GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; SATELLITE GRAVIMETRY; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; CLIMATE EXPERIMENT; GRAVITY RECOVERY; NORTHWEST INDIA; SOIL-MOISTURE; GRACE DATA; VARIABILITY; VEGETATION	A time lag exists between precipitation P falling and being converted into terrestrial water. The responses of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and its individual components to P over the global scale, which are vital for understanding the interactions and mechanisms between climatic variables and hydrological components, are not well constrained. In this study, relying on land surface models, we isolate five component storage anomalies from TWS anomalies (TWSA) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission (GRACE): canopy water storage anomalies (CWSA), surface water storage anomalies (SWSA), snow water equivalent anomalies (SWEA), soil moisture storage anomalies (SMSA), and groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA). The responses of TWSA and of the individual components of TWSA to P are then evaluated over 168 global basins. The lag between TWSA and P is quantified by calculating the correlation coefficients between GRACE-based TWSA and P for different time lags, then identifying the lag (measured in months) corresponding to the maximum correlation coefficient. A multivariate regression model is used to explore the relationship between climatic and basin characteristics and the lag between TWSA and P. Results show that the spatial distribution of TWSA trend presents a similar global pattern to that of P for the period January 2004-December 2013. TWSA is positively related to P over basins but with lags of variable duration. The lags are shorter in the low- and midlatitude basins (1-2 months) than those in the high-latitude basins (6-9 months). The spatial patterns of the maximum correlations and the corresponding lags between individual components of the TWSA and P are consistent with those of the GRACE-based analysis, except for SWEA (3-8 months) and CWSA (0 months). The lags between GWSA, SMSA, and SWSA to P can be arranged as GWSA > SMSA >= SWSA. Regression analysis results show that the lags between TWSA and P are related to the mean temperature, mean precipitation, mean latitude, mean longitude, mean elevation, and mean slope.

J	Soliman, S; Anchor, J; Taylor, D				Soliman, Samar; Anchor, John; Taylor, David			The international strategies of universities: deliberate or emergent?	STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Internationalisation; universities; deliberate and emergent strategies	HIGHER-EDUCATION; CURRICULUM; DESIGN	The internationalisation of higher education, which has developed from a number of separate initiatives to become a strategic objective in its own right, has not been investigated from a strategic organisational perspective. Case studies of four English universities were developed via a Grounded Theory methodology. Mintzberg and Waters' [1985. "Of Strategies, Deliberate and Emergent." Strategic Management Journal 6 (3): 257-272] 'deliberate' and 'emergent' strategies were used to analyse the trajectories of the international strategies of the case study universities. It was found that the international strategies were deliberate in each strategic period, whereas they were emergent over a longer time frame. Internationalisation has gone through three phases, as the approaches of universities to this phenomenon have matured and progressed from operational to strategic. A conceptual model which describes the trajectory of the international strategies of these English universities is developed and is a major addition to the internationalisation literature. Future research should examine the applicability of the model to other countries.

The authors apply bibliometric methods to that end -in particular, document citation and co-citation analyses (DCAs)- so that they can try and identify the main research lines within the aforementioned scientific field or domain; in other words, the 'intellectual structure' of the discipline examined. Social networks analysis was also used to carry out the representation or visualization of such structure or knowledge base. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the research undertaken, since the study field still keeps its characteristic diversity and interdisciplinarity or the need to integrate a variety of theoretical frameworks or approaches into the development of a widely-accepted theory about the field under study become evident. Amongst these theories would be the new institutional theory, the strategic theory or perspective or others such as the transaction cost theory or the agency theory, applied to the context of internationalization and to the field of international business, on whose integration the future development of this field may largely depend.

J	Jain, P; Saxena, A				Jain, Pooja; Saxena, Akash			An opposition theory enabled moth flame optimizer for strategic bidding in uniform spot energy market	ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL-JESTECH			English	Article						Moth flame optimizer; Strategic bidding; Market clearing price; Price volatility; Exercise of market power	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH; ALGORITHM	Power generating companies have an opportunity to maximize their profit in electricity market by selling the energy at competitive prices under incomplete information of other rivals behavior. In a day-ahead energy market, Generating Company (GENCOs) sells the energy at optimal bid prices. To calculate the bid prices optimally and for maximizing the profit of generating company, this paper presents a solution for strategic bidding problem which is based on opposition theory enabled moth flame optimizer (OB-MFO). In this work, a new opposition theory enabled moth flame optimizer is proposed which have the additional concept of oppositional feature. First OB-MFO algorithm is tested on 22 benchmark and Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC-2017) functions, then it is applied to bidding problem of standard IEEE-14 bus (Test Case-1) and 7 generator power system (Test Case-2). The strategic bidding scheme for a generating company for single and multi hour trading duration in a day-ahead market is formulated. The major findings of the proposed approach are market clearing price (MCP), load dispatch and bid prices of five different blocks of different capacities. The meaningful comparison of the bidding results of other optimization techniques are presented.

Cloudinid taxa, including the terminal Ediacaran index fossil Cloudina, are the most well studied of these Ediacaran tubular forms due to their global palaeogeographical distribution. Recent reports revealed ecosystems of tubicolous organisms from the Great Basin region, Nevada, USA, and assigned taxa to such genera as Conotubus, Gaojiashania and Wutubus, well known from contemporaneous Chinese deposits. Appreciating the role that these organisms may have played in the evolutionary history of metazoans and recognizing their potential global distribution, however, requires careful taxonomic study. Here, we detail pyritized fossils from the Deep Spring and Wood Canyon formations of Esmeralda and Nye counties, Nevada, USA, respectively. Our investigation focused on the most abundant tubular taxon from the Nevada sites, which was previously generically assigned to Conotubus. While outwardly similar in morphology to this Gaojiashan taxon, our investigation determines that those fossils previously figured as Conotubus are instead two distinct taxa. The first represents a new species of Saarina - Saarina hagadorni sp. nov. - a genus previously known only from the East European platform, and the second is established as a novel genus and species, Costatubus bibendi gen. et sp. nov.

J	Meijers, MJ; van der Veer, H				Meijers, Maurits J.; van der Veer, Harmen			MEP Responses to Democratic Backsliding in Hungary and Poland. An Analysis of Agenda-Setting and Voting Behaviour	JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES			English	Article						European Union; European Parliament; roll-call voting; issue competition; democratic backsliding	PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS; EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT; PARTIES; EU; SAFEGUARDS; OVERSIGHT; RECORD; UNION; VOTES	The governments of Hungary and Poland have been accused of sliding toward semi-authoritarianism. Systematic analyses of the responses of political actors at the EU level to these instances of alleged democratic backsliding are scarce, however. This article therefore investigates the responses of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to the issue of the quality of democracy and the rule of law in Hungary and Poland. On the basis of data on parliamentary questions and motions for resolutions, we analyse who puts these issues on the European Parliament's (EP's) internal agenda and what positions legislators subsequently take in votes on resolutions. We find that both ideological preferences and strategic interests determine MEPs' responses to democratic backsliding. Our findings are important for research on EU responses to democratic backsliding in EU member states as well as for the literature on party competition in the EP.

Previous research has identified two distinct between-parent reminiscing styles, wherein parents who are more elaborative (vs. repetitive) have children with more optimal outcomes. To date, however, research has not examined how parents and children talk about past painful experiences nor compared parent-child reminiscing about past painful versus other distressing events despite key developmental differences in how young children respond to pain versus sadness in others. This study aimed to fill that gap. Methods Seventy-eight children aged 4 to 7 years underwent a tonsillectomy. Two weeks postsurgery, children and one of their parents discussed past autobiographical events (i.e., the tonsillectomy, another painful event, a sad event). Parent-child conversations were coded using established coding schemes to capture parental reminiscing style, content, and autonomy support. Results Findings revealed robust differences in parent-child reminiscing about painful versus sad events. Parents were less elaborative, used less emotionally negative words and explanations, and were less supportive of their children's autonomy while reminiscing about past painful versus sad events. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that through reminiscing, parents may socialize children about pain in a way that is different from other distressing events (e.g., sadness). Future research should examine the influence of differential reminiscing about pain versus sadness on developmental and health outcomes.

SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY AND TALENT UTILIZATION OF WORKERS FROM POORER BACKGROUNDS: THE OVERLOOKED IMPORTANCE OF WITHIN-ORGANIZATION DYNAMICS	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT ANNALS			English	Article							CORE SELF-EVALUATIONS; SOCIAL-CLASS; JOB-PERFORMANCE; WOMENS UNDERREPRESENTATION; INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; CAREER SUCCESS; UNITED-STATES; BEHAVIOR; CHILDHOOD	Socioeconomic mobility, or the ability of individuals to improve their socioeconomic standing through merit-based contributions, is a fundamental ideal of modern societies. The key focus of societal efforts to ensure socioeconomic mobility has been on the provision of educational opportunities. We review evidence that even with the same education and job opportunities, being born into a poorer family undermines socioeconomic mobility because of processes occurring within organizations. The burden of poorer background might, ceteris paribus, be economically comparable to the gender gap. We argue that in the societal and scientific effort to promote socioeconomic mobility, the key context in which mobility is supposed to happen-organizations-and the key part of the life of people striving toward socioeconomic advancement-that as working adults-have been overlooked. We integrate the organizational literature, pointing to key within-organizational processes impacting objective (socioeconomic) success with research, some emergent in organizational sciences and some disciplinary, on when, why, and how people from poorer backgrounds behave or are treated by others in the relevant situations. Integrating these literatures generates a novel and useful framework for identifying issues people born into poorer families face as employees, systematizes extant evidence and makes it more accessible to organizational scientists, and allows us to lay the agenda for future organizational scholarship. Our hope is that the current review will help bring organizational science-in our view, the best equipped domain of scholarship for studying how workers from different backgrounds fare in organizations-to the forefront of the quest for promoting socioeconomic mobility of workers coming from poorer families.

Audience Perceptions of Authenticity in Nascent Crowdfunding Ventures	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						authenticity; nascent ventures; crowdfunding; organization theory	IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT; UNIVERSAL DIMENSIONS; LEGITIMACY; WARMTH; COMPETENCE; LEADERSHIP; JUDGMENTS; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS; MUSIC	The growing organizational scholarship on authenticity has drawn attention to both its symbolic and material consequences for-among other things-organizational status, identity, consumer ratings, and brand trust. However, our understanding of authenticity has tended to focus on the what-the attributes and content typically associated with authentic products, organizations, and experiences. We still lack a clear understanding of how audiences think about different aspects of authenticity and the mechanisms through which audiences' perceptions affect outcomes. In this paper we conduct three studies to investigate what people mean when they evaluate an organization as authentic, and what consequences this has for their support for the organization. In study 1 we build on existing theoretical frameworks to empirically derive three dimensions of authenticity: moral, idiosyncratic, and categorical. Using an online survey in the empirical setting of nascent crowdfunding ventures, we test the effects of these dimensions on audience members' funding decisions. We find that each of the authenticity dimensions proves significant for distinct support outcomes, notably by enhancing the likability (warmth) of the project and/or its creators in the minds of evaluators. Study 2 offers experimental support for the mediating role of likability-but not of assessments of competence-in explaining support for nascent organizations. Finally, study 3 provides evidence that regardless of which dimension of authenticity audiences draw on, the latter are positively related in their minds to an overall notion of authenticity. We draw implications for the study of authenticity as a multidimensional concept in organizations, with both perceptual and real consequences for the support of nascent ventures.

J	Vicol, M; Fold, N; Pritchard, B; Neilson, J				Vicol, Mark; Fold, Niels; Pritchard, Bill; Neilson, Jeffrey			Global production networks, regional development trajectories and smallholder livelihoods in the Global South	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Global production networks; smallholders; Global South; rural development; livelihood pathways	VALUE CHAINS; FAMILY FARMS; LABOR AGENCY; COFFEE; LAND; EMBEDDEDNESS; ASPIRATIONS; STANDARDS; DYNAMICS; POVERTY	Recent advances in global production network theory, known as GPN 2.0, provide a theoretically sophisticated framework for understanding the articulation of global production systems with regional development trajectories. However, this framework was largely derived from lessons out of empirical analyses of the strategic coupling and value capture trajectories of firms in certain manufacturing and service sector 'hot spots', primarily in East and Southeast Asia, and its wider applicability for other contexts remains uncertain. This paper aims to address this lacuna by examining the potential for GPN 2.0 to understand regional development trajectories in agricultural production landscapes in the Global South dominated by smallholder-based farms that generate outputs for national and international markets. The distinctive characteristics of smallholders throw up significant challenges for the explanatory applicability of GPN 2.0 for rural development, at least as it has been developed so far. A key challenge is that smallholders cannot be considered equivalent to 'firms' as conceived in GPN 2.0. To overcome this problem, this paper argues for bringing a livelihoods perspective to bear on GPN 2.0.

J	Caputo, A; Fiorentino, R; Garzella, S				Caputo, Andrea; Fiorentino, Raffaele; Garzella, Stefano			From the boundaries of management to the management of boundaries Business processes, capabilities and negotiations	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						BPM; Digitalization; Boundary management; Boundary capabilities; Partnership; Negotiation	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; VALUE CHAIN; BIG DATA; INTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; OPERATIONS STRATEGY; FIRM BOUNDARIES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine some of the new capabilities that are required for the facilitation of business processes management (BPM) in the current political and technological landscape. Specifically, the goal is to investigate the role of firm boundaries, from a business processes perspective, in new contexts in which the affirmation of digitalization requires more integration across a complex network of partners. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a review of relevant literature on BPM, firm boundaries and negotiation. By critically integrating this literature, a framework is developed with the objective of supporting the management of boundaries. Findings BPM, new competitive contexts, and the technological landscape require the development and management of boundary capabilities. Among these capabilities, "boundary management" - how managers coordinate resources, activities and business processes on the boundaries of the firm - should play a key role. Moreover, as managers must continuously interact with multiple partners in digital supply chains, the organizational model of negotiation serves as a means of effectively managing firm boundaries. Originality/value This study shifts the emphasis of BPM from the boundaries of management to the management of boundaries. By shedding light on new capabilities required, this paper enriches the BPM literature and can assist, on the one hand, in reconfiguring business processes in the new political and technological landscape and, on the other hand, in facilitating effective negotiation.

This article explores the potential challenges associated with this goal and future strategies for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.MethodsThirty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted with policy makers (n=17) and principal investigators (n=15) selected based on their involvement in malaria prevention, control and elimination in the GMS. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for qualitative content (thematic) analysis using QSR NVivo.ResultsAll respondents described current malaria control and elimination strategies, such as case detection and management, prevention and strengthening of surveillance systems as critical and of equal priority. Aware of the emergence of multi-drug resistance in the GMS, researchers and policy makers outlined the need for additional elimination tools. As opposed to a centralized strategy, more targeted and tailored approaches to elimination were recommended. These included targeting endemic areas, consideration for local epidemiology and malaria species, and strengthening the peripheral health system. A decline in malaria transmission could lead to complacency amongst funders and policy makers resulting in a reduction or discontinuation of support for malaria elimination. Strong commitment of policymakers combined with strict monitoring and supervision by funders were considered pivotal to successful elimination programmes.ConclusionAgainst a backdrop of increasing anti-malarial resistance and decreasing choices of anti-malarial regimens, policy makers and researchers stressed the urgency of finding new malaria elimination strategies. There was consensus that multi-pronged strategies and approaches are needed, that no single potential tool/strategy can be appropriate to all settings. Hence there is a need to customize malaria control and elimination strategies based on the better surveillance data.

J	Gannon, J; Paraskevas, A				Gannon, Judie; Paraskevas, Alexandros			In the line of fire: managing expatriates in hostile environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hostile environments; expatriates; international human resource management; risk; insurers; relocation specialists; protection	INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; HUMAN-RESOURCES; MANAGEMENT; TERRORISM; IMPACT; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; STRATEGY; INSIGHTS	This study explores best practice in the preparation and protection of strategic HRs deployed by Multinational corporations (MNCs) in hostile environments. By building on the literature from the areas of strategic and IHRM, expatriation, as well as risk and crisis management, the limitations and gaps of the extant research are highlighted. This provides a foundation for our investigation through a series of in-depth interviews with corporate executives, and insurers and relocation specialists with professional expertise in protecting and supporting HRs. This represents the first time such a detailed picture of the partnerships between MNCs and the specialists, required to deliver preparation and protection in hostile environments, has been depicted in the IHRM literature. The findings identify the challenges MNCs face when protecting their HRs and highlights the importance of specialist expertise, knowledge, and management. A framework for managing HRs within international hostile environments is subsequently developed offering an opportunity to systematically consider some of the ethical and strategic issues associated with the contemporary challenges of international mobility.

Assessing the impact of drop-shipping fulfilment operations on the upstream supply chain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						retail supply chain; drop-shipping; fulfilment; distribution system; service design	MODERATING ROLE; MULTICHANNEL DISTRIBUTION; ADMISSION POLICIES; OPTIMAL INVENTORY; BUILDING THEORIES; MEDIATING ROLE; MANAGEMENT; EXPLORATION; EXPLOITATION; RETAILER	The use of drop-shipping strategies, the practice where end-consumer orders are fulfilled directly from upstream suppliers upon a retailer's request, has grown in popularity. Due in large part to the growth of online retailing and the increased focus on integrated omni-channel fulfilment, retailers continue to express the strategic urgency of drop-shipping operations. In a broader sense, the concept of drop-shipping represents a new and emerging aspect of the supply chain triad phenomenon, where a buyer contracts with a supplier to deliver services directly to the buyer's customer. In order to more fully understand the operational nuances and upstream impacts of triadic service supply chain relationships, we adopt a qualitative research methodology to investigate suppliers in the service triad, a perspective that has been, to-date, under-researched. By exploring these issues in the context of the drop-shipping service triad, we more specifically shed light on the processes and operational challenges that suppliers face when assuming the bridge position in drop-shipping service triads. Therefore, this research extends the current drop-shipping literature by shifting the research focus away from retailers to suppliers; and hence, shifting the focus from strategic use of drop-shipping towards a more tactical/operational perspective by exploring those who carry out drop-shipping operations.

Strategic entrepreneurial behaviors: Construct and scale development	STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL			English	Article						construct development; entrepreneurial behaviors; entrepreneurial orientation; strategic entrepreneurship; structural equation modeling	ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH; ORIENTATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; SUGGESTIONS; PERFORMANCE; VARIABLES; RECOMMENDATIONS; IMPACT; ERROR	Research Summary Delineating between conservative and entrepreneurial firms to discern the causes, consequences, and benefits of entrepreneurial behavior is a key conversation in strategic entrepreneurship research. We introduce to this conversation a new construct, Strategic Entrepreneurship Behaviors, which we argue provides several theoretical and practical benefits to scholars exploring strategic entrepreneurship phenomenon. We develop and validate a measurement model for the Strategic Entrepreneurship Behaviors construct using a three-study design in Japan and in the United States. To facilitate reproducibility and replication of our results, we posted all data, R code, and Supporting Information on the Open Science Framework website available at . Managerial Summary The driving question in strategic entrepreneurship research is the impact of an organization's entrepreneurial activity on its performance. Answering this and related questions requires careful measurement of entrepreneurial activity. Existing measures and scales served the field well, but to answer questions establishing causal relationships, we need new constructs and measures robust to causal research designs. We introduce a new construct and scale, Strategic Entrepreneurial Behaviors, to capture the firm's exploitation of new product-market opportunities through the intended commercialization of its product innovations. We hope this new measure for a firm's entrepreneurial activity allows researchers to build more predictive theory, and to ask-and answer-new research questions that move the strategic entrepreneurship conversation forward.

Several attempts have been made to develop measurement and reporting systems for this relevant source of value, but managerial literature has highlighted the limits and difficulties of some of those endeavors. Integrated reporting, the general purpose of which is to provide transparent and integrated disclosure, has also entered this field with the aim of improving disclosure of intangibles, along with a strategic perspective on communication. An accurate description of a company's IC is indeed one of the focal elements of an integrated report. This paper describes an exploratory study based on the case study research method of three companies, all of which have applied the integrated reporting IIRC framework and are operating in different business contexts. Following a performative approach, the first aim of this work is to verify the ability of integrated reporting to support the mobilization of IC and to encourage companies to take advantage of this process. This should lead to positive effects on management and governance practices, with respect to both external and internal users. Additionally, from a critical and performative perspective, this research investigates how business context influences the processes of measurement, management, and reporting of IC.

However, new firms vary in their degree of strategic flexibility. In this paper, we analyze resource management practices founders can use to increase the strategic flexibility of their firms. We depict how specific resource management practices can augment the strategic flexibility of a new firm in addition to the strategic flexibility resulting from their actual resource base. Scrutinizing innovative resource management practices in various domains, our findings especially underline the importance of specific innovative resource management practices in the financial domain to increase the strategic flexibility. Managerial Summary For entrepreneurs being independent is frequently the ultimate goal. Still, founders frequently find themselves in constraints that limit their freedom to act. In this research, we analyze various activities founders can undertake to increase the strategic flexibility of their firm. We find that specific practices in the financial resource management domain focusing on cash-flow optimization such as quick customer payments and delaying supplier payments prove especially effective for providing more strategic flexibility for the nascent firms, while other ones do not appear to increase the strategic flexibility.

J	Cordeiro, GA; Ordonez, REC; Ferro, R				Cordeiro, Gabrielly Araujo; Cooper Ordonez, Robert Eduardo; Ferro, Rodrigo			THEORETICAL PROPOSAL OF STEPS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INDUSTRY 4.0 CONCEPT	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industry 4.0; Digitalization; Smart manufacturing systems; Business strategy	RESEARCH AGENDA; FUTURE; DIGITALIZATION; FRAMEWORK; CONTEXT	Goal: The purpose of this paper is to present a proposal of steps for the implementation of Industry 4.0 in the industrial context, considering management and operational aspects. The reason is to discuss that technological change is accompanied by many organizational implications, in which it is perceivable that some companies already experience strategic and operational turbulence due to the lack of understanding of the this structure's complexity. Design / Methodology / Approach: This study assumes an exploratory character because the subject of analysis is still in the knowledge-structuring phase. In this sense, data was collected from the literature review. Results: A theoretical proposal for the Industry 4.0 implementation framework is presented in flow format. It is organized in steps that cover the strategic and operational aspects during the implementation flow. Limitations of the investigation: The limitations of this study are directly related to its theoretical nature and the difficulty of finding tools that help in the execution of each proposed stage. Practical implications: However, based on theoretical insights, a trajectory of a transformation model is proposed, thus this research intends to show clearly and direct how companies can introduce the aspects of Industry 4.0 to their own benefit. Originality / Value: In this study, a conceptual model is structured, and it indicates a potential of application because it contributes to support and encourage the adoption of technologies and concepts indicated in the Industry 4.0 literature in a structured way.

J	Feldman, ER; Amit, R; Villalonga, B				Feldman, Emilie R.; Amit, Raphael; Villalonga, Belen			Family firms and the stock market performance of acquisitions and divestitures	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						acquisitions; corporate strategy; divestitures; family firms; shareholder returns	INTERNAL CAPITAL-MARKETS; AGENCY COSTS; SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; RISK-TAKING; CEO DUALITY; CASH FLOW; DARK SIDE; INVESTMENT	Research Summary: This paper explores the stock market performance of acquisitions and divestitures where both, one, or neither of the companies in the transaction are family firms. We find that acquirer shareholder returns are highest when family firms buy businesses from non-family firm divesters, especially when family chief executive officer (CEO) acquirers buy businesses from non-family CEO divesters. Additionally, divester shareholder returns are highest when family firms sell businesses to non-family firm acquirers, especially when family CEO divesters sell businesses to non-family CEO acquirers. These findings reveal that it is important to consider the characteristics of both the acquiring and divesting firms when analyzing acquisition and divestiture performance, and that the expected gains to family firm acquisitions and divestitures are driven by transactions in which the counterparties are non-family firms. Managerial Summary: This paper explores how investors react to acquisitions and divestitures where both, one, or neither of the companies in the deal are family firms. The stock market performance of acquiring firms is highest when family firms buy businesses from non-family firms, relative to the other three possible combinations of family and non-family firm acquirers and divesters. Likewise, the stock market performance of divesting firms is highest when family firms sell businesses to non-family firms, again relative to the other three possible combinations of family and non-family acquirers and divesters. These findings suggest that investors take into consideration the identities of both the acquiring and divesting firms when evaluating acquisitions and divestitures, and that this has significant implications for the expected performance gains of these transactions.

Second-order effects of CEO characteristics: How rivals' perceptions of CEOs as submissive and provocative precipitate competitive attacks	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						CEOs; competitive attacks; competitive dynamics; upper echelons; victimization	WORKPLACE VICTIMIZATION; PERCEIVED VICTIMIZATION; HIERARCHICAL STATUS; SITUATIONAL FACTORS; RESPONSE RATES; UPPER ECHELONS; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; DETERMINANTS; DYNAMICS	Research Summary; Integrating victimization into competitive dynamics and upper echelons theorizing, we develop and test theory articulating how rivals' perceptions of a CEO precipitate attacks on the CEO's firm. Rather than treating CEOs' characteristics solely as perpetrating action (a first-order effect, like research integrating upper echelons into competitive dynamics), we argue firms with CEOs possessing characteristics perceived as more submissive or more provocative are subject to more competitive actions directed toward their firms (a second-order effect, like victimization research). Empirical analyses of a sample of Fortune 500 CEOs supports our theorizing while interviews of executives corroborate our premise as well. Our framework offers a more complete and socialized understanding of CEOs' roles in competitive dynamics, providing both theoretical and practical insights as well as future research avenues. Managerial Summary: We articulate how CEOs possessing certain psychological, behavioral, and social characteristics may unknowingly precipitate competitive attacks on their firms. Our explanation integrates insights from victimology which explain how individuals are subject to more attacks if they possess characteristics others perceive as more submissive or more provocative. While prior research articulates that CEOs' characteristics affect decisions such as attacking rivals, integrating theories of victimization into this line of inquiry paints a more socialized view of why firms may be subject to competitive attacks as well. The logic and evidence we provide advances theoretical explanations of firms' competitive behaviors and executives' roles therein. At the same time, providing knowledge about how CEO characteristics precipitate competitive actions toward their firms can aid in prevention and intervention strategies.

J	Lee, S				Lee, Sunkee			Learning-by-Moving: Can Reconfiguring Spatial Proximity Between Organizational Members Promote Individual-level Exploration?	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						organization design; organizational learning; spatial design; spatial proximity; seating arrangements; individual-level exploration; microfoundations of strategy; natural experiment	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; MEDIATING ROLE; US SENATE; EXPLOITATION; AMBIDEXTERITY; DESIGN; WORK; PERFORMANCE	This research proposes that individual-level exploration can be promoted by reconfiguring the spatial proximity between organizational members' workspaces. To test this idea, I exploit a natural experiment in an e-commerce company where the spatial distances between organizational members' workspaces were reconfigured. Consistent with the theory I develop on learning, results suggest that individuals whose workspaces were moved closer to those of previously separated peers engaged in more individual-level exploration. This pattern was stronger for individuals who had higher prior organizational experience and those who did not have ties with previously separated peers. Finally, I found that the relocated individuals also achieved higher financial performance. Overall, this study highlights the importance of an underexamined organization design element-spatial design-and its implications for organizational learning, individual-level exploration, and firm performance.

SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Online social network; Social capital; Early adopters; Embeddedness	PROBIT COEFFICIENTS; SELF-PRESENTATION; CONTEXT COLLAPSE; FACEBOOK; FRIENDS; USERS; INNOVATIVENESS; EMBEDDEDNESS; TURNOVER; SERVICES	The last decade has shown that sometimes even the largest online social networks (OSNs) collapse. Significant cascading mechanisms have been identified in the pattern of abandoning the OSN iWiW at its peak of popularity and after. We set out to examine the key actors who were the first to leave their networks by contrasting explanations based on the structural position of users in the network. Using heterogeneous choice models, we found that a higher number of connections as well as less clustered ego-networks hindered early abandonment while early adoption was only a secondary factor.

J	Shahzad, G; Rehan, R; Fahim, M				Shahzad, Gulfam; Rehan, Rashid; Fahim, Muhammad			Rapid Performance Evaluation of Water Supply Services for Strategic Planning	CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN			English	Article						Key Performance Indicators; Turbidity; pH; E-coli; Discharge; VBA	DRINKING-WATER; DISTRICT; QUALITY	The assessment of existing water supply services was carried out through selected performance indicators with the aim of using that data in future for strategic planning of urban Mardan. The key performance indictors studied were selected to assess both the quantity and quality of water. The quality of water was assessed by turbidity, pH, and E-coli tests for samples collected at the start, middle, and tail end of the distribution system. The quantity of water supplied was measured by calculating discharges from water tapes at the three selected locations in the distribution system. A total of thirty samples were collected from ten union councils out of fourteen covering urban Mardan. A number of issues are highlighted in the overall water supply infrastructure and short, mid, and long term remedial measures are recommended. The results are presented in the form of an interactive map using Google Earth and VBA based dynamic database. It was found that the overall quality of water is generally acceptable for drinking. However, the presence of bacteria is an issue in many cases which needs to be resolved. A significant decrease in discharge is observed in the distribution systems away from the source due to leakages and illegal connections. A comprehensive overhaul of both management and infrastructure is required for sustainable and satisfactory level of services.

Three distinct bodies of literature have emerged, with limited cross-pollination among them: routines, heuristics, and improvisation. We add to the existing literature by studying these three types of organizational responses simultaneously via an in-depth longitudinal study of an organization that encountered increasing levels of environmental dynamism. We pay particular attention to explaining how and why routines broke down, prompting the emergence of heuristics or improvisations, as well as when these three responses were used in tandem and when they interacted with each other. Our theoretical model identifies the triggers of heuristics and improvisations and the focal context that led to routines breaking down. We define "focal context" as a constructed temporary reality that encompasses both the objective traits of the environment experienced by the organization at a particular point in time, as well as the subjective perceptions that organizational members had of that reality. We also identify the mechanisms of cognitive search and social convergence that led to the creation of nonroutine responses. Finally, we use our insights to clarify the existing overlaps in the conceptualization of the three organizational responses. Our field study is based on a mountaineering expedition to climb one of the most difficult sides of Mount Everest, the Kangshung face, an archetypical case that is particularly well suited to the development of a new theory in which rich data are required to study the phenomena.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses a qualitative, multiple-case-based investigation with semi-structured interviews and secondary data sources to create a context-rich insight to the area examined. Findings The findings indicate a strong orientation towards operational tools deployment aligned with financial management and resources and process planning, monitoring and control. Strategic perspectives of the respondents indicate an implicit, rather than explicit deployment of strategy tools and unstructured deployment, but general awareness of the resulting component issues. Clearer strategic approaches and strong implementation appear to positively influence success, when measured by growth. Originality/value The methodology for this study differs substantially from previous investigations within the field, which has had relatively few contributions, as it uses in-depth, context-rich qualitative techniques to investigate the micro-processes at play. The conclusions capture new insights and indications and identify areas for further investigation, hence adding to the understanding of a complex and heterogeneous field.

J	Han, XH; Wang, JL				Han, Xuehua; Wang, Juanle			Using Social Media to Mine and Analyze Public Sentiment during a Disaster: A Case Study of the 2018 Shouguang City Flood in China	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						social media; flood; public sentiment; disaster risk reduction; China	TWITTER	Social media has been applied to all natural disaster risk-reduction phases, including pre-warning, response, and recovery. However, using it to accurately acquire and reveal public sentiment during a disaster still presents a significant challenge. To explore public sentiment in depth during a disaster, this study analyzed Sina-Weibo (Weibo) texts in terms of space, time, and content related to the 2018 Shouguang flood, which caused casualties and economic losses, arousing widespread public concern in China. The temporal changes within six-hour intervals and spatial distribution on sub-district and city levels of flood-related Weibo were analyzed. Based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was built to hierarchically identify six flood-relevant topics and nine types of public sentiment responses in Weibo texts. The majority of Weibo texts about the Shouguang flood were related to public sentiment, among which questioning the government and media was the most commonly expressed. The Weibo text numbers varied over time for different topics and sentiments that corresponded to the different developmental stages of the flood. On a sub-district level, the spatial distribution of flood-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in high population areas in the south-central and eastern parts of Shouguang, near the river and the downtown area. At the city level, the Weibo texts were mainly distributed in Beijing and cities in the Shandong Province, centering in Weifang City. The results indicated that the classification model developed in this study was accurate and viable for analyzing social media texts during a disaster. The findings can be used to help researchers, public servants, and officials to better understand public sentiments towards disaster events, to accelerate disaster responses, and to support post-disaster management.

This study analyzes the evolution of SM research from related SM articles inclusively published in hospitality- and tourism-focused journals as well as business- and management-focused journals from 1971 to 2016. This study is the first to map the intellectual structure of SM research in the hospitality industry to analyze the changes in the influence of the most significant studies, journals, and disciplines/fields as well as the relationships among the subfields on SM research in the hospitality industry. This study suggests that marketing is a dominant subfield in SM research within the hospitality industry. In addition, the resource-based view is a dominant approach in the field, although the positioning school was dominant during the field's early stages.

High-quality empirical Green's functions at periods of 7-200s are extracted from the cross correlation of the vertical component of continuous seismic data at 108 stations during 2012-2014. Our tomographic results show remarkable velocity variations between and within the major tectonic units from the crust down to the upper mantle. We observe very slow upper crust beneath the Tarim and Junggar sedimentary basins. The interior of the Tarim Basin shows strong seismic heterogeneities. The high-velocity mantle lithosphere of the Tarim Basin underthrusts northward toward the central Tien Shan. Lithosphere underthrusting could trigger intrusion of hot mantle material and partial melting, in correspondence with the prominent low-velocity anomalies observed in the lower crust and uppermost mantle of the central Tien Shan. In contrast, the connected high-velocity upper mantle structure from Tarim Basin across eastern Tien Shan to Junggar Basin may reflect the convergent effect between the Tarim and Junggar Basins, which consequently prevents the asthenosphere upwelling. We observe low-velocity anomalies in the upper mantle of the western Tien Shan, indicating continental crust of the Eurasia lithosphere that has been subducted toward the western Tien Shan. The observed structural variations along the Tien Shan orogenic belt suggest different tectonic mechanisms for the lithosphere formation and modification of the three segments along strike.

J	Mody, M; Suess, C; Lehto, X				Mody, Makarand; Suess, Courtney; Lehto, Xinran			Using segmentation to compete in the age of the sharing economy: Testing a core-periphery framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Experience; Experiencescape; Individual characteristics; Situational factors; Sharing economy; Airbnb	CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE; BEHAVIORAL INTENTION; TOURISM; SATISFACTION; DIMENSIONS; QUALITY; HOTELS; HOSPITALITY	Airbnb has emerged as a credible competitive threat to the hotel industry. Consequently, hotel brands are having to rethink the experiences they provide to customer in an increasingly competitive environment. Despite these trends in the industry, experience-related research that examines and informs these developments remains under-represented in the hospitality and tourism literature. The present study offers a systematic approach to examine the potential differences in experiential consumption in the accommodations industry. Using a multiple -group analysis approach, it examines the moderating effects of individual characteristics and situational factors on the nature and dynamics of experiential consumption in the accommodations industry. The findings of the study culminate in the core periphery framework of the hospitality consumption experience that can provide a relevant theoretical lens for future research into the different sectors and types of experiences within the hospitality and tourism industry. The study also outlines important implications for the hotel industry's strategic experience design initiatives, from the standpoint of product development, the segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) process, and marketing communications.

J	Jooss, S; Burbach, R; Ruel, H				Jooss, Stefan; Burbach, Ralf; Ruel, Huub			Examining talent pools as a core talent management practice in multinational corporations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Talent pools; talent identification; talent management; multinational corporations; multilevel case study	EMPLOYEE REACTIONS; HR	Many organisations view talent management (TM) as perhaps the most critical challenge of this century. Consequently, it would seem vital that multinational corporations essayed to employ talent pools (TPs) to identify and manage talent more strategically. This paper examines critically the use of TPs as a core TM practice in multinational corporations. Through a multilevel case study of three organisations, we draw on 73 in-depth interviews with human resources and operational leaders at corporate and business unit levels to ascertain how TPs contribute to TM effectiveness. Findings show that TPs can provide a platform for the development of a strong internal talent pipeline if an appropriate TM framework is in place. The results imply that TPs need to be actively managed and underpinned by a rigorous and strategic decision-making process to establish the necessary depth and breadth of talent within TPs, which, in turn, will ensure the overall effectiveness of the TM process. This research responds to the call for much needed empirical evidence on TP practices and suggests a more nuanced view on TP management. Furthermore, this paper offers a model that conceptualises a systematic approach to TP management.

New public management's emphasis on transparency, accountability, efficiency and performance highlights the multiple and often conflicting roles and performance outcomes of PSOs, the social and economic contexts in which PSOs operate, and the multiple ways they measure and manage performance. Responding to this special issue and calls for a richer understanding of performance management in PSOs we examine the impact of context on performance appraisal in Chinese PSOs. As China continues its transitions to a market-driven economy, Chinese PSOs have engaged in managerial reforms to improve governance, efficiency and productivity, including the strategic implementation of western-based HRM practices to manage employee performance. Our analysis demonstrates the challenges context poses for analysing HRM practices in Chinese PSOs.

J	Ewert, R; Wagenhofer, A				Ewert, Ralf; Wagenhofer, Alfred			Effects of Increasing Enforcement on Financial Reporting Quality and Audit Quality	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						G38; M41; M42; M48; earnings management; enforcement; auditing; financial reporting quality; audit quality	ACCOUNTING STANDARDS; LEGAL LIABILITY; EARNINGS; CONSERVATISM	A widely held assumption in policy making and empirical research is that increasing the strength of public enforcement improves financial reporting quality and audit quality. This paper provides a more nuanced view. In a model with a manager who can manage earnings, a strategic auditor, and an enforcement institution, we show that enforcement and auditing are complements in a weak enforcement regime but can be substitutes in a strong regime. Although stronger enforcement always mitigates earnings management, the effects of different instruments of strengthening enforcement are ambiguous. We show that they can improve or impair financial reporting quality and audit quality, depending on production risk, accounting system characteristics, and the scope of auditing relative to enforcement.

J	Harris-Lovett, S; Lienert, J; Sredlak, D				Harris-Lovett, Sasha; Lienert, Judit; Sredlak, David			A mixed-methods approach to strategic planning for multi-benefit regional water infrastructure	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multi-criteria decision analysis; Regional environmental planning; Nutrient management; Wastewater treatment; Stakeholder analysis	MULTICRITERIA DECISION-ANALYSIS; NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; WASTE-WATER; STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; EUTROPHICATION; EXPERIENCES	Finding regional solutions for water infrastructure and other environmental management challenges requires coordination, communication, and a shared understanding among different stakeholders. To develop a more versatile and collaborative decision-making process for nutrient management in the San Francisco Bay Area, we used a mixed-methods approach consisting of stakeholder analysis with cluster analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and scenario planning. These methods allowed us to identify agreements and disagreements in stakeholder objectives and preferences, clarify ways in which different options could meet the goals of diverse stakeholders, and elucidate how scientific uncertainty about technical performance and future conditions could affect management strategies. Results of the analysis indicate that several non-conventional nutrient management options like constructed wetlands and increased water recycling for irrigation met the goals of many stakeholders under a variety of future scenarios. A comparison of MCDA results with a more traditional 'cost-efficiency' measure (i.e., optimizing for the lowest cost per mass of nutrients removed) revealed little correlation between the two methods for stakeholders who expressed a preference for co-benefits of management options such as increased water supply and nutrient recovery for fertilizer use. The method also allowed us to identify key areas of disagreement (e.g., the relative importance of constructing infrastructure that would not be affected by sea level rise) that should find regulatory or professional consensus before advancing with decision-making. This mixed-methods approach is time-consuming and requires specific expertise that is not always available to stakeholders. The development of more efficient preference elicitation and interaction procedures would increase the likelihood that decision-makers would make the extra effort required to use this potentially powerful method. Nonetheless, the mixed-methods approach had several important advantages over more traditional strategic planning methods including its ability to stimulate discussions amongst stakeholders who do not regularly interact, support collaborative planning, and encourage multi-benefit solutions.
