J	Koivumaki, T; Svento, R				Koivumaki, Timo; Svento, Rauli			Development of strategic business network for local travel industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						electronic commerce; network strategy; non-cooperative games		This paper applies the strategy framework presented in Raupp and Schober (2000) to scrutinise the current operational form and future development of a travel industry network in Northern Finland. First, we studied how well the suggested theory corresponds to the operational dimensions of an actual cooperative network. We then utilised the theory to determine what types of strategies would best suit the firms in achieving their common future goals. Results show that the suggested framework is a useful tool in analysing different dimensions of strategic operations of actual networks.

J	Kristiansen, T				Kristiansen, Tarjei			Provision of financial transmission rights including assessment of maximum volumes of obligations and options	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						financial transmission rights; independent system operator risk; credit risks	MARKET POWER; ELECTRICITY NETWORKS; STRATEGIC INTERACTION; COURNOT; MODELS	This paper studies the risks faced by the providers of financial transmission rights (FTRs). The introduction of FTRs in different systems in the USA must be viewed in relationship to the organization of the market. Often, private players own the central grid, while an independent system operator (ISO) operates the grid. The revenues from transmission congestion collected in the day-ahead and balancing markets should give the ISO sufficient revenues to cover the costs associated with providing FTRs. This can be ensured if the issued FTRs fulfill the simultaneous feasibility test described by Hogan. This test on a three-node network is studied under different assumptions to find the maximum volumes, which can be sold, including contingency constraints. Next the feasibility test is analyzed when taking into account the proceeds from the FTR auction, and demonstrates that a higher volume might be issued. We introduce uncertainty under different scenarios for locational prices and calculate the maximum provided volumes. As a tool for risk management, the provider of the FTRs can use the Value at Risk approach. Finally, the provision of FTRs by private parties is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Communication under this perspective has fundamental importance, once it becomes the conductive way through which the organization builds/unbuilds and perpetuates its image. Following this, the study aims to rescue the theories referring to organizational communication and the presuppositions of integrated communication, as well as it reports the experience of an university in Rio Grande do Sul state, when they implemented/rearranged the institutional journal. The report clearly shows that the institution does not have defined communication policies. In order to build the theoretical structure that lead the study, the concepts produced by Kunsch (2003) and Bueno (2003) were considered, among other researchers on the subject.

The proposed model applies the real options approach to calculate the before and after project values of international merger undertaking and analyze the threshold of this merger which are dealt with real exchange rate. Assuming that firm profit function is given, the threshold of the real exchange rate is assessed and numerical examples are also presented for sensitivity analysis. The mathematical and numerical analysis results can provide decision makers with a reference for deciding whether to maintain existing strategic alliances or pursue international mergers.

The final goal is a purposeful scheduling system that guide in the right direction the current, high priority needs of the shop floor while remaining consistent with long-term production plans. The difference, and the power, of Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) is its ability to mimic dynamic manufacturing systems, consisting of complex structures, and many heterogeneous interacting components. This paper describes such an integrated system (ERP/APS/DES) and draw attention to the essential role of simulation based scheduling within it.

J	Rothenberger, S				Rothenberger, Sandra			Strategic and operational issues in implementing a CRM tool	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Customer Relationship Management; CRM; strategic tool; implementation; success factors; business environment		If recently published articles and opinions can be trusted, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is still very popular and important to any kind of company. As an integrated approach, it helps to identify, acquire and retain customers and enables organisations to manage and coordinate customer interactions. CRM therefore supports organisations in their efforts to maximise the value of every customer interaction and to drive superior corporate performance. Yet in many cases, the strategic CRM goals are not reached to the fullest extent and so even fail. Roughly 70% of all CRM implementations do not live up to the expectations of managers (Lamberti, 2003). This paper tries therefore to identify the success factors, as well as the most important thoughts and relations to be taken into consideration, if CRM is to be successfully implemented as a tool for enhancing and supporting overall business success and customer relationship efficiency.

Coastal Marine Mapping as an Ecosystem Based Management - the case study of the Baixada Santista Region - Sao Paulo, Brazil	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						supervising; monitoring; geoprocessing		Despite the enormous environmental impact occurring in the study area and the relevant scientific studies ongoing, the decision-making processes of management and enforcement activities are still restricted. It happens mainly due to the inexistence of data integration of the available information. The development of integrating maps that summarize the information on geomorphology, biological processes, ecology, biodiversity, sociology and economic data, is therefore strategic. So with this purpose, a multidisciplinary team developed a data bank gathering the previously existing information with documented visits to all the area under study. These included interviews about socio-economic uses, biological occurrences and pollution impacts. The study demonstrated that spite of being important fishes', birds' and invertebrates' matting areas; there are important ecosystems like mangroves and estuaries that suffer many deleterious impacts. The study also determined the number of species present in the area: 216 marine fish species, 77 estuarine fish-, 454 bird-, 174 terrestrial mammal- and 22 marine mammal species. Beaches, rock shores and mangrove areas were also fully mapped. On the long run this study will help to define new areas to be protected and to establish a better policy management. Another aim of this study is to shorten time to analyse and understand the ecosystem, allowing the promotion of new studies in observed gaps.	[Sartor, S.

J	Sebalj, D; Hudson, S; Ryan, J; Wight-Boycott, J				Sebalj, Darlene; Hudson, Susan; Ryan, Jan; Wight-Boycott, Juliet			Alliance Through Change	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Following a landmark organisational change event within the University of Western Sydney, when the university ceased operating as a federation of four distinct, inter-related elements and merged to become a single entity, four foundation College Managers made a strategic decision to form an alliance. This alliance significantly enhanced the organisational impact and effectiveness of each partner during what was a highly turbulent, competitive and constantly shifting change setting. This paper describes the environmental conditions that led to the formation of this partnership and details the three core alliance strategies implemented by the College Managers. Such strategies included the creation of lateral and hierarchical communication channels, the engagement of staff, plus the provision of a supportive work environment. The success, or otherwise, of the alliance and its strategies is discussed.

J	Skinner, D				Skinner, David			A move toward European retail	JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE			English	Article						Office buildings; Retailing; Diversification; Real estate; Europe; United Kingdom		Purpose - This report aims to examine the sectoral composition of Europe's real estate investment market, the factors likely to drive a shift in portfolio composition away from the office sector and toward retail, and how this will likely occur. Design/methodology/approach - The article examines the sectoral breakdown of Europe's real estate market and describes the shift in the UK's sectoral breakdown over the past two decades. Economic convergence in Europe, the increasing number of third-party fund managers offering access to the performance of retail assets, the historically superior risk-adjusted returns of retail in mainland Europe are noted as factors that will drive the shift. Eight mechanisms that could help achieve the shift are described. Findings - Many investors in European real estate are modifying strategy to capitalise on the expected outperformance of the office sector over the short to medium term. However, as the office rental recovery matures and the potential for outperformance diminishes, a substantial, long-term increase in the portfolio weightings of retail and other property types will likely occur in mainland Europe. Improved asset and fund management infrastructure has made retail assets more accessible to investors. Retail has tended to outperform offices over fairly long time horizons and will likely continue to provide superior risk-adjusted returns. Originality/value - Many investors in European real estate have recently been making tactical allocation decisions to benefit from the potential upside offered by offices. This analysis suggests that at a strategic level, investors in mainland European real estate should diversify away from offices (now about half of investors' portfolios) by raising allocations to other sectors.

J	Wu, LH; Wang, JL				wu, Li-Hung; Wang, Jaw-Lu			Bank lending linked to product market under swap hedging: an option-based optimization	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Commodity loan; swap; optimal loan rate		This paper, explicitly incorporating characteristics of the borrower's product market, examines a financial claim for swap hedging. In an option-based model where loan markets are imperfectly competitive, changes in the hedging pricing and capital regulation have direct effects on the bank's optimal margin. An increase in the default probability of the commodity loan increases in the bank's market share in the loan market if the bank plays strategic substitutes and increases in the bank's margin if the bank plays strategic complements. This optimal margin is negatively related to the counterparty bank's loan rate or to the bank capital requirement when the bank realizes a relatively less risky state of the world or to the counterparty bank's default probability when the bank realizes a relatively more risky state. Our findings lead to an important implication that the link between the financial and product markets with swap hedging should be stronger.

J	Keiber, KL				Keiber, Karl Ludwig			INSIDER TRADING RULES AND PRICE FORMATION IN SECURITIES MARKETS: AN ENTROPY ANALYSIS OF STRATEGIC TRADING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FINANCE			English	Article						Insider trading rules; informational efficiency; underreaction; overreaction; excess volatility; information theory	INFORMATION; EFFICIENCY	This paper addresses the issue of how insider trading rules affect price formation in securities markets and suggests the application of information theory to market microstructure theory. We analyze a variant of the setting in [20] by simply introducing a more general criterion for informational efficiency borrowed from information theory - namely maximum information transmission. The analysis shows that both the insider's optimal trading strategy and the market price of the risky security depend on the insider trading restriction. Insider trading restrictions are reported to be detrimental to the liquidity of the securities market. We find that a unique insider trading rule exists which implements semi- strong form informational efficiency of the securities market. Alternative restrictions on insider trading give rise to either underreaction or overreaction in securities prices. Too strict insider trading rules are shown to account for excess volatility in securities prices. Contrary to common notion, the uninformed investors are shown to be hurt by too restrictive insider trading rules. We conclude that loose insider trading rules are preferred by the group of investors as a whole.

This transition is occurring in major incumbent fixed telecommunications operators like BT ( British Telecom), France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, among others, where the innovation gap seems to be more challenging compared to mobile operators and cable TV companies. We analyze the capabilities development of BT in the United Kingdom, using documentary and interview data. The main conclusion is that, during the transition, capabilities vary rapidly in intensity: at the very beginning, strategic capabilities influence the decision-making and define the transition, and then project capabilities are put in place to deploy the strategy, until functional capabilities take over and maintain the evolutionary path of the technology until a next major transition may occur.

Memory Organization and Optimization for Java Workloads	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY			English	Article						Cache and memory systems; Java; memory management; high-performance computer architecture		Java has become a popular paradigm in software development. It is widely used in embedded systems and network computing because of its excellent robustness, modularity and security. Its built-in garbage collection automatically reclaims unused memory space. Current generational garbage collector works well with programs containing massive short-lived objects. However, the existence of hot-mature (frequently-accessed and long-lived) objects inhibits object reclamation. In this paper, we present two methodologies to exploit the locality for these objects. Firstly, we employ an on-chip scratchpad memory in memory hierarchy to preserve young and hot-mature objects. This reduces energy consumption and data accessing cycles for Java execution. Secondly, we introduce a pretenuring technique to segregate objects into separated memory regions based on object lifetimes and reference densities, which minimizes the amount of object copying during garbage collections.

Quality initiatives and dashboards are shared through an established shared drive, which is accessible for all employees. to track performance on identified dashboards. Improving Mammography Cycle Time at the Women's Health Center: Cycle time (arrival to departure) for mammography was identified as the top improvement priority. Increasing the percentage of patients who had preregistered reduced admission time, and process changes were made to move the patient through the center more efficiently. For example, patients with orders for additional films were flagged to ensure that these exams were completed before a new patient's exam. The ultrasound schedule was blocked during peak times to ensure that add-on exams could be performed in a timely manner. The cycle time was reduced for screening mammography (from 2 hours in 2003 to 30 minutes in April 2006) and diagnostic screenings, including review of films and reports with radiologist at departure, decreased from > 3 hours in 2003 to 2.5 hours in April 2006. Conclusion: Expectations of teamwork, proactive problem resolution, communication on all levels, and customer service are the cornerstone of Baptist Women's culture of quality.

IT Training as a Strategy for Business Productivity in Developing Countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						developing countries; hierarchical; IT; organization; strategy; training		Most existing studies on technology training address the operational issues of training process (e.g., training needs assessment, learning, delivery methods, etc.). The strategic concerns of IT training for enhancing business productivity largely are not addressed by the current literature. In this article, we explore the strategic concerns of IT training in hierarchical organizations, which are typically prevalent in developing countries. We synthesize various ideas in the literature on change management, training needs analysis, and IT adoption in order to evolve a strategic IT training framework for hierarchical organizations. The proposed framework recognizes the differences in IT training requirements for different levels of employees and suggests a differentiated training content for different segments of employees. The training framework provides an actionable and comprehensive tool that can be used for systematically planning IT training for enhancing productivity of organizations.

J	Bagchi, SN				Bagchi, Soumendra N.			XENITIS GROUP OF COMPANIES	ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CASES			English	Article						Low-cost computers; strategic partnerships; organizational growth; competition		The Xenitis Group of Companies emerged as a significant player in the personal computer (PC) market in the Indian subcontinent after the introduction of its Aamar PC, priced below Rs 10,000. Starting as a trading company and then launching its own desktop, Xenitis had seen its annual turnover grow from Rs 20 million to excess of Rs 1,780 million. Buoyed by its success in the Indian market, Xenitis planned to expand in international markets, targeting an annual turnover of Rs 50,000 million by year 2010. The entry of new players, offering low-priced PCs with similar configurations, in both Indian and international markets posed a serious challenge to Xenitis. The launch of sub-Rs 15,000 PCs with credit facility offered by financing companies also posed a threat to Xenitis, as consumers could now opt for higher-end PCs from betterknown manufacturers.

J	Butcher, J; Turner, N; Drenth, G				Butcher, Jim; Turner, Nick; Drenth, Gerard			Navigating in the Midst of More Uncertainty and Risk	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								With the steady increase in the variety and scale of uncertainties and risks, the challenges for today's executives have become ever more complex and daunting. One powerful tool for navigating among different risks and uncertainties is scenario planning. From its early days of use within Shell, scenario planning has evolved in ways that make it better suited to the tasks of identifying, analyzing, and managing various financial risks across different industries. During the last ten years, Morgan Stanley has also been using scenario planning to gain a better understanding of key risks and uncertainties facing the financial services industry, ranging from the consequences of possible changes in the dollar to the emergence of hedge funds and the remarkable growth of China and India. In discussing the benefits of scenario planning, the authors note its potential to help management in a number of ways: By challenging conventional thinking and current assumptions about its industry and world; By identifying key signals or potential direction changes ahead of time, which is especially important when lead times to invest, hedge, or change assets are limiting factors; By identifying and assessing the value of strategic or "real" options-options to invest in new opportunities or limit downside risks that may suddenly open up or disappear, and that management must be prepared to "exercise" quickly and decisively; By reinforcing the recognition that value added comes not just from better strategic thinking and planning, but from the role of risk management in helping companies take advantage of new opportunities; By encouraging more cross-divisional and firm-wide conversations about strategic choices and options, thereby creating a shared understanding of and greater consensus about chosen strategies; and By forcing them to go beyond the limits of typical three-to-five year forecasting limitations to think hard about longer-term strategic choices.

J	Grody, AD				Grody, Allan D.			Operational risk forum	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RISK			English	Article								New regulations are imbedding operational risk concepts and the provisioning of operational risk capital in the risk management considerations of globally active financial enterprises. Inherent in new capital calculations is the effect of losses due to faulty reference data data which is costly to acquire and maintain, duplicative across the industry and of no strategic value, and which comprises 70% of the data content of financial transactions. Faulty reference data has been a persistent impediment to systemic risk mitigation across the global capital and investment markets. Reference data electronically represents financial products and their changing specifications, counterparties, financial intermediaries, corporations, issuers, financial markets, currencies and valuation prices. This paper attempts to illuminate the effect of faulty reference data on operating costs, operational risk and operational capital. It also points toward applying solutions that have proven to reduce costs and risk in other industries and in other segments of the financial industry. Standards for product and supply chain participants, which have long been a staple in the retail industry, are now overdue in the financial services industry. Financial industry-wide cost sharing and risk mitigating approaches have long been organized around shared infrastructure entities but, to date, have only been applied to the value portion of transactions (principally quantities, transaction prices and amounts). This paper argues for these same techniques to be applied to the matching and "clearing" of the reference data components of these transactions.

J	Chong-Hyun, W				Chong-Hyun, Won			The optimal portfolio for the pension fund investors	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article						asset allocation; HJB-equation; credit risk; market risk; pension fund	STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION; MODEL	In pension fund management, the most important decision to make is the choice of a portfolio of assets. It means how much assets to invest and how to maintain and change the division asset rate. This study is to show optimal investment portfolio for the long-term investors with each risk attitude. The assets should be composed of group of risk free bonds, defaultable bonds and stocks. The main theme in this literature is to study how investors can efficiently allocate wealth among several financial asset categories in order to achieve utility maximization in the presence of different risk-return combinations. For that purpose, I reflect on the risk aversion utility function of multi period investment managers. This paper investigates how investors who face both interest rate risk and credit risk in addition to equity risk can optimally allocate their financial wealth in a dynamic, no arbitrage, continuous-time setup. I model credit risk through a defaultable zero-coupon bond and solve the stochastic differential equation of the bond under the recovery to the market value scheme. From the study I derive the optimal portfolio for maximizing investors' utility function subject to their risk aversion. The risk in this study not only includes standard deviation as indicated in Makowitz's mean-variance study but also market risk, credit risk and equity risk. In this paper, I want to prove that bonds (including risk-free bonds) have as much risk as stocks do. Many investors look for returns (with risk adjusted) from corporate bond holdings that could be higher than those from equity or risk-free bonds. And most of pension investors also raise their allocations to corporate bonds. Following results are drawn from the study. First,, the more risk aversive managers are, the less are the weight of defautauble bonds they hold. It may mean the market risk and credit risk of bonds are stronger than those of stocks to investors utility. Second, the weight of defaultable bonds decreases more rapidly than that of stocks with increasing risk aversion by managers. It shows that managers' preference of credit risk is more important than risks of holding stocks. Third, with time horizon, the weight of risk free bonds can decrease. It implies that the weight of defautable bonds may increase in probably 5 to 7 years by then, the investors may believe that the corporate bonds can be held to their expiration. Above all, I want to show the bonds including risk-free bonds are not any safer than stocks when we consider interest risk, credit risk or other risks at the same time. The bonds are also exposed to various risks, so the fund managers must provide against these risks. And if investors' utility function can serve as a managing standard, we can consider asset allocation with reflection on macro economics and various risks.

J	Coetzee, P				Coetzee, Phina (GP)			Effect of HIV/AIDS on the control environment	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH			English	Article						control environment; corporate governance; HIV/AIDS; risk management	EMPLOYMENT	Objective: The management of organizations is responsible for risk management and control systems. HIV/AIDS could be a great threat in the achievement of strategic business objectives, implicating a great concern for management. Management needs to understand this possible risk. This study aims to identify the effect that HIV/AIDS could have on the different elements of the control environment. Methodology: The archival research method was used. It was established that no formal research was conducted to date on the effect of HIV/AIDS on the control environment as a whole. Various studies have included the effect of HIV/AlDS on certain factors of the control environment. These studies will be discussed briefly to identify relevant findings. Results: The study indicated that the disease could affect various aspects of the control environment, namely: competency of the workforce (e.g. productivity, quality of work, absenteeism, loss of skills and knowledge, training and recruitment, etc.); organizational structure (e.g. increase use of technology labour, disruption of processes, level of employees affected by the disease); human resource (HR) policies and practices (e.g. legislation applicable, prevention and awareness programmes, compensation and benefits). Research limitation: HIV/AIDS is a relatively new potential risk to organizations. Knowledge of the disease is limited. HIV/AIDS is also a very sensitive issue as people fear the disease and do not like to discuss its existence. Government determined that it should be a non-notifiable disease and the disease is currently greatly stigmatized. The databases of companies investigated by other research studies were not developed to gather all the relevant information. Conclusion: Management should be aware that HIV/AIDS poses a possible risk to organizations. Data on the effect of HIV/AIDS should be gathered and used in the decisionmaking process on how to manage this risk. To be able to fulfil this duty, management first has to determine: whether HIV/AlDS is a risk; the relevant cost involved that the disease is costing the organization; how to control these costs.

It can be a powerful strategic and tactical tool when used to address business process disconnects, especially between the Revenue Management/Pricing and Sales departments. This article describes a fare stratification process to address these issues, where the intent is to refocus the multi-class hierarchy in terms of network revenue priorities. The article also includes simulation results to substantiate the merits of this process improvement, and it reveals that Multi-class Fare Rationalisation must be an integral part of any network-wide organisational strategy that incorporates the overarching mission of revenue maximisation.

Make, Source, or Buy: The Decision to Acquire a New Reporting System	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						academic administration IS; commercially available software; information technology adoption; IS development approaches; IS evaluation; IS project selection; outsourcing of IS; user needs assessment		The College of Business (COB) at Northern Washington University (NWU) needs new data systems to provide reports and information both internally and for its external accrediting body. Dewitt Brown, COB's associate dean, has been tasked with determining COB's needs and developing recommendations for sources of systems. COB could develop the systems internally since it has database expertise among its faculty and staff. Or, it could outsource to NWU's information technology staff. A third option, at least for some systems, is to purchase from an outside vendor. The decision is crucial: efficient, accurate reporting of data is key to COB's strategic plan to continue its accreditation as well as ensure that operations are smooth as possible. If COB were to lose its accreditation, it would lose status and likely lose funding and students as well.

During the Asian crisis, the diversified and international Salim Group was barely able to survive. The present CEO and president, Anthony Salim, was faced with the task of developing the new strategy for the Group. Rather than focussing on core businesses, he insisted on remaining flexible in order to capture whatever opportunities might arise in the Asian region, regardless of the products or services.

J	Lange, T				Lange, Thomas			When Management Theory Meets Economics: Towards Innovation and a Dynamic Growth Model of the Firm	JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Dynamic growth model; firm-level strategy; Schumpeterian creative destruction; heuristic conceptualisation		It has been argued that the dynamic effects of economic development through innovation are poorly understood by mainstream economic theory. This paper provides a conceptual and heuristic framework that is intended to move us closer to a dynamic growth model of the firm in a high-tech, knowledge based economy. A Cobb-Douglas production function with components of high tech capital and skills and with assumptions on the origin of innovative processes is being introduced to provide structure to the arguments. By drawing on the strategic groundwork of management theorists Moran and Ghoshal, it proceeds by applying an "appreciative" hypothesis of economic development (that is, a descriptive tool rather than a formal model) to test a Schumpeterian scenario of iterative creative destruction, thus answering the call for a dynamic Schumpeterian process. It also provides a response to the call for a broadened agenda to include a greater degree of attention to the selection [and de-selection] mechanism that influences the use of resources. These issues and others are investigated and some conjectures offered.

This paper explores an initiative by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, exemplifying the concept of 'strategic philanthropy,' to contribute their financial resources and strong institutional ties to respond to the current and future shortage of nurses in Florida. Through this intervention, the company and partnering organizations hope to benefit the health care sector, the public, and themselves from the outcomes associated with the generation of a greater supply of nurses.

J	Adler, RW; Theivananthampillai, P				Adler, Ralph W.; Theivananthampillai, Paul			STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROPOSALS AND THE BALANCED SCORECARD: HOW TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INVESTMENTS AND LONG TERM STRATEGY	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategic investment decisions; capital investments; balanced scorecard		This paper examines how a balanced scorecard can be used to guide strategic investment decisions. As noted in the literature, an advantage of the balanced scorecard over the common financial metrics that are often used (e.g., net present value) is that a broader set of benefits and limitations can be recognised. Furthermore, unlike other non-financial and hybrid financial and non-financial approaches, the balanced scorecard provides relatively clear guidance. This clarity comes from its ability to make tradeoffs between the balanced scorecard measures by assigning weightings to each measure. Unfortunately, the balanced scorecard literature is silent on how these weightings are best determined. In addressing this oversight, this paper argues for and suggests that managers should use a balanced scorecard approach that relies on a multi-attribute decision model. A detailed explanation of this approach is provided and further illustration of the approach is presented through the use of a hypothetical example.

It is a follow up to the survey of 2000, N = 594. The more there is openness in the firm's contact with the external social environment, the higher the level of social responsibility of the management. The increase in the managers' social responsibility leads to the fact that these managers choose models of sustainable development as a strategic reference point for their firms. Distinctions in spheres of social responsibility have also been rather strongly revealed.

As the biotechnological paradigm is progressively replacing the chemical one, the biotech start-ups are the principal engine of R&D activity. They discover new molecules and impulse drug innovation. Still, big pharmaceutical companies (big pharmas) have some advantages, such as benefiting from higher funds to support development of new drugs, scale and scope economies in R&D. Partnerships between small and big firms are developed on a win-win basis. Consequently, the size of the firm is a moving target. Innovation is to be linked with industrial, technological networks. Small firms are cooperating and so increasing returns to scale may appear at the level of the research networks, strategic alliances or bio-clusters. Industrial policies stimulating innovation as a competitive edge should then concentrate on creating strong incentives for small firms to cooperate.

J	Browne, C; Wheeler, D				Browne, Chris; Wheeler, David			How your "stay back" can hold back your outsourcing efforts	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Real estate; Outsourcing; Property management		Purpose - The changing nature of corporate real estate (CRE) management and the realignment of its goals has meant that about a third of corporations have now outsourced much of their facilities management activities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the experiences of successful real estate outsourcing models and discuss how this experience could be applied more widely in the industry. Design/methodology/approach - Research was conducted by CB Richard Ellis among 32 corporations, which showed a wide range of approaches to retained CRE organizations. Further analysis was made of a number of relationships between CB Richard Ellis and their existing clients in order to determine a "best practice" organizational structure. Findings - There were a wide variety of organizational questions that impacted on the size of the retained team and the conclusion was that, "No one size fits all". The number of CRE personnel varied significantly, based largely on the company's approach to and degree of, outsourcing. In order for the client to receive innovative and cost effective solutions to its real estate service requirements, a collaborative and strategic partnership is critical. The "best practice" structure is flexible, stimulates cooperation and creates an environment of strategic partnership to ensure a productive level of communication and collaboration where ideas can be rewarded. Originality/value - This paper provides useful insight into how the combined organization of client and service provider can be optimized in order to maximize the efficiency of the outsourcing process.

J	Burt, G				Burt, George			Towards an understanding of the link between environment, discontinuity and volitional strategic change	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						business environment; discontinuity and volitional strategic change; environment; scenario planning; transitional object	MANAGEMENT	Whilst organisations have been confronted with uncertainty in the environment and the need to change, resulting in incremental or radical change, we know very little about volitional strategic change. Volitional strategic change arises when management engage in changing before the need to change is imposed on their organisation. We know very little about how organisations perceive early warning signals of impending change and using the insights from these perceptions to bring about volitional strategic change, with the resulting impact on the operations of the organisation. This paper explores the link between environment, discontinuity and volitional strategic change, using recent empirical evidence, to identity the bases of change - psychological and operational. This paper identifies the role of a 'transitional object' as being the key that links the old (existing) world of management to the new (proposed) world of management and therefore facilitating volitional strategic change. The transitional object enables a re-conceptualisation of the organisation' s basis of success to incorporate and integrate wider change proposals.

J	Gonzalez, ME				Gonzalez, Maria			The value(s) of editorial peer review	ON THE HORIZON			English	Article						Peer review; Publishing		Purpose - To explore the status, interests, and intentions of peer reviewers and how editors enlist and muster these factors to enhance the prestige of a scholarly publication. Design/methodology/approach - Case study: use of a 30-year accumulation of editorial office records of one scholarly journal to analyze the contents of peer review comments and correspondence; direct quotes highlight key themes. Findings - Peer reviewers labor to obtain more than the certification, authentication, and quality of individual works. The volume and variety of commentary generated by a double-blind peer review process reveal concerns behind reviewer comments to authors and effects over time. Research limitations/implications - The study centers on one journal, Libraries & Culture, a publication committed to the specialized, interdisciplinary research about the history of libraries and the collection of cultural records. Originality/value - The strategic nature of the administration and management of the invisible work of peer reviewers becomes more apparent. The interests and intentions of peer reviewers surface in commentary intended only for authors. Commentary relates to a variety of themes including personal interests, pedagogical and disciplinary objectives, field expansion agendas as well as the prestige of the publication. These themes suggest peer review as a potentially effective guiding mechanism for long-term endeavors that benefit author, reviewer, and editor as interrelated players in arenas where distinction is at stake.

In order to assist student to think and solve problems, business educators have turned to business simulation as an alternative way to develop people. Business simulation is a teaching method that can assist in developing a learning environment, which exposes students to complex situations that needs strategic decision-making. At Faculty of Economics and Business UKM, business simulation has been integrated in strategic management course as a platform for students to make management decision in a dynamic environment. A study on 165 students had been conducted to measure the influence of demographic factors on the effectiveness of business simulation. Our findings show that students' gender, race, academic qualification, academic program and career ambition have influenced the simulation effectiveness. On the other hand, students' C.G.P.A, simulation performance, English language capability and working experience have no influence on the effectiveness of business simulation.	[Hanafiah, Mohd.

J	Kni, C; Winkler, D				Kni, Christoph; Winkler, Dartiela			Convergence or Divergence of National Legal and Administrative Structures? Europeanisation Effects of the Environmental Impact Assessment in Germany and England (Part 1)	JOURNAL FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL & PLANNING LAW			English	Article								In the past few years the effects of European integration on national legal and administrative structures have increasingly attracted the attention of legal and administrative analysts. One of the main topics of this branch of research based on the catchword 'Europeanisation' is the question whether and to what extent these processes have led to the approximation of national legal and administrative structures in the course of time. However, we still lack comprehensive findings as to whether and under what conditions the effects of European integration lead to domestic administrative and legal changes. It this paper, we try to address this research gap. We analyse whether and to what extent the implementation of European policies leads to an approximation of legal and administrative structures in the Member States. This question will he thoroughly elaborated by using the example of the implementation of directives related to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in Germany and England.

The model demonstrates how the nature of the loan (substitutes/complements), loan rate strategies (strategic substitutes/strategic complements) and regulation conditions jointly determine the acquirer bank's optimal loan rate. We find that the acquirer bank's loan rate are negatively related to the proportion of the combined banks owned by the acquirer bank's shareholders and also negatively related to the capital regulation under the nature of the loan complements and the loan-rate-setting complement strategy. Our findings provide an alternative explanation for the acquirer bank's strategies for operating and competing in the lending market concerning bank acquisition behavior.

J	Lindelof, P; Lofsten, H				Lindelof, Peter; Lofsten, Hans			Importance of management accounting in new technology-based firms in Sweden - analysis of environmental and strategic variables	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						management accounting; environmental variables; strategic variables; New Technology-Based Firms (NTBEs)	SCIENCE PARKS; GROWTH; INNOVATION	The focus of this paper is on the importance of management accounting in small high-tech firms. The study uses data from a sample of 183 small New Technology-Based Firms (NTBFs) in Sweden, gathered from a postal questionnaire. There are a couple of environmental variables that have influenced new technology-based firms. We argue that, together with the strategic variables, they mainly determine the importance of management accounting practices in the firm. Previous research has identified technology as one of the most important factors. The structural model indicates no significant relationships between innovation and development orientation, and the importance of management accounting. Rather, there appears to be greater emphasis on dynamic hostility, price and cost hostility and aggressive competition that appear to be of particular importance to management accounting in new technology-based firms.

J	Ojode, LA				Ojode, Lucy			Tobacco Business and Regulation in the Developing Markets: The Case of British American Tobacco (BAT) in East Africa	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS			English	Article						British American Tobacco (BAT); business environment; East Africa; excise tax; Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC); Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa; tobacco; Uganda; World Health Organization (WHO)		This paper compares BAT's business environment in Kenya and Uganda in light of the World Health Organization's (WHO) tobacco control initiative. It also illustrates the use of tobacco tax by Sub-Saharan African countries to address tobacco related conundrums. The comparison revealed elements of government ambivalence towards tobacco business and a possible recourse to tobacco tax to mollify global pressure against big tobacco. The paper uses the partial correlations between tobacco tax and basic economic development indicators across Sub-Saharan Africa and previous World Bank data as indicative of tobacco tax efficacy in controlling consumption in the region. It suggests that Sub-Saharan Africa may find regionally designed tax-based policy guidelines a palatable strategic alternative to global firms (such as BAT) that face a hostile global business environment. A united policy front that fits within the region's institutions can reduce complexity and create efficiencies through lower administrative costs across the region. Such action will make the region relatively more attractive (than it is currently) to foreign investors. (C) 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Otjacques, B; Noirhomme, M; Feltz, F				Otjacques, Benoit; Noirhomme, Monique; Feltz, Fernand			TAXONOMY OF THE VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES OF PROJECT RELATED INTERACTIONS	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Cooperation; project management; information visualization; taxonomy		All construction projects can be considered as cooperative undertakings. Their strategic management and daily operations causes numerous interactions to occur, either among persons or among persons and resources. These interactions have been studied from various viewpoints but few researchers have focused on their visualization. The graphical representation of the cooperation is however a powerful tool to help the project participants to get a correct understanding of the situation. This paper proposes a structuring framework (IVF - Interaction Visualization Framework) of the visualization techniques used to display such interactions. Three basic axes of classification are used to organize the study. Which objects are visualized? In which context of use are they visualized? How are they visualized? For each axis, several properties have been identified and the permitted values have been specified. The paper then explains three major applications of the IVF: the characterization, the comparison and the design of visualization techniques. This work can be considered as a first step towards a structured view of the 'visualization of cooperation' domain.

But in general, SCM can be defined as a complex business relations network that contains synchronized efforts among these business entities to plan, control, coordinate and distribute raw materials, parts, subassemblies and finished goods from suppliers to ultimate customers. It can be strongly claimed that, the most important objective of SCM is to ensure production and delivery of products at the right diversity, with the right amounts, at the right time and to the right locations. In order to achieve this aim, some strategic decisions have to be made such as finding number of plants (manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, cross-docks etc.) to be opened, defining location of these plants, choosing suppliers to use (called Supplier Selection Problem), determining transportation times and modes, and creating supply chain strategies. In this study, supplier selection problem in SCM is considered with the help of Analytic Hierarchy Process. A case study in a textile manufacturer is presented.

Line Logic(TM) on the bow tie	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product management; Product development; Product design; Brand extensions; Case studies		Purpose - The purpose of this article is to present Line Logice as a means of developing and building a company's portfolio of products. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a sporting goods company in the USA as a case study to portray the implementation of Line Logice. Findings - An extensive analysis of the company and its implementation of the Line Logice methodology found that the company was operating in conjunction with a bow tie channel strategy. Research limitations/implications - A case study does an excellent job of capturing phenomena at a particular company. The Line Logice framework needs to be explored and reported in various companies, thus allowing multiple sources of data to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the Line Logice methodology. Practical implications - There is no magic formula or prescription for managing a company's line of product offerings. Line Logice offers a disciplined approach to creating and presenting a full complement of product choices. As shown here, the implementation of Line Logice assists companies in understanding both strategic and tactical issues related to competitors and channel members. Originality/value - While there are companies that execute some of the Line Logice system, this paper illustrates the importance of line logic in the sporting goods industry. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of the bow tie in product line planning.

J	Reid, D				Reid, Duncan			Making Space for Theological Research in the New Environment of Australian Higher Education	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The paper examines 2 recent Australian government issues papers on higher education and research policy, indicating areas both of concern and opportunity for Australian higher education providers in theology and their research efforts. The paper then offers suggestions as to how providers of theological education might position themselves as research institutions in the emerging higher education environment in Australia, and how educational policymakers might regard research in the theological sector of Australian higher education. This paper is directed, within the new research environment in Australia, to 2 groups of readers: those concerned with the administration of theological institutions, and those whose responsibility it is to draft policy with regard to research funding. To the theological institutions I want to say: (1) become more familiar with the emerging higher education culture, especially as it affects research, and pay attention to ensuring your institution's own quality assurance controls; (2) avoid being sidelined in the new environment, seek strategic partnerships with other institutions with a similar vision and mission to your own; and (3) attempt to state clearly the role and value of your own discipline in the Australia of the 21st Century. To the policymakers I say: recognise the value of research done, often in small private but not-for-profit institutions, in the theological and biblical disciplines. Recognise it as genuine research. Listen to the particular needs of these institutions, which may be quite different from larger institutions with more attention-grabbing research profiles.

The paper also describes the approach underlying the system, validates it by designing a system prototype, and tests the system using questionnaire and in-depth interviews in order to further knowledge about the subject. The main results from the test show: collaboration engineering is potentially important for senior managers; end-users were specifically attracted more by the concept rather by its implementation; engineering change management is a complex process; and the support of strategic level is a critical success factor. In addition, the paper describes other factors that emerged during the ongoing project and inhibit success of the system.

The main issue has been the emergence of new intermediaries which reorganise business and management process throughout the value chain. Electronic marketplaces are gradually transforming the organisational structure between firms, but have been seriously affected by a major recession consequent to the collapse of the 'New Economy'. This article focuses on their impact on industries and provides a conceptual framework that aims to show how they affect the business and coordination process, with the automotive industry as an example.

The re-management of clusters undertaken at the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), a major research organisation in Thailand, is based on the concept of the National System of Innovation (NSI). Now a shift is being planned at NSTDA to direct and expand the clusters, based on the national competitiveness agenda recommended by Professor Porter (1990; 1998; 2001). The paper presents the process of defining the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) as a framework for translating NSTDA's strategic direction into action. Policy implications and supportive initiatives at NSTDA will be useful for research organisations in other countries to exploit the industrial cluster concept for enhancing the nation's technological capabilities.

J	Fleury, AC; Fleury, MTL				Fleury, Afonso C.; Leme Fleury, Maria Tereza			The Formation of Organisational Competences in the International Telecommunications Production Network	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						telecommunications; competence management; strategic management		Competence building and management has been an issue frequently addressed in the literature, but it seldom has been referred to enterprises acting as part of production networks. The literature is still scarcer when the networks are international and include organisational units located in countries classified as "emerging economies". The main purpose of this study is to develop an analytical framework for the understanding of the configuration of organisational competences in the distinct participants of international production networks: multinationals and their subsidiaries organising local production networks. Different types of subsidiaries create local relationships whenever they act as part of a supply network to serve the local markets (interfirm relationship). At the same time, every subsidiary keeps an internal relationship with its parent company and respective headquarters (intrafirm). This article focuses on the global networks of Telecommunications industry and more specifically in Brazil. The networks are essentially constituted by Telecom Operators and Specialised Equipment Suppliers. The field research was done in a sample of six subsidiaries operating in Brazil. In every firm we studied the way in which competences were built. An analytical framework was built to analyse the subsidiary-headquarters relationships, the role played by the subsidiary in the local supply networks and the specific features of the distinct types of subsidiaries. The outcomes show that, in the Brazilian context, where the lack of regulatory constraints allows that multinational corporations (MNCs) operate under a high level of autonomy, the structure of the local supply chain tends to reflect the structure of the chain at global level. In that case, the way in which the global leader, the MNC that exerts the governance of the chain, considers competence formation at the headquarters and at the subsidiary level, as well as the competences that exist ingrained in firms and institutions at local level, are the main determinants of the overall configuration of competences.

J	Saunderson, I; de Wet, G				Saunderson, I.; de Wet, G.			Social communication networks and videoconferencing: Strategic management decisions in new organisational forms - the case of TELP	COMMUNICARE-JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION SCIENCES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article								This study examined new organisational environments and environmental variables involved in the adoption and implementation of new communication technology. This includes structures within the organisation and social communication networks. Social communication networks determine the levels of the measurement of the processes associated with managerial practices and policies regarding videoconferencing implementation. Videoconferencing as a communication management tool should not only take into account the numerous applications of videoconferencing, but also consider all the implications for management. The study utilised focus group research, social network analysis and descriptive statistics in the investigation of the manifestation of the above- mentioned variables in the Tertiary Education Linkages Project (TELP), which is a linkage project between the Eastern Cape Technikon and Texas Southern University. The study utilises triangulation for the establishment of acceptable levels of reliability and validity. The data analysis revealed that videoconferencing facilitates organisational communication networks on the precondition that communication networks and the communication environment are well managed. The nature of social networks reveals that it will always be in existence where human interaction is present. However, communication management strategies are indeed required to ensure that the quality of information disseminated over the social network contributes to sound managerial outcomes. It was furthermore established that communication management policies do not necessarily affect individuals' experiences of videoconferencing. However, as a communication management tool, videoconferencing must be guided by effective communication management policies and practices for the group to be effective.

Internet banking is a new delivery channel that offers a one-stop service and information unit to gain competitive advantage in the banking sector. While it promises enormous benefits both to consumers and banks, what do bank managers, as providers perceive internet banking? This article seeks to examine the perceptions of bank managers on internet banking with respect to strategic, operational, customer-related and technological issues. A total of 54 responses were received from questionnaires distributed to bank managers in the Northern region of Malaysia. Interestingly, they provide conflicting views. While internet banking enhances customer service, it is perceived to have reduced human resource and banker-customer relationships. Hence, this finding suggests that the management should continue to offer personalised services to its customers. Internet banking should be used as an informational and transactional tool to complement and enhance banking operations.

The study, using factor analysis, surveyed 298 exporting firms in Slovenia. The strategic elements for standardization of the marketing mix consisting of price, distribution, and promotion, were substantially significant factors in cost reduction and profit increase. The ability of firms to standardize the product and market themselves emerged as a separate factor of standardization. The study also found many country-specific variables constraining the degree to which standardization and its benefits could be undertaken by Slovenian managers.

THE MAGNETIC SENTENCES INDUSTRY GAME: A COMPETITIVE IN-CLASS EXPERIENCE OF BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION			English	Article						business-level strategy; differentiation; low-cost leadership; inclass exercise; Magnetic Poetry		The Magnetic Sentences Industry Game is a high-energy in-class exercise designed to help students gain hands-on experience with setting, implementing, evaluating, and revising business-level strategy. Students compete in teams to create and market sentences using Magnetic Poetry (a product of Magnetic Poetry, Inc.). Revenues earned are highly dependent on the successful development and implementation of a cohesive business-level strategy. The game experience should create opportunities for the class to discuss a variety of strategic issues including external environment, internal environment, competitive dynamics, the advantages and disadvantages of various generic business-level strategies, organizational learning, and strategic groups.

J	Jelinek, M; Griffith, TL				Jelinek, M; Griffith, TL			Organizational science and the NSF: Funding for mutual benefit	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						organization theory; organization science; research methodology; research funding and grants; National Science Foundation; organization theory development	MODEL	The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the primary federal agency funding nonmedical research in the United States. However, relatively few organizational researchers consider approaching the agency, despite the funds it has available. It is easy to understand why: The agency has a reputation for preferring "hard science" and quantitative approaches, and there is no obvious home for organizational studies in the agency. NSF programs appear to recognize psychological and small-group research on the one hand, and sociological research on the other, with little emphasis on organizations. There are, however, several programs that have funded research on organizations, or relevant to organizations. Additionally, the NSF regularly solicits advice and direction from researchers on new directions for focus and attention. We argue that organization researchers should indeed approach NSF with robust research proposals. We provide suggestions for finding an appropriate application "home" within NSF. We also discuss the process of proposal preparation, offering suggestions on how to prepare a persuasive proposal, with comments on how the review process works. Finally, we close with a clarion call for organization researchers to help NSF understand the importance of organizations, and thus of organization research, to the whole array of the agency's other research interests-to the effective practice of science; to organizing human activity, including economic and educational activity; and to management and governance of human activities in general. As such, we argue, NSF has a stake in organizational research-and organizational researchers have a stake in NSF.

The objectives for the MAPP training program included teaching participants about MAPP resources on the Web, providing participants with instruction about what MAPP is, and why it is important for community health improvement. Participants were also instructed on how to implement MAPP through a series of concrete steps such as mobilizing community partnerships, creating an action plan, conducting a series of assessments, and identifying strategic issues. An on-site survey with pretraining and posttraining questions and a follow-up survey were developed and administered to participants to assess their readiness levels to access MAPP resources and actively use and promote MAPP in their communities. The findings indicate that participants' knowledge of MAPP and confidence to use it improved as a result of training, Six months after training, participants' readiness levels increased from pretraining levels in the areas of incorporating MAPP into their roles, presenting MAPP to community partners, and using MAPP for community health improvement projects. Making changes in their organizations and communities to implement MAPP did not change significantly from pretraining levels. Just under half of training participants were implementing MAPP 6 months posttraining.

J	Tayler, G				Tayler, G			UK Building Societies: 'Deregulation' change myths	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article								An academic and official orthodoxy has it that late 1970s and 1980s UK Building Societies 'deregulation' (part of wider financial services/ banking 'deregulation') foreshadowed great change in the nature of the industry and its markets and, so, in the task for management (change from stewardship to strategic management requiring greatly enhanced capability and from regulation protected marketplace, and permitted industry cartel, to open aggressive competition). In this article the orthodoxy is challenged and is exposed as being largely in the nature of myth through statements of building society finance directors in semi-structured interviews and financial data concerning the profitability nexus and markets.

One of their most relevant purposes is to align the organization strategy with the daily functioning of the organization. One of these models is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). In this paper, we propose a modeling strategy for the BSC implantation process. We will model it using UML Activity Diagrams and Strategy Dependency models of the language i*. The Activity Diagrams allow determining the order in which involved activities must be performed, and at the same time, to identify which people has the responsability to carry them out. The Strategic Dependency model allows showing the intentional aspects of the actors involved in the most strategic activities of this process. Finally, relationships among the actors and the people involved in the BSC implantation process are modelled using again the language i*. Although this paper only considers the case study of the BSC implantation, our proposal can be generalized to other implantation processes of systems with a high strategic impact on the organization, like ERP or CRM systems.

This article aims identify and categorize the stakeholders involved in the strategyc actions of a federal financial institution of development from 1986 to 2002. The survey reference is Freeman's ( 1984) proposal for the stakeholders management. In April 2003, some interviews were done with the organization's employees, besides bibliografic and documental research. From the knowledge of the strategic events existent in each period, the stakeholders were identified and categorized, considering the interests and influences of these actors in the studied institution. In conclusion it was realized that some factors are essential in order to make the organization reach its mission: a) articulation with the federal government, local entities, govern organizations and other entities that provide resources to assure the increasing of money funds; b) partnership with government organs, classes entities and universities aiming the results optimization.

LIBNET: A Case Study in Information Ownership & Tariff Incentives in a Collaborative Library Database	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						e-commerce managerial issues; e-commerce pricing issues; e-commerce strategy; intellectual property rights; online collaboration; strategic alliances		In any cooperative database the participants contribute their data for their own as well as the benefit of the other members, usually with incentives from the database administrators. A South African library network company (LIBNET) provided a networked service to participating libraries. Member benefits included conversion of their catalogues into machine-readable form, significantly reduced costs through cooperative cataloguing and more efficient interlibrary loans through a union catalogue of the holdings of the participant libraries. This case study explores some of the issues influencing tariff determination in a cooperative database. Questions of data ownership and the provision of incentives for the uploading of data also raise legal and ethical issues. The case study provides a basis for exploring business strategy in collaborative database management.	[Hooper, A. S.

Learning to Be Strategic: Learning By Doing and Learning Before Doing in Strategic Decision Making	REVISTA GESTAO & TECNOLOGIA-JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Learning curves; learning by doing; learning before doing; group learning; organizational learning; strategic decision making; problem solving		In this paper, we examine whether the learning curves so familiar in production settings are also manifest in strategic decision making by teams. We also analyze the degree to which learning before doing impacts the intercept or slope of such learning curves. We use data on 10 teams performing complex strategic problem-solving tasks over time. Results indicate that team strategic problem-solving does exhibit learning curve effects, and that investment in learning before doing (study of a process that takes place prior to commencing the task) significantly increased initial performance, but decreased the slope of the learning curves (the learning rate). These results lend support to the argument that learning before doing can jumpstart initial performance, but having "picked the low hanging fruit" (Pisano, 1997:40), less room is left for improvement through learning by doing.

J	Jelezov, EB				Jelezov, EB			Chart design and analysis of the railway freight tariff rates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS			English	Article								The modem conditions, under which railway transport is developing, are a challenge to freight operating companies. Their activity is subject to hardships grounded in the development of the common market, the separation of the railway infrastructure, the establishment of new carriers, the strong competition with the road transport and other social, economic and political reasons. A significant prerequisite to achieve the necessary efficiency and competitive power of operators is their ability to implement a flexible tariff policy. However, a number of practical questions have occurred when developing and applying railway freight tariffs. The problems are connected both with the analysis of freight costs as well as determining their level, differentiation, structure and model. The paper presents a method that attempts to overcome the difficulties connected with the analysis and modeling of tariffs. It presents the tariff rates graphically and facilitates and accelerates the process of strategic and operative pricing decisions. The advantages and potential abilities of the methods have been substantiated by models built from particular railway tariffs already in force.

J	Brissette, S				Brissette, S			Reputation management	NUCLEAR PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article								For an industry that prides itself on having intricate plans for every imaginable nuclear scenario, we have to ask ourselves, "Have we done enough planning in the area of reputation management?" For too many years, we've retreated from any perceived attacks from the media or our critics and let them forge our reputation. It's time for nuclear companies to tell their own stories and manage their own reputations. But how do you know if you are successful? Bruce Power has developed a full policy on reputation management and a way to measure how the company is perceived in the eyes of the public, its peers, critics, competitors and governments. This paper will demonstrate the methodology used to calculate reputation and demonstrate the link to strategic communication initiatives aimed at truly adding value to a company's "reputation bottomline".				susan.brissette@brucepower.com					Basler Roy P., 1953, COLLECTED WORKS A LI, V3, P27; LINCOLN A, 1858, COMMUNICATION   0821	2	0	0	0	0	EQES INC	GLEN ELLYN	799 ROOSEVELT RD, BUILDING 6, STE 208, GLEN ELLYN, IL 60137-5925 USA	0892-2055			NUCL PLANT J	Nucl.

The new approach is illustrated by using the example of a changed target for the debt-income ratio in the G-3. The results suggest that there are few policy externalities when only fiscal policy is coordinated, whilst coordination of both fiscal and monetary policy results in substantial externalities and welfare improvements. Our findings reflect the fact that, unlike earlier studies, we focus on the strategic interaction between (domestic) policy makers, as well as the standard exchange rate and interest rate transmission mechanisms.

Beginning with maintenance records from sea valve assessment, the paper demonstrates the application of various statistical tools and the related strengths and weaknesses of each. These tools involve maximum likelihood estimators, empirical methods, and hypothesized distributions. Using these methods, failure rates and confidence intervals are estimated and compared. Finally this information is combined to formulate a cohesive view that allows a high level of confidence in predicting sea valve failure. This paper demonstrates use of statistical models as a tool to validate and improve maintenance systems, costs, and strategic maintenance management programs.

J	McLeod, L; Thain, A; Wales, A				McLeod, L; Thain, A; Wales, A			Influence of strategic direction for NHS Scotland knowledge services on indexing policy for the NHS Scotland e-library	HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL			English	Article								Objectives: Indexing* policy for the NHS Scotland e-Library needs to maximize future inter-operability with other significant health- and social-care-related resources. The strategic drive towards integration and partnership working means that the indexing system has to be widely acceptable to the full range of disciplines within the integrated health-care family. Methods: Indexes identified by various means and then shortlisted using predefined criteria. Results: Three subject indexes have been chosen-Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), CareData and the Government Category List (GCL), plus mapping between natural language and MeSH terms. This decision was a reasonable compromise between the strategy-driven aim of seamless access for all 'partners in care', and practical constraints of time/manpower. Other authority files (e.g. geographical area, language) are also standards based, and customised to reflect the information needs of an increasingly integrated health-care system. Conclusions: No single index could provide the scope required to meet the widening range of NHS information need. The influence of high-level strategic aims and objectives have extended their reach to influence indexing policy for the e-Library. Our indexing policy will continue to evolve and contribute to a knowledge management infrastructure capable of supporting current and future NHS Scotland information needs and strategy. Layperson terminology was identified as a gap; additional measures to address this gap are highlighted.

J	Lee, JS; Yoshida, S; Tsuyuki, S; Minowa, M				Lee, JS; Yoshida, S; Tsuyuki, S; Minowa, M			A strategic forest planning model for integrating economic and ecological management goals	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY			English	Article							CONSTRAINTS	Timber harvest plan in forest management should be flexible to meet changing social and environmental needs. We need to collect and process the proper forest information, which will enhance the efficiency of working process in the harvest plan. Especially, GIS and RS techniques have been considered to have a benefit in processing the multidimensional information. The purpose of this study is to present strategic forest planning procedure that can support the identification of forest structures and the maximum use of forest functions through GIS, RS and LP techniques. In this study, forest information such as compartment structure and forest road was entered into GIS to construct FMIS. DEM was constructed using base maps of 1/5000 for the geographic analysis. Aerial photographs and DEMs were used to create orthophoto. Orthophoto was used to classify forest into 3 types, artificial, natural and bare forest. And then geographical attributes of each forest type were identified. Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) forest area of each forest type was used in the harvest simulation. A spatial constraint, distance from a forest road, is taken into consideration in the LP. New grouping unit, so called "harvest unit", was introduced as the forest management unit.

C.; Wagner, Tracy			Capital asset management process: the case of Hose & Fittings Corporation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL FINANCE			English	Article						Fixed assets; Capital budgeting; Capital projects; Assets management		Purpose - To develop a more effective, long-term-oriented capital asset management process for capital project evaluation Design/methodology/approach - Relying on a cash study format, the weaknesses of the traditional capital budgeting process are examined. The proposed capital asset management process is contrasted with the traditional process with respect to several aspects of long-term resource management. Flow-charts and evaluation matrices are presented. Findings - The capital asset management process offers significant improvements over the traditional process. First, it links various functions that trigger capital requirements. Through an actual versus plan measurement, capital plans become more accurate and predictable. Forecasting beyond one year also enhances the planning and management of resources. Second, the process promotes a more accurate evaluation of costs and benefits of capital projects. The suggested evaluation techniques include detailed qualitative analysis, real option and EVA analyses, and applying project/division costs of capital in place of a company cost of capital. Practical implications - The capital asset management process provides guidelines to justify and manage capital expenditures in a systematic manner for divisions and product lines within a company. For an effective application, the process should be established across all corporate levels so that top management and project managers have a clear understanding of the process and its importance with respect to a capital proposal's linkage to long-term strategic goals. Originality/value - This study provides a comprehensive overview of the traditional capital budgeting process based on an actual company case and presents key drives and evaluation techniques in the capital asset management process to effectively manage firms' long-term capital assets.

It deals with developing a full set of project plans, including milestones, tasks, schedules, staffing, deliverables, and projected costs, for a complex software development project (Gido & Clements, 2003; Kerzner, 2003; Schwalbe, 2002). The essence of this case is the analyzing of a specific organizational setting with critical software needs and the developing of the needed plans. As in many similar situations, this organization is relatively complex, and the situation is not entirely clear. By reviewing the facts of the case, collecting outside information, conducting role playing interviews, analyzing requirements, and estimating schedules and costs, one can collect the information needed to develop baseline project plans for the software development envisioned in this case.

J	Draskovic, M				Draskovic, Mimo			Theory of Games and Research Company's Nature	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						company; theory of games; competition; strategy; information		Company is complicate economic category and particular institute of contemporary economic system. In western economic science has been formulated different views on the nature of company. Theory of games has been arise in as alternative theoretical concept in evolution of research company's nature. There has been wide time interval between first (Cournot 1838) and next pioneer's attempt (Bertrand 1883, Edgeworth 1925) in appliance theory of games in analyse of economic problems. All those attempts had been limited on cases of oligopoly price policy and volume of production, without of possibility of generalize appliance theory of games on analyse of the other economic problems (balance, competition, risk, doubt, rationality, public choice, etc.). It was, partly, enabled in mid of last century (1944) when mathematician John Von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern published book "Theory of games and economic behaviour". They analysed matrix game of two actors with zero result, what mean that profit of one player is loss for the other. They went from assuming of rational players' behaviour, internecine conflict of theirs economic interests, risk and abeyance of opposing decisions. Aim of this article is to see importance and possibility of application theory of games in companies at all, and especially in nautical companies and in ports. It is possible by theory of games in economy and strategic management to model differ problems of development and company's organisation (strategic investment, production plan, marketing combinations), transport problems, price policy, competitions market structures and situations, bilateral negotiations ect. Methodologist instrumentals of theory of games in specific situations (in making important strategic decisions) offer possibility to nautical company (port, shippowner) to foresee some strategic moves of its partner (collaborator) and/or competitor and on that way its strategic behaviour adapt to conditions of bigger or smaller risk and uncertainty. As in the other economic areas, also in theory of games is used principle of model (simplified economic reality) by which are comprehended only representative players (actors) and dominant strategies. Short theoretical elaboration about essence of theory of games and possibility of its application in economic analyse and strategic management, with retrospective view on simple examples from nautical (shipping and port) transport as service industry, shows that it is for many nautical companies useful to consider possible reactions of theirs partners and/or competitors (accordingly different possible returned strategic replies). At that it ought to take in consideration that there are diverse and numerous limitations of application analytical instruments of theory of games, which its importance analyze on the level of supplemental strategic information during making decisions.

J	Hara, T				Hara, T			Innovation management of Japanese pharmaceutical companies: the case of an antibiotic developed by Takeda	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovation management; pharmaceutical industry; innovation in Japan; typology of innovation; drug discovery; new product development	BETA-KETOACIDS; CEPHALOSPORINS	It is often argued that the Japanese pharmaceutical industry lacks international competitiveness partly because of its weakness in innovation - most new drugs developed by Japanese companies are imitative and lack appeal in overseas markets. To address this problem, I suggest a well-defined typology of drug innovation. I found in my previous studies that the dominant type of innovation among Japanese companies has been the modification-based innovation, which indeed appears to be imitative. Although modification-based innovation is not necessarily easy it may bring in significant revenue. It is also found that institutional and organisational conditions of the Japanese market until recently were in favour of modification-based innovation. Therefore, it can be argued that innovation management of Japanese pharmaceutical companies in the past was not inappropriate. Recently, the situation is changing and some Japanese companies are seeking more radical types of innovation. But we should not underestimate the strategic value of modification-based innovation.

J	Karppi, I				Karppi, Ilari			Good Governance and Prospects for Local Institutional Stability in the Enlarged European Union	JOURNAL OF EAST-WEST BUSINESS			English	Article						Governance; administrative reforms; EU enlargement; regionalization; institutional stability		Since 1989, the Central and East European new market economies have implemented major governance reforms. Local administrations in these formerly centralized societies are gradually empowered to take a more strategic grip on their grassroots communities' developmental needs. However, public management-driven governance reforms are seen to constitute an ideologically rigid mainstream paradigm that diverts from the traditional Western market democracies' evolutionary institutional development trajectory. To implement large-scale governance restructuring, institutions such as EU or IMF have introduced powerful tools for monitoring, evaluating and assessing the pace of progress in the ways how the new market economies are governed. Still in a transitional stage, they need to accept these tools as ready-made parts delivered for their reforms. So far the tools utilized for the governance of policies run by the European institutions may themselves have been too centralizing and neglected the needs of more horizontal communication and learning from various grassroots communities' experiences. This may be counterproductive to an overall strive for enhanced European competitiveness. (C) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, JH; Lii, P; Chang, CP				Lin, Jyh-Horng; Lii, Peirchyi; Chang, Chuen-Ping			Loan commitments, asymmetric information and capital regulation : an explanation for the synergy or narrow-banking management	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Banking; asymmetric information; capital requirement; loan commitment		We use a two-stage option-based model to study how Asymmetric information, capital requirements, loan commitment rate and the optimal loan rate relate to one another under an uncertain loan loss source. This model shows that there will be synergies between lending and deposit-taking to the extent that both require the bank to hold large liquid asset balances if its term loans and loan commitments are substitutes. Otherwise, narrow banking management is required by the bank. However, if the bank's term loans and loan commitments are substitutes (complements) and the bank conducts strategic substitutes (strategic complements), there is also real narrow banking. Our findings provide an alternative explanation for the synergy or narrow banking management, which answer the question: if there is real synergy (narrow banking), a forced switch to narrow banking (synergy) could lead to a large inefficiency.

A field survey of Malaysian universities was conducted to determine the key factors that facilitate the adoption of non-business EB. Since EB adoption decision is a strategic one, a comprehensive list of potential facilitators for the strategic use of information technology (IT) was derived from extant literature and used in collecting data from 65 schools and centres in five public universities in Kota Kinabalu and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The data were factoranalysed to determine the key underlying dimensions of facilitators. On the basis of the resulting five dimensions namely, relative advantage orientation, network orientation, information efficiency orientation, innovativeness orientation, and competitiveness orientation, regression analysis was done to determine the impact of the five dimensions on non-business EB adoption.

Cross-national evaluation and benchmarking of manufacturing SMEs using an expert system based assessment tool (QuickView)	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Benchmarking; Manufacturing industries; Strategic evaluation; Small to medium-sized enterprises		Purpose - To determine whether: Quick View, that is a primary assessment and business planning tool that was designed in the USA in the 1990s, could be usable out of USA; and manufacturing SMEs outside of the US could be evaluated against the 3,400 US SMEs on the QuickView database. Design/methodology/approach - The project consists of a survey of a sample of SMEs in different overseas regions, Northern Spain being one of them: revise and translate questionnaire to local language; train local agents; conduct a survey of a sample of 50 SMEs using the local agents; and review the results and draw conclusions as to the applicability of the model. Findings - We think that we have demonstrated that QuickView is a valid tool to use on non-US SMEs to help build local databases containing local companies. What is not so evident is how to establish direct comparisons between the two databases. To make this, the USA database should be partitioned by year of survey or by industry sector. We can draw some initial conclusions about the Spanish sample. Research limitations/implications - The USA database should be partitioned by year of survey or by industry sector, to make direct comparisons. A further continuation of this project is, obviously, an in-depth analysis of the Spanish sample. Another issue is whether an open structure can be developed for QuickView that would allow it to be modified into specialized questionnaires for service companies, for example, or a questionnaire dedicated to the SMEs in a particular country. Practical implications - To create a database of spanish companies based on QuickView methodology to serve as a reference of management practices. Originality/value - There are currently several projects trying to develop standard European benchmarking tools and databases. Our project presents an adaptation of another different tool already in use in the USA and proves its validity in an European context. This tool should be useful either for companies trying to evaluate themselves and compare with a local, though still small, database or for external agents trying to compare one particular company against the database.

Strategic operations and logistics planning process for an integrated supply chain strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations strategy; logistics and supply chain strategy; formulation process; implementation; action research; Australia		This paper examines the design and implementation of an effective process of operations and logistics strategy. A process called Strategic Operations and Logistics Planning (SOLP) is developed from the Manufacturing Audit Approach to encompass operations, both internal to enterprises, and across the extended enterprise. The paper posits that SOLP can be used in enterprises with weak strategic planning skills based on successful testing of the process in three Australian meat processing companies. The comparative success of the SOLP process is underpinned by the use of action research involving external facilitation, group consensus and tailoring the process to meet the enterprise needs. The results suggest that the SOLP process is successful and that repeated use by a planning team improves its effectiveness in formulation and integration.

J	Quiros, IS				Sanchez Quiros, Isabel			SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFIGURATIONS Strategy, Structure, and Culture Combinations in Spanish Hotels	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organization studies; Alignment theory; Spain; Hotel industry; Strategy; Effectiveness	CORPORATE CULTURE; PERFORMANCE; CONTEXT; FORMALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; RELIABILITY; FIT	The paper proposes a model that will enable us to go deeper into the study of organizations, bringing forth a framework that will allow us to make many propositions explicit and thus provide a contrast to the alignment theory. We test the model in the Spanish hotel industry. We have been able to identify the internal processes and behavior that fit into each strategic pattern, which go deeper into the process of putting each strategy into practice (first objective: first set of hypotheses). Furthermore, the analysis of the internal processes and behavior that bring about the different degrees of effectiveness in each strategic type makes it possible to build or maintain the complementary nature of business strategy and internal process, and guarantee its success (second objective: second and third sets of hypotheses).

J	Spais, GS				Spais, George S.			A fundamental formula for leadership efficiency: weighting the contribution of 'marketing paideia'	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						Productive leadership; leadership strategies; leadership style; efficiency; paideia; values; marketing education		Building businesses leaders is the pathway to increase competitiveness in a micro-and macro-economic level. That's why marketing (a word of ancient Greek origin) and leadership are two linked concepts. So, it seems that there is a highest research priority on how higher levels of marketing productivity can be achieved. A 'good' leadership (productive leadership efforts) seems to be expressed from the known formula of management science. A ratio between effectiveness (degree of achieving goals) to efficiency (degree of exploitation of entered information). In such frames, the in-depth examination of Ancient Sparta's case during the period of king Agesilaos will be proven valuable. Agesilaos, after a long decline period had succeeded to lead Sparta in leadership levels for more than 40 years. The case becomes more interesting if we consider that Sparta's external environment (the other Greek states-poleis: Athens, Theba, Corinth, etc.) was highly competitive, as the global economic environment nowadays. The aim of the study is to examine if there is a potent relation among leaders' educational background (paideia), their personality traits, and their ability to formulate winning grand strategies for leadership. But it seems that the most important factor is not related to the leader's personality characteristics but the characteristics of the 'mathematically' reengineered 'Spartan system'-a system designed by Lycurgus, probably the first successful systemic reform process. In continuous, we have conducted an in-depth literature review on the modern empirical evidence from academic journals in marketing, in order to formulate safe scientific arguments and the fundamental leadership efficiency formula. We strongly believe that this conceptual analysis will provide not only valuable findings, but also significantly research implications to the academic community of marketing.

J	Tchibozo, G				Tchibozo, Guy			Institutional Organisation, Performance Determinants and Success Strategies in Secondary Science Teacher Preparation in France	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								In France, secondary teachers are public sector employees. Becoming a science teacher in secondary education is subject to passing public competitive entry examinations. Preparation for these examinations is provided by University Institutes Departments, which are essentially assessed on the basis of the successful performance of their students in the exams. This paper analyses the determinants of departments' performance. After a broad description of the French system of secondary science teacher recruitment, significant determinants of successful performance are identified. Finally, from this analysis, some strategic implications for the management of departments' success performance have been derived.

J	Van Hoorebeek, M; Marson, J				Van Hoorebeek, Mark; Marson, James			Teaching and technology transfer as alternative revenue streams A primer on the potential legal implications for UK universities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Income; Litigation; Technology led strategy; Teaching; Universities; United Kingdom		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the financial and intellectual issues facing the university sector as many institutions in the UK pursue alternative revenue streams. As a consequence to the increasing financial pressures, university departments are increasingly exposed to new forms of potential litigation and also face the risk to the prestige of their university and departmental brand. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical and analytical approach is adopted whereby an introduction to the topic of revenue streams is presented before a review is conducted of the two most prominent and important streams available to the higher education sector-teaching and technology transfer. The paper furthers this analysis through a discussion of the accompanying legal consequences to UK universities and offers strategies to be adopted by such institutions to avoid these pitfalls. Findings - The investigation has identified that the pursuit of additional sources of money from teaching and technology transfer pose significant risks and should only be considered after a rigorous analysis of the associated cost by institutional and departmental management structures. Originality/value - The paper offers an insight into the experience of litigation and the intellectual problems encountered by university departments in the USA. This evidence is utilised to consider how it may provide UK-based counterparts with a guide to avoid similar problems. It will be of relevance to practitioners, managers and strategic planners in the university sector.

Part two of the study will focus on SOE managers' espoused theory on the building blocks of innovation. The findings of the literature (theoretical) review, suggested that the current theoretical framework on innovation consisted of five important building blocks, namely contextual setting; strategic enablers; business enablers; foundational enablers; and human resources; each with its own categories and sub-categories. The study also identified barriers to innovation.

A qualitative approach, namely Grounded Theory, supported by Theoretical Sampling, was applied in generating the primary data for the study from different management levels in the SOE. The managers' espoused theory, based on empirical evidence, shows that innovation consisted of five important building blocks, namely contextual setting; strategic enablers; business enablers; foundational enablers; and human resources; each with its own categories and sub-categories. The study also identified barriers to innovation. An innovation diffusion framework, specifically for implementation in a government context, was proposed.

Congestion-driven planning method becomes one of the new challenges under deregulated environment. With POOL transaction pattern being the basic investigation background, the fuzzy congestion management models for bilateral auction market mode and single-buyer market mode are set up first in this paper. The soft constraints of line power flow limits, and market participants' bidding curve coefficients considering possible strategic bidding, are all described in form of fuzzy membership functions. Second, based on the maximum membership rule and maximum entropy principle, the fuzzy optimal congestion management problem is solved. New sensitivity indexes to select to-be-built or to-be-upgraded lines are defined for the two market modes respectively. They describe the compromise between congestion relieving impact and investments, and make the problem of transmission network planning solved fast, simple and heuristic. Test results illustrates that the fuzzy congestion-driven and sensitivity analysis based heuristic transmission network planning method for POOL transaction pattern presented by this paper is robust and practical under the deregulated environment.

J	Vandermeulen, F				Vandermeulen, F			Towards the service company - The 'service enabling platform' as a key asset	JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	43rd European Telecommunications Congress	SEP   08, 2004	Ghent, BELGIUM					Faced with the declining revenues from commodity-based connectivity services and confronted with the gloomy economic climate, telecommunications providers are scanning new opportunities in the area of value-added services in order to unlock new potential revenue streams. Multimedia services such as multi-party conferencing and content delivery (for example, video on demand (VoD), video broadcast), home automation, security management (for example, home surveillance), and managed home networking are just some examples from the emerging service basket. Next-generation services require next-generation network infrastructure. In this perspective, a major trend is the evolution towards the IP-based digital home where a myriad of devices and appliances (such as set-top boxes, IP videophones, domotics bridges, etc.) connected on a residential home gateway will be reachable via broadband connectivity. Value-added services will be delivered from next-generation back-end service virtual private networks (VPNs) such as logical IP clouds housing VoD cluster servers, soft-switching platforms, gaming servers, etc. In order to turn the potential revenue streams into profits, the operator must provide subscribers with self-provisioning and behind-the-scenes service activation at minimal expense, track and bill for these new IP services, and enable third-party providers and content providers to deliver their services across the infrastructure of the broadband core network and the digital home network. The key missing piece to allow for all this, is a strategic service enabling platform (SEP) to be exploited by the operator. This paper elaborates on the requirements and possible implementation of such a platform.

J	Ming, X				Ming, X			Sustainable development strategies for China's Du Jiang Yan water resources project	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY			English	Article						sustainable development; water resources; irrigation; strategic framework; support system; evaluation indices		China's Du Jiang Yan Irrigation Project, dating back to 256 BC, is one of the world's earliest water resources projects. Although it has been benefiting the Sichuan Basin area for over 2000 years, it is facing increasing problems due to ecological deterioration, over-exploitation from local industries and agriculture, sub-optimal resource allocation arising from supply and demand mismatches, and an aging infrastructure. The traditional water resources development model is no longer appropriate for current and future needs of the area. Therefore, a sustainable development framework is envisioned in which population, economy and environment coexist in harmony. Within this framework, major strategies, such as construction and renovation of infrastructure, promotion of water conserving irrigation through non-engineering measures, pollution control and ecological improvements, restructuring of management entities and exploration of new funding sources, are proposed. An evaluation system is also introduced to assess the degree of sustainability and to monitor progress towards a high level of sustainable development.

J	Murphy, BM; Wubbena, RL; Thompson, GL; Graham, AG				Murphy, BM; Wubbena, RL; Thompson, GL; Graham, AG			Strategic business planning as a water resource management tool	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								The way water utilities manage water resource issues is changing out of necessity. Today, water utilities are faced with constraints beyond those associated with water quality and delivery. Through interviews with participating utilities the authors identified a complex set of constraints including regulations, customer expectations, and environmental, political, and financial issues. Utilities reported that balancing these constraints while developing a better product in a competitive market is forcing them to reexamine how, when, where, and why resources are developed and managed. This article presents the Strategic Business Planning Model (SBPM) that was developed to enable utilities to integrate water resource development activities both within and outside the utility. The SBPM strategically integrates water resource planning elements and facilitates implementation of a holistic resource approach. The model is an iterative, long-term method for integrating all utility elements into a strategic business plan that organizes the internal and external intricacies and interrelationships necessary to operate in a successful, businesslike manner.

J	Nwagboso, CO; Pendlebury, MA; Mukarram, SK				Nwagboso, CO; Pendlebury, MA; Mukarram, SK			Performance benchmarks of pressure and fibre optics sensors for natural gas engine control	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING			English	Article						engine control; engine management; fibre optics; ignition control; combustion control; characteristics and simulation	NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIESEL-ENGINE; EMISSIONS; SYSTEMS	Traditionally, the automotive industry has been using piezoelectric transducers for measuring cylinder pressure due to their higher frequency and relatively small size. However, there is the need to develop sensors that are capable of measuring other combustion parameters. An optical fibre sensor can give accurate readings of combustion characteristics (e.g. combustion species concentrations) with high temporal resolution within each engine cycle. Engine control systems incorporating these sensors can reduce harmful emissions levels and improve fuel economy as well as performing parametric monitoring for predicting emission levels. A strategic combination of the fibre optic sensor as part of the control system can be deployed in order to provide these benefits. This paper presents the design of a novel sensing scheme with a fibre optic sensory system capable of monitoring the combustion event as part of the natural gas engine control system with a minimal invasive technique. The robustness of the optical sensory system is compared with a pressure sensory signal and is used to analyse mass fraction burn and heat release. An integrated ignition controller is presented that will enable the ignition angle to be modified based on the measured optical combustion signal with a control technique to provide an optimal management of the engine performance. The technique presented in this paper was developed as part of a research and development programme. However, the results will also make a significant contribution to further deployment of the technology in production vehicles.

J	Ghani, JA				Ghani, Jawaid Abdul			BATA: STRATEGIC CHOICES	ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CASES			English	Article						Strategy; vertical integration; outsourcing; distribution channels; footwear		The case describes the history of Bata (Pakistan) together with relevant information on major competitors in Pakistan's footwear industry. Bata started as a vertically integrated manufacturer and soon dominated the industry. The development of the leather export industry and growth in consumer buying power in the eighties, selective imposition of sales tax in the mid-eighties, and lowering of trade barriers in the twenty-first century, resulted in the emergence of firms specializing in different stages along the value chain. When this occurred, Bata's wide scope and vertical integration no longer remained a source of competitive advantage, and resulted in threats from inexpensive imports and leaner and more specialized firms. The case allows students the opportunity to analyse outsourcing decisions, issues related to franchised versus company-owned stores, and introduction of global brands, in the context of a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.

The paper attempts to look 50 years beyond the birth of LEO in order to discern the nature. and effects of business computing in 2051. Scenarios are offered of some possible business applications fifty years hence. These include the business information systems in space and the nature of manufacturing. The scenarios serve as a basis for addressing a number of issues. These include the availability of technology to support the scenarios presented, the nature of organizations shaped by future information systems, the nature of employment in the new organizational structure, consumer-vendor relations in the new economy, the effects of the new information technology on the nature of national governments, and the effect of information technologies on the structure of the global economy.

A new focus was given with the issue of Planning Policy Guidance 25, and this paper presents experience from a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment of South Holland District, in Lincolnshire. The assessment pioneered the examination of fenland flood risk in terms of risk zones related to flood hazard and standard of protection. Methods for evaluating the risk zones are described; they consider flooding from embanked rivers which are subject to tide locking, internal drainage systems, tide level and wave action. The methods would be appropriate for many lowland areas of the UK where conventional flood analysis cannot be used.

J	Downie, D; Nosal, E				Downie, D; Nosal, E			A strategic approach to hedging and contracting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION			English	Article								This paper provides a new rationale for hedging that is based, in part, on non-competitive behavior in product markets. We identify a set of conditions which imply that a firm may want to hedge. Empirically, these conditions are not inconsistent with what is observed in the market place. The conditions are: (i) firms have some market power in their product market, (ii) firms have limited liability, and (iii) firms can contract to sell their output at a specified price before all factors which can affect their profitability are known. For some parameter specifications, however, our model predicts that firms will not want to hedge. This result is as important as our hedging results since, in practice, although a large fraction of firms do hedge their cash flows, a substantial number of firms do not.

J	Diedericks, AW; Fouche, PAP; Badenhorst, SN				Diedericks, AW; Fouche, PAP; Badenhorst, SN			A systems approach in implementing Minerals Resource Management at a base metal mine (Rosh Pinah Zinc Corporation, Namibia)	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	SAIMM Conference on Recovery of Base Metals in Southern Africa: Mine to Metal	JUL 16-18, 2002	SUN CITY, SOUTH AFRICA	SAIMM				Rosh Pinah Zinc Corporation (RPZC) identified implementing a Mineral Resource Management (MRM) programme at the mine as a strategic incentive. The purpose of the programme is to optimize the economic value of the RPZC mineral resource, over the total value chain of the mine, taking expected macro economic conditions into consideration as well. With Mineral Resource Management still being a relatively young drive in the mining industry, information on the concept is relatively scarce. RPZC had several successes and problems with implementing such a concept and also still has a way to go before a complete Minerals Resource Management approach is implemented at the mine and entrenched as a working culture. The purpose of this paper is to: . define a systems approach to implementing a mineral Resource Management programme at a base metal mine . indicate the specific MRM approaches taken at RPZC . indicate the expected advantages of implementing a MRM approach . measure the actions already taken against the systematic MRM approach, and indicate the advantages already captured indicate the way forward taking lessons learned into consideration . indicate proposals to implement the MRM approach in the macro mining environment in South Africa.

Antihistamines are used to treat the symptoms of SAR. This research compared desloratadine with placebo for the treatment of SAR. Additional baseline data were obtained outside the allergy season. Nine real-world equivalent performance scores were obtained from individuals participating in the Strategic Management Simulation. For easier task demands, no difference between treatment conditions was observed. For demands of intermediate difficulty, SAR diminished performance and desloratadine restored performance to baseline. For the most challenging task demands, desioratadine treatment improved performance over allergy season placebo treatment. The data suggest that the beneficial effects of desloratadine vary with task difficulty.

J	Kumar, SS				Kumar, SS			Strategic alliances and entrepreneurship in innovation diffusion and technology management - The emergent paradigm	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article								The paper dwells on aspects of innovation diffusion in the context of technology, management. The linear model of innovation diffusion has been replaced by two-way models. This calls for diffusion mechanisms based on cooperative or consortia type alliances for strategic advantages. It also calls for science based entreprenuership. even in public funded research agencies. The linkages with potential client have to be forged through specific policy initiatives and diffusion mechanisms like those found in OECD countries. The corporate vision in CSIR in India is aimed at creating condition's for contract research and an entrepreneurial research environment in public funded laboratories. Strategic research and promotion of tacit knowledge as well as people networks and high-tech training centres are found to be important component. The Japanese S&T policy and the changes in its key points are pointers to the importance of an innovation oriented industrial policies. S&T policies in India are also undergoing a transformation due to internationalization. The new science and technology (S&T) policy should facilitate proactive networking among research labs, private enterprise, and public agencies including financial institutions. The concurrent developments in research management practices are also highlighted.

The potential commercial payoff of WWW application attracts more and more organizations to build their own web sites and develop business-to-business or business-to-consumer applications on the Internet. Designing Web applications has become a critical corporate strategic issue. However, current methods of modeling and designing hypertext applications are in chaotic and ad-hoc nature. These approaches lack the stringent and rigorous system analysis and design principles. Special efforts are needed to develop a formal method to support the modeling and design of hypertext applications. This research aims to tackle this important issue and propose an effective and efficient design alternative. We build a toolkit prototype that implements the design method we present. This toolkit is easy to use and to integrate with SQL compliant database systems. We develop a Web hypertext design method called the database-centric Web hypertext design method (DWHDM) to approach Web page requirements analysis, Web hypertext navigation design, Web page template generation, and hypertext information system maintenance. We adopt UML class diagram, state diagram, and sequence diagram to capture user requirements and application characteristics. We use a relational or object-relational database system to serve as the integrating design repository.

J	Polosa, M; Broccatelli, G				Polosa, M; Broccatelli, G			Mobile network sharing: Technical solutions, strategic implications and economical impacts for mobile operators	JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st European Telecommunication Congress	SEP 04-07, 2002	GENOA, ITALY	Fed Telecommunicat Engineers European Comm				In past years network sharing has often been taken into consideration as an asymmetric condition imposed on incumbent operators to facilitate new entrants in the telecommunications marketplace. With the advent of the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), the cost of licences has transformed this measure into an opportunity for all mobile operators, in order to reduce capital expenditure, deployment and management costs, and accelerate ate network roll-out. Different solutions exist, with different implications both on the strategic side and the economical side. Depending on the level of cooperation required by the agreement, operators will partially lose their independence in making choices, and will need to disclose strategic information to the other party. This paper analyses the possible technical solutions, trying to evaluate the savings obtainable in every sharing model, assessing their strategic value and finally comparing the different benefits that operators can derive from network sharing, depending on their role in the network sharing agreement and their position in the marketplace.

J	Harvey, J; Saunders, M				Harvey, J; Saunders, M			Exploiting the wholesale telecommunications market - The role of CRM	JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK			English	Article								Customer relationship management (CRM) has become the focus for many organisations and it would be rare to find an organisation that is not involved in CRM implementation in some manner or form. This article highlights some of the reasons and benefits for CRM implementation and its role in the future telecommunications market. The wholesale telecommunications market is finding that it is having to evolve from the commodity selling of minutes and bandwidth to value-added services, and is having to adapt its organisation to embrace this change. CRM and analysing customer data give organisations more insight into their customers which in turn helps them to manage and address this changing market. Analytics will become more prevalent in strategic decision making with regard to retaining customers, especially through identifying those customers that are of most value.

Through their ongoing activities, interactions and language games, people come to modify linkages with the organization's environment. An organizational ethnography approach is used to reconstruct two episodes that illustrate the transformation of strategic systems during a change in orientation of a top-of-the-line clothing company,. These episodes demonstrate how people use the company's rules and resources to structure new links with their clientele. "Over-coding" and "translating" are two micro-dynamics that are inherent to actors' strategic competence.

J	De Lopez, TT				De Lopez, TT			Brave new parks: Lessons from internationally funded protected areas in Cambodia	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						Cambodia; international conservation; national parks; protected areas		This paper assesses international efforts to establish a system of protected areas in Cambodia and reviews the history, legal regime, and institutional background of these efforts. Donor-funded projects have been successful in creating a legal and institutional framework, and in training protected area staff, Despite these achievements, projects have suffered from critical shortcomings, including poor institutional support, lack of planning and coordination, weak accountability, inadequate management of human resources, and financial unsustainability. These problems must be addressed before new field projects can be efficiently implemented. The paper suggests strategic priorities and assesses their operational needs. The establishment of an environmental fund would provide a source of income to meet the operating expenses of protected areas in Cambodia. The annual costs of operating a southern cluster of four national parks, an area covering 201,000 ha, are estimated at US$200,000. The assistance of the international community will remain crucial if Cambodia is to protect its natural environment.

J	Fields, E				Fields, E			Present and future status of the NOAA oceanographic fleet	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL			English	Article								NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) provides centralized management of NOAA's fleet of 15 vessels that support a wide range of operational and research missions. NOAA's ship requirements are being met with a mix of commercial charters, contracts for data, the UNOLS academic fleet and NOAA vessels. In 2000, OMAO developed its five-year strategic plan in direct support of the NOAA strategic plan. The primary focus of the OMAO strategic plan is to provide the best value in safe, high-quality ship and aircraft operations and scientific support to NOAA and the nation. Having efficient and effective ocean platforms that collect atmospheric and oceanographic data, which can ground truth (or validate) other data platforms, is still paramount to NOAA and the scientific community. As NOAA continues its critical research on the coupling of the atmosphere and ocean that drives global climate, as well as protecting and managing marine environments, its fleet will play a vital role in supporting these efforts.

J	Dexter, PC				Dexter, PC			A strategic European approach to aerodynamics research, technology and development	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								In spite of the best intentions of many national and international funding agencies, much of the research and technology development (RTD) activity undertaken in Europe over the past few years has often been duplicating the work of others and has not resulted in an increase in capability in key areas. This is not to denigrate the work that has been undertaken - but have we done the right work? The EC-funded Thematic Network `Targeted Research Action in Aerospace Aerodynamics', (TRA3), has been initiated with the broad aims of improving collaboration between existing EC- supported projects and, more importantly, attempting to put in place a long-term strategy for European aerospace aerodynamics RTD. TRA3 is, amongst other things, attempting to answer three key questions: . What are the important aerodynamic technologies? . What is the European aerospace industry's current capability in these areas? . In which areas should Europe be investing to maintain a competitive aerodynamics capability? The major benefit and output expected from TRA3 is the creation of a co-ordinated European aerodynamics RTD programme. The TRA3 Management Board consists of seven people who represent a cross-section of the European aerospace industry and research establishments, together with a Project Officer from the European Commission. This Management Board is tasked with formulating long-term plans for nine `Key Technology Areas' that encompass all of the important aerodynamic technologies. This paper outlines the progress that has been made in meeting the very ambitious initial aims of the demanding work programme.

J	Van de Vel, K				Van de Vel, K			Avoiding xDSL provisioning pitfalls - How to mass market and roll-out xDSL services	JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	40th Congress of the Federation-Telecommunications-Engineers-of-the-European-Community (FITCE)	AUG 22-25, 2001	BARCELONA, SPAIN	Federat Telecommun Engineers European Community				Digital subscriber line (xDSL) broadband access services are becoming a hot topic in the marketplace. On the supply side, the main structural drivers for this rapid expected growth rate are: After the abundance of bandwidth (and failing prices) caused by the increased competition created in the core network space, operators are now looking to offer value-added services into the access network part where there, was traditionally less competition. The access space has the strategic potential of 'owning the customer'. The local loop unbundling phenomenon in Europe (supported by an EU directive) now allows competitive service providers to enter this emerging market. Today's most important challenge for a service provider is to have infrastructure ready to mass market the high-bandwidth xDSL services customers require. In reality, xDSL service provisioning and roll-out is a very painful process and takes a lot of time (often several weeks). Rapid provisioning is key to gain market share quickly and to benefit from the first-mover advantages in the marketplace. Other challenges to be overcome by integrated OSS/BSS software are: rapid provisioning of network services (roll-out), customer care and flexible billing, order entry and management of customer accounts, usage data collection and mediation, network inventory management, fraud management, fault management, performance management, quality-of-service assurance, and trouble ticketing. This paper will took into these challenges and the strategies associated with them.										0	0	0	0	1	INST BRIT TELECOMMUN ENG	LONDON	POST POINT 2 D05, THE ANGEL CENTER, 403 JOHN ST, LONDON EC1V 4PL, ENGLAND	1470-5826			J INST BRIT TELECOMM	J.

J	Richter, FJ				Richter, FJ			Systemic technology management - An organizational learning view	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE	The article opposes conventional innovation management to systemic technology management requiring organizations to simultaneously internalize and develop innovations, competencies and the organizational culture. This is a strategic and holistic approach to organizational self-renewal and consists of tho combination of horizontal and vertical learning processes, thereby determining an organization's internal as well as external relations. Several indicators of systemic technology management have been brought out. Indicators of varieties of knowledge layers, and of different types of learning-modes, along with the corresponding learning orders are described. It is contended that indicators of innovation cannot be described without a complete account of the learning.

J	Mandel, BN; Schnell, O				Mandel, BN; Schnell, O			An 'Open sky' scenario for Hamburg Airport and Germany	JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Hamburg Aviation Conference	DEC, 1999	HAMBURG, GERMANY	Hamburg Minist Econom Affairs, Hamburg Airport, HWWA, Inst Econom Res, Univ Hamburg		air transport; transport policy; 'open sky'; strategic simulation; system approach; travel demand; aircraft movements; Hamburg Airport; Germany		After explaining the background of this paper and the underlying basic modelling task a short description of the working procedure and the 'Open Sky' scenario results are shown in detail for Hamburg airport and in general for Germany. Hamburg airport can expect to gain passengers as a result of the newly inaugurated services. These services will be more international than intra-European, therefore the mix of aircraft movements will significantly change to more wide-body aircraft. This will affect airport revenues, ground handling and the airport infrastructure as well as noise exposure of the surrounding residents. For Germany in total, Open Sky will increase the overall volume of passengers although not all airports will be winners. In particular, international airports in highly populated areas will gain while smaller airports will lose due to decreasing feeder activities. The aircraft movements in Germany will decrease due to less flubbing and feeder services and the movement to somewhat larger aircraft. One limitation of the study was that it was not possible to consider passenger flows from outside Germany hubbing outside Germany as well as all other potential markets due to both data and time constraints. Obviously, we expect that some of these flows will be redirected towards German airports due to the new services so that the overall passenger gain will be higher than shown in the results. Of course, this will affect aircraft movements as well. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sohal, AS				Sohal, AS			From privatization to commercialization: a case study from the Australian aerospace industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						privatization; technology adoption; aerospace industry; Australia		AeroSpace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) is Australia's major player in the international aerospace industry and competes directly with international aerospace companies. Previously known as the 'Government Aircraft Factory', it manufactured aircraft and guided weapons for over 50 years. A strategic push towards privatization during the mid-1980s and the need to achieve international benchmarks of performance highlighted a number of areas for improvement within ASTA. One such area was the chemical milling process that detects flaws and imperfections in aeroplane parts. To achieve the required productivity, the detection process was effectively redesigned and now incorporates computer control of all process variables and automatic transfer of parts within a single building. This was a significant change from the traditional process and resulted in a doubling of productivity within two years, greater quality control and better utilization of employees. The change involved application of unprecedented software and plant technology, liaison with consultants, training and multi-skilling of employees, and changes to traditional job descriptions. This article details these issues and examines the planning and implementation strategy used by ASTA and the limitations and benefits of such a change in process technology.

J	Takahashi, T				Takahashi, T			The role of knowledge and organization in the competitiveness of Japanese high-tech industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on New Technological Landscapes in Asia Pacific	MAR, 1999	TAIPEI, TAIWAN			breakthrough innovation; science-driven; engineering-driven; information-driven; doctrine of workshop and actual entity; digital revolution		In the 1980s Japan was viewed as the world leader in high technology. Its superiority in electronics and other manufacturing sectors created the enigma of the Japanese management system and trade friction with the USA. Today the sharp decline in Japan's competitiveness has become another enigma and even a trouble in the world economy, This paper addresses the contrast between Japan's high-tech industry in the 1980s and that in the 1990s. The ascendance of Japanese high-tech industry up until the 1980s has been attributed to tacit knowledge and the organization of Japanese firms based on shared knowledge. The competitive decline during the 1990s has been viewed as a failure of the Japanese assembly industry to adapt to the change in explicit knowledge embodied in the digital revolution. In this paper the author produces a more comprehensive explanation for the decline in the competitiveness of the Japanese high-tech industry by introducing a comparison between science-driven sectors, which rely on the sharing of tacit knowledge, and engineering-driven sectors, which should rely more on explicit knowledge such as is found in strategic components. The author argues that different forms of organization are appropriate to different types of knowledge exchange. He concludes that current changes in the organization of Japanese firms and research will stimulate the science-driven sector of the country's high-tech industry.

J	Tetsuya, U				Tetsuya, U			Missile defense and extended deterrence in the Japan-US alliance	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article								As long as the United States remains vulnerable an attack with long-range nuclear missiles, Japanese confidence in US extended deterrence would rest on the ability of Tokyo and Washington to (1) maintain a favorable balance in conventional forces most relevant to the defense of Japan, (2) avoid provoking the potential adversary into threatening a nuclear assault against Japan and (3) fasten the bilateral relationship so as to impress the adversary about the possibility of US response with strategic nuclear weapons in case he launched such an assault. Further Japanese cooperation in the US theater missile defense (TMD) program would generally have positive effects as regards the first and third conditions above, although management of the process might be quite challenging. The impact on the second condition would be harder to judge, largely because it is difficult to predict how missile defense in East Asia might affect Chinese nuclear strategy.

J	Lewis, I; Coulter, DY				Lewis, I; Coulter, DY			The Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement: Strategic transportation for national defense	TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL			English	Article							FLEET	The Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) was established in February 1997 following approval of the Maritime Security Program (MSP) under the Maritime Security Act of 1996 (MSA). Ocean carriers enroll in the MSP in order to receive subsidies that are meant to offset the higher cost of operating U.S.-flag vessels. Carriers with vessels enrolled in the MSP agree to make their ships and related intermodal equipment available on request to the U.S. Department of Defense if VISA is activated. Because VISA has been in effect only since 1997, it is too early to assess VISA's impact on the strategic mobility of the U.S. military. However it has provided some assistance to the shrinking fleet of U.S.-flag ships, and to the maintenance of a reservoir of skilled U.S. mariners. Also, the cost of subsidizing U.S.-flag shipping has been reduced; MSP/VISA subsidies amount to considerably less than the cost of maintaining additional government-owned ships.

J	Sharma, S				Sharma, S			Total Knowledge Management (TKM): Enhancing competitiveness through Knowledge Management Systems	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Meet on Intangibles and Competition / Co-operation Strategy: Measurement and Management Issues	DEC 29-31, 1999	NEW DELHI, INDIA	Natl Inst Sci & Dev Studies, India Int Ctr				Differentiation between vigyan or the empirical knowledge and gyan or the atmik or the knowledge of Self is central to the Indian thought. At the holistic level, Total Knowledge implies both vigyan and gyan. However, when we talk of 'Total Knowledge Management', we are looking at the management of knowledge at the self, society and enterprise level. It may be indicated that in the Western idiom, total knowledge has a restricted meaning in terms of only two components viz. codified knowledge and tacit knowledge. Total knowledge is a combination of the 'explicit' and the 'tacit'. This definition of total knowledge is also at the vigyan level. For pragmatic reasons we restrict the idea of Total Knowledge to 'vigyan' level as indicated earlier. Accordingly the idea of "Total Knowledge Management" deals with managing the "Total Knowledge" comprising the explicit and tacit knowledge. In the knowledge economy the competitive advantage of enterprises depends upon its Total Knowledge Management Systems and Linking it up with strategic architecture. We provide some conceptual frameworks to understand the processes involved in knowledge creation and development. Application of these ideas at the enterprise level to enhance enterprise competitiveness is then explored. Implications for the academia in its role in knowledge creation and development is also discussed.

There was no difference in energy intake between E and H deer in any of the groups, but H deer grew faster than E deer for each of the three sex classes (p<0.05). The energy intake during early lactation was double the requirement for the second and third trimester of pregnancy. By 16 weeks of age fallow deer fawns had an energy intake equivalent to that of a non-pregnant adult fallow doe. It was concluded that the crossbreeding system described is production efficient. Furthermore, these data confirm the importance of strategic feeding of fallow does in late pregnancy and lactation.

The latest FEEDMAN (Version 3) software package has been developed to provide a deer module, in addition to an existing beef management DSS template, applicable for use in pastoral-based animal production systems in southern Queensland. FEEDMAN incorporates results from research on grazing systems for both beef cattle and more recently deer, and has been released commercially to aid in decision making and strategic planning for farmers and agricultural consultants. The package considers input data and parameters for a specific farm and essentially evaluates feeding management strategies for both beef cattle and deer in sub-tropical Queensland. Since it is a repository of past research it is an aid to information transfer and to the adoption of sustainable pastoral animal production based on deer and or cattle. While existing and potential deer farmers will benefit from use of this package, an ultimate goal is to encourage more commercial size deer enterprises seen as essential for a sustainable and viable deer farm industry in Queensland.

J	Nam, M				Nam, M			Dealing with North Korea's nuclear and missile proliferation	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article								The Pyongyang regime may view that the tense situation relating to its nuclear weapons and missile issues is a desperate struggle for life that will determine North Korea's destiny. Nuclear weapons and missiles nle the very last resort to realize its multiple goals. Current national policy tends to disregard the possibility that Pyongyang will use these weapons to unify the two Koreas. This paper examines whether a comprehensive package deal with the North and the Agreed Framework are appropriate measures to deal with these issues. We see that neither seems to be a viable option dire to Pyongyang's brinkmanship tactics. The paper recommends a new outlook on current symptoms regarding the nuclear and missile problems, and new strategic approaches to solve those problems. While there is no effective way to make the North end its nuclear and long-range missile ambitions, we should not give tip efforts to prevent the situation from going from bad to worse. Two approaches are conceivable: employing tactics used to tame a ferocious wild creature; and managing deep economic relations with the North. The first is a supplementation of current diplomatic approach, and the second a supplementation of current economic approaches, more highlighted in this paper. Given the extreme economic hardship Pyongyang faces, its military-centered policy could be turned more towards an economics focus through careful management of our economic relations with the North and by enhancing its economic dependence on the South.

Using case studies from the Holderness coastline, it (a) reviews the options with respect to erosion control on a rapidly eroding coast, and (b) acknowledges the need to introduce change gradually if it is to be accepted. Specifically, it assesses the potential to use planning permission controls to prevent new development in areas where maintaining a hard defence line will interrupt longshore transport, with potentially significant down-drift effects.

In recent years there has been increased recognition of the environmental value of the tidal Thames; however, this environmental renaissance has been matched by increased river-side development, creating intense pressures upon the tidal Thames environment. Building on the application of environmental assessment at the project level, the Environment Agency is developing new tools to evaluate the cumulative environmental impact of works to individual frontages. Using current case studies, this paper describes practical examples of these approaches which aim to provide sustainable and economically justifiable flood defences and contribute to the enhancement of the tidal Thames.

Forty-eight Senepol purebred and crossbred bull calves were assigned to the following treatments: T1: stocking rate (SR) 3.45 animals per hectare and 449.1 kg/ha of fertilizer; T2: T1 plus winter supplementation; T3: SR 1.85 animals per hectare and 224.5 kg/ha of fertilizer; and T4: T3 plus winter supplementation. The bulls were supplemented with a mix of poultry litter, molasses and corn grain at the onset of seasonal restrictions on pasture growth. During the grazing phase the effect of pasture management on average daily gains (ADG) and closing weights was not significant (P > 0.05). However, moderate pasture management systems (T1 and T2) produced 218 kg more weight gain per hectare (P < 0.05), Winter supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ADG; total weight gains per bull; and weight gains per hectare (+0.32 kg/animal/day; +37.1 kg/animal; +104.4 kg/ha of weight gain). Bulls in T2 and T4 consumed daily 2.33 and 1.44 kg of supplement dry matter (DM) per animal and had estimated feed conversions of 6.65 and 5.90 kg of DM per kilogram of added gain (P > 0.05), respectively. Herbage mass decreased continuously and was significantly lower (P < 0.05) at the end of the trial. The mean production cost of the total weight gain for the entire study was $0.08/kg lower in T2 than in T1. Within supplemented treatments, animals grazing at a SR of 3.45 animals per hectare (T2) had the lowest cost per kilogram of gain.

J	Khong, PW; Lim, KS				Khong, PW; Lim, KS			Management of technology: Employing artificial intelligence in strategic planning and design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						management of technology; strategic planning; design; artificial intelligence; supply-demand network		Managing the early phase of project development in a proactive manner calls for an articulated and coherent set of organizational mechanisms, managerial principles, methods and technology. Design for supply-demand distribution (transportation) network refers to the planning of distribution systems' geometrical layouts. This constitutes the early conceptual phase of the project life cycle. As the early conceptual phase is of strategic importance, the planning of geometrical configuration (layout) inevitably becomes an important factor in a project environment. Research in artificial intelligence has had significant impact on the formulation and solution to computational methods in engineering design. This paper proposes generalized representation of a supply-demand distribution system by an artificial neural network model. A case study of planning and design for such distribution system is used to illustrate the conceptual framework of this approach.

Vision and dynamism are determinative in order to achieve this. The combination of innovation and conservatism is striking. The core values and the core objective form the immutable, guiding values, principles, and preconditions. This paper describes the Baan Company as a visionary company, and discusses in particular the timeless aspects. Baan's immutable values, principles, and preconditions relate to the work ethic, stewardship, Pioneering, the industrial approach, entering into strategic cooperative relationships, client-orientation, an open, informal organization and serving leadership.

J	Troll, DA; Myers, MD				Troll, DA; Myers, MD			Providing technology support: the never-ending story of today's library	LIBRARY COMPUTING			English	Article						academic libraries; technology; staffing; customer satisfaction; management		The purpose of this article is threefold. First, to introduce into journal literature a multi-year statistical analysis of the daily work required to keep the technologies found in today's academic libraries operational, and to situate this daily maintenance effort in the context of the additional responsibilities of technical staff. Second, given the volume and variety of daily maintenance work and the additional special projects and routine duties of technical staff, to present a parallel assessment of customer satisfaction with the daily maintenance effort. Data about the work and about customer satisfaction with the work are both crucial to understanding the scope of duties and staffing required to provide the hi-tech library services, collections and equipment that will meet or exceed user needs and expectations. Third, to provide examples of how these data are used to support strategic decisions and plans that will move libraries toward their goals.

Such an organization is characterized by four mutually related conditions: the presence of shared values; the competencies to transform these shared values into results; selfmanagement systems to guide this process; and appraisal and reward systems to support it. To realize these four conditions is considered a number one management responsibility. The proposed research programme looks for empirical evidence in support of the above hypothesis. It also tackles the question of how to realize the conditions mentioned, if they are lacking. Two context factors are taken into account: educational programmes of universities, because of their impact on the influx of employee competencies into organizations; and national and supranational bodies, because of their role in the conditioning of people's (shared) values.

J	Langlois, CC; Langlois, JPP				Langlois, CC; Langlois, JPP			Behavioral issues of rationality in international interaction - An international appraisal	JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION			English	Article								The behavioral pointers of rationality discussed by Langlois and Langlois are used to scan the World Events Interaction Survey data on U.S.-China and U.S.-Soviet relations for evidence of rational behavior in the interaction between states. The null hypothesis that the interaction between states is not compatible with subgame perfect equilibrium play in all cases examined is rejected: states react to each other's past moves; if deviations hom equilibrium play are significant in explaining player moves, they determine positive inducement effects; and implied payoff structures reveal a need for strategic management of the relationship. With payoff structures estimated to be prisoner's dilemmas for all players, both bilateral relations begin with the widest tolerance of the other's behavioral choice and the adoption of countervailing strategies. Over time, these nations' strategic interaction evolves toward a sharpening of the bounds they envision for their relationships.

In this review, the impact of outcomes studies on entry into clinical practice, access of patients to care, care delivery itself and the management of clinical practice, are reviewed. The contribution of the American Academy of Neurology and the role of its 1997 Strategic Plan to determine the future of the profession of neurology through outcomes studies, is included. Patients and the profession have much to gain and much at risk as the US healthcare system evolves. Opportunities for future outcomes Studies to impact these changes are explored.

J	Yan, XT				Yan, XT			TMD rocking regional stability	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article								The convertabililty of theater missile defense (TMD) systems technology makes TMD more offensive than defensive. The LTS is most active in TMD projects due to its available resources for TMD and its crisis management strategy questing for TMD. By joining US TMD projects, Japan is attempting to develop a pre-emptive strike capability against North Korea and Taiwan is trying to consolidate its defense relations with the US. South Korea could also get a ride on LIS TMD, but the short distance between Seoul and Demilitarized Zone makes TMD inefficient. China, Russia and North Korea have no TMD resources at present. The strategies of China and Russia are based on retailiation which costs less than TMD. TMD exacerbates strategic suspicions between China and the US-Japan Alliance and makes security cooperation difficult. Taiwan's participation in US TMD projects would aggravate tensions in the Taiwan Strait because the deployment of TMD could strengthen the political confidence for public independence. TMD creates obstacles to regional non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and gives missile exporters a good excuse for transferring missile technology. Excluding Taiwan from the TMD plan would greatly reduce the TMD negative impact on regional security. The TMD program will bring about an arms race in the long run.

We have established a fairly general purpose programming environment for inductive rule discovery. It can be used, for example, as a high-level decision support system for social and cultural anthropologists. The program hypothesizes and then asserts rules that govern (permit or prohibit) social interactions and relations in human societies. We also describe the domain-independent facilities of the decision support system offered to the user and how the program works. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This exploratory research is intended to throw some light on the different strategic factors governing the adoption and use of new technologies likely to help reduce professional risk and industrial injury. Its operational objectives are: 1) to clarify the various perceived strategic benefits of new technology that differentiate significantly between effective and less effective organizations; 2) to identify significant differences in technological competencies and resources, especially the differences ill new technological equipment based an HSW performance levels; 3) to identify significant differences in the decision- making pi processes leading to the adoption of new technologies; and 4) to analyze significant differences in organizational capacity (other than technological capacity) Between effective and less effective organizations in HSW tterms The paper therefore describes the choices mid conditions in tr which the introduction of new technology can help prevent industrial injury. The data were drawn from a sample of 140 companies in the metal products manufacturing sector.

J	Bertodo, R				Bertodo, R			Competitiveness and the new product process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN			English	Article						change; competition; continuous improvement; customer; design; hierarchy; industry; innovation; management; organization; processes; product engineering; suppliers; teamwork; time; value-added		Industrial businesses world-wide are caught in an economic transition to globalized activities, characterized by a competitive scenario of 'speed' and 'change', in an environment of data and information exchange in real time to the furthest reaches of the planet. 'Globalization' is favouring the emergence of political, economic and trade zones of continental dimensions with important consequential effects giving competitive advantage a brittle, effervescent and rapidly obsoleting edge. Knowledge acquisition and deployment, inventiveness and adaptability have become keywords of success. This paper considers the meaning of 'competitive innovation' within the developing situation described, and its cultural, managerial and methodological impacts on the crucial new product process, as observed within a range of mechanical, electro-mechanical and electronic enterprises, with particular reference to the personal transportation sector. Empirical trends are shown linking commercial and technological strategies with product programmes and structures, and with management and organizational developments. Qualitative and quantitative measures of competitiveness are presented and discussed. Due consideration is given to change management and implementation issues. It is concluded that globalization is creating economic and competitive benefits through the reward of entrepreneurship, the punishment of inefficiencies and the close linking of competitiveness to 'productivity', including engineering productivity. This is deepening inequalities between enterprises at different levels: to be uncompetitive is to be marginalized. Local culture has an important influence on the possible responses to the need for evolution and change. The most effective mode of resource deployment will differ for different strategic objectives and commercial aims. Hence, no generally applicable product process enhancement programme can be devised, even for a single company operating in different cultures. It can generally be stated that 'innovation' must be broadened beyond its accepted technological sense to encompass produce architecture and structure, component quality and supply, realization methodologies and deployment of resources. The nett effect has been the emergence of distinctive competences in fast realization and fast delivery: timescales have reduced by orders of magnitude in every aspect of product realization and presentation. The inherent change in values can trigger managerial resistances and transitional failure risks.

The UK Government's mandatory Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) was examined to determine its value to software projects. The evidence was collected from interviews with 17 project managers, discussions with participants on 3 large SSADM projects and from observing 90 end users in training. The conclusions are that prescriptive information systems methodologies are unlikely to cope well with strategic uncertainty, user communication or staff development. The recommendations are to focus more on soft organisational issues and to use approaches tailored to each project.

Indeed the speed and nature of responses may well be a determinant of success. Why is it then that companies continue with strategies that are clearly not working and the available evidence for change is ignored? It is only by understanding the prevailing culture and its effect an strategic thinking that the response of firms to the environment can be understood. In particular the influence of culture as a paradigm or dominant logic on strategy is investigated by analysing a company that, despite available evidence, continued its strategy until taken over. The conclusion is that information needs to become knowledge to effect change and that knowledge is information that has became culturally accepted in the organization.

Traditional approaches, such as simulation languages and spreadsheets, do not offer effective solutions with quick 'what if' calculations for large scale profit planning systems. Based on complex management relationships, Business Structure-Based Systems can be harnessed using structured matrices to link activities to cost drivers in the value chain. With the interactive package, business scenarios are projected on super sets of tables allowing models to become visible. Structured Matrix Technology can offer a solution, readily transcribing the cost-process relation into a modelling system. The affinity of productivity and concurrent management information systems is expounded. Business Structure-Based Systems make new process designs effective and provide powerful and relevant decision-making tools in strategic productivity management.

J	Torkzadeh, R; Gemoets, LA				Torkzadeh, R; Gemoets, LA			Utilization and impacts of information technology application on end-users in US and Mexico	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							SYSTEM USAGE; DETERMINANTS; SCIENCE; SUCCESS; MODEL	In the emerging post-industrial setting, information technology is used in ways that have substantial implications for the nature of work, productivity and economic growth. Increasingly, work has become heavily dependent on information processing, abstract, cognitive, and a fusion of doing and learning. Information technology empowers workers with the tools to plan as well as execute their own work; thus, the potential to diffuse management functions throughout the work force. This diffusion can have strategic implications by creating a more flexible and responsive organization with a flatter structure and lower overhead costs. With the growth of end-user computing environment and flexible technology, the ultimate question for use of technology by individuals and organizations may be more related to (1) how the technology is used rather than how much it is used or what technology is chosen and (2) how the technology is impacting rather than how technology is designed or regarded. This study uses perceived measures to evaluate information systems usage and impact at the level of the individual end-user. These measures have been tested for reliability and validity. A sample of 332 responses from the U.S. (180) and Mexico (152) was used to study information technology application in the two countries; to study why computers are used by individuals and how computers impact individuals in their work. While remarkable similarities exist in results for the two countries, there are differences in the level of use for some applications. Standards for information technology usage and impact are presented.	Univ Texas, El Paso, TX 79968 USA		Torkzadeh, R (corresponding author), Univ Texas, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Therapeutic pathways for antimicrobial use: Pediatric issues	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE			English	Article								This presentation details Dr. McCarty's experience with the development and implementation of antimicrobial clinical pathways at Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno, California, where he is the Medical Director of Infectious Diseases. The hospital has several hundred beds, serves 700,000 children in central California, and has recently developed a physician's association including 250 physicians. The first capitated contract was received in 1997 covering 12,000 patients, and it is expected that capitated contracts covering up to 200,000 patients will be secured by the end of 1999. The first therapeutic pathway was developed as part of the new managed care organization's utilization management strategic plan, and substantial cost savings were realized while outcomes were maintained. Physician cooperation with the therapeutic pathway concept has increased, and plans are underway to develop therapeutic pathways that will be equally as effective for other disease states commonly encountered in this specialized patient population.

J	Gupta, CS				Gupta, CS			International Conference on Business Information Technology Management - BIT WORLD 1998	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article								Management of Information Technology (IT) by the business has evolved into a complex process comprising diverse incentives, multiplicities of dynamic capabilities and multiple dimensions. Issues on the management of IT within the business include policy dimensions on the national information infrastructure,IT education, social productivity, and information regarding social impact, and resource mobilization. IT within die business cannot remain departmentalized Information System (IS). Contemporary IT management has to be an integral partner of the strategic issues regarding the Business Process Reengineering (BPR), the Enterprise Wide Resource Planning (ERP), and above all the process of learning in an organization. The IT strategy and the business strategy cannot remain separate and distinct. These were the major observations made at the International Conference on Business Information Technology Management (BIT WORLD 1998), held at Taj Mahal Hotel in New Delhi, during 25-27 February 1998.

The flood defence and environmental value of the Ouse Washes depends upon the maintenance of an open grassland which is regularly flooded in winter, but dry enough in summer. ii strategic study of the system was completed in 1995, which recommended that (a) summer flooding should be better controlled and (b) the structures contained within the Washes were improved. This paper considers some of the economic and environmental problems which were encountered during the development of the strategy and examines operational aspects of the design.									*ENV AG, 1995, OUS WASH FLOOD CONTR; *LEW FRYER PARTN, 1996, WELM LAK SIUIC REC; 1995, BINNIE BLACK VEATCH	3	0	0	0	1	CHARTERED INST WATER ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT	LONDON	15 JOHN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND WC1N 2EB	0951-7359			J CHART INST WATER E	J.

Assoc Asian Studies				Thailand's rapidly changing environment required effective strategic management and visionary leadership. This paper explains how, the Office of the Board of Investment (OBOI) applied the concept of strategic management to cope with external threats and enhance its organizational capacities. The OBOI has shifted from a rule-based authority structure which granted tax incentives and privileges to a new form of governance involving provision of information and related services necessary for investment promotion. Organizational restructuring, work process redesign, strong leadership, empowerment, performance measurement, and human resource development were key factors accounting for this case of successful bureaucratic reform. A lesson drawn is that public organizations can and should be transformed to become more flexible, innovative, and results oriented.

The group recommended that an organised mammographic screening programme be part of a strategic approach to breast cancer detection and management with the aim of reducing mortality from breast cancer. Service specifications should be based on those of the pilot programmes in Otago-Southland and Waikato, but modified according to the lessons learned, with special attention to such areas as recruitment and information systems. Women between the ages of 50-69 should be invited for screening every two years, and screening should be free of charge. Because of the uncertain value of general population screening by mammography in women under the age of 50, the programme should not be extended to younger women, including those at high risk, at the present time. Further reviews of the issue should be commissioned when new evidence becomes available. Pilot programmes in New Zealand have demonstrated that screening can be performed with acceptable standards in comparison with overseas trials but considerable planning and commitment will be required for the expected benefits to be experienced nationally. Implementation of a successful national programme will involve attention to key areas such as programme management, recruitment and quality standards to deliver a high quality service to a substantial proportion of the eligible population.

J	Detmer, DE				Detmer, DE			Health and the national information infrastructure	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								Only information technology offers society the opportunity to reinvent health care into a more value-driven, knowledge-based, cost-effective industry. The author urges the health informatics community to assume greater leadership for defining and securing a robust health information infrastructure (HII). A blueprint for the future tied to a coalition of advocates pushing for change would enable the step-interval improvements in health care needed by the nation. Our nation and its people are fortunate. We are blessed with a system of government that offers ordinary citizens the opportunity to shape the future, leadership that seeks to anticipate and create a better society, and at present a robust economy. Moreover, like many other countries, we are benefiting from astounding advances in medical knowledge and technologies. Finally, the increasing power and affordability of information technology is transforming the work of many industries and incrementally changing the lives of many citizens. At the same time this is true, there is much about which to be concerned with respect to health care. Tens of millions lack financial access to care; quality is very uneven and not receiving serious attention from health professionals; and costs are once again rising. Our people are unhappy with their care; providers are unhappy with the system; payers will soon become more unhappy about costs; and government reacts by enacting regulations that will fail to create substantial change. There will never be sufficient funds to do all we would like to do. Better knowledge and treatments will come from biomedical research, but the progress will be gradual and likely offset by increased demand by an aging society. While improved health care system management will result from health services research, only the information technology revolution and better policy offer promise of dramatic help. Yet there is little evidence of movement to harness this opportunity. One of the great challenges for our generation is to assure that the astonishing capabilities of information technology benefit human health to the fullest extent possible in the future. This paper seeks to stir debate, discussion, and action. It identifies and discusses some of the likely, elements of our nation's emerging information infrastructure that can revolutionize health care to the betterment of our society. Further, it advises on ways to move this strategic agenda forward. This paper relates to the formal position of the American Medical Informatics Association on a national health information infrastructure and other policy documents on advancing health information technology in the hope that continued discussion will stimulate further refinement and action.(1, 2,3,4)	Hlth Sci Ctr, Charlottesville, VA USA		Detmer, DE (corresponding author), Hlth Sci Ctr, Charlottesville, VA USA.

The community has further determined that these needs might be most efficiently met by a profitable business that garners revenues to the community and income to the employees, furthers the community members' skills, and provides employment. The community presently has several entities that perform construction work on the reservation. Because of these successful operations, the SRPMIC believes that it can enter the market of supplying construction services to clients off the reservation. Determining the opportunities and threats in the marketplace, this study analyzes the potential for success of the community performing construction work off the reservation and outlines a strategic plan that describes the steps for implementing a business enterprise.

The programme is part of an overall industry Strategic Plan to establish the technical and institutional enabling conditions to open the option for new nuclear power electric generating capacity in the US. Standardized designs have been developed which integrate the nuclear steam supply and balance of plant systems and are well advanced in the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval and certification processes. These designs cover both pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs) of the large (1300 MWe) evolutionary type as well as the intermediate size (600 MWe) with passive emergency cooling features. The design safety objectives exceed the safety goals established by the NRC by a factor of IO. Major improvements in reliability and economy have been incorporated from the extensive worldwide operating experience of current LWRs. Final design approvals have been obtained from the NRC for the evolutionary BWR (GE's ABWR) and PWR (ABB-CE's System 80 Plus). Testing of the passive cooling features of the 600 MWe PWR (AP-600) has confirmed the adequacy of their safety functions and NRC design approval is expected in 1998. On the down side, only limited progress has been made in meeting the institutional conditions necessary to open the nuclear option in the US. An effective radioactive waste management regime, a predictable and stable regulatory process, and adequate political and public acceptance remain beyond the horizon. The ALWR Programme is an outstanding model of US industry-government and international utility collaboration. US industry and government shared financial support has been an essential element of success. The Programme has been greatly enhanced by the technical participation and financial support of the international nuclear utilities in Europe and Asia. An important by-product is the emerging international consensus on the safety characteristics of future plants. The designs and concepts of advanced LWR technology are being brought into reality by European and Asian utilities. Advanced LWR nuclear plants have been built and placed in operation: the Sizewell B PWR by Nuclear Electric Ltd in the UK and the evolutionary ABWR plant, fostered by the ALWR Programme, by Tokyo Electric Power in Japan. The N-4 PWR is being built by EdF in France and the System 80 Plus by the Korea Electric Power Company in Korea. The ABWR has been selected by the Taiwan Power Company for its next twin-unit nuclear plant. If this trend continues, the US energy industry may find itself purchasing nuclear power plants and the requisite technology from European and Asian firms when the need for new nuclear power capacity in the US becomes evident.

J	Neumann, S; Zviran, M				Neumann, S; Zviran, M			Tel Aviv City Hall - The computerization revolution	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						information systems; IS management in local government; IS master-plan		This case study reports on the computerization revolution that took effect in 1989 on the Information System Division at the municipality of Tel Aviv. The restructuring of the division began with hiring a new CIO and the preparation of an information systems master-plan and encompassed major changes in hardware, software, infrastructure, personnel, organizational structure and IS-user relationships. The case focuses on the situation before 1989, when IS was perceived as a support function, and the turnaround between 1989 and 1991 that elevated IS to a strategic role. The success of the revolution is attributed to the strong support of the city's general manager (CEO) and mayor and the close relationships between the CEO and the CIO. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using a trigger strategy devised by FRIEDMAN [1985], we identify two necessary noncooperative equilibria, and show that when bath the prospective deviant and punisher are free to choose between price and output as their strategic variables the dominant noncooperative equilibrium is Cournot while the dominated noncooperative equilibrium is asymmetric in the two variables. We show that, under certain conditions on product substitutability, there exist plausible discount factors which will sustain collusion for almost the entire life of the cartel.

First, theoretical and empirical literature in GT/CM are explored to identify the planning, design and implementation practices which are expected to play major roles in successful development of cellular manufacturing systems. Then we attempt to measure if and to what extent these practices affect the success of such projects via a detailed survey of 69 companies that have implemented GT/CM systems. It is observed that a properly managed/GT/CM project can provide, not only operational efficiency but also, strategic advantages to a firm. Several management issues that stand out in our study are: (1) training of employees across functional boundaries at all levels of organizational hierarchy, (2) revised incentive/reward schemes, (3) autonomy of cell teams, (4) gradual phasing-in of cells, (5) employee involvement during the development life cycle, and (6) setting specific targets during the project planning stage.

The organizational structure of the company and the environment in which the case had taken place were presented along with the strategies for implementation. The technology transfer and commercialization process is discussed within the framework of a systems analysis approach using a technology commercialization model and the concept of imbedded technology. However, the outcome of the project has not been according to expectations. The reasons found after analysis are inadequate communication and somewhat differing objectives of the different players involved. The need for a strategic view and the scope for exploring the use of information technology tools to minimise the communication barriers is outlined to gain better benefits from such efforts.

J	Daniels, RL; Kouvelis, P; Morgan, LO				Daniels, RL; Kouvelis, P; Morgan, LO			Using profit maximizing scheduling models to structure operational trade-offs and manufacturing strategy issues	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION			English	Article							SINGLE-MACHINE; SETUP TIMES; JOB CLASSES	Manufacturing plays an increasingly important role in determining the competitiveness of the firm. However, corporate strategy is often formulated with little regard for how these decisions affect operations within the manufacturing system. Detailed models provide a necessary link between manufacturing performance and the Functional policies followed by the firm, so that the strengths of the manufacturing system can be consistently reflected in strategic decisions. This paper presents a scheduling model that relates the strategic decisions that determine the type of work that must ultimately be processed by the manufacturing system with the detailed decisions that determine how this work should be scheduled. The model accounts for varying processing time, delay penalty, and revenue characteristics among the jobs available for processing by a single facility, with jobs partitioned in multiple classes such that a setup is incurred each time two jobs of different classes are processed in succession. Given limited processing capacity, the objective is to simultaneously determine the subset of jobs to accept for processing and the associated order in which accepted jobs should be sequenced to maximize the total profit realized by the facility. problem formulations and dynamic programming algorithms are presented for both the special case in which all available work is from a single job class, and the more general case involving multiple job classes. The insight derived from these models concerning the operational implications of strategic decisions is illustrated through a series of example problems, first focusing on the coordination of marketing and manufacturing policy, and finally by considering important issues related to manufacturing focus.

J	Momoi, M				Momoi, M			The improvement of US North Korean relations: A journalist's view of the Japanese perspective	KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS			English	Article								Washington-Pyongyong relations are swiftly moving toward the normalization through various diplomatic accords and improvement steps. Repeated bilateral talks have already produced MIA and other formal agreements. Given the dynamics of the two negotiators, the ongoing talks will lead to a fait accompli of full-scale normalization much sooner than observers have so far speculated. Why is the US in such a hurry? Speculations about US motives range from the political need for the forthcoming presidential election in November to a strategic necessity to secure US military footholds on the peninsula, Okinawa and their peripheral areas and to preempt the outbreak of armed conflict in the region. Other observers stress the fact that China is no less eager than the US to improve ties with its strategically vital buffer, North Korea. Whatever the motives and intentions, the US is determined to improve its relations with Pyongyang; but a crucial doubt exists among its allies and friends in the Asia-Pacific area whether Washington might be too eager to achieve just ''any'' improvement. Prior consultation as well as the speed and the substance of an agreement are closely related to the perception of respective national interest of the other nations concerned. They, Seoul and Tokyo, are ready and willing to cooperate in the improvement process, by planning to resume rice deliveries to Pyongyang and by collaborating in arms control and crisis management measures. In case of an unpredicted outbreak of armed crisis, even Japan, often labeled as a permanent bystander, can be expected to act promptly in providing the UN and US forces with wartime host nation support. On the other hand, few military experts believe Pyongyang has realistic capabilities of launching full-scale, sustainable sophisticated armed attacks on its neighbors. One exception is its missile capability; though limited in operational performance, the missiles are at least useful for bluffing or psychological warfare purposes. One countermeasure available to potential target nations will be a regional cooperation with the US program of R&D and production of tactical ballistic missile defense, a system primarily to uphold a minimum deterrence and designed to preempt either the demonstrative or the destructive launchings of tactical missiles. Such a deterrence posture coupled with arms control and crisis management measures collectively adopted might help to create a strategic environment in which all nations concerned can work for ''a peace that must nor end.''

Recent growth rates of electronic journals and electronic Publications in science suggest that the traditional paper and print journal may be obsolete within 15 years. These changes are occurring as a result of the social and intellectual choices being made by scientists. A push for more timely, accessible and affordable sources of scientific information is creating a vacuum that is being filled by the new information technologies of the Internet. The consequences and implications of this new paradigm of publication for the organization, collaboration and participation of scientists is discussed.

J	Reponen, T; Parnisto, J; Viitanen, J				Reponen, T; Parnisto, J; Viitanen, J			Personality's impact on information management strategy formulation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							MAPS	This study aimed to examine the impact of a decision maker's personality on the ways the decision maker formulates information resource strategies. The basic hypothesis is that different personalities make different decisions in the same environment. An empirical test was made with a group of 20 managers participating in an Executive Education Programme. Using the results of the Myers and Briggs Type Indicator test the managers were divided into two groups of intuitive-extrovert and sensing-introvert types. Both groups were given the same assignment - creating an information resource strategy for a case company - and conclusions were drawn from their behaviour during the process and the results of their work. This test shows that the personality has a strong influence on both the working methods and results of the planning process. The main conclusion is that the decision maker's personality should be taken into consideration in the strategic planning processes.

Tougher competitive situations have led to increasing attention being paid to customer satisfaction, of which timely and customized services are the key concepts. The decisions on how firms should trade off these expectations against high utilization of capital equipment and limited inventories are important to manage congestion effectively. A conceptual framework is presented in this paper for solving the problems of congestion in manufacturing. This framework takes into account the (i) role of cost accounting, (ii) presence of network externalities, (iii) evaluation of customer queueing costs, (iv) impact of entry regulation on congestion levels, and (v) pricing, competitive issues, and strategic implications in solving the problems of congestion. In addition, the role of new production concepts and technologies in the management of congestion is discussed in this paper.

So the availability of a totally flexible and productive tool for network topology optimization becomes more important than before. This paper presents requirement analysis for development of a network topology design tool and introduces TND-Tool as a tool fulfilling the proposed requirements. First, philosophy behind the tool and its requirement model which uses Hatley and Pirbhai method are explained. Second, organization of the tool, i.e. needed modules and their structure are described such as representation, data base, optimization, cost-calculation and graphical user interface. Third, operational capabilities of the tool are presented. Fourth, heuristics for topological design of the fixed part of cellular mobile communication networks GSM900, the European mobile standard, and DCS1800 are shown. Fifth, performance analysis and new and special features of the tool will be presented.			Shahbaz, M (corresponding author), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN,KOPERNIKUSSTR 16,D-52074 AACHEN,GERMANY.

J	Bovey, EC				Bovey, EC			Strategies for railway noise	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Railways and Tracked Transit System Noise (5 IWRN)	JUN 21-24, 1995	VOSS, NORWAY	Norwegian State Railways, KILDE Akustikk A S				Strategies are much talked about, but frequently lack any substance. The general concepts of strategic planning are discussed and the need for it to have a focus, i.e., a clear objective, are emphasized. A structured approach to strategic plan development is advocated, with a definition of the relevant issues being a prerequisite for success. Strategies, however, must be flexible and constantly reviewed even though the measures of success are often blurred. Railway noise is clearly amenable to strategic planning, but the issues will vary depending on the objectives of the organization. It is evident that railway noise technology, application and development, while important, needs to be substantially supplemented by other factors such as logistics and management issues to form an effective strategy in this domain.

J	Gee, JMA				Gee, JMA			Choice of product type by strategically interdependent firms	SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article							COMPETITION; EQUILIBRIUM	The paper analyses the degree of product differentiation between single product firms in alternative market equilibria. The equilibria are stable in the sense of Nash, and both non-cooperative and tacitly collusive marker outcomes are identified. The basic model follows the 'address' approach to product differentiation, and the firms' strategic variables are choice of product type and price charged. When all firms are non-cooperative, product gaps between firms are equal; bur tacit collusion results in product gap variation between firms in Nash equilibrium. In all cases, profits for any firm are assumed to he proportional to the multiple of the product gaps between that firm and each of its two closest rivals.

J	Gerchak, Y; Safayeni, F				Gerchak, Y; Safayeni, F			Perfect information with potentially negative value: An intriguing war story and a possible explanation	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						decision under uncertainty; resources allocation; value of information		When the Allies were bombing Germany in World War II, it is rumoured that before certain raids they would let the Germans know, without realizing the information was leaked on purpose, that one of the potential targets would nor be attacked. While this information was correct and taken as such, the Germans have allegedly made additional erroneous inferences from it, rendering their overall defensive alignment less effective than before the information was leaked. This note attempts to 'explain' this scenario via a resource allocation model which minimizes expected damage. The key issue is whether the subjective probability of a particular site is significantly lower after receiving the information than the corresponding pre-information probability. This issue seems of interest in its own right, and could also be relevant in modern strategic business settings. Some related behavioural issues are discussed.

The SWS Program integrates IETMs with SWS data providing automated operational and maintenance procedures and reference documentation at the SWS operator consoles. Integrated ship's logistics, administration, and onboard training can also be supported. An operational environment is provided that supports multiple ''views'' of a MIL-D-87269 compliant database, including a legacy view of the database used to minimize the operator impacts of the transition from paper to electronic documentation. An IETM database development process is described that includes: Establishing the Baseline, the one-time low cost legacy technical manual conversion; Exploiting the Media, the incorporation of Class 4 IETM capabilities; and Maintaining the Baseline, an integrated IETM maintenance environment used for recurring maintenance of the IETM database. Authoring capabilities of the IETM Maintenance System are discussed as are other capabilities supporting workflow management, configuration control, electronic review and approval, and IETM database verification and validation. Finally, programmatic experience is described including Navy/contractor coordination, adoption of standards, and suitability of the standards to the SWS application.

IOS involve two or more partners with various objectives who collaborate on the design, development and support of an information system which crosses organizational boundaries (34). These systems are gaining in usage as businesses become aware of their application to enhance organizational interactions relevant to economic efficiencies and strategic management (3). IOS must be developed and managed to reflect the values, beliefs, and operating procedures of each participating enterprise. Since IOS generally rely on tested technologies, human resource management (HRM) issues are critical to the stability and the success of the interorgdnizational system.

J	Kleen, BA; Shell, LW				Kleen, BA; Shell, LW			Multimedia resources: Their presence, use, and management in AACSB colleges of business	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								This study explores how multimedia technologies are being used and managed in AACSB schools. Recent changes have shifted multimedia from experimental device to mainstream, yet the literature has paid little attention to the management of multimedia assets. The researchers ask what standards for multimedia exist on campus, at what level of authority, and how centralized. Finally, the researchers investigate how the vision for multimedia balances strategic and operational uses. The researchers answered these questions through a mail survey. Findings show that a large majority of AACSB schools have multimedia capabilities, largely decentralized, often with no formal standards for their use. Faculty use a variety of authoring tools and multimedia software, but are not yet widely developing their own materials. The most commonly cited visions included (1) multimedia will enable faculty to be more productive and will become a routine part of teaching, and (2) multimedia will revolutionize the process of education.

This work describes the practices of three leading edge Australian firms in developing a strategic technological capability. The technical management practices of these companies are based on some common principles, which provide both opportunities for learning by others in addition to a practice-driven set of elements deserving further field research, A common element in each of the organizations studied is the desire to integrate three key technical management subsystems: strategic, capabilities and organizational, This managerial perspective is illustrated through a number of practices and characteristics observed within these firms, Specific areas discussed include strategic planning processes, the development of a process management capability, the development of team based work structures, organizational development and restructuring and outsourcing, Key findings include: the value of balanced sets of performance measures, leveraging a safety management program to develop a process management capability, difficulties in aligning the values of technical personnel with the principles of a quality culture and the need to develop approaches to preserve technical capabilities when structural changes are undertaken.

Here the research is aimed at reinforcing the belief that AMT is essential to ensure that companies remain competitive in the international market. The explicit factors in the literature that impinge on investment policies are the distinctions and differences between the theoretical assumptions underpinning organisational behaviour, and current practice in formulating strategic plans, investment and decision making. This paper shows that when the problems of appraisal are overcome, the implementation policies pursued can be different from those indicated by traditional analysis.

Consequently, firms have become dependent on political and economic decisions that have been taken elsewhere in the world. Technology and investment have become interdependent. Consequently, governments can no longer face challenges of the new economy without thinking and acting globally and actively encourage alliances. They must find new ways of helping firms to attract new investment and technologies into firms and regions as well as suggesting means of accessing niche markets abroad. This paper considers one such new approach taken by Canada through the Investment Prospecting Programme.

J	Wilson, G				Wilson, G			From day-to-day coping to strategic management: Developing technological capability among small-scale enterprises in Zimbabwe	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technological capability; management of technological function; Third World; small-scale enterprise; co-operative enterprise; NGOs; intervention		The ability to move from coping with the day-to-day technological function to managing its strategic function is crucial for the technological capability of an enterprise. Interventions aimed at small-scale enterprise development in Third World countries can assist in this move, but it is important that they neither reduce technology aid to provision of hardware nor provide training for enterprise workers in isolation from their hardware. A systemic approach is required that builds on the existing capabilities in enterprises and which also recognises the impact of the environments in which enterprises operate on their ability to make strategic technological choices.

J	TREMBLAY, D				TREMBLAY, D			INFLUENCE OF AGISM ON DECISION-MAKING - THE PERCEPTION OF UPPER MANAGEMENT	CANADIAN JOURNAL ON AGING-REVUE CANADIENNE DU VIEILLISSEMENT			French	Article						AGISM; STEREOTYPE; PERCEPTION; AGE; EXPERIENCE; DECISION	STRATEGIC DECISIONS; JOB-PERFORMANCE; TOP EXECUTIVES; EXPERIENCE; STYLE; AGE	The aim of this research was to study the relationship between aging and decision-making. Specifically, it deals with managers' views on the hypothetical effects of age and experience on decision behaviour. Do the numerous beliefs and stereotypes related to the supposed effects of aging (i.e, agism) affect the decision-making process and its results? Are younger managers more creative, quicker or more audacious than older managers? Are the experienced managers more skilled, cautious or pragmatic than the less experienced ones? Given the fact that mean age of managers in many contemporary public organizations is rising, further information is needed on how this trend will affect the behaviour and state of mind of public managers who make daily decisions bearing important economic and social consequences. To investigate these questions, interviews were conducted with managers employed by Quebec's public set-vice. These interviews were aimed at collecting data about the way managers themselves perceive the effects of aging on decision behaviour. Results indicated that managers do not readily link age and decision behaviour. However, the relationship between experience and decision behaviour is perceived as comparatively strong. The relevancy of further research on the effects of experience on decision behaviour and, more generally, on the effects of experience on working abilities is discussed.

J	KIM, D; MORRISON, DG; TANG, CS				KIM, D; MORRISON, DG; TANG, CS			A TACTICAL MODEL FOR AIRING NEW SEASONAL PRODUCTS	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						PRODUCT PRESENTATIONS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS		This paper introduces a model that analyzes the impact of the length of time spent presenting new seasonal products. Specifically, we develop a simple stochastic model for determining the optimal airing time for each product so that the net profit is maximized. We consider cases in which there are two products to present, two channels to select for airing the products, and two methods of presentation to choose. In each case, we formulate the problem as a mathematical program and characterize the properties of the optimal airing time. These properties may provide managerial insights for determining airing time for each product, selecting channels to air the products, and choosing presentation method for products. In addition, this analysis may help the management to make strategic decisions in airing products that would lead to an increase in sales.

Frankel and Rockett argue that, if model uncertainty is not explicitly taken into account, policy coordination is as likely to decrease welfare as increase it. This paper therefore looks at the scope for reducing errors by making strategic model choices part of the overall policy selection procedure. It shows that alternative definitions of the policy bargain produces decisions which are robust against disagreements about the correct model; while alternative choices of model produce policies which are robust against model uncertainty. Hence fixed (i.e., model-free) policy rules are no substitute for making strategic model choices.

J	FISHER, WL; ARNOLD, DE				FISHER, WL; ARNOLD, DE			AFS BOOK PROGRAM SURVEY	FISHERIES			English	Article								In 1992, the American Fisheries Society (AFS) Publications Overview Committee was charged with developing a strategic plan for the AFS Book Department. As a result, we sent questionnaires to 1,146 AFS members (997 non-students and 149 students) to gather information about the books members buy and need, their opinions about the price and quality of books currently published by the Society, and existing information gaps in fisheries science and management. Responses from 603 members, including 88 students, indicated strong support for the book program and provided many helpful suggestions for its improvement. Approximately 95% of the respondents anticipated purchasing fisheries science books in the next five years. Topics of interest for future books ranged from traditional subjects such as fish biology, fish ecology, and sampling techniques and methods, to the more contemporary topics of conservation genetics, biodiversity, and ecosystem management. When asked to rate the relative importance of various publishing elements, respondents consistently ranked editorial quality over production quality of books, methods manuals, and symposium proceedings. They also wanted to keep the quality of books up and the price down. Respondents supported the promotion and distribution oi some, but not all, subunit publications. Current and anticipated use of traditional AFS journals, books, and proceedings will Likely remain constant among members; however, many respondents predicted their use of online data base services, computer software, and compact disks will increase. The committee is using the findings from this survey to develop a five-year strategic plan for the Society's Book Department.

J	BENZONI, L; FENOGLIO, P				BENZONI, L; FENOGLIO, P			TOWARDS A CONCEPT OF STRATEGIC INPUT - EVALUATION AND CHOICE OF A TECHNOLOGY IN A VERTICALLY DIFFERENTIATED MARKET	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						CHOICE OF TECHNIQUE; PRODUCT LOCATION; STRATEGIC INPUT; VERTICAL PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION	PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION; PRICE-COMPETITION	This paper attempts to define the notion of strategic input and to study the choice of techniques in a market with vertical product differentiation. For that purpose, two different theoretical frameworks are used: firstly, we are interested in models of vertical product differentiation which examine some economic conditions needed to obtain a positive market share. More specifically, the finiteness property implies the fact that a finite number of firms can co-exist in this kind of market. Consequently, we can conclude from this property that, under some conditions, firms will always try to produce the higher quality product even if this product does not generate highest profits. If these conditions are not fully met, firms would produce the product able to generate the greatest profit. However, these models are not concerned with technical and economic production feasibilities. In other words, without a technical and economic study concerning production possibilities, these models are not sufficient to decide which kind of product strategy firms must adopt. For this reason, we introduce, secondly, a technical and economic product representation which allows us (i) to complete the previous models through a study concerning the quality wishes of the demand side and the possibilities for the supply side to satisify them and, so, (ii) to present the choice of techniques in vertical product differentiation. On this basis, this paper develops the concept of strategic input which allows us to evaluate the economic weight of an input in the production process of quality. The interest of this notion rests on its ability to become a management tool for technological decisions.

The strategies used by these firms have been to use globalization and alliancing for strategic repositioning. They have created intrinsic competitiveness through a series of measures such as collaborative R&D, globalization of RED and horizontal innovation transfer. The internationalization of skills has been very quick, and because of this they are able to extend the core competence rapidly. The complementary use of strategic networking, globalization and innovation, along with intrinsic competitiveness, help the Japanese firms to respond to competition in an effective manner. Managerial visions, quick skill internalization, horizontal coordination and economies of scope form the basis of creating and sustaining competitiveness and these characterize the innovation system of the 1990s.

To move beyond today's electronic libraries to tomorrow's networked virtual ones, libraries will need to extend well beyond their institutional boundaries. We are witnessing the emergence of a new industry in America: the knowledge industry. It involves communications, computers, software, database developers, publishers, and libraries. Libraries will play a pivotal role in the knowledge industry by developing special information packages and by providing direct access to many different print and non- print formats, bibliographic indexes and abstracts, CD-ROM systems, document delivery, full-text-electronic journals, images, and multimedia products. Libraries will offer customized services that seamlessly bring the world of information to users through the Internet, super networks, and wireless communications. Besides personnel and technological reconfiguration, new strategic partnerships with other libraries, commercial enterprises, software suppliers, publishers, campus computer centers, and user communities of educators and researchers will position libraries to become the high profile knowledge management centers of the future. Descriptions of a virtual medical library illustrate progress some libraries have made in these new directions.

J	KANZ, JW				KANZ, JW			ORIGINS OF THE US SEMICONDUCTOR RESURGENCE - PRODUCTS AND PERCEPTIONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						US SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY; COMPETITIVENESS; JAPANESE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY; INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ICS); MICROCOMPONENTS, MEMORY DEVICES; DIGITAL LOGIC CHIPS; APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ASICS)	INDUSTRY	For over a decade, the US semiconductor industry has been widely viewed as endangered by severe foreign competition, primarily from large, vertically integrated Japanese electronics firms. This paper briefly contrasts the development of US, European, and Japanese industries and examines the present competitive situation in the context of current technology trends. Strong evidence is found that American companies have at least maintained and have probably increased their competitive advantages in those types of products which represent the fastest growing and most strategic market segments and are dominant in certain key microchips. The origins, evolution and significance of unique structural features of the US industry are reviewed, and their relationship to these competitive advantages is postulated. The US industry relies on an increasingly disaggregated structure that historical evidence suggests could be competitively superior in a fast-moving technology-intensive globalized industry. These conclusions contradict traditional assumptions regarding the inherent technological advantages of large, vertically integrated firms. Finally, there are indications that some mechanisms contributing to present successes could also promote long-term problems.

However, the critical success factors for transfer of technical knowledge as represented by methods, processes and technical philosophies have not been so completely characterized. This paper explores the use of demonstration projects for the transfer of these 'non-product' technologies. Recent case studies, covering two of the most important reliability issues facing the US utility industry, are examined.

The analysis is based on a comparison of 57 large technology based firms in Europe, USA and Japan over an 11 year period between 1980 and 1990. Based on this analysis a classification of strategic diversification behaviour is made and it is shown that technology-based business extenders were the real winners in terms of growth. With this background the need for product diversification among large Swedish firms to better exploit the flow of technology is discussed.

J	LONG, RJ				LONG, RJ			THE ADOPTION OF WHITE-COLLAR COMPUTERIZATION BY CANADIAN BUSINESS FIRMS	REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION-CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES			English	Article							INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITIVE WEAPON; ADVANTAGE; GROWTH	This paper seeks to identify the extent to which Canadian firms have adopted white collar computerization, and to identify factors that differentiate high and low adopters. Based on data collected from 110 major Canadian companies in 17 industrial subsectors, it was found that 71 percent of all white collar employees had been provided with a computer or terminal at their workplace. The data revealed that this proportion varied dramatically across occupational groups, from 58 percent among executives to 88 percent among clerical employees, and across industrial subsectors, from 42 percent in retailing to 93 percent in high technology. The most striking finding was the high variation in computerization level across firms within the same industrial subsector, which was as large as the variation across subsectors. Correlational analysis indicated that in the manufacturing sector, firms with a high proportion of professional employees, a hostile business environment, an aggressive strategic orientation, and favourable top management attitudes had significantly higher levels of white collar computerization, providing some support for the structural contingency model of information technology structure. Interestingly, not one significant correlate was found in the service sector.			LONG, RJ (corresponding author), UNIV SASKATCHEWAN,COLL COMMERCE,SASKATOON,SK S7N 0W0,CANADA.

J	MARKS, AF				MARKS, AF			THE INTERPLAY OF RESEARCH AND INFORMATION IN MOST	INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article								Researchers require specific information for their work. Information needs vary according to the phases of research - the preparatory phase, the design phase and the fieldwork and report phase. Social scientific information is also rapidly becoming a central resource for policymaking. Active information provision is replacing passive information collection and storage; there is a shift from stock to flow management. The increasingly strategic value of information leads to the development of strategic information management. Strategic information management is concerned with capacity-building in research and policy-making. Six crucial aspects are discussed: exploitation of existing databases, creation of databases, national and regional networking, development of technical infrastructures, solution of the problem of multilingualism in information and communication, and training of information workers and researchers. MOST priority themes and research topics may be considered to be foci in strategic information management. MOST is a recently established UNESCO programme of international social science research on ethnicity and multicultural society, cities as arenas of accelerated social transformations and local impacts of global environmental, technological and economic transformations			MARKS, AF (corresponding author), SOCIAL SCI INFORMAT & DOCUMENTAT CTR,410-412 HERENGRACHT,1017 BX AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.

It suggests a GDSS architecture that would enable a group of managers to discuss, learn from each other and possibly develop consensus about decisions or their causes. It shows how an object-oriented approach can be used in producing interactive software to support managerial debate about problem solving. The method uses comprehensive situation mapping causal mapping to represent each manager's perceptions of the relationships between key variables of a firm's strategic situation. The paper presents a prototype implementation and, based on experiences from it, discusses issues concerning future development and use.	[Heintz, T.

J	JOSE, PD				JOSE, PD			PARTICIPATIVE MANAGEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS	JOURNAL OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								In the last decade participation has become a central theme in development administration. This paper looks at the possibility of using participative approaches in the strategic management of developmental programmes. As participation involves attitudinal and behavioural changes the emphasis here is on the 'process' of participation. Participation is viewed as a process of contribution, as organisation, as partnership and as empowerment. Each of these modes may be distinguished on the dimensions of purpose, form and the content of participation. For the successful management of development programmes the attempt should be to obtain a situation-strategy fit. The development situation may be analysed using the variables of administrative capability, community capacity and environmental complexity. In situations of high administrative capability and low community capacity the contributory mode may be appropriate. Where both administrative capability and community capacity are high the partnership mode is desirable. In low administrative capability and high community capacity situations participation as organisation is the appropriate strategy. Finally in situations where both administrative capability and community capacity are low and the environmental complexity high the empowerment mode of participation is appropriate. In the final section an attempt has been made to analyse the appropriate mode of participation in the context of a given programme using a modified version of Samuel Paul's framework. The appropriateness of qualitative and quantitative criteria for measuring the quality of participation has also been examined briefly.

J	VENSHOSKY, D				VENSHOSKY, D			PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF AE FIRMS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Architecture/engineering (A/E) firms are sometimes criticized for a lack of long-term strategic planning-for reacting to short-term opportunities rather than proactively formulating and implementing long-term business plans. However, given the project orientation of the architecture/engineering/construction (A/E/C) industry, the volatility of project markets, and the relatively low capitalization of many A/E firms, such a short-term approach is somewhat logical. Nevertheless, it appears that consideration by A/E firms of the concepts of strategic management should be worthwhile.

The focus here is on how information systems can improve organizational performance by obtaining improved consistency between formulated strategy and implementation, improved quality of complex decision-making processes, and enhancement of organizational learning. How this can be attained is demonstrated through the design of a new system for credit evaluation in a Norwegian bank. Implications are highlighted.

This multi-echelon evaluation framework employs strategic planning, conceptual design, risk analysis, sensitivity analysis, simulation and the analytical hierarchical process to evaluate the CIM system design. This approach is characterized by flexibility and assessability of the iterative evaluation cycles, subjective utility functions of decision makers, and simulation for risk analysis at different stages of the evaluation process. It provides management with a decision support tool when considering CIM implementation. A case study is presented to demonstrate this multi-echelon evaluation framework for CIM systems design.

The research results suggest a model based on the intention-action relationship and three components of this relationship - the content, social, and affective components. The model explains how managers dealt with these elements and adopted three different approaches, depending on the strategic issue. These approaches, termed technical, political, and expressive, each lend particular dynamics and patterns of characteristics to the organizational processes.

To date however, little attention has been paid to the underlying motivation of the decision makers or how the decision process actually functions in the corporate environment when adversarial relationships exist between departments. In this paper adversarial decisions are analyzed using Allison's conceptual framework, strategic assumption surfacing and testing (SAST), and agency theory. The performance of the SAST method is found to be linked to the descriptive model that best represents the decision making process and whether the analyst subscribes to agency theory as a valid motivator for individual decisions within the organization.

After discussing the inherent problems with productivity, including the productivity paradox, this paper attempts to solve them by an unconventional use of a linear programming (LP) method. Accommodation of such strategic factors as manufacturing quality and flexibility is emphasized. The LP-based performance analysis also demonstrates that 'manufacturing' strategy can be the most important business strategy of a company.

This review examined the strategic effectiveness and operational efficiency of the guidelines developed under the auspices of the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Institutional and Medical Services (ACIMS). To assess the perceived management utility of the guidelines, over 185 structured mail questionnaires were sent to a random representative sample of health care managers stratified by type of health-related organization and Canadian province and territory. With a response rate of over 80.5%, a profile of management perceptions of the need for the current Program Guidelines was created. In tandem an internal review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the design and development of the Guidelines was conducted using over 45 structured interviews with key informants. Both components of the comprehensive audit provided the basis of report recommendations that are relevant to the Canadian health system community.

As this experience includes a wide range of countries, policies and instruments, many developing countries might learn a lot from Latin American successes and policy failures. The paper concludes with a discussion of the most relevant policy issues that should be included in,an agenda for the immediate future: competition policies beyond trade liberalization, strategic alliances, the impact of regional and sub-regional integration on technological development, and the building up of an integrated approach to technological development and social justice.

J	QUERE, M				QUERE, M			THE CONVENTION CIFRE - A SUCCESSFUL FRENCH INCENTIVE SCHEME FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN-RESOURCES IN RESEARCH ACTIVITY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						EDUCATIONAL TRAINING; INNOVATION SUPPORT; RESEARCH INCENTIVE SCHEMES; RESEARCH POLICY		A CIFRE contract is a French incentive scheme which associates a firm and a public research group in order to finance a PhD student in producing his thesis whose subject is applied and should be profitable to the firm. In this paper, quantitative and qualitative aspects of the CIFRE contracts are set up, and I conclude that this public incentive scheme is successful. The core of the argument is to show how the basket of CIFRE contracts has changed from opportunistic behaviour towards deeper strategic cooperative projects. The effectiveness of this incentive scheme is by now obviously established, both for the company and for the public research group, and the paper explains the reasons of such a change. Consequently, some lessons from the CIFRE incentive scheme are suggested, emphasizing the role of human resources in innovation, and the understanding of French companies facing innovative choices.

The Process Control aims at improving global productivity and quality of the resulting products by optimizing each elementary process as well as management of tools or workshops interfaces. Complex processes, involving generally many variables, require for their control more or less sophisticated models. These process models are either analytical when physical and thermodynamical mechanisms are known or statistical or knowledge based, according to circumstances. In any case, it is necessary to have a reliable and precise instrumentation to adjust undetermined parameters during model development and to be able to take into account external parameters variability during current working. This instrumentation concerns both running of machines and testing of manufactured materials under harsh environment conditions of Iron and Steel industry: temperature, dusts, steam, electromagnetic interferences, vibrations,.... In this context, in-line Non Destructive Testing methods contribute efficienly because they may give directly and in real time products characteristics, integrating both drifts of machines and sensors due to their ageing and the abnormal spread of material entering the process. These methods induce the development of sophisticated inspection equipments whose strategic significance is such that their failure to operate can require production shutdown. The paper gives some representative examples of improvement of the accuracy of an in-line measurement or controlling of elementary processes or processes interfaces: temperature measurement by infrared pyrometry, thickness profile determination by X-ray array sensor, recrystallization control in continuous by X-ray and ultrasonic methods, automatic detection and indentification of surface defects by optics, cracks detection on as-cast hot slabs by eddy currents.

The aim of the study is to obtain a systematic, as well as a systemic problem definition for the subsequent design of higher-level control algorithms. The method of analysis was taken from general systems theory; the general scheme of the systems approach has been adapted to the specific control design problem. Following this approach, first, the behaviour of the basic control algorithms was explored by computer simulation. Based on these preliminary results, a systemic representation of the overall control problem was obtained by defining the pulp cooking process and the basic control algorithms together as a system with three inputs and three outputs. Further, the input-output relations of the system were examined by simulation. The final results are given in the form of three diagrams representing the static responses of the object system to the step changes of a single input. The significance of these characteristics is discussed in terms of information needed for the next step of control design. In addition, the diagrams contain some strategic operational hints for better process management on the lower control level.

Responses must be guided by careful enquiry into needs of potential users, identifying circumstances, existing knowledge and beliefs. Such activity systems vary between individuals and groups, yet the goal of an information policy designer must be to encourage a unified approach or, at least, a limited number of approaches to problems of information provision. ''Soft'' systems techniques provide powerful means of describing, analyzing and designing information systems. The techniques are sensitive to the approaches, or views, that people have of their knowledge domain. By identifying the nature of the domain it is possible to define its boundary and, by comparison, to identify the characteristics of common elements. A classification of the main elements usually found within a system includes (Client, Actor). Transformation Weltanschauung, Owner and Environment (to use Checkland's criteria). This approach encourages a forward, strategic view of information management and policy provision, which highlights the point at which technological change can offer opportunities. Successful strategies will also be adaptable to unexpected events, helping to balance the proactive and reactive aspects of policy management.

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in the transportation industry is used as an exemplary case. Recent research showed that higher efficiency is the main reason for service organizations to implement EDI. But EDI can also be used as an enabling tool to develop new or improved customer services - e.g. tracking and tracing, real door-to-door concepts etc. But in most organizations it takes time to discover the strategic potentials of EDI. In the first part of the paper, the fields of customer service and new information technology are described. Subsequently, the two subjects are linked in a theory on innovation in services, termed the reverse product cycle theory posed by Barras (1986, 1990). Finally, some first results are presented.

Hydro in terms of their impact on the technological development of the electrical power equipment industry in Canada. The theoretical underpinnings of this analysis are that under certain economic, technical and institutional conditions, procurement as managed by large publicly owned corporations with a high level of technical capacity can be a powerful instrument of industrial innovation. The paper describes how in the face of weakening market power following the twenty-year expansion phase in the industry (1960-80) and global restructuring among electrical power equipment suppliers, the three utilities have been forced to reassess conflicting commercial and technological objectives. The authors point to Hydro Quebec's signing of a recent series of strategic production agreements with key suppliers as an example of a new approach to procurement through concentrated use of limited market power in critical product areas. The paper concludes that the distribution of risks involved in technology development between buyers and sellers is dependent on market structures.

J	LINT, LJO				LINT, LJO			OPTIONS IN ADVANCED ENERGY-RELATED PRODUCTION PROCESSES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article								Investments in advanced energy related production processes are highly forwardlooking. On the one hand consideration must be given to the possibilities of later integration of constituent projects, on the other hand, uncertain energy conditions have to be taken into account. Traditional discounted cashflow techniques for the economic evaluation cannot properly reckon with the opportunity of conditional investment making dependent on future developments. Option analysis provides an answer to this issue by creating an analogy between the valuation of options on shares and serial investment planning. This paper presents a casestudy of the application of option analysis for investments in coal-based ironmaking, an advanced and energy-sensitive process studied by Hoogovens and British Steel Corporation. Based on traditional criteria, uncertain energy conditions make it questionable whether the management should invest in this process. This paper shows that the first step in the investment process can be framed and valued as buying an option on the total conversion of the existing process, dependent on fluctuations of the energy-price. As demonstrated, the option value makes it attractive to start the first constituent project in order to create the opportunity to make a final decision on total conversion in the future. Thus, option analysis provides an additional aid for the management in the economic evaluation, linking strategic planning with investment planning.

AT&T's active participation in the growth of international telecommunications requires close cooperation among its business units, as well as between the company and its overseas partners-which, in some circumstances, may also be its competitors. This cooperation is an essential element of a globalization strategy that recognizes that no company, by itself, will be able to meet the expanding information movement and management needs of ever-greater numbers of global customers.

The different social consequences of each are addressed. A fundamental appraisal of issues of cost analysis is provided, and often overlooked factors are identified. The merits of (a) alternative tariff forms including rising and falling blocks, (b) seasonal and time-of-day tariffs, and (c) cover/fixed charge approaches are analysed, together with the often more cost-effective use of tariffs without meters for households. The important role of the engineering elasticity of demand is set alongside the more often discussed concept of economic elasticity.

J	SHIPLEY, MF				SHIPLEY, MF			A DSS MODEL FOR A SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STRATEGIC PLANNING; MULTICRITERIA DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM; HIGHER EDUCATION		Although it may be questioned whether OR has failed to make a significant impact on decision processes at the top of the management hierarchy, the author believes it can be appropriate for decision making within subunits of the organization. One such example is the application of OR methodologies to the strategic planning process of a school of engineering. The fact that the university is a service organization with inherently fuzzy data leading to frequently non-quantifiable objectives exacerbated the problem with using typical quantitative OR techniques. An approach was developed that structured the objectives into a hierarchy of mission, goals, objectives, strategies, and actions, all of which could be relatively weighted through input of knowledgeable middle managers within the school. Constraints were incorporated into a 0-1 integer programming model that attempted to maximize the importance for initiation of each action as its importance varied over time.

A model of the existing system was analysed at current and increased demands to identify weaknesses in the system. The model was altered by the addition of pumping mains, two storage reservoirs at new locations, and the strengthening of distribution mains to provide a solution to meet the client's requirements. The location and size of the proposed reservoirs were optimized with respect to the construction costs of the reservoirs, pumping and distribution pipelines, and pump running costs. Areas were zoned to provide better strategic storage, whilst also reducing retention times, thus eliminating the problems of low chlorine residuals.

We propose a strategic forecasting system for foodservice management, which may be expedited by using decision support systems. The most notable potential for improved forecast performance and decision flexibility may rest with increasing forecasting information. This article provides a framework for building a strategic forecasting system that can help managers select and use appropriate forecasting models for foodservice operations.

This vital process must be as efficient and effective as managerial skills and the application of technology permits. Yet, as the effects of technology escalate, little is known about the application of computerized information systems (CIS) to important strategic and operational, financial management decision-making. This study examines the use of information technology in financial decision-making in state governments. The findings suggest that computerized information systems play central but diverse functions in various financial decisions, but that public managers will continue to play a key role in ensuring that CIS use enhances decision-making capabilities.

J	STUPAK, RJ; GRIESER, RC				STUPAK, RJ; GRIESER, RC			UNICORS STRATEGIC-PLANNING PROCESS - A DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article								In this period of cutback-management, downsizing, and cost-containment in the public sector, everyone has become interested in strategic planning. The academic and management guru tomes on theoretical strategic planning grow both in volume and abstrusness as the years pass. And yet, the really strange thing is that everyone seems to be talking about, intellectualizing about, and philosophizing about strategic planning, while very few organizations are doing it effectively. Surely strategy is a complex and multifaceted concept. It sometimes leads to great confusion, fear, and disorientation for managers, because leaders do not communicate exactly what they mean by the term or the processes of strategic planning. And since many public leaders do not anchor strategic planning into the cultural and contextual bowels of their respective organizations, the result most times ends up in endless debate, academic nonsense, and useless paper-pushing. Therefore, this analysis documents how Federal Prisons Industries, Inc. (UNICOR) began its organizational strategic planning endeavor to prepare for a future of quality growth. Hopefully, this will illustrate a useful game plan for other public agencies on how to begin the process of synthesizing the design of strategic planning with the operational realities and cultural anchors of organizational life. Most strategic planning savants are convinced that the most important process problem in strategic planning is the management of strategic ideas into operational realities. In other words, the initial key to making strategic planning work is getting started with it in such a way as to convince enough power people in the organization that the new ideas of the strategic approach can be turned into a productive conventional wisdom within the culture of the organization. This article illustrates the benefits to be gained by public agencies that are willing to make a commitment to begin a strategic planning effort. Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (UNICOR) made such a commitment by holding a Strategic Planning Conference in early 1989. As a result of having undergone a comprehensive, initial process, UNICOR is in a much stronger position today to chart its course for meeting its growth demands in the future as it moves from the basics of strategic planning into the realities of strategic management.

Existing applications are only redesigned and modified when there are problems or user requests. This reactive approach may mean lost opportunities and systems that are no longer providing strategic advantage for the organization. While there has been much attention to design methodologies for new systems, there has been a lack of investigation into when and how an existing information system should be modified or abandoned. This article investigates the need for redesign methodologies and presents an approach for determining the frequency of application redesign.

Most consider it an upper management activity, yet 90% of the strategic plans for industrial facilities cannot be implemented as planned. According to the authors, plans often fail because engineering and technical considerations are overlooked. Strategic plans based on inaccurate assumptions can cost a company millions of dollars. The strategic planning process for capital-intensive projects is shown in a block diagram. It begins with a mission statement and ends with criteria needed for a capital plan. Situation analysis, objectives, strategies, and implementation are broken down to show items that need to be evaluated. The diagram helps to clarify the interrelationships among these items. Case histories illustrate how and why a company's senior engineers must be part of the decision-making process when investing capital in plant and equipment or applying new technology in the workplace.

This paper discusses the problems encountered by small suppliers, offering innovative software solutions to industry. It suggests that there is a common pattern to the development of such suppliers; and proposes a model of their evolution and development. This model, in turn, identifies a fairly consistent set of issues which should be addressed by organisations purchasing such innovative, strategic software products. The paper provides an appropriate criterion for judging the likely success of products purchased from such a software house, additional to the standard criteria of product quality and suitability.

J	WHITELEY, AM; JORDAN, E				WHITELEY, AM; JORDAN, E			BEHAVIORAL-ASPECTS OF INTRODUCING CHANGE IN INFORMATION-SYSTEMS	AUSTRALIAN COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article								The predictable social consequences of introducing fundamental change to a computerised information system are discussed. Attention is drawn to the need for strategic planners to consider that employees are slower to change than senior managers. A case is described to illustrate the effects of introducing an Information Centre organisation without due consideration of the social environment. Change must be introduced with sensitivity to potential behaviour problems. The use of the Grounded Theory approach is proposed, to involve employees in the change process.

Early data dictionary systems had limitations that reduced their effectiveness and contributed to their limited usage. Many of these limitations have been or are being resolved with the result that evolving data dictionary systems offer many benefits to management and EDP auditors. This article evaluates the features, potential benefits, and limitations of data dictionary systems from the perspective of the EDP auditor.

This article describes the implementation of a novel MIS development strategy and explains the circumstances that influenced the decision to prepare a user's manual at the beginning of the system development cycle rather than at the end. The article further describes the management strategy of creating a Systems Engineering Department to exercise centralized project control and emphasizes how the generation of Activity Description Charts, and Hierarchy plus Input-Process-Output (HIPO) documentation during system development affects the productivity of project personnel by: (a) clearly understanding their individual responsibilities, and (b) knowing the relationship of their work to the overall project development goals.

In 1978 a task force studied and made recommendations on the future of word processing throughout the corporation. As a result of these efforts, the Office of Information and Computer Services (OICS) assumed leadership and developed a small consulting team to assist users in choosing and installing word processing systems. By 1980 the consultants' workload and the existence of perceived needs for $ 1.8 million in word processing products demanded a more systematic and encompassing strategy. Therefore, OICS formed a temporary organization, the Office Systems Group, to devise objectives, policies, and implementation strategies for the 1980's. This team needed to learn what questions to ask and how to find answers. Furthermore, because modern office technologies will not work unless people accept them, the group had to deal with the social dynamics of office units. The group did a technical study of available products and developed a self-study method to determine office needs. Today the University's policies and strategy foster compatible systems, enable adequate maintenance, and promote staff mobility. The products chosen meet the needs of all users - teachers, students, clerical staff, professional staff, and administrators.

Evolving and Implementing a Worldwide Management Information System (IMS/MIS)	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Implementation; system development; evolving systems; worldwide MIS; management interaction		Du Pont's international business is becoming a more important part of its worldwide total. The Polymer Products Department (PPD), due to the merging of former independent departments, represents about 25% of Du Pont's worldwide revenues, and has the largest export sales section several hundred million dollars annually. As PPD's product lines increased, managers with geographic responsibilities must cope with an increasingly complex array of detailed product, end use, sales, and forecast information. These changes require a more efficient way to organize and access business information. This article describes the development of a management information system that could cope with an anticipated rise in meeting new information needs for both sales and order processing. This article explores the operational philosophy that permitted the rapid development of the IMS/MIS at a relatively low cost. It explores the techniques used to interact with users at all organizational levels and outlines a plan to implement the IMS/MIS at headquarters and subsidiary locations around the world.

The "Information Systems" approach selected involved some newer technologies in combination with some older, almost prosaic, techniques. The article shows how value-added networks, non-simultaneous communications, voice/data sharing, ASCI protocols and the electronic PBX were combined to produce a data network at literally no incremental cost to the corporation.

It is both a reference system, in that an indexed summary or surrogate of a document is created and stored for retrieval by computer, and a full text system, and in that the complete document can be entered, searched, and retrieved if needed. AMANDA is capable of handling a wide variety of document types (e.g., letter, memo, report, contract, reprint, book) by tailoring an organizational communication. A system which widens the channels of communication and helps to integrate disjoint functions provides large and complex organizations the means of over coming a basic operational deficiency. AMANDA is currently in active use within several departments at American Critical Care, a division of American Hospital Supply Corporation. Departments at other divisions access the system from remote sites.

J	McNeil, DH				McNeil, D. H.			STABILIZING AN MIS	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						MIS management; standards; information systems; planning; design		Technical managers of MIS appear to have only two problems: End user requirements continually evolve; Vendor product offerings are in constant flux. In other words, everything is subject to somewhat unpredictable change from all sides at once. This is the quintessence of unmanageability. The excitement and adventure of the situation are more than offset by the excessive costs of development and maintenance which accrue to those who are trying to provide an MIS of consistently high quality. One company which performs MIS and conventional data processing services for more than 400 hospitals was able to design, implement and maintain a rather complete set of functional interface standards for all software run on its central processing facility. Seven primary functional types were identified and implemented over a five year period with an expenditure of more than 50 person-years of effort. User profile management and user data distribution were the two best developed and most essential standard interfaces. The diversity of client characteristics and of output media which can be handled through the interfaces has made possible an extraordinary corporate growth rate in excess of 25% per year, with a corresponding expansion in client base and MIS services. The management ramifications and the technological outcomes of this MIS stabilizing project are the complementary subjects of this paper.	[McNeil, D. H.] IBM, Armonk, NY USA; [McNeil, D.

J	Moore, JH				Moore, Jeffrey H.			A FRAMEWORK FOR MIS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Software; MIS; framework		This article questions the tacit assumption that computer software development is a homogeneous activity across differing tasks. The author proposes that conventional statistics on the performance of MIS software development groups are too often based upon norms and procedures relevant to groups developing systems-oriented software. To evaluate the statement a simple descriptive framework is presented which distinguishes software developmental attributes for MIS from those of other computer software systems. The framework is validated by data from twenty-four organizations and the implications for management of MIS software development are discussed.
