Stock monitoring is vital for inventory management; it is a tool that enables adequate planning in terms of importation requirements when stock is low and for general price management. The accuracy of stock inventory depends largely on the accuracy of the calibration data of the various storage tanks and structures deployed along the value chain. Mobile tanks are prone to harsh conditions due to poor road networks in some countries which affect tanker truck alignment and suspension systems, and all these affects tank calibration accuracy. This is further aggravated by various road impacts, and accidents that sometimes distort portions of the tank shape making it to lose its cylindrical profile in some sections. Excessive stock variations is often linked to product theft and sabotage, though this may be true in some instances, but at times, this variations may be as a result of inaccuracies in tank calibration. The dataset presented in this paper contains tank calibration parameters for two consecutive calibrations carried out on the same mobile storage tank. The statistical analysis attempts to identify variations between the two tank calibration dataset as an indication of potential stock accuracy variations. (C) 2018 The Authors.

PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Nuts business; NTFPs; Market value; Anthropogenic pressure; Nut classes	TRADITIONAL DRUGS SOLD; ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL SURVEY; REGENERATION; MARKET; TRADE	Lack of attention to forest products' contribution to socioeconomic status has created a gap between the ecosystem services and its management. To fill this gap, current study has explored the management approaches, value chain activities, trade dynamics and economic potential obtained from the Nuts of medicinal plant Pinus gerardiana Wall. The main objective of the study was to highlight the prevailing gaps in knowledge, discussed the linkages among various players in the market, existing problems in the trade, and formulates future perspectives. Current study was completed with the help a comprehensive survey comprised of two phases. In the first phase, the local harvesters were interviewed about the various dynamics in the trade from harvest to supply to market. While in the second phase, market survey was carried out with traders and dealers to record the prices fluctuations of nut at various level in the market. Current study reports that pine nut is the largest Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) with great demand both in national and international market. Local people are unaware of the market linkages and quality standards. Most important value added activity was found to be the roasting activity and which is not done by the local harvester at the study area due to lack of expertise. Significant increase in market prices was recorded along the supply chain. The revenue come from the business is unequally distributed among various agents involved in the value chain. Overall, the business is informal and heterogeneous. Local communities should be educated about the value added activities and market demands. It is equally important to facilitate the local harvesters for finding certain market linkages to make easy their access to the national markets where they gain maximum revenue of medicinal plants and their other valuable forest products. It is the responsibility of state and other organization to help them while addressing the problems by improving the knowledge at the start of supply chain, improving the linkages among all steps in value chain and developing the sustainability at all levels.

Environmental Assessment of Amylase Used as Digestibility Improvement Factor for Intensive Chicken Production in Brazil	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						life cycle assessment; LCA; environment; enzyme; amylase; feed; chicken; broiler	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; EMISSIONS	Industrial enzymes can be used to improve the digestibility of livestock feed components, thereby increasing the nutritional value of the feed, and allowing farmers to change and cost-optimize the feed composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the environmental impacts of adding a starch-degrading enzyme (amylase) to feed for Brazilian chicken production. A lifecycle assessment covering all significant processes in the value chain as well as all significant impact categories was used as analytical tool. The application of amylase increases the energy value of corn in chicken feed and allows saving of costly fat in the feed. In Brazil, the saved fat is used either for biodiesel production or as a replacement for other fats in cleaning and hygiene products. The study showed that approximately 6% of greenhouse-gas emission from Brazilian chicken production could be avoided using the amylase. Using the amylase increases the contribution to nutrient enrichment by 0.6% when the excess fat is used for biodiesel. The use of amylase has little impact on agricultural land use, water consumption and acidification.

J	Gilles, E				Gilles, Enrique			Global value chains, employment and services: Evidence for some Latin American countries	TEC EMPRESARIAL			Spanish	Article						jobs; services; Latin America; global value chains; globalization		In this article, we address the Global Value Chain (GVC) phenomenon as an employment generator, from the experience of five Latin American countries and focusing on the Services sector. An international input-output table combined with country and industry level employment is used to do it. Results show that the majority of employment directly and indirectly generated by foreign demand is originated in the Services sector of these countries, which invites to pay more attention to the consequences of trade policies to this traditionally non-tradable sector. The evidence about the limited participation of Latin American countries in Global Value Chains is also presented.

J	Phung, HG; Pham, DB				Hai Giang Phung; Duong Bao Pham			Effects of Integrated Shrimp Farming in Vietnam	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article						economic effects; integration; shrimp farming; Vietnam	INDUSTRY	Despite being a leading shrimp exporter in the world market, shrimp farming in Vietnam is carried out by many small-scale farmers who face constraints in complying with increasingly stringent food safety and sustainability standards. The best way for such small farmers to circumvent this paradox is to make effective integrations both horizontally and vertically. Using value chain and institutional economics approaches, this study determines the factors that influence the probability of horizontal and vertical integrations between the production and processing stages in the shrimp industry in Vietnam. Analysis results confirm that integrated shrimp aquaculture is much more effective than the traditionally small-scale- and individual-production mode. In addition, logit estimation results identify the key factors affecting integration, including effectiveness of the legal framework, production scale, infrastructure development, and farmers' skill and awareness. Several policy recommendations proposed to encourage the development of integration in shrimp farming in Vietnam could also be useful for other similar developing countries.

J	Arce-Chaves, L				Arce-Chaves, Laura			Business innovation as a value chain in companies incorporated into the Public Relations practice of the Universidad Latina of Costa Rica	REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE RELACIONES PUBLICAS			Spanish	Article						Innovation; Public Relations; communication; strategy		It results of an exploratory and descriptive investigation about the state of innovation and its incorporation into the business value chain starting from the execution of the business practice in PR of the Latin University of Costa Rica are presented. The participating organizations belong to relevant economic sectors of the country, at the time of the study they had presence of students of the last grade of the carreer. The instrument used was validated by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications of Costa Rica. The objective was to examine strategy, structure, process, culture of innovation and identify the contribution of PRs as a tool for promoting innovation managed by advertisers as a differentiating element in the value chain. The findings reveal that 50% of the organizations present ambiguity in the concept of innovation, lack of measurement criteria and budget for innovation, managerial support and commitment, lack of generating spaces for new ideas and nullity of documentation of lessons learned. However, they recognize the contribution provided through PR consultancy or PR students, this has allowed them to implement creativity and innovation tools in their organizations, being useful to face the challenge of innovating in the current context. The main conclusions are that the structure of innovation is the most problematic variable, determined by indicators of management priority level with innovation; the lack of an innovation structure is evident, lack of human capital supporting the execution of projects, and little interdepartmental articulation. On the other hand, the innovation strategy stands out as the best managed variable with indicators that determine presence, definition and deployment of innovative policies, strategic objectives, establishment of goals and metrics for the scope, the intervention. This places PR as a tool for internal communication management, organizational culture and promoter of new opportunities for growth and innovative learning.

J	Felipa, PB				Barrientos Felipa, Pedro			Peruvian agriculture and its ability to compete in the international market	EQUIDAD & DESARROLLO			Spanish	Article						Peruvian agriculture for export; international competition; international marketing		This article is part of an ongoing research on productive diversification in Peru, as a response to the possibility of modifying the productive matrix of a country characterized as primary-exporter. The mentioned diversification implies being able to compete in the global market with products that do not have much added value, and which contribute to strengthening the basket of exportable products. Competing implies having knowledge of the initial context of the country and its background, in order to participate in a place where participants look for opportunities offered by buyers and the oversights of other participants. Competing in the context of the country is a macro action that implies that all local agents form a value chain to strengthen their participation.

Along with the globalization, the increase in competition has necessitated strategic planning Today, almost every institution seemsto have made strategic planning The starting point of the work is on the strategic planning in non-profit organizations. The main reason for the elaboration of the museums from non-profit organizations is that there is a limited number of studies on the subject in the literature. Michael Porter's value chain analysis has been emphasized in the stdudy conducted with literature review management. The importance of strategically determining the values in the museums has been examined. As a result, the obstacles in strategic planning are rankes and teh roles of leaders are summarized.

Total cost of risk for privatized electric power generation under pipeline vandalism	HELIYON			English	Article						Energy	ANALYSIS FRAMEWORKS; RECENT DEFINITIONS; ENERGY; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; PERCEPTION; SECURITY; NIGERIA	Gas pipeline vandalism is a huge threat factor to steady electricity generation and energy materials flow in the power sector of Nigeria. It imposes huge cost of risk to that sector. Due to incessant pipeline vandalism, power availability is subject to elements of chance and with undesired out comes that adversely impact on power generation value chain. To this end, this study seeks to develop a model for estimating the cost of risk to a power generation company (Genco) and calculating plant unavailability indices by applying the dispersion technique. Applying the dispersion technique is innovative and differentiates the current methodology from other works on the subject area concerned. The probability and impact of failure alongside the variances and standard deviations of the parameters were derived. Cost to the Genco was obtained by multiplying fuel utilization ratio by unsupplied power and associated differential between price of electricity (output) and price of its primary fuel. Results showed that the lost megawatt hours (MWh) standard deviation, delta, of the case study plant is 48,176.776 MWh. During the 2010 to 2012 periods, the resultant risk to the Genco was estimated to be (sic) 45,399 per MWh, (sic) 42,022 per MWh and (sic) 42,832 per MWh with the exchange rate as (sic) 150/$, (sic)155/$ and (sic) 159/$ respectively. To bridge a research gap based on literature, total cost index and model have been developed for measurement of impact or loss suffered as a result of vandalism. Inclusion of reliability index in the algorithm is a novelty as it allows measurement of level of system performance and its vulnerability to vandalization. The information will be of immense benefit to private investors in the power sector who have to make decisions over management of electricity generation in Nigeria based on imperfect information, following the privatization exercise.

Effects of a transnational company in the Amazon	MUNDO AMAZONICO			Spanish	Article						global value chains; tourism; Amazonia; transnational corporations; Decameron Hotels	GOVERNANCE	The effects of transnational tourism corporations has been study in mature markets. The analyses present important, intra and extra markets, mechanisms of control applied by the corporations over local and small enterprises in the destinations, with the aim to maintain their power along the value chain. However, less attention is devoted to the effects that transnational companies caused in remote destinations in peripheral regions. This article explore with a global value chain approach, the effects of mass tourism promoted by a transnational tourism corporation in the Colombian Amazon. That vertical integration, the strategic alliances and the support of a political context allowed the position of Decameron Hotels as the leader firm, boosting the expansion of mass tourism in the area, and questioning the sustainability of the sector.

Impact of air granulation on the ferrochrome value chain in metallurgical smelter complexes	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						slag handling; air granulation; dry granulation; energy recovery; granulation; ferroalloys; ferrochrome	HEAT; SLAG	South African ferrochrome producers typically operate single tap-hole furnaces with alloy and slag separation occurring post-taphole by means of a skimmer block. Both streams are then cast directly onto a prepared surface, or in some cases a layer-casting process is employed using hot metal ladles. These processes all require significant cooling time followed by extensive in situ crushing operations, leading to a high burden and cost in terms of time and on-site material handling. Moreover, the slag is then further crushed and screened in a chrome recovery plant to liberate any entrained alloy, and subsequently discarded as waste. Air granulation has achieved commercial success in other sectors and typical South African ferrochrome operations can also benefit. Air granulation promises lower production costs by elimination of casting, cooling, break-up, and crushing activities; improved alloy liberation by elimination of middlings; and improved safety due to faster cooling without water sprays. There is also a market for subsequent use of air-granulated ferrochrome slag as a valuable product, due to its potential improved physical properties over slow cooled variants. Air granulation is being tested to evaluate its effect on the ferrochrome value chain within a typical South African metallurgical complex. Here we report the results of this first-of-its-kind work, and explore strategies for successful integration.	[Hannemann, F.; Bradfield, M.; Mahdi, M.; So, L. L.

J	Mandizvidza, K				Mandizvidza, Kudzai			Vertical price linkages in food markets: Evidence from the tomato value chain of Northern South Africa	FUTURE OF FOOD-JOURNAL ON FOOD AGRICULTURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Marketing margins; Price transmission; Tomato value chain; Vertical price linkages	TRANSMISSION; ASYMMETRY	Price transmission in agricultural fresh produce markets is a subject of considerable interest to policymakers given that improved market performance for agricultural commodities promotes market development and maximization of social welfare. In northern South Africa, where tomato production dominates the country, studies exist on the general production, marketing, and consumption of fresh produce. However, the literature lacks an analytical component that is pertinent to the mechanism of price transmission and vertical linkages among successive marketing stages of tomato. This study employs the Houck approach and Error Correction modeling technique in an attempt to examine price transmission in South Africa's tomato markets. The results indicate a symmetric adjustment to price signals between farm and wholesale levels and an asymmetric adjustment between farm and retail levels. Even so, there is scope for ameliorating the effectiveness and efficiency of fresh produce markets in South Africa.				kudzaimandizvidza@outlook.com					Abdulai A, 2000, J DEV ECON, V63, P327, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(00)00115-2; Abidoye B.

J	Nyabaro, V; Mburu, J; Hutchinson, M				Nyabaro, Violet; Mburu, John; Hutchinson, Margaret			Factors influencing gendered intra-household allocation of land and capital assets in banana (Musa spp.) production: The case of Meru County, Kenya	TROPICAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Banana; capital assets; gender; land; intra-household allocation; Kenya; Meru County		Unequal access to agricultural resources such as land, labour and capital has driven women to less rewarding roles along the banana value chain while allowing men to take up the (dominant) management roles. This study seeks to determine factors that influence gendered intra-household resource allocation in banana production in Meru County in Kenya. Currently, intra-household distribution of land and capital assets for banana production in the study area is skewed towards married men. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 160 household respondents in March 2017. A fractional logit model was used to determine the effects of independent variables on the proportions of land and capital assets allocated jointly or to husbands or to wives. The value of livestock owned by the household emerged as one of the key factors that favoured `joint' allocation of land (p < 10%) while the variable 'age of the wife' reduced the likelihood of a 'husband' (p < 5%) being allocated land in banana production. The results also show that the key driver for 'wife' allocation with both land and capital assets is education of wives (significant at p < 5% in both cases), a factor associated with the enhancement of the human capital of women, and thus their empowerment. For both land and capital assets, group membership reduced the likelihood of 'joint' allocation (significant at p < 5% in both cases). Thus, investments in social capital may not address the problem of unequal intra-household distribution of productive agricultural resources. To increase equity in intra-household distribution of land and capital assets in banana production in the study area, policy interventions needed include diversification of banana production into livestock keeping, and investment in the formal education of girls.

Perception of Maize Processors Towards Utilization of Maize Value Addition Techniques: Implications for Rural Entrepreneurship Development - A Study in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Maize; utilization; value addition; processors; perception		Purpose: Huge losses in maize production lead to reduction in farmers' income and food insecurity. However, it is expected that the value chain approach would provide processors with actionable methods capable of increasing productivity and income. However maize producers and processors in the study area are still faced with post-harvest wastages and limited products along maize value chain; Hence, the study. Research Method: The data for this study were gathered through an interview schedule from 120 maize processors in Nigeria. Appropriate descriptive and inferential statistical tools such as frequency counts, means, standard deviations chi-square and correlation analyses were used to analyze the data Findings: The results revealed that majority were female with the mean monthly income was (sic) 51,000.33. A total of 17 value addition techniques were identified and indigenous ones include pap making (39.5%) and solid gel making (32.5%). Majority were small scale local processors producing for their immediate communities and where almost equal numbers of processors were operating either on part time or fill time basis. 56.7% had a favorable perception towards the utilization of maize value addition techniques. Sex and occupation had a significant association while years of schooling and income had significant relationships with the perception towards the utilization of maize value addition. Research limitations: The study was limited in that it did not cover all the geographical zones in Nigeria since there was no grant to support the research. Originality/value: The study identified different maize value addition techniques utilized by the processors and the characteristics of the enterprise in the study area.	[Alabi, D. L.; Akintola, O.

THE LINKAGE OF THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ALGERIA'S NATURAL GAS WITH THAT OF THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN REGION. A METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH	REVISTA UNISCI			English	Article						Algeria; Western Mediterranean; natural gas; energy; regional integration; global value chain; global commodity chain; rentier state	GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS; INTEGRATION; GOVERNANCE; SECTOR; CURSE	There is a chronological parallelism between the surge of the natural gas sector in the Western Mediterranean and the setting up of the post-colonial Algerian economy in the early 1970s, which has led to the accretion of a series of cross-border and regional relationships of dependency. Because of Algeria's overwhelming financial dependence on hydrocarbon resources (via economic rents), any attempt to modify the power relationship within its regional gas chain would immediately alter the way its political economy functions. This article presents a first outline of a methodological proposal aimed at analysing how the integration of the Algerian gas sector into regional gas chains in the Western Mediterranean affects the internal functioning of a rentier economy such as Algeria. By exploring the literature that helps capturing the relational effect between the Algerian domestic economy and the regional gas & oil structure of governance, the article suggests some analytical tools with the aim to evaluate the capacity of power and influence of each of the agents involved in the energy chain, from both Algeria and the other countries in the region.

J	Chand, A				Chand, Anand			Expanding Gouldner's Theory of Patterns of Industrial Bureaucracy: Looking Back and Moving Forward	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						Developing countries; Gouldner's Patterns of Bureaucracy; Mock State Bureaucracy; State-Employer Collusion	COMMODITY CHAIN	Although there is adequate literature on the topic of state-employer collusion, this literature is barely underpinned in any theoretical framework. This article attempts to fill this theoretical lacuna by revisiting Gouldner's (Patterns of industrial bureaucracy: a case study of modern factory administration, The Free Press, New York, 1954a) pioneering theoretical framework on patterns of bureaucracy, and extends his concept of mock bureaucracy to develop a new concept called 'mock state bureaucracy' to illustrate state-employer collusion in controlling workers in plants in developing third world economies. The article revisits and extends Gouldner's (1954a) unit of analysis from the 'firm' level to the 'state' level and argues that the new concept mock state bureaucracy provides a better illustration of the state-employer collusion. The article argues that both 'state' and 'employer' are important units of analysis and they should be brought back to the centre stage of any discourse on employment relations of developing countries.

It is observed that many of these residues do not return to the value chain, due to the lack of incentive policies or laws that punishes the transgressors, or the lack of initiative of the companies in the sector. Given the importance of the topic, the number of studies in the sector is considered low. On this, the present work seeks to contribute to the theme of reverse logistics, increasing studies in the specific area of civil construction. Therefore, the work theme is: Reverse Logistics for the environmentally correct destination of solid waste generated by construction. The research has as general objective the mapping of the stages and activities of the return cycle for the reuse or the final destination environmentally correct of the Construction and Demolition waste, identifying the companies involved in this reverse channel. This project is an applied research, with a qualitative research approach, of an exploratory nature and with an experimental field study. The research method was a bibliographical and documentary research, with a single case study, done in the field with a medium sized company responsible for the construction at UFABC. However, the study was done with information from another site, as it had a sustainable construction certification. The instrument of data collection was a semi-structured questionnaire and the sources for the research were personal interviews and analysis of reports and documents.

J	Segura, EA; Martinez, MDV				Abad Segura, Emilio; Valls Martinez, Maria del Carmen			Strategic analysis of Ethical Banking in Spain through Triodos Bank. Financing social and environmental projects	CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA			Spanish	Article						Ethical Finance; Socially Responsible Investment; Social Bank; Strategic Plan; Triodos Bank		Objectives Banking with ethical values appears as an alternative to traditional banking, answering the need of integrating ethics with entrepreneurial activity, prioritising the social commitment face to the economical profitability. In this sense, ethical banking limits the credit to non-socially responsible projects and it provides financing to vulnerable groups and investment with a positive environmental and social impact, at the same time that all its activities are transparent. The objective of this paper is to study the origin and features of the ethical banking, establishing the main differences with the traditional model, to analyse its implantation in Spain and to review the conditions and initiatives that Triodos Bank makes to position itself as the leader bank with ethical values. Methodology The implantation level and development of the ethical financial companies in Spain ( Triodos Bank Espana, Fiare Banca Etica, Coop 57, Oikocredit Espana, etc.) has been analysed through the data of its financial statements. However, in order to study the Triodos Bank's corporate strategy, an external and internal analyse has been made. In this sense, the PESTEL analysis, which studies the Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Ecological and Legal factors that set up the environment and how they can affect the activity, is used to identify the factors of the general environment that influences the financial company's strategical position. Regarding to the competitive environment, the Porter's "Five Forces" model has been analysed, its main competitors have been differentiated, as well as its main threats and opportunities. In order to do the internal analysis, four models have been used in the entrepreneurial scope: first, the weaknesses and strengths found in Triodos have been determined; second, the resources that contribute a competitive advantage according to the VRIO model, have been analysed; third, the "Value chain" described by Porter for the company, which describes the development of the activities performed by the bank to create value for the customer, is studied; and, finally, the Triodos Bank's organizational structure and the social and environmental data, are analysed. Results The ethical banking's customers belong to groups with a high social commitment, who need to know the destiny of their savings. In the same way that it has happened in traditional financial companies, since the beginning of the crisis in the ethical institutions (Triodos Bank Espana, Fiare Banca Etica, Coop 57, Oikocredit Espana, etc.) the capital destined to the loan transactions was overcome by the bank customers' savings; the trend has been increasing and it is remarkable that in 2016 the savings almost doubled the capital given in loans. The increase experienced by the ethical banking is also reflected in the 48.26% increase in the number of customers and users from 2013 to 2016, and in its amount of capital, which was almost 171 million euros in 2016, and all of this with a low rate of defaulting. Regarding to Triodos, whose beginning in Spain is in 1998, even though it was in 2004 when it was converted into Triodos Bank Espana, the assets managed were 13,454 million euros in 2016, with a 9.40% annual increase. Regarding the sustainable sectors that are financed by Triodos, and knowing that the aim is to allocate to credit between 65% and 75% of own funds, it is remarkable environment (38%), social (24%), culture and leisure (14%), and loans given to people, city councils and sustainable residential mortgages (24%). The Triodos Bank's strategic analysis shows that the distrust created by the non-ethical political practices has led to rules that search for the transparency of the financial system; moreover, the traditional banking's abusive practices have originated the demand of ethical products and companies by society. Likewise, the banking's development through the Internet and the mobile apps have implied the disappearance of regular offices. However, the threat of new financial companies in the sector of ethical finance is a reality, since the absence of a strict regulation for the ethical banking provokes that several traditional companies offer their saving and credit products under the name of sustainable, and this confuses customers. Nevertheless, Triodos is a European consolidated bank, it has a bigger infrastructure that its ethical competitors, it is a financially healthy company, with trained personal and it provides all kinds of financial products and services, what allows it to be competitive to face traditional banking. The model VRIO notes that a resource provides a competitive advantage if it has the attributes: valuable (V), rare or scarce (R), inimitable (I) and related to the organisation of the enterprise (O). If it is applied to Triodos Bank, we can be sure that human resources (staff who is trained and with experience in the banking sector) and the intangible resources (solid image of a financial group with a successful trajectory) are a sustainable competitive advantage, while the tangible resources (branch network) and the client portfolio which share the company values, suppose a competitive parity with the rest of banking companies. The Triodos' organizational structure, which is different from other financial companies and it is based in the Triodos' Foundation for the Administration of the Shares, allows it to have control of the decision making and not to be subjected to the shareholder's power, assuring the fulfilment of the ethical values. On the other hand, the success of the implantation of Triodos depends to a great extent on the workers in the company, who have to be qualified and motivated with the mission and have to be able to put it in practice daily in the development of their work. The company has the commitment to invest an important amount of resources in training programs and professional development, with the purpose of training its workers. In this sense, the average expense in training by worker in 2016 was 1,731 euros. Practical conclusions and original value The inclusion of the ethical banking model in Spain is relatively recent; in fact, no companies like this have been created in the Spanish financial system as of yet. Up to now, the rule has been to stablish branch offices, following the model applied in other countries by consolidated companies, like Triodos Bank and Fiare Banca Etica, and to act according to the lines of financing that lead to the development of sustainable projects, sharing actively this banking business segment with financial companies which are called traditional banking, like BBVA, CaixaBank and Banco Santander. This sector may become saturated and, somehow, dilute efforts to ensure that the perception of society is based on a business model that includes social, environmental, cultural and economic results. The cooperatives that trade ethical saving and financing products, like Oikocredit and Coop57, also have an important role to establish and consolidate an ethical finance model, though more residual. Ethical banking in order not to be a mere illusion associated with financial crisis periods and to become definitely in a consistent alternative, it should offer services and products similarly to the conventional banking and an economic and social profitability to contribute to their credibility and a clear differentiation in equality of conditions with the traditional banking. This paper provides a strategic analysis without precedents about ethical banking in Spain, focused on Triodos, which is the leader ethical banking company. Traditional methodologies of external and internal analysis have been applied to this newly created sector providing useful information to its future implantation, as the strengths and weaknesses of this sector have been shown.

The electronics industry is a characteristic example of a globally integrated activity that has shaped an ecosystem of increasing complexity. Using a methodology based on input-output tables, we infer the essence of the changes experienced in the international organization of production, taking into account the geographical and factorial distribution of the value generated by each member in every stage of the production and distribution processes. On the one hand, it is confirmed that the degree of outsourcing has increased. On the other, that the East Asian pole organized around China has become the main source of value for the industry, with an increasing interaction on a global scale. Finally, it reveals a process of intense factorial substitution in favour of capital and high-skilled labour.

J	Reviron, S; Python, P				Reviron, Sophie; Python, Pascal			Analysis of value distribution in the dairy sector	AGRARFORSCHUNG SCHWEIZ			German	Article						value chain; governance structure; fair price; differentiation		The price of milk delivered to industry by dairy farmers has been steadily decreasing over the last 10 years. In response to this situation, a study on value distribution in the Swiss agro-food supply chains has analyzed the situation and suggests concrete measures to improve the financial return to farmers. Across all agricultural sectors, prices paid to farmers differ greatly depending on various factors including the sales channels employed, product differentiation as perceived by both consumers and retailers, and the governance structure between the farmer and buyer. Furthermore, the rules for determining profit margins employed by supermarkets and milk processors are not transparent. This asymmetry of information reduces the farmers' negotiating power. The more successful farmers and processors are able to differentiate their products and convince consumers to pay more, the higher their share of the price levied by retailers. In addition, other issues such as production surpluses and low value-added products weigh on the overall value of the sector. The study also highlights the impact of the choice of the governance structure on the return of value to farmers. Consumer demand for fair prices for farmers is increasing and may soon have a significant impact on the reputation of processors and retailers leading them to incorporate fair pricing policies into their performance criteria.

Role of Dairy Cooperatives in Strengthening Value Chain of Liquid Milk and its Sustainability in Karnataka: Findings from Preliminary Study	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Chain-wide learning; dairy stakeholders; dairy value chain; liquid milk; sustainability		Cooperatives play an important role in achieving and strengthening the sustainability of dairy value chain. In developing countries like India most of the small, marginal and landless farmers are engaged in dairying for their livelihood and hence there is a dire need to strengthen the milk value chain for effective and efficient performance. The present study has been carried out in Bengaluru rural district of Karnataka to analyze the existing scenario of value chain in liquid milk for suggesting policy interventions to strengthen and sustain its performance. Chain wide learning indicated the importance of dairy cooperatives in providing inputs and technical services to farmers as well as integrating production to processing. The study documented the strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats for chain actors and finally concluded that synergy between the stakeholders right from input supply to distribution with cooperatives as chain leader will improve the performance and sustainability.

J	Odmell, C; Mamimine, PW; Kudakwashe, C				Odmell, Chipungu; Mamimine, Patrick Walter; Kudakwashe, Chitindingu			A situational analysis of health tourism for appropriation of indigenous herbal sexual stimulants and fertility enhancers in Zimbabwe: A situational analysis paper	COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						health tourism; authenticity; appropriation; fertility enhancers; sexual stimulants; value chain	MEDICINAL-PLANTS; ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION; AUTHENTICITY; MANAGEMENT; INJURY	In Zimbabwe, health tourism for the sake of gaining access to herbal substances for sexual and fertility enhancement remains both undocumented and shrouded in myths. The significance of indigenous herbal medicine practice in stimulating medical tourism growth has remained understudied, undervalued and unappreciated. Seemingly, research has paid very little attention to this branch of health tourism based on traditional medical practice. The pharmacological properties of the various indigenous herbal medicine prescribed, dispensed and consumed under health tourism remains scientifically unassessed and not much is known about the nature of the tourist traffic whose main purpose of travel is the consumption of these indigenous herbal substances for sexual stimulation and/or fertility enhancement. As a result the commercial potential of indigenous sexual stimulants and fertility enhancement herbs remains uncharted both for health tourism and the health sector in general in Zimbabwe. This situational analysis paper sought to clarify the knowledge on the medical tourism market place concerning indigenous herbal medicine for sexual stimulants and/or fertility enhancers. The paper also maps out what has been achieved within the herbal medical tourism industry. Specifically the paper explores the medical tourism entrepreneurial potential and highlights the knowledge gap concerning herbal medicine and health tourism development based on these traditional herbal medicines and highlight areas for further research.

J	Borrelli, IP				Borrelli, Irene Paola			AGRICULTURE AND CIRCULAR PARADIGM: A CASE STUDY	QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS			English	Article						Agriculture; circular economy; circular paradigm; case study; winery; Tuscany Region		In recent years we are witnessing the development and dissemination of the concept of circular economy that is now recognized internationally as the paradigm of development for a sustainable future. Being able to create a circular economy means assuming its principles at all stages of the value chain, which inevitably requires a rereading according to the specifics of the sector considered. Agriculture is not exempt from this commitment, the need to reflect on how the principles of the circular economy are integrated into the work of agri-food companies is clear. In other words, it is important to question the concrete actions to demonstrate the commitment to achieve a "circular paradigm". In this regard, a case study was carried out aimed at verifying the compatibility of the entrepreneurial strategies of some Tuscany region winemaking enterprises with the principles of the circular economy. In particular, in this first experiment, it was decided to pay attention to the principle of "renewability" in quantity and quality of capital stocks, considering it the one with greater connections to the sustainability of well-being.

In this regard, we theorize, and propose, budgeting at the transaction-cycle level for effective budget designs. The transaction-cycle level budget requires management justification for resource assignment to business processes, often spanning multiple departments. The transaction-cycle typology consists of five cycles: production, expenditure, financial, revenue, and human-resources. In order to distinguish among transaction cycles, we use their relative positions within the value chain and technology content in their business processes. As a proof-of-concept, we develop theoretical arguments for asymmetric ratcheting in operating budgets at the transaction-cycle level in hospitals, and empirically examine this phenomenon using longitudinal archival data. Our hypotheses examine budgetary responses to overspending and underspending variances in operating budgets for fixed and variable costs. Our findings suggest that a transaction cycle's position in the value chain and its technology content play a role in determining asymmetric ratcheting during budgeting. We discuss our contributions from the perspectives of theory and practice of accounting, budgeting, and accounting information systems.

J	Jajja, MSS; Hassan, SZ				Jajja, M. Shakeel S.; Hassan, Syed Zahoor			SIL: Value Chain and Strategic Choices	ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CASES			English	Article						Manufacturing; revenue; quality		Prior to 2011, Service Industries Limited's (SIL) production for the Pakistani market was sold through the marketing and retailing network of Service Sales Corporation (SSC), as both SIL and SSC were owned by the Service Group. However, in 2011, the companies parted ways based on two main conditions. First, SSC would continue to buy shoes worth at least PKR 3.8 billion from SIL till 2021. Second, SIL would give exclusive license to SSC to use Servis brand for the shoe business till 2021. Omar Saeed, CEO of SIL, is reflecting on the previous four years' performance for the shoe business division. It has not met the sales target for 2014, domestic sales are dependant on SSC and Klara (SIL's own brand of wholesale), the European market is presurizing SIL to reduce prices as well as provide high variety and low volume orders, and more efforts need to be made to utilize SIL's manufacturing facilities. Omar has to make SIL's strategy for 2021, when SSC may not be there to give business worth PKR 3.8 billion, as well as plan the necessary roadmap. SIL's top management wants to see SIL as a global player in its line of business.	[Jajja, M.

Benchmarking cane supply quality in the Herbert, Burdekin, Proserpine and Plane-Creerk regions [in Australia]	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Conference of the Australian-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists (ASSCT)	MAY 03-05, 2017	Cairns, AUSTRALIA	Australian Soc Sugar Cane Technologists		extraneous matter; damaged; mutilated; billets; survey; benchmark		A survey of the quality of the cane delivered to the Herbert, Burdekin, Proserpine and Plane Creek regions was undertaken in 2015 to assess the quantity of extraneous matter (viz. dirt and roots, trash and tops) in the cane supply, as well as measure billet length and quality (viz. sound, damaged and mutilated). Extraneous matter was between 5.4% and 32.7% of the cane supply in the Herbert, Proserpine and Plane Creek regions and between 3.6% and 12.0% of the cane supply in the Burdekin. Tops were between 36% and 55% of the median extraneous matter in the cane supply and it was evident that harvesters are routinely not topping cane, even when it is erect. Billet length has continued to decrease since the early 2000s and it was estimated that 21%, 15%, 9% and 20% of the harvesters in the Herbert, Burdekin, Proserpine and Plane Creek, respectively, had installed 10-blade chopper systems, while at least 2 harvesters in the Burdekin have 12-blade chopper systems that produce a billet that is around 126 mm long. Median billet length was between 13-20 mm shorter than that expected from a harvester with an optimised 8-blade chopper system. It was estimated that approximately 93 900 tonnes of biomass, cane and juice, is lost during the billeting operations due to these harvesters not being optimised. It was further surmised that between 300 000 and 800 000 tonnes of cane is possibly being lost and not delivered to the mills, as shorter billets are more prone to loss in the extractor systems. Best fit regression models identified that dirt and roots, trash, tops, damaged billets and mutilated billets impact negatively on the CCS. Research is needed to quantify how these affect CCS and to develop strategies to assist harvester operators better harvest the cane crop to maximise the return to the entire value chain of the industry.

J	Singh, S				Singh, Surendra			Strategy, Current Activities and Future Prospect for Advancing Indian Agricultural Machinery into the African Market	AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA			English	Article								Africa is the world's second largest continent. It has the wide diversity across its different countries. A few are fairly well developed, but the majority is still developing. Within the continent, there is a noticeable difference in the degree of agricultural development between Africa and North Africa. India-Africa partnership for overall growth of the agriculture sector is moving towards one common goal-food security, and both economies have been flexible in their approach towards achieving the same. Therefore, there exists significant potential for both India and Africa to explore and leverage from various agricultural technologies that have been successful in increasing the productivity of small-scale farming. With Africa's economic growth gaining momentum, now is the time to evolve and collaborate for the agriculture sector to develop as a whole. The major innovations that can help increasing productivity include mechanical innovations such as the development of new seed varieties; fertilizer/pesticides; agronomic innovations, for examples, novel agricultural management practices such as no-till/zero-till agriculture and inter-cropping. To help crop yield and achieve the larger goal of food security, interventions from all value chain stakeholders are required. For instance farm input manufacturer needs to develop appropriate tools and technologies to better respond to diverse soil and changing climate types, whereas investments in processing infrastructure are required to reduce post-harvest losses. The African governments should have Policies and Regulations for better mechanization options that is to create conducive environment for successful agricultural mechanization, remove restrictions to choice, leasing or credit programmes for imported machinery as well as locally produced machines, support information for better decision making by farmers, legislation for safe, durable and reliable machinery and equipment. Increasing land and labour productivity should be adhering too as agricultural productivity is positively correlated with farm power. Conservation agriculture (no-till/reduced-till, permanent organic soil cover, crop rotations), multi-cropping, precision agriculture, controlled traffic farming and permanent raised beds with residue retention are some of the priority area for sustainable agriculture. The Policy priorities should be to enhance mechanization demand, stabilizing mechanization supply, strengthening institutions needed for mechanization development, Private-Public Partnerships for mechanization development, integrate mechanization and good agronomic practices for environmental sustainability and special focus on increasing agricultural mechanization among smallholders.

J	Singh, S; Kumar, R				Singh, Sushmita; Kumar, Raj			Handloom Entrepreneurship & Government Intervention-A Case Study of Varanasi	PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Entrepreneurship; handloom industry; bootstrapping; marketing; master weavers; government schemes	DEINDUSTRIALIZATION; INDIA	Handloom weaving is an age old craft which is passed from one generation to another as a family legacy which makes it like family business but lack of proper management skills such entrepreneurial skills this profession is not getting its due recognition resulting in a situation where this art is almost on the verge of extinction. But the younger generation is not very keen to continue this family occupation due to lack of recognition, low wages, poor working conditions and difficulty in raw material procurement and selling of finished products. And also they face stiff competition from power loom which can easily imitate the design and can make the same design in less time. Weavers need to be enabled to interpret designs and technical advancements, convert them into final product within stipulated time. Here comes the importance of entrepreneurial skills. The modus operandi in handloom market has three important pillars namely individual weavers, Master Weavers(Grihastha) & Gaddidars(Mahajan). The individual weavers work under master weavers who owns the paraphernalia for weaving but depends on Gaddidars for the sale of the of the goods. These gaddidars act as the middlemen and take up the profit by making a markup of 50% and then big retailers again make 50% markup on that which makes the price almost 100% more than the original price. This paper mainly focuses on the working model of entrepreneurs in handloom sector of Varanasi, here it refers to the master weavers. These weavers manage to keep themselves relevant and are able to create a market for themselves in spite of this sector being low technology driven. The entrepreneurial functioning in this sector is quiet an interesting thing. Government also is working tirelessly in promoting this sector, by implementing various schemes for benefit of weavers. The handloom products have their uniqueness in terms of their sophisticated designs. The master weavers often get an advantage by maintaining a low transaction cost and social capital. This paper will outline the working model of entrepreneurs/master weavers and will also give an insight to the interventions of the government which will act as a catalyst to promote entrepreneurial functioning in individual weavers. The Government intervention through various schemes will help in educating weavers about technical as well as managerial matters and enable young weavers to enhance Entrepreneurship, Management and Computer skills and sensitize them on issues of Quality Control, Packaging, Zero defect and Zero effect apart from some component of technical knowledge so that they successfully emerge as Handloom Entrepreneurs. This effort is quiet apparent due to launch of BRAND HANDLOOM and providing e-commerce platform for the handloom products in collaboration with flipkart. Introduction of various courses in institutions such as IIHT is also a favorable step in this area. This paper will describe in detail about already existing model of entrepreneurship and efforts generated by the government in this direction. The main objective is to highlight the functioning & relevance of master weavers and their roles in value chain of handloom weaving, along with importance of government interventions which bases it schemes more or less on functioning of master weavers.

J	Hsiao, CM; Lai, PR; Sun, LY; Tsai, YJ				Hsiao, Chiu-Ming; Lai Pin-Reuy; Sun Li-Yun; Tsai Yun-Jean			The location advantages and persistence of the performance for the Taiwan logistic company: A case study	COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						performance persistence; location advantage; supply chain management; Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests; big data analysis	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; MUTUAL FUND PERFORMANCE; GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN; STOCK-PRICES; HOT HAND; BIG DATA; SELECTION; INFORMATION; DECISION; EARNINGS	This study empirically analyzes the persistence of the performance for the Taiwanese logistic company. It is the first study to address the hot hand effect on the performance of logistic stations. Generally, the well-performed stations (Winner) will still have a better performance in the following period; the poor-performed stations (Loser) will stay in the worst group. Moreover, we find there is a strong evidence of location advantage for the business stations which supports the discussion of Hernandez and Pedersen. It reveals that a non-metropolitan station is well performed rather than the metropolitan station. Either to increase the number of cargo or to decrease the number of workers will promote the performance of the company. Our empirical results can also be extended to the logistic companies in the emerging markets and transition economies. Policy-makers can provide some incentives to make the logistics industry more vigorous development and create economic prosperity.

J	Adekunle, IA; Farinde, AJ				Adekunle, Ibrahim Adebayo; Farinde, Akinloye Jimoh			EFFECT OF LINKAGES AND NETWORKING ON ROLE PERFORMANCE OF STAKEHOLDERS IN CASSAVA RESEARCH OUTPUT UPTAKE IN OYO STATE, NIGERIA	SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						role performance; stakeholders; research output uptake and linkages		Agricultural research outputs are useless until they are picked up by end users, adapted and or utilised for solving social, economic and environmental problems thus bringing about sustainable development. This study assessed the effects of linkages on roles of stakeholders in cassava research output uptake in Oyo State, Nigeria. It specifically described the cassava stakeholders' characteristics, identified the roles performed by stakeholders in relation to the linkages used for networking in the cassava research output uptake process in Oyo State, Nigeria. Multistage sampling procedure was employed to select respondents. Stakeholders were purposively selected along cassava value chain. Only 40 percent of the stakeholders were proportionately selected based on numerical strength in the State. They include research scientists, agricultural extension agents, agricultural input suppliers, cassava farmers, cassava produce processors, cassava produce marketers and three policy makers/legislators.. Data were collected using questionnaire. Data were analyzed with appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics. The results show that the mean age of all the stakeholders along the cassava value chain was 50.04 +/- 5.07 years and mean years of experience was 16.76 +/- 6.91years. All the cassava stakeholders had at least 50 percent of their expected roles performed above their grand mean score. All the cassava stakeholders make use of agricultural shows/exhibitions and informal contact as major linkages to facilitate uptake of cassava research outputs. In conclusion, there exists a positive and significant effect and relationship between the role performance of stakeholders and the linkages used to transfer the cassava research output (r=0.755).

J	Adewole, S; Omeye, A				Adewole, Similoluwa; Omeye, Akinwunmi			EFFECTS OF FINANCING ON CASSAVA VALUE CHAIN IN OWO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, ONDO STATE, NIGERIA	SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						actors; segments; Cassava; credit; value chain		The study examined the effects of finance on cassava value chain actors in Owo Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria. Primary data was collected through the aid of structured questionnaire and interview format. Ninety four respondents were interviewed from the study area, consisting of farmers, processors and marketers of cassava and cassava products. Descriptive, financial and regression analysis was carried out on the data collected. Results showed that the majority of the respondents were aged between 36 and 45 years and were married. It also revealed that men are more involved in cassava cultivation and processing while women are more involved in marketing of cassava products. Findings also revealed that cassava value chain actors had some formal education. Fifty Nine (59%) percent of respondents interviewed had no access to formal credit at all while 41% have access to formal credit for cassava farming. Also, 86% of respondents interviewed farmed cassava with their own capital alone while 14% respondents farm using credit from various sources. Inadequate access to credit, high interest rate and fragmentation of farm holdings accounted for this. It also revealed that 45% have access to credit through micro finance banks, 32.5% through farmers union and 22.5% through "aajo" (Daily contribution). The regression result indicated an R-2 value of 0.988 for farmers, 0.959 for marketers and 0.967 for processors. It was revealed that the major factors that influence the level of profitability of the respondents in the study area are age, level of education, years of experience, access to capital while source of capital and technology used by processor increased the level of profitability.

Gender dimensions in the local chicken value chain in northern Uganda	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						gender; gross margin; local chicken; participation; Uganda; value chain	MARKET PARTICIPATION; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; FOOD SECURITY; POULTRY	The study was conducted to explore gender dimensions in the local chicken value chain in northern Uganda. Specifically, it focused on characterizing local chicken value chain actors, ascertaining level and determinants of gender participation as well as relationships between gender, access and control over income from local chicken enterprises. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaires administered in a cross-sectional survey of 200 randomly selected local chicken value chain actors. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 10 and StataSE 13 software from which simplified gross margins, descriptive statistics, correlations and a Logit regression model were estimated. Results revealed that majority of value chain actors were aged 20-48 years and males were dominant across most segments in the value chain. Men participated more in input supply, house construction, marketing and barbequing while women participated in production and stewing local chickens. Among actors, processors (UGX 1,911,274) and farmers (UGX 159,691) had the highest and least annual gross margin respectively. The Logit model revealed that age, education level, marital status and income control positively influenced (Pr=0.00) gender participation. Men had more control over income than women. An engendered innovation platform could be established for training and empowerment of local chicken value chain actors.	[Akite, I.; Aryemo, I. P.; Kule, E.

S	Gardetti, MA		Gardetti, MA; Muthu, SS		Angel Gardetti, Miguel			Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Luxury: The Case of ANTHYIA	SUSTAINABLE LUXURY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND INNOVATION	Environmental Footprints and Eco-design of Products and Processes		English	Article; Book Chapter						Luxury; Sustainable luxury; Anthyia; Entrepreneurship, innovation, Ramie, sustainable value creation		Sustainable luxury not only requires social and environmental performance of real excellence throughout the value chain in organisations but also, local cultural contents such as the craftsmanship and local innovation. Today brands that will be considered luxury labels in the future are being created through innovation and entrepreneurship. More than simply observing reduced negative impacts of operations, entrepreneurs and innovators seek to solve social and environmental problems through the development or acquisition of new capabilities that are directly related to the challenge of sustainability. Anthyia is an organisation created by Ying Luo and Nicolai Nielsen. This company is a pioneer in the use of Ramie, a vegetable fibre from China. While it was founded in 2011 in the United States, it currently operates in Germany. This paper studies Anthya from the model of sustainable value creation developed by Professor Stuart L. Hart that integrates the environment, innovation, stakeholder management and potential for growth. Anthyia is focused on Ying's personal values and beliefs and on innovation. Ying and her partners develop the abilities that enable to position (and reposition) the firm for the future. Sustainable competences arising from ramie research is the key to the company's value creation. Anthyia is the combination of Ying's personal values and the Eastern perspective of ramie in a continuous creativity and innovation process. This is essential for the company's long-term existence and, since it is a dynamic concept, it requires managerial and organisational leadership that are typical of both Ying and Anthyia.

Some frameworks have begun to identify sets of requirements for pro-nutrition value chains. Pakistan's dairy sector has been the focus of a business-driven innovation which introduced ultra-high temperature (UHT)-treated milk in aseptic packaging. This was expected to relieve existing constraints in production and distribution, raise incomes for producers, and increase the supply of an affordable nutrient-dense food to consumers. While this innovation appeared to fulfil most requirements of a pro-nutrition value chain, it ultimately failed to act as a bridge between farmers and consumers. Instead, it led to the introduction of non-dairy products and imported raw materials. This case study shows that while existing frameworks take a relatively static view of whether an innovation prospectively fulfils certain requirements, businesses can quickly alter entire value chains in response to market conditions.

A brief description of the main argument, the establishment of an Entrepreneurial University, will enable a better understanding of its complex structure and will provide an insight into the mutual interdepen-dencies in the spin-off value chain. Research-intensive spin-offs generated by universities and research centers are one of the most important innovation motors and the vehicle for disruptive innovations. The large number of scientific results and inventions that frequently remain passive assets of the universities in the form of intellectual properties, could create an enormous potential for starting successful and sustainable enterprises. Besides creating new ideas and innovations, a key factor for success is an appropriate institutional framework along the whole spin-off value chain. A permanent and sustainable Entrepreneurship Culture requires a holistic Entrepreneurship Governance throughout the entire transformation process, from research to the marketable product. In the following chapter the authors will analyze the concept of the Entrepreneurial University and describe the characteristics of Entrepreneurship Governance which may accelerate the process of knowledge-based spin-offs in the universities and research centers. The authors will rely on empirical findings in leading entrepreneurial universities and show how an overall entrepreneurship institutional framework may function. In a next step institutional requirements for each stage of entrepreneurship process will be discussed and the determining factors will be described.

This method leads to the definition of the strategic vision of the intermediary, including its value proposition and its required competencies, assuming that actors in the value chain are prepared to revise their business approach to enable effective collaboration and knowledge sharing. The method is used to support management of public forests in the Province of Quebec, in Eastern Canada. Basically, the intermediary, referred to as the integrator-supplier (IS) in the application case, enables several stakeholders, including the government, the forest industry, regional authorities, recreation organizations, and First Nations, to communicate, to set compatible goals, and to synchronize their activities. These activities and interactions must all be effectively carried out to maximize the overall benefits of forest management. Three critical issues for successful development of the IS are identified. The results present functional descriptions of seven development scenarios for effective use of intermediation in forest value chains.

Then, the product-specific value chain allocation leading to the maximum net return on sales could be found. Based on a model including the current determining factors of the profit taxes, tariffs and value added taxes, the calculation of the optimal allocation of the production is shown. Noteworthy, the effects of taxes and tariffs can either compensate or intensify each other. The opposite interests of the authorities responsible for taxes and tariffs can lead to a significant additional burden.

J	Barnreuther, S				Baernreuther, Sandra			From Urine in India to Ampoules in Europe: The Relational Infrastructure of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ETHNOLOGIE			English	Article						pharmaceuticals; hormones; urine; relational infrastructure; valuation; commodity chains; reproductive medicine; India		From urine in India to ampoules in Europe describes the commodity chain of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) between the 1960s and 1990s. The transfiguration of hCG from an impotent waste product in India to a prized pharmaceutical in Europe was made possible by promises of productivity. These promises mobilized a gendered, classed, and racialized relational infrastructure that made the fertility of the urban poor in Kolkata available and valuable for reproductive medicine in the global North. Traces of these relations, however, were obscured by framing transactions as donations, providing return gifts, and declaring urine as raw material. In this article, I make hCG's relational infrastructure legible. Showing how the pharmaceutical has come into being through manifold relations, allows me to analyze processes of valuation that go beyond biological extraction and chemical metamorphosis.

J	Brar, RS; Kaur, I; Singh, VP; Chopra, S				Brar, Ravneet Singh; Kaur, Inderpreet; Singh, Varinder Pal; Chopra, Shruti			Analysis of factors influencing choice of milk marketing channel among small and medium dairy farmers in Punjab	INDIAN JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Binomial logit; Medium farmers; Milk marketing channels; Punjab; Small dairy farmers	ADOPTION	Dairy sector in Punjab has emerged as most crucial auxiliary for diversification of agriculture. Dairying alone contributes about 85 per cent to the livestock sector in Punjab (2010-11). More than 70 per cent of milk production and marketed milk are contributed by small and medium farmers, which make them an indispensible part of milk production system. There is a dire need of gradual morphing of milk marketing channel from unorganized to the organized sector that would provide basis for a more inclusive growth for all categories of dairy farmers and simultaneously ensure disposal of quality raw milk and processed dairy products for the end user. Present study unravels the factors influencing the choice of marketing channel by small and medium sized dairy farmers in Punjab. The results of the binomial logit regression model revealed that age of the household and distance to selling point has negatively influenced the producers' likelihood towards organized sector. Other factors influencing the choice were found to be total milch animal holding, price of milk sold and availability of advances. Study clearly indicates the need to strengthen collection of milk, promotion of liberal loans, remunerative prices and lesser intermediaries in milk value chain for growth and expansion of dairy business in Punjab.

J	Bulkini, A; Satria, A; Mulyati, H				Bulkini, Asep; Satria, Arif; Mulyati, Heti			ANALYSIS OF THE CATFISH (Clarias sp.) VALUE CHAIN AND ITS PROBLEMS IN BOGOR, INDONESIA	INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION			English	Article						value chain; catfish; farmers		Catfish is one of the leading freshwater commodities stipulated by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) of the Republic of Indonesia. The annual production target of catfish continues to increase every year. This study aims to analyze the actors and the value chain map of catfish, problems in the value chain of catfish, and the strategies to improve the value chain. This research was conducted by survey method using questionnaire instrument. The survey was done by using purposive sampling technique to 23 catfish farmers, 7 catfish wholesalers, 5 catfish retailers, and 5 catfish processors in Bogor Regency. In this study, there are 4 channels of the value chain of catfish from the production to the consumer. The four actors who are involved in the value chain, namely farmer, wholesaler, retailer, and processor. The constraints along the value chain consist of three aspects: pre-production, production, and post-harvest. Pre-production problems include the quality of seeds, high price of feed, and lack of capital. Problems on production are the weather, fish mortality, and social security. Problems facing post-production cover price instability and lack of bargaining power of farmers. Proposed up-grading strategies to improve the competitiveness are strengthening partnership among farmers, strengthening partnerships between farmers and other strategic partners (traders, and feed companies).

J	Davis, AE				Davis, Ann E.			Global Production Networks and the Private Organization of World Trade	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES			English	Article						corporation; financialization; global-value chains; supply chains; theory of the firm	CAPITALISM; VARIETIES; EVOLUTION; INDUSTRY; MODELS	As John R. Commons understood, the role of the firm in providing employment and income distribution is a form of public power (Munkirs and Knoedler 1987). This public power of firms is supported by the laws of the state, which protect private property and enforce market transactions. The Global Production Network (GPN) is a new form of the firm, influenced by information technology to lower "transaction costs" (Coase 1937), as well as international trade regimes, such as the Washington Consensus to improve the ease of world trade and investment. The GPN is globe-scanning, yet private and able to shape the economies and policies of countries. Under the banner of branded products, the lead firm in a supply chain exercises considerable power over subsidiaries, contractors, workers, communities, and countries. By influencing trade relations, GPNs also influence international finance, foreign currency reserves and exchange rates, as well as trade deficits and "race to the bottom" of taxes and environmental protection. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, this topic benefits from an alliance of sociology, business, history, law, and international as well as institutional economics in the AFEE tradition. I draw on the work of leading scholars in the field (Antras 2016; Baldwin 2016; Gereffi 2013; Milberg and Winkler 2013) and analyze the implications for the world trade system, as well as the ongoing political resistance to globalization. These GPNs are no longer "of" their country of origin (Tyson vs. Reich).

J	Diedhiou, SO; Sy, O; Margetic, C				Diedhiou, Secou Omar; Sy, Oumar; Margetic, Christine			Urban agriculture in Ziguinchor (Senegal): on-farm consumption practices supporting growth of sustainable urban supply chains	ESPACES-POPULATIONS-SOCIETES			French	Article						urban agriculture; female; self-consuming; food security; urbanization; Ziguinchor; Senegal		Located in south-western of Senegal, Ziguinchor is in Lower Casamance. Developed on a river site, it offers favorable ecological conditions to develop agricultural activities. However, this ecological advantages are affected by a population growth that generates some direct and indirect issues. This article examines the role of urban farmers in supplying the city by identifying the actors involved, the methods of access to land, their practices and the way in which agricultural activity contributes to securing their income. In the absence of official statistics, the latter authors' statement is confirmed in the city through a questionary methodology near 248 farmers and 130 vegetable traders in 2016 and 2017. The choice of Ziguinchor is relevant. The urban extension that goes back to the 1970s contributes both to the de-structuring of agricultural spaces and the stronger demand for foodstuffs, which grows as the municipal area has been enlarged (from 3 400 ha in 1972 to 4 450 ha since 2002). For farmers' perspectives, the challenge is twofold. The first challenge is to be able to maintain family self-consumption in rice, despite a retreat of arable land, while the second one is relay on generating income through the sale of vegetables for the purchase of food during the lean season. Unlike other cities in West Africa, women play a key role in the local agricultural value chain (i.e. from production to marketing) by combining several production sites: one site in home, in the shallows and other in the plateau. This combination of several production sites is fundamental not only for their own food security, but also for that of the city.

J	Dumolyn, J; Lambert, B				Dumolyn, Jan; Lambert, Bart			A Chemical Compound in a Capitalist Commodity Chain: The Production, Distribution and Industrial Use of Alum in the Mediterranean and the Textile Centers of the Low Countries (Thirteenth-Sixteenth Centuries)	JOURNAL OF EARLY MODERN HISTORY			English	Article						alum; commodity chain; capitalism; world system; Low Countries; Mediterranean; thirteenth century; fourteenth century; fifteenth century; sixteenth century		According to Immanuel Wallerstein, the sixteenth century saw the emergence of a capitalist world economy in which labor was organized on a global scale, and the production, distribution and use of goods and services were integrated across national boundaries. This article argues that, though exceptional, an integrated, hegemonic division of labor on an international scale did occur before 1500. Adopting one of Wallerstein's conceptual tools, the commodity chain approach, it analyzes the production, distribution and industrial use of alum, a chemical compound, from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. The high-quality cloth industry of the Low Countries, the most prominent artisanal sector of the period in Europe, strongly relied on alum as a mordant to fix colors. Yet the best varieties of alum could only be won in Asia Minor until the middle of the fifteenth century and in central Italy after 1450. The combination of the inflexible demand structure and the mineral's limited supply resulted in the creation of commodity chains that crossed national and even continental boundaries and allowed those in control of the alum mines to establish exactly those dependency relations that were particular to Wallerstein's world economy of the sixteenth century. If the aim is to study the conditions in which economic actors lived and worked and the ways in which they organized their labor, a focus on the production contexts of specific commodities, rather than on comprehensive world systems, might therefore be more revealing.

Design/methodology/approach The authors led a series of discussions to develop a CDVC specific to existing HIV/AIDS services in Northern Togo. Using the CDVC framework, 28 specific gaps in service delivery were identified and integrated into a strategic QI plan. Findings At 12 months, 92 percent of delivery gaps had demonstrated improvement. The CDVC framework proved to be valuable in the following ways. First, it facilitated the first comprehensive mapping of HIV/AIDS services in the Kara region of Togo. Second, it enabled the identification of gaps or insufficiencies in the currently available services across the full continuum of care. Third, it catalyzed the creation of a strategic QI plan based on identified gaps. Research limitations/implications This case description is the authors' experience in one setting and should not be considered comparative in nature. Furthermore, the approach described may not be applicable to all initiatives and/or organizations. As described, the lack of sophisticated and comprehensive data collection systems limited the authors' ability to collect reliable data on some of the QI initiatives planned. Practical implications The operationalization of the CDVC framework is an effective approach to drive continuous QI. Originality/value Through the operationalization of the CDVC, the authors developed a new approach for assessing existing services, identifying gaps in service delivery and directing continuous QI initiatives in a strategic manner.

Method: The present research employs the DG concordance system. This approach establishes a procedure to match patents according to their potential use in economic sectors. The research incorporates a two-stage approach, each involving a different method: capturing basic information from Mexican nanotechnology patents; and, establishing concordance with economic sectors. Results: 217 patents were identified; 153 were analyzed. Private companies and individuals registered 30%. The largest concentration (41%) is found in the economic sector "Manufacture of Chemicals and Chemical Products". Most patents are located in basic research. There are virtually no patents related to the final place in the value chain (final products) or to nanotechnology instruments. Conclusion: The article provides an overview of nanotechnology in Mexico in terms of quantity and institutional allocation of patents; also with the economic sectors with which they are associated, and the relation with the place in a value chain. Patent concentration in public academic institutions suggests a lack of nanotechnology research and development capacity in firms. Most patents are related to electronics, an economic sector with significant development in the country.

A potential source of such change is the spread of global value chains (GVCs), which have brought a marked increase in the use of intermediate goods and changes in the nature of trade competition. We review the recent literature on the impact of GVCs on measured trade elasticities and the ways in which their emergence may affect how we estimate and interpret trade responsiveness. We then draw out a few implications of recent research for global modeling.

They describe the great transformation of this sector in Colombia, in addition to a comparison among multiple players according to their circumstances and nature of their respective business organizations. While their business is carried on in apparently similar environments, the areas where they act have substantially dissimilar features, even when they are players in the same value chain in processes and services of port marketing and logistics industries. It is noted, as a central finding, that ports in Colombia, particularly in the cases studied, have been building a substantial and significant relationship with their surroundings, which constitute their social environment. This has given rise to changes in social policy and managerial perspective at ports, understanding that there should be a convergence of mutual interests. In conclusion, a change in the strategic view of ports and their outreach to social groups comprising their immediate reference is perceived.

This way, the work shows the production challenges faced by the peasants due to the tensions between the economism rationality and the alternative rationality. The latter considers the socioeconomic practices together with different forms of valuing the things. This work highlights the heterogenous nature of the peasants as well as the workings of the value chain in the traditional plants production, from the land to the selling place at the town markets in Bogota, taking into account the dehydration process.

The purpose of the article is to obtain a comprehensive picture of the Moldovan vegetable sector's value chain. The results of the paper are based on the primary and secondary information collected from different data sources. The primary tool for collecting the information was the individualized interview with different categories of participants on the Moldovan vegetable market, as well as the questionnaires made on a sample of 65 consumers. Thus, 65 consumers were questioned both in supermarket chains and in agricultural markets to identify their consumer preferences. Discussions were also held and 10 persons responsible for procurement from commercial units have been interviewed in order to analyze the model for integrating distribution units into the value chain in the vegetable sector. Conclusions on the competitiveness of the sector allow us to note that most of the analyzed vegetables sold on the market are produced by agricultural enterprises and peasant farms with areas over 10 ha and the access of domestic vegetable producers to the supermarket market is affected by a series of problems.

Feasibility of Adoption of Structured Grain Trading System in Ogun State, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Adoption; grains trading system; Nigeria		The study examined the feasibility of adoption of the structured grain trading system (SGTS) in Ogun State, Nigeria. It investigated the current grain trading system in the study area, identified policy and structural changes that needs review for successful adoption of structured grain trading system, investigated the perception of the people involved in the grain value chain, and identified the bottlenecks that may restrict efficiency of structured grain trading system. The population of the study covers mainly rice farmers, and other stake holders involved in rice value chain in Ogun State, who were selected using snowball technique. Questionnaires were used to obtain data from the respondents. Results from the study shows that the majority of the benefits derivable from using the structured grain trading system were not found in the present system of grain marketing; such as the use of warehousing receipt as collateral for loans. Conclusion drawn based on the perception of the stake-holders involved in rice value chain was that the structured grain trading system is highly preferred. The system can be implemented only if the infrastructures such as: roads, electricity, market information services, and standard storage structures are put in place.	[Jaji, M. F. O.; Kolawole, R.

The purpose of this paper is to study a bigger research project of the dairy value chain in agribusiness framework in the Rwenzori region. Design/methodology/approach A sample size of 100 dairy farmers were randomly selected from two Districts in the Rwenzori region. The descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) provided a basis for discussion. Furthermore, parametric Pearson coefficient test was conducted to examine the smallholder farmers' TNs and assess its association with selected socio-demographic characteristics of the dairy farmers. Findings The analysis indicated that dairy farmers expressed the need for a training program. Most frequently requested topics include: fodder cultivation, quality and safe milk handling, milk marketing, calf feeding and rearing, animal nutrition and financial literacy out of 12 topics. The least desired TNs was record keeping. Research limitations/implications The findings contribute to the understanding of dairy farmers' TNs. Practical implications The identified 12 key training intervention areas for the dairy farmers inform policymakers Dairy Development Authority and other development bodies in the Rwenzori region to address the challenges and improve smallholder dairy farming practices. Originality/value The study applies a synthesis review to identify theoretically acceptable variables that measure smallholder farmers' TNs in the dairy agribusiness. The paper also shares the empirical evidence of a pioneering attempt to identify smallholder dairy farmers' TNs in Uganda.

UNMAKING WASTE IN PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION: TOWARDS THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY			English	Article; Book Chapter						Social enterprises; recycling; reuse; policy; commodity chain; circular econmy; regulation	WASTE; REUSE	In debates about recycling and the circular economy, the role of existing organisations that already facilitate the circulation of materials through society can be neglected. Indeed, the social enterprise sector may currently be more significant than the commercial waste management sector in facilitating the circular economy within Australia. Drawing on interviews with organisations involved in collecting and reprocessing used electronics and scrap metal in Australia, the authors detail some of the synergies and tensions between the social enterprises and commercial organisations that have emerged as recycling gains traction through government policy and various forms of product stewardship. The authors conclude with suggestions for policy and governance approaches most likely to facilitate productive and perhaps symbiotic relationships between the two sectors in the future.

J	Liu, HZ; Shi, DQ				Liu, Hongzhong; Shi, Daqian			China's role in the new round of restructuring of regional division of labor in East Asia	ASIAN EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES			English	Article						China; ASEAN; East Asia; Regional division of labour	FLYING GEESE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explain the reasons and development trend of the new round of restructuring of regional division of labor in East Asia after the global financial crisis and the role of China in the process. Design/methodology/approach The paper probes into four factors leading to the adjustment of regional division of labor in East Asia before analyzing its development trend trough comparing the change of roles of China and ASEAN in the process. Findings After the flying-geese division and regional production network, East Asia's regional division of labor is getting a new round of structural adjustment. The analysis of this paper shows that this adjustment is mainly due to global financial crisis, post-crisis de-globalization, the rebalancing of East Asian economies and China's economic transformation. From the adjustment direction, the main trend is ASEAN gradually replacing China to become the new assembly plant area, while China becomes a new manufacturing power by its rising status in the global value chain. Originality/value The paper describes the development trend of the new round of restructuring of regional division of labor in East Asia in the future and gives the policy implications for the East Asian countries.

Now that "the East Asian Miracle" was financed by the Japanese government and China's current economic status was rather weak, that negligence made sense. But ironically, when World Bank tried to explain why it put China into research category in "East Asian Renaissance," it claimed again that there was a vast difference between China and other Asian countries.

S	Liu, ZB		Binhong, S		Liu Zhibiao			The Restructuring of Global Value Chains and Vitalization of China's Manufacturing Sector in the Context of the "One Belt One Road" Initiative	POLITICAL ECONOMY OF GLOBALIZATION AND CHINA'S OPTIONS	China in the World		English	Article; Book Chapter						"One Belt One Road" initiative; global value chain restructuring; economic structural imbalance; vitalization of manufacturing		The globalized development of manufacturing enabled China to reap huge profits as a leading producer. However, the embedded global value chain (GVC) export-oriented development model has also brought some challenges to China, as it does international subcontracting work at the bottom of GVCs. China is thus striving to adjust the imbalance in the world economic structure by shaping China's globalization strategy based on domestic demand and establishing an outlook and a mechanism creating a virtuous circle between the domestic and international economies. The new Chin-adominated GVCs will become China's new, high-level, comprehensive, and open spaces, links, and vectors, which will enable our economy to achieve high-speed industrial development on a mid-to-high-end basis. The GVCs formed through the "One Belt One Road" initiative, based on domestic demand, will help to push its economy more quickly into a new stage of innovation-driven development, which in turn will provide China's manufacturing sector the bright minds and the wings it needs to soar.

If mining enterprises want to make full use of low-grade resources simultaneously and obtain good economic benefits to strengthening the analysis and management of costs is necessary. For metal underground mines, with the gradual implementation of exploration and mining projects, capital investment and labor consumption are dynamic and increase cumulatively in stages. Consequently, in the evaluation of ore value, we should proceed from a series of processes such as: exploration, mining, processing and the smelting of geological resources, and then study the resources increment in different stages of production and the processing. To achieve a phased assessment of the ore value and fine evaluation of the cost, based on the value chain theory and referring to the modeling method of computer integrated manufacturing open system architecture (CIMOSA), the analysis framework of gold mining enterprise value chain is established based on the value chain theory from the three dimensions of value-added activities, value subjects and value carriers. A value chain model using ore flow as the carrying body is built based on Petri nets. With the CPN Tools emulation tool, the cycle simulation of the model is carry out by the colored Petri nets, which contain a hierarchical structure. Taking a large-scale gold mining enterprise as an example, the value chain model is quantified to simulate the ore value formation, flow, transmission and implementation process. By analyzing the results of the simulation, the ore value at different production stages is evaluated dynamically, and the cost is similarly analyzed in stages, which can improve mining enterprise cost management, promote the application of computer modeling and simulation technology in mine engineering, more accurately evaluate the economic feasibility of ore utilization, and provide the basis for the value evaluation and elective utilization of low-grade ores.

J	Machacek, E; Fold, N				Machacek, Erika; Fold, Niels			Competitors contained? Manufacturer strategies in the global rare earth value chain: Insights from the magnet filament	EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Rare-earth magnets; Global value chains; Governance; Codification; EU-China	MODULAR PRODUCTION NETWORKS; ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY; GOVERNANCE	This paper connects the extractive industry of rare earth mining and processing with the global automotive industry in which magnets with rare earth content are key components. In the context of the hardly uncontested market leadership in rare earth mining by China, the strategies of second-tier European rare-earth magnet manufacturers warrant examination: they compete with their third-tier Chinese suppliers and aim for a favourable position with first-tier suppliers to automotive end-users. We use the governance typologies of the global value-chain framework to elucidate how European magnet manufacturers strategize and employ the 'ability to codify' variable. Codification significantly determines how global value chains are governed and who gains from access to and use of mined and processed rare earths: Our findings pinpoint the strategic use of information flows and knowledge by manufacturers to their competitive advantage in the magnet filament towards the automotive industry. Therefore we propose a focus on 'intention to codify' in exploring deliberately managed information flows for global economic restructuring processes. Such focus will provide a more holistic understanding of the global rare earth value chain and its many filaments.

J	McIntyre, R				McIntyre, Richard			Professor Resnick Is Mean, or Productive Misinterpretation in Economics Pedagogy	RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE & SOCIETY			English	Article						Colonialism; Economics Education; Economic History; Imperialism; Marxist Economics		This essay examines the role of theory and history in Stephen Resnick's teaching. An undergraduate student thinks Resnick hates poor people because of his rigorous presentation of the links between assumptions and policy conclusions in neoclassical economics. Another graduate student believes Resnick knows little economic history because of his focus on the development of a theoretical framework almost to the exclusion of historical narrative. These examples of productive miscommunication in teaching are developed mostly through a lecture Resnick gave on "Competition, Colonialism, and Imperialism," but also through discussion of contemporary capital flows and some open questions in global commodity-chain research. Resnick's precision and focus on theory was powerfully formative for generations of Marxian economists, even those who preferred to teach discursively and through narrative.

This allows the development of a network diagram to represent complicated service processes for multiple customers by one salesperson. Quantification of the processes is also performed to identify characteristics of the customer-service behavior for a particular salesperson by three developed indicators based on the data of the created diagram. In addition, an application study is performed to confirm the utility of the proposed methods in the case of a cosmetics shop. The obtained results provide the detail perspective to digitalize the current state of the customer service process of the analyzed salesperson.

J	Nandonde, FA				Nandonde, Felix Adamu			Factors limiting the flow of food innovation ideas from modern food retailers to local food suppliers in Tanzania	TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW			English	Article						Tanzania; food innovation; retailers; food processors; diffusion of innovation theory; down stream	MECHANISMS; DIFFUSION; CAPACITY; BARRIERS; DRIVERS; ACTORS	This paper explores factors that constrain the flow of innovation ideas among downstream actors in the food value chain in Tanzania. Prior focus was on the improvement of products, but the influence of downstream actors has received little attention from the researchers in Africa. Qualitative method was deemed to be adequate and advantageous because the study was on understanding the challenges of innovation flow among downstream actors in the food value chain in Tanzania. Food suppliers were selected from international or local retailers using contact information of the processers provided on the packaging. The empirical findings of this study indicate that trade credit, government requirements, counterfeit products, consumers' preference and lack of skilled staff limit the flow of innovation in the food value chain in Tanzania.

J	Niyazmuradov, S; Heo, E				Niyazmuradov, Shohrat; Heo, Eunnyeong			Long-term natural gas contracts evolution in the changing industry environment	GEOSYSTEM ENGINEERING			English	Article						Long-term contracts; natural gas; LNG; transaction cost; technological change		This paper analyzes the determinants of changes in duration of long-term gas export contracts signed in the period from 1963 to 2015 in order to make implications for the gas exporting countries. Our findings from two models suggest that contracts became shorter due to gas market liberalization process triggering in Continental Europe, technological development along gas value chain and increase in LNG fleet size. On the contrary, we found that FOB deals and contracts signed during the global recession period were on average shorter compared to others. The results imply that ongoing technological development along gas value chain, planned gas market liberalization in other significant markets may lead to the further decrease in the contract duration. In this context, gas exporting developing countries may need to take this into account in longer term planning in order to foster gas export revenue stability, demand security and lessening contract renegotiation and enforcement transaction costs.

It explains how and why the fragmentation of production has contributed to the strong interconnectedness of the countries and how different authors and institutions responded to this development. Their approaches and characteristics are summed up according to stages and commodity chain (CC), global commodity chain (GCC) and global value chain (GVC) theories.

The Rise of the Digital Creative Economy: Caribbean Challenges and Opportunities	INDUSTRIAS CULTURALES Y ECONOMIA CREATIVA EN LATINOAMERICA: DESARROLLO ECONOMICO Y SOCIAL EN LA REGION	Coleccion Ciencias Economicas y Administrativas: Libros de Investigacion: Negocios Internacionales		English	Article; Book Chapter						Caribbean culture; creative industries; creative economy; cultural sector; digital trade; industrial upgrading		The burgeoning creative economy is making an increased contribution to GDP, exports and employment across the global economy. Although this is increasingly so in the developing world, from a trade standpoint, most developing countries operate at the low value-added end of the value chain, resulting in large trade imbalances in creative goods, services and intellectual property. As such, to tap into present and emerging opportunities, especially in the context of the rise of the digital creative economy, developing countries are encouraged to not only improve the quality and marketability of existing creative content they must also find ways to participate in the higher value-added segments such as online distribution is also highlighted. Drawing on the experience of the Caribbean, the paper presents a roadmap for value chain integration via mechanisms focused on trade support programmes that target industrial upgrading and enterprise development.

Mainstreaming Agricultural Extension Services in Value Chain in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Agricultural Extension Services; Mainstreaming; Value Chain		The paper examined how agricultural extension services can be mainstreamed in value chain in Nigeria. Literature materials concerning the concept of Value Chain, Agricultural extension and their roles were reviewed. Further effort was made to x-ray the possible ways where agricultural extension was used to facilitate the value chain. Findings on reviewed researches revealed that the involvement of agricultural extension in this crusade is paramount in achieving food security, poverty reduction, wealth and employment creation vis-a-viz Agricultural Transformation Agenda. Therefore, agricultural extension should be at the fore front of creating awareness on value chain to get farmers to participate as well as encourage them to be value chain actors. Government and stakeholders should facilitate the setting up of effective and functioning of value chain stakeholder committees ensuring the inclusion of agricultural extension services for effective facilitation.

A modification of a heuristic algorithm of possibilistic clustering for intuitionistic fuzzy data that account for the information coming from the labeled objects is proposed. The paper describes the basic ideas of the method and gives the plan of the partially supervised version of a direct possibilistic clustering algorithm. Illustrative examples of application of the method to two intuitionistic fuzzy data sets are provided. Preliminary conclusions are formulated and some perspectives outlined, notably for the analysis of agricultural value chain.

Agricultural Value Chain Extension: A panacea for Agricultural Transformation in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Agricultural Value Chain Extension; Agricultural Transformation; Anchor Borrowers' Programme		The study examined the effectiveness of value chain extension using some field activities among smallholder farmers in Nigeria and beyond and some farm projects that have adopted value chain extension approach. It revealed that the impact of a value chain extension approach if adopted include increased productivity, better post-harvest management, guaranteed and more remunerative market among others. The study also revealed that quite a number of problems constraining farmers from transforming into agribusiness could effectively be managed using the agricultural value chain extension approach. It was therefore recommended that agricultural value chain extension approach be piloted in selected states in Nigeria with a plan for gradual up-scale, as associated teething problems are being identified and appropriately managed to achieve desired outcomes.

A first case-regarded as services pertaining to the value chain in vital processes of energy and fossil minerals industries- accounts for the work carried out with a private company, whose organization is interesting not only because of its nature and performance, but also because it illustrates two circumstances experienced by business organizations that, being of family nature in their corporate structure, are defined by new business trends and current organizational forms.

They describe the great transformation of this sector in Colombia, in addition to a comparison among multiple players according to their circumstances and nature of their respective business organizations. While their business is carried on in apparently similar environments, the areas where they act have substantially dissimilar features, even when they are players in the same value chain in processes and services of port marketing and logistics industries. It is noted, as a central finding, that ports in Colombia, particularly in the cases studied, have been building a substantial and significant relationship with their surroundings, which constitute their social environment. This has given rise to changes in social policy and managerial perspective at ports, understanding that there should be a convergence of mutual interests. In conclusion, a change in the strategic view of ports and their outreach to social groups comprising their immediate reference is perceived.

What Makes Enterprises in Auto Component Industry Perform? Emerging Role of Labour, Information Technology, and Knowledge Management	GLOBALISATION OF TECHNOLOGY	India Studies in Business and Economics		English	Article; Book Chapter							SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; SMES; FIRM	Auto component industry is an interesting variant of business that is located in the context of dynamic value chain. While one end of the value chain is the sophisticated-oligopolistic original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the other end has suppliers who are small and medium enterprises. In the whole length and breadth of this value chain, suppliers include small, medium, and large enterprises. Broadly, these enterprises are of two types: organised and unorganised. Unlike in the case of large multinational enterprises, auto component suppliers, in particular small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are not so well endowed to invest in research development and exhaustive capability building endeavours. However, as elucidated in the extant literature on SMEs, a prudent option for these enterprises is to build and foster absorptive capacities that synergise labour, information technology, and knowledge management. To gauge these themes, we analyse four types of data. First, we examine recent time series of select variables that delineate the basic dynamics of performance and resources of organised auto component industry in India. Second, we lay focus on cross-sectional enterprise data drawn from 2012 to 2013 Annual Survey of Industries. Third, we analyse 67th round, for the year 2009-2010, of National Sample Survey, to examine unorganised auto component industry in India. Fourth, we use field data, collected in 2016, to discuss multidimensional aspects of knowledge management, technology, learning, labour, and outcomes, based on a survey conducted in Pune, Maharashtra, India. We conclude that auto component manufacturers seem to rely more on labour, information technology, and attainments like ISO to perform well in the business. While automation appears to be a catching up trend in the value chain, use of information technology seems to be the game-changer as far as value added is concerned. Drawing cues from patterns and inferences presented in our paper, for enterprises in the auto component value chain, be they are in the organised and unorganised sector, whether they are small or medium, it is important to create synergies between human resources and information and communication technologies to scale up a sustained higher order performance.

J	de Arteche, MR				Regina de Arteche, Monica			Clusters and Knowledge Management: Competing and Cooperating	EDUCAR			Spanish	Article						cluster; knowledge management; intellectual capital; CP		The objective of this research was to show how clusters and communities of practice (CPs) generate knowledge, competitive advantages and create value by developing the intangible assets located within the different players of the cluster. A state of the art in knowledge management and CPs is also developed, and it is explained how knowledge and innovation are involved in the economic theories supporting these types of associations. The clusters and CPs from four countries were studied: the Research Triangle Park (RTP) of North Carolina (USA); the GAIA clusters in the Basque Country (Spain); the atomic sciences research cluster in Bariloche (Argentina), and the footwear cluster in Sinos River Valley (Brazil). A descriptive and qualitative research methodology with a case study was used, including surveys in each country's cluster and CP members. The instrument used in the surveys consisted of four parts and 23 indicators built upon more dynamic variables and included dimensions of the intellectual capital model of knowledge management, which allowed measuring the results of the analysis in each cluster and determining how collective efficiency improved the clusters' value chain. The empirical study was completed with an analysis of documents and interviews with experts. The findings show that RTP and GAIA are the most dynamic clusters in generating collective knowledge, followed by Bariloche. It was also found that CPs are structures that encourage socialization and trust. It is concluded that joint action in clusters improves intellectual capital and structural capital.

J	Reifferscheidt, PP; Darr, D				Reifferscheidt, Paul Philipp; Darr, Dietrich			Meeting the growth challenge: developing the next level organization for GASA Group Germany	INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						organization design; company growth; horticulture value chain; small- and medium-sized enterprise; Lower Rhine valley; Germany		In order to remain successful, business organizations need to continuously adapt and respond to a changing environment. Rapid growth poses significant challenges to managers, not least with regard to maintaining the balance between efficiency and creativity in their organizations. Using the example of a wholesale company operating in the potted plants value chain in the lower Rhine valley, Germany, the case illustrates how the company was able to exploit the opportunities arising from the concentration in the value chain, and the necessity to adjust their organizational model in response to these changes. The case chooses the example of a small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) as such firms constitute the prevalent type of enterprises in Germany. Simultaneously, SMEs often find it particularly difficult to adapt their tangible and intangible resources to such changes. The current material is intended to help train future managers mastering this challenge.

The poultry sector in Zambia, in particular, has witnessed a rapid growth triggering increased investments and competition, benefiting the consumers. Despite this growth, the sector still faces huge challenges hindering the development of the animal feed, feed input and poultry production sub-sectors. This has limited the extent of participation of the Zambian poultry industry in the regional market due to uncompetitive prices. This study analyses the animal feed to poultry value chain in Zambia, focusing on the industry capabilities with a view to enhancing its competitiveness and production for the regional market. Enhancing value chain capabilities will require improvements in productivity and production of key poultry inputs, and addressing transportation inefficiencies and coordination among governments.

J	Santin, M; Espinola, LM				Santin, Marina; Maestro Espinola, Lidia			The digital press and the defence of intellectual property rights: The Spanish conflict as a European Case Study	COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY-SPAIN			English	Article						Copyright; digital press; Spain; Europe; Google News; news aggregators		This article analyses the on-going struggle over property rights in journalism in Europe, with a particular emphasis on the situation in Spain. To do so, we have carried out a historical review of the main conflicts on which the defence of intellectual property on the internet has centred. The European legislative system has tended to shy away from involvement in the area. The decisions and actions of the Member States have revealed a lack of common policy in the field of intellectual property rights as a result of the facultative nature of EU Directives. State judicial bodies diverge in their regulation of the protection of the press regarding news aggregators. Intermediaries are deemed parasites of the transformed value chain of the press industry by certain sectors. In the face of the tension which has surfaced between editors and news aggregators, diplomacy would appear to have become a key player as mediation takes place, with the intermediaries attempting to reach press collaboration agreements with the giants of the net. The services and activities which feature in the digital environment outpace judicial orders and, consequently, out-of-court settlements appear to be preferred by some media. At the same time, they await the EU authorities' debate on the regulatory framework, which is expected to afford greater protection to press editors.

B	Schleicher, SP		Pauly, P		Schleicher, Stefan P.			Deepened structural modeling: The case of energy	GLOBAL ECONOMIC MODELING: A VOLUME IN HONOR OF LAWRENCE R KLEIN			English	Article; Book Chapter						energy modeling; deepened structural modeling; energy policy; climate policy		Conventional economic analysis of energy systems is just not sufficient or even misleading in understanding the implications of the emerging energy innovations and the challenges for the design of energy and climate policies. We stress that it is essential to move from the usual black-box approach of energy modeling to deepened structural specifications which are based on the full value chain of an energy system. We explain this argument by looking at conventional approaches to energy modeling, in particular in the context of econometrics. We then demonstrate by using data for China, the United States, and the European Union, how an appropriate energy data analysis can provide insights into the structure of energy systems. Finally, we explain in a nutshell the building blocks of a deepened structural modeling approach which enables to tackle the new challenges; radical technological innovations, a very long time horizon, and the accompanying new designs for business and regulation.

Reason being usage of technology to transform the same old physical processes of government and public sector (GPS) to realize the E-Governance as are being following since independence. E-Governance is a much broader term (then only providing online access to government services), which encompasses usage of technology to enhance transparency, accountability, collaboration and participation of citizen in policy making, decision-making and improving services. Merely transforming physical services to electronic service cannot yield the benefits of E-Governance; rather necessity is to go for re-engineering of old government processes which are in desperate need of transformation. And in order to redesign these old GPS processes, it is firstly required to evaluate the current GPS processes to identify the problematic areas and then diagnosing the non-value-adding and value-adding activities in same. Here comes the role of value chain analysis which enables the BPR teams and change agents to identify non-value-adding activities in the government processes and evaluate how technology can enhance value of GPS processes. Now, the problem is that there is a lack of concrete value chain for government sector in literature, and this motivated the authors to undertake the present research work and propose a conceptual value chain for GPS which would later be tested empirically using SEM at the next stage. Value chain here has been developed based on SAP-LAP methodology proposed by Sushil (Manag Decis 38(5):347-353, 2000).	[Singla, M.

Constraints perceived by dairy farmers of Kerala State	INDIAN JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Milk; Cooperatives; Value chain; Credit		Dairying is a major subsidiary occupation for the farmers of Kerala. But the present day dairying is faced with a number of challenges. The study was conducted in four districts of the State, selected purposively, to explore various constraints associated with dairy farming as perceived by the farmers. Later the identified constraints were ranked according to their significance. Results showed that increased price of cattle feed, non remunerative price of milk, high cost of credit, unavailability of required manpower for cattle health care, unavailability of dry and green fodder etc. were some of the important constraints reported by majority of the respondents. Interventions including financial support to contain the cattle feed price along with periodic revision of milk price on rational grounds, due recognition of the sector at par with the crop husbandry etc. are suggested. Moreover the study highlights the proactive role that the milk cooperatives could play in supporting the farmers, and underscores the need to support evolving dairy value chains which benefit the producers in unique ways.

S	Steiber, A	Steiber, A			Steiber, Annika	Steiber, A		China: An Innovation Country?	MANAGEMENT IN THE DIGITAL AGE: WILL CHINA SURPASS SILICON VALLEY?	SpringerBriefs in Business		English	Article; Book Chapter								For years, China's economy was known mainly for low-cost contract manufacturing and imitation of foreign goods. This chapter explores the strides that have been made in building innovation capacity. The chapter draws on sources ranging from research by others to the author's original work to paint an all-around picture of how the world's largest nation is moving up the value chain. Key factors include major investments in research, education, and infrastructure, along with policy reforms that have opened up the economy to free-market forces. Chinese firms benefit from a very large, fast-growing domestic market, which creates demand for innovative goods while allowing for experimentation. Perceived impediments to innovation in China include a Confucian-based social culture and education systems focused on rote learning and test-taking, but various observers point out that such factors may not inhibit innovation as much as is commonly believed.

The phenomenon has been studied by multiple disciplines, including economists, geographers, sociologists, and historians. This article synthesizes various lines of inquiry, and notes their respective assumptions. IB research on GVCs continues to focus on Multinational Enterprises or MNEs, assuming that they exert control over the network through buying power and superior knowledge. Structure and governance are, however, not necessarily destiny in a GVC. Porter's original definition of the Value Chain stated that competitive strategies manage not just local costs, but the linkages between dependent nodes. Two Swiss firms illustrate how small suppliers can be successful within GVCs by managing network effects. We conclude with the implication of new business models and strategies on IB research and practice.

The plan was built after analyzing the relevant cotton value chain, which includes producers, spinners, textile manufacturers, clothing manufacturers, fashion influencers, universities and consumers. A network of service providers and supporters were aligned around the objective of growing the volume of cotton used throughout the chain. The case shows the strategy behind the campaigns and several promotional actions. Students are presented with challenges related to moving the effort forward following a successful program launch and are asked to consider what ABRAPA should consider in order to establish a continuous, long term and self-sustained effort of increasing cotton demand. Marketing, finance and governance issues are included.

Design/methodology/approach Information was collected from 175 different onion (Allium cepa L.) seed value chain actors in Nepal. Four different business models for the introduction of new bead drying and hermetic storage technology were compared to current practices through use of partial budgeting. Findings The increase in net income throughout the chain was quite similar in all four models, ranging from US$28.86 to 29.61 per kg of onion seed, making it difficult to say that any single model is best for all situations. However, there are differences in sharing of positive net income and negative net income for different actors in different models. Moreover, about US$5.85 million incremental return could be earned per year in Nepal from improved preservation of onion seed alone. Research limitations/implications This research assesses how to introduce a new technology, the dry chain concept to maintain seed quality, into the existing marketplace. Originality/value This paper focuses on the economics of a novel technology and compares different business models and scenarios.

The specific objectives were to: describe the socio-economic characteristic of the respondents; identify the sources of information by the respondents; evaluate the relationship between socio economic characteristics of the respondents and information utilization as well as identify the constraints faced by the respondents in the study area. Three wards were purposively selected based on their high involvement in fluted pumpkin farming, 96 commercial fluted pumpkins farmers were identified using snowballing sampling technique and were used for the study. Interview schedule was used to collect data. Data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Result shows that most (85.4%) of the respondents were male and 35.4% were between 30-39 years with mean age of 37 while 78.2% were educated as well as cultivated average of 1.6 hectares. The distribution of the respondents by source of information revealed that 80.3% sourced their information through friends and neighbours. The result of multiple regression showed that the coefficients of gender, household size and educational status were positive and significant. The study also revealed that inadequate fund (65.6%), poor provision of extension services (47.9%), poor access of irrigation facilities (40.6%) as the most serious constraints faced by the respondents. It was concluded that fluted pumpkin farmers had formal education which enable them utilized any available knowledge as information. The study recommended that farmers growing fluted pumpkin should be sensitized on how to borrow not only for production but for the value chain.

S	von Kutzschenbach, M; Schmid, A; Schoenenberger, L		Dornberger, R		von Kutzschenbach, Michael; Schmid, Alexander; Schoenenberger, Lukas			Using Feedback Systems Thinking to Explore Theories of Digital Business for Medtech Companies	BUSINESS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY 4.0: NEW TRENDS IN THE AGE OF DIGITAL CHANGE	Studies in Systems Decision and Control		English	Article; Book Chapter						Digital transformation; Systems thinking; Systems archetypes Business model; Theory of business; Digital service strategy; Platform business; Healthcare; Medtech	DYNAMICS	The rapid innovation of digital technologies poses a significant challenge to the healthcare sector. Digital technologies are transforming stakeholder relationships among established industry actors, including those of manufacturers, hospitals, and patients. To be ahead of competitors and to maintain profitability, medical device technology manufacturers (medtech companies) are urged to shift their business focus from product to customer excellence and thus invest in service offerings, focusing on the costs of alternative value delivery and patient outcomes. Such investments require a systemic and holistic understanding of how these changes in strategy affect the external and internal competitive environment. In this chapter, we propose the use of feedback systems thinking to explore the intended and unintended consequences of shifts in strategy, from sequential value chains to platform-oriented thinking. Taking the perspective of a medtech company in the value chain, we highlight challenges arising from hidden limits to growth that prevent the realization of intended achievements. Based on this, we develop hypotheses for the intended and unintended consequences of investing in digital service offerings. We conclude with a discussion of how systems thinking and modeling can support digital strategy development.

J	Wesumperuma, A; Ginige, A; Gunawardana, U				Wesumperuma, Ashini; Ginige, Athula; Gunawardana, Upul			Towards formation of dynamic value chains to enhance competitiveness of commercial lighting industry	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Community; Trust; Dynamic value chain; Entrusted circle		Purpose This study aims to explore ways to enhance competitiveness of commercial lighting industry because of the growing digitally connected stakeholder community. Positive responses from stakeholders to recurring business interactions help build trust and formation of a community; value chains being one form of such trusted community. Because of the increasing trust, the effort to search right value chain partners diminishes, business interactions become less formal and transaction costs are reduced, thus increasing the competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach In this research, a cross-sectional study of commercial lighting industry domain in Australia was carried out, focusing on two states: New South Wales and Victoria. Based on the findings, an approach and a supporting platform to enhance competitiveness of commercial lighting industry were synthesized. Findings Based on the findings from the study, formation of such value chains, namely, Entrusted Circles and its two types of formations, fully and partial, were observed. Their further growth was hindered by high transaction costs. To reduce this transaction cost, this paper proposes a platform to create dynamic value chains, among stakeholders of commercial lighting industry, making use of growing digital connectivity leading toward agile formation of Entrusted Circles to enhance competitiveness. Research limitations/implications This study focuses on the commercial lighting industry in Australia, which is not tested in any other domain to investigate its wider applicability. However, it is conceptually applicable to be used in industries with compliance and standard procedures. Originality/value This paper shows how to identify Entrusted Circles and build, support and sustain such relationships among value chain partners to successfully conduct business transactions in a dynamic value chain.

Porter's value chain theory and the modified Delphi method are used to provide empirical results to bridge the theory gap. This study identifies 43 knowledge and skill items that address three interdisciplinary areas within the IME industry. In the upstream area, research and development engineers need analyst and regulatory/patent affairs knowledge to develop products that meet medical needs. For the midstream, engineers need the ability to control the quality of mass production for human body use. Finally, the downstream area of marketing and seller relevant talent needs to explore new market capabilities and biomedical engineering professional knowledge to resolve and explain customer feedback. The research results support the recommendation that the government establishes a cross-disciplinary exchange mechanism to encourage the electronics industry and medical institutions to interact.

J	Orozco-Toro, JA; Ferre-Pavia, C				Alberto Orozco-Toro, Jaime; Ferre-Pavia, Carme			Measuring corporate reputation along the value chain of communication companies: a proposal	AUSTRAL COMUNICACION			Spanish	Article						value chain; communication companies; reputation indexes; corporate reputation; stakeholders	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; PERSPECTIVES	In an increasingly competitive context, the need to learn how interest groups assess companies is on the rise. This means that evaluating corporate reputation (CR) is a crucial task for corporate communications. Although there exist various indexes for measuring corporate reputation, none consider the entirety of the value chain, since most sample only a few stakeholders. Additionally, indexes gauging sector reputation or focusing on concrete economic fields are not widely available. This article is a methodological proposal that presents an Index of Corporate Reputation for Communication Companies (ICRCC), constructed after an analysis of existing academic and company indexes. Our methodological approach allowed us to study, in theoretical and corporate contexts, different measurement indexes that employ dimensions and indicators in implementing their evaluation tools, as indexes usually do. The results of our investigation show our ICRCC proposal broken down into these dimensions and indicators. We conclude that each interested party can have a distinct view of corporate reputation. Segmenting evaluations by stakeholders appears to be the most advisable way to then compare perceptions and elaborate differentiated strategies for each interest group. A strategy that means to improve a company's corporate reputation must identify the intangible brand values that interest groups care about.

Business Responsibilities in Times of War and Peace The Case of Heineken in Central Africa	BUSINESS PEACE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Multinational corporation; Business for peace; Conflict; Peace; CSR; Africa; Heineken		In recent years, corporate social responsibility (CSR) of multinational corporations (MNCs) in developing countries has received a great deal of academic attention. However, the literature has focussed on large and mostly stable emerging countries such as Mexico, Brazil, China or India. The few studies concerning Africa typically cover South Africa or Nigeria and concentrate on the extractive industries, such as oil and mining. Central African countries and non-mining companies have not been the object of much academic scrutiny. This paper looks specifically at one major MNC operating in the beverage industry in three (post) conflict countries in Central Africa, namely Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and analyses the company's reactions to the conflicts as well as the extent to which the conflict context influenced the company's management and operations. Drawing from extensive interviews with Heineken high executives, and secondary documentation provided by Heineken, this paper offers detailed insights into the perceived and practised social responsibilities a major private economic actor encounters while operating in a conflict region. Based on the peace through commerce existing frameworks, we provide empirical evidence which reveals that economic and social opportunities are widely exploited. By continuing business in war times, creating linkages in the value chain, and offering healthcare to employees, family members and communities, as well as facilitating dialogue between warring parties, Heineken creates conditions for peace to thrive and contributes to consolidating the countries' stability. Our study also extends the scope of MNCs' responsibilities by showing the challenges MNCs operating in conflict areas face in maintaining an official policy of strict neutrality while being de facto involved in public matters.

J	Nogalski, B; Niewiadomski, P				Nogalski, Bogdan; Niewiadomski, Przemyslaw			Interception of values as a result of the business model restructuring - case study	MANAGEMENT-POLAND			English	Article						flexible business models; implementation flexibility; strategy; agricultural machinery sector		The main objective of this paper is to present a case of value interception as a result of restructuring the business model of a manufacturing company that operates in the agricultural machinery sector. A company that focuses on core activities in the value chain and commissions the manufacturing of most components to specialised suppliers - as a result of restructuring - becomes an integrator that controls all parts of the supply chain; from obtaining a raw material, through its own production of a possibly large number of components, to the distribution of a finished composite product. The framework of the conducted research featured the identification of the relationships occurring between own production of components comprising a given product, and an alternative solution, i.e. possibility of acquiring them by way of co-operation. The authors assumed that a derivative of the value intercepted in the finished product implementation process is the number of components manufactured using own production resources.

J	Park, DK; Kim, CG; Park, CY				Park, Dong Kyu; Kim, Chung Gi; Park, Chan Young			A Study on Synthesis and Properties of Polyurethane Dispersion Adhesives	ELASTOMERS AND COMPOSITES			Korean	Article						polyurethane; water soluble; adhesive; bond strength; prepolymer		Polyurethane dispersion (PUD) polymers were synthesized by using polyether and polyester polyol. The effect of ionomeric centers, r(NCO / OH) values, chain extender process, and chain extender types on the adhesion properties was investigated. In the case of polyether-based PUD, the ionic center, r value, chain extension process and chain extender types were not adjusted even after adjustment. In the case of polyester-based PUD, when the ionic center content was more than 2.5%, the state of adhesive strength was 2.0 kgf/cm(2) or more. On the other hand, the initial adhesive strength was excellent at about 1 kgf/cm(2) when the ionic center content was over 3.5%. When the r value was 1.3 or more, it was found that the initial bonding strength and the state of bonding strength were excellent at about 1 kgf/cm(2) and 2.1 kgf/cm(2) or higher, respectively. An IR spectrum analysis of the synthesized PUD confirmed that PUD was composed of urethane based on the N-H characteristic peak at 3340 cm(-1) and the urethane characteristic peak at 1730 cm(-1). Moreover, the characteristic peaks of the isocyanate (2260 cm(-1)) used in the preparation of the prepolymer were not observed. As a result, the residual-NCO was not observed, and urethane was completely synthesized.

J	Kong, DJ				Kong, Dejian			Shaping a legal framework for China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System	SPACE POLICY			English	Article						BDS; Legal framework; State of play; Way forward		As the service provision to Asia-Pacific region and the construction of global constellation are being pushed forward step by step, the lack of soft power on the governance and management over BDS, including institutional, policy and legal arrangements, is clipping the wings of the deployment, development, exploration and application of BDS, and constraining its further popularization at both the domestic and global level. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a comprehensive legal framework for BDS to keep the sustainable development of BDS and to balance the interests of all stakeholders in the value chain of BDS. Bearing that in mind, this paper offers the whole thinking of shaping that legal framework based on the specific analysis on the legal regimes on the supervision mechanism, certification system, mandatory application, ownership, operation, cost of recovery, sovereign rights, liability regime, data and privacy protection as well as other legal issues in the context of BDS.

The hypothesis is that sweet sorghum multiuse would permit the combination of its several uses: in food industry (grain, fodder), energy producing (biofuel or cooking gel and cogeneration) and potable alcohol value chain. We mobilize an analytical frame of reference of value chains to study in itinere the conditions for a sectorial development of an experimental implementation. The data were collected from face-to-face surveys with experts. The results revealed that the functioning of sugar cane industry determines specific constraints, conditioning the choice of sorghum varieties. These results highlight a possible complementarity between the use of sweet sorghum grain for food or feed and its use to produce potable alcohol. They interrogate the potentialities of using sweet sorghum grains and co-products in animal diet. They invalidate the use of sweet sorghum juice for biofuel.

J	Cooper, C				Cooper, Colin			Don't sweat the sweet stuff: how to manage in the new sugar order	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article						Europe; European Commission; EU; sugar; quotas; isoglucose; sugar beet; sugar production; agriculture; volatility; price risk; market risk; risk management; data; advanced analytics		On October 1, 2017, the EU's 50-year old sugar quota production system will come to an end, introducing a new dynamic between the European and global sugar markets. Currently, producers and consumers are insulated from the significant price fluctuations in the global market. The end of the quota system exposes every aspect of the sugar value chain to these global headwinds, while simultaneously increasing the level of volatility seen, for at least the short term. This article explores the potential impacts of the end of the sugar quota system on European and international markets for both sugar and isoglucose. It considers other external factors that are likely to shape the market in the near to medium term, including but not limited to Brexit, and assesses the levels of change and uncertainty in the new sugar environment. It also looks at the technological tools that can help producers identify, mitigate and minimize the new risks they now face.

A survey on the current practices regarding toilets, the assessment of a new protocol for operating the prototype toilet, and the evaluation of the interface design was performed with 20 people at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Indonesia. Concurrently, an assessment of the interface design was performed at a mosque in Sapporo, Japan. Half of the people answered that the bad smell is a point to be checked, and 70% of respondents worried about excreta sticking to the toilet bowl. The problem of smell can be solved by installing a ventilation system. The new operation protocol was acceptable, and the impression of the toilet on the body was good and acceptable. 70% was unsatisfied with its size, and the yellow color of the cover brought to mind garbage or something polluted. 40% felt discomfort in terms of the impression of sitting on the toilet seat, feeling like they might fall into the hole. Many said that the space was too small for washing their body with their hands. Modification of the toilet was discussed.

J	Niwa, K				Niwa, Kazuhiko			Fujitsu Group's Green Logistics	FUJITSU SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								The Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage VIII) has been in operation since FY2016, and one of its thematic objectives is to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain. In the logistics division, we aim to achieve a 2% reduction in CO2 emissions per sales amount from transport. Working with our suppliers and clients, we proactively pursue a variety of activities to reduce environmental burden in the group-wide transport practices (domestic, overseas intraregional, and international transport), which we call green logistics. The Fujitsu Group started various green logistics initiatives in April 2006, even before the Amendment to the Act on the Rational Use of Energy (known as the Amended Energy Conservation Act) was implemented. The amended act required not only freight forwarders, but also shippers to join in efforts for energy conservation. While the act is effective only within Japan, the Fujitsu Group extends the scope of these initiatives to its global value chain. This paper describes these activities of green logistics pursued at the Fujitsu Group.

Proactive efforts to meet these targets are expected not only from nations and regions but also from the private sector. The Fujitsu Group formulated the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage VIII) on the basis of two pillars: "contributing to society through the development of ICT solutions" and "reducing the environmental impact of our business." This plan has been followed since April 2016. We are working to make contributions to society by providing information and communications technology (ICT) services and products that lead to a sustainable society. We are working to reduce the environmental impact of Fujitsu's own businesses by aiming for the Paris Agreement's reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions and engaging in initiatives to achieve it along the entire value chain. This paper introduces Fujitsu Group's environmental management activities, including our Environmental Action Plan (Stage VIII) and specific initiatives.

The three methods are total energy, energy-time and energy-distance. The methods combine practices used in traditional physical distribution system analysis and extended value stream mapping (VSM) analysis. This research concludes that the energy-distance method and measure is the most effective for analysing, comparing, and identifying opportunities for value chain improvement. It also identifies a 'U-shape' that is characteristic of the energy transfer pattern during a transportation segment that suggests that damage from transportation may need to be screened for quality at a subsequent value chain node. Key Findings: This research compares three new methods and measures for evaluating the transportation segment of a value chain.

Our aim is to determine how augmented reality (AR) and other hybrid media solutions change print media's value chain and what kind of opportunities they offer. We studied both human and technical aspects and critical challenges. We interviewed 20 actors of Finnish advertising and media business, who are very enthusiastic toward AR-enriched interactive hybrid media. User behavior measurability was found to be important. We present a sketch of the hybrid media value chain with the actors. We also describe and discuss selected AR applications. AR technology is mature enough for the mass market; the technical performance of smartphones is high enough for AR applications, and the penetration of smartphones is increasing rapidly. Our main conclusion is that hybrid media is essential to the future of print media.

However, at this date, it lacks of valuation and recognition in the national market as a product with heritage features. This study postulated that Public Policy aimed to value chain development influence the recovery, development and promotion of these products. To this effect, first it described the product and the relationship between gastronomic heritage and value chain. Secondly, it identifies and analyses the different differentiation and value added process product strategies. Finally, those public policies that influence the development of the chain, together with the institutions and related instruments and the role of these in product development are identified.

J	Yee, J				Yee, Justin			Designed in China: A Legal Frontier	FUDAN JOURNAL OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Intellectual property; Copyright; Patent; Trademark; China		China's "Five-Year Plan" is a national strategy document developed by the country's top leaders. Manifest in its guidelines was a concept that the developed world has traditionally and freely acknowledged, but that China has only recently become an acquaintance with. Specifically, the plan labels innovation as one of its focus areas, with a goal to move up in the value chain of global economic powers by abandoning old heavy industry and building up bases of modern information-intensive infrastructure. These objectives are to be facilitated by actions which include the strengthening of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement and represents another notch on China's growing shelf of advancements in the area. This paper will discuss the current state of China's intellectual property legal framework, the increasing awareness amongst Chinese leadership to bolster the framework and the barriers which will inevitably form in the eye of progress. The analysis will delve into the history of intellectual property in China and culminate with a glance into today's political and cultural landscape. The goal of this paper is to examine the importance of devising a stable legal framework in order for China to successfully adhere with the innovation aspect of its current Five-Year Plan.

While it is assumed that the economic links are driven by investment and formal trade agreements, we identify a more intertwined dynamic of "deep integration" through Global Value Chains (GVCs). We first examine the macro data of Taiwanese direct investment and bilateral trade with ASEAN member countries. Next, we discuss "the trade-investment-serviceIP nexus" through the case of the textile and apparel industry in Taiwan, which evolved with the GVC led by brand marketers in advanced countries, cementing economic linkages between Taiwan and Southeast Asia. We then explore new patterns of Taiwanese development through exporting "good enough innovations" and "total solutions" in the region.

J	Hegde, NG; Deo, AD				Hegde, Narayan G.; Deo, Avinash D.			Current status of goat husbandry and scope for improving its productivity in Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Goatery; Goat breeds; Goat diseases; Goat keepers; Small ruminant marketing		A study was undertaken in selected districts of Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh states, to understand the current status of goat husbandry and identify suitable interventions to enhance productivity and income of goat keepers. Approximately 87.2% families in the study area were living in poverty and 93% goat keeping families belonged to small, marginal or landless families. While 47.5% goat keepers owned less than 5 goats across the study area, over 73% goat keepers were small flock owners in Bihar and a majority of them were dependent on extensive grazing. This was predominant in Odisha where over 99% goat keepers were dependent on extensive grazing while in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, less than 20% families were dependent on extensive grazing. PPR was the major disease, but FMD, enterotoxaemia, goat pox and HS were also reported with low intensity. Goat mortality was high at 33.5% in Bihar, 26.6% in Odisha and 20.6% in Uttar Pradesh. Goat husbandry was mainly looked after by women. Over 80% goat keepers sold their goats in their villages itself. The income from goats has been significantly low at (sic) 4,068 per family in Bihar, while it was slightly higher at (sic) 10,748 in Odisha. Assured breeding and health care services and financial support are needed to enhance the income of goat keepers. Hence, priority should be given to build their capacity for developing value chain and mobilise critical services for improving the production.

Benchmarking cane supply quality in the Herbert, Burdekin, Proserpine and Plane Creek regions [of Australia]	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Conference of the Australian-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists (ASSCT)	MAY 03-05, 2017	Cairns, AUSTRALIA	Australian Soc Sugar Cane Technologists		extraneous matter; damaged; mutilated; billets; survey; benchmark; sugarcane		A survey of the quality of the cane delivered to the Herbert, Burdekin, Proserpine and Plane Creek regions was undertaken in 2015 to assess the quantity of extraneous matter (viz. dirt and roots, trash and tops) in the cane supply, as well as measure billet length and quality (viz. sound, damaged and mutilated). Extraneous matter was between 5.4% and 32.7% of the cane supply in the Herbert, Proserpine and Plane Creek regions and between 3.6% and 12.0% of the cane supply in the Burdekin. Tops were between 36% and 55% of the median extraneous matter in the cane supply and it was evident that harvesters are routinely not topping cane, even when it is erect. Billet length has continued to decrease since the early 2000s and it was estimated that 21%, 15%, 9% and 20% of the harvesters in the Herbert, Burdekin, Proserpine and Plane Creek, respectively, had installed 10-blade chopper systems, while at least 2 harvesters in the Burdekin have 12-blade chopper systems that produce a billet that is around 126 mm long. Median billet length was between 13-20 mm shorter than that expected from a harvester with an optimised 8-blade chopper system. It was estimated that approximately 93 900 tonnes of biomass, cane and juice, is lost during the billeting operations due to these harvesters not being optimised. It was further surmised that between 300 000 and 800 000 tonnes of cane is possibly being lost and not delivered to the mills, as shorter billets are more prone to loss in the extractor systems. Best fit regression models identified that dirt and roots, trash, tops, damaged billets and mutilated billets impact negatively on the CCS. Research is needed to quantify how these affect CCS and to develop strategies to assist harvester operators better harvest the cane crop to maximise the return to the entire value chain of the industry.

The levulinic acid product tree: a versatile opportunity in the bio-based economy What does it take to establish such transition?	CHIMICA OGGI-CHEMISTRY TODAY			English	Article						Levulinic acid; woody biomass; product tree; cost competitive; open innovation; value chain; fine chemicals	FUELS	Renewable feedstock offers magnificent business development opportunities in chemicals and materials. We describe the emerging Levulinic Acid (LA) product tree, with woody biomass as a raw material. First products from LA will find tens of million Euro markets, and further downstream products a billion Euro market. The value creation outperforms most other bio-refineries, thanks to high carbon and energy efficiency. Cost prices, excluding carbon tax and subsidies, appear at par with fossil derived equivalents at an oil price of 30 $/brl. All this requires development time, capital and assets. Open innovation offers an excellent environment to make this happen, with partners representing entire value chains, technology experts, NGO's and governments. With this constellation and full throttle, the first LA-products could be on the market by 2022, heading towards a full-grown LA-market by 2030.	[Broxterman, Quirinus Rinus B.; Janssen, Michele C.

ENERGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Petrochemicals; Polypropylene; Value chain; Price dynamics; Variance decompositions; Impulse response functions	CRUDE-OIL PRICE; COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS; GASOLINE PRICES; RETAIL GASOLINE; TRANSMISSION; FEATHERS; ROCKETS	This paper investigates price dynamics between polypropylene (PP), propylene, naphtha, and crude oil together with proxies representing PP using industries. We test the dynamics in the South East Asian and North Western European markets. The paper is motivated due to the importance of the propylene and PP market in various downstream industries and importantly to aid producers in having a better understanding of how input costs and demand drive the prices. We employ a vector error correction framework, which facilitates testing different dynamics among the upstream and downstream prices. We find PP prices in both regions to be endogenous, albeit with some evolution over time, i.e., input costs and downstream demand factors tend to drive PP prices. In both regional markets shocks to naphtha and oil prices tend to be driven mostly by each other's price with little effect originating from PP and propylene prices.

The methodology used for the diagnosis was based on the analysis of the primary and secondary sources of information, which made it possible to identify the information needs and their sources, in order to design different instruments and templates that allowed the data to be collected, and the subsequent processing. Based on the weaknesses detected, actions were taken in order to improve the health of the cattle, their feeding and with it the animal feed process, as well as the agro-technology activities, the strengthening of the contracts with the suppliers, the assembly of the machinery for special cuts and maintain the quality of the products. It was concluded that the proposed actions, coupled with the appropriation of technological transfers and the systematic introduction of the results of science and innovation in beef cattle raising, they allow to revert the identified weaknesses and they improve the results notably in each link of the chain of value of the meat.

Design considerations for critical coal measurement points: towards accurate reconciliation for integrated mine planning	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						integrated mine planning; processing plant; critical coal measurement points; accurate reconciliation		Integrated coal mine planning requires integration of mine planning technical inputs like survey, geology, planning, mining, processing, and finance. A comprehensive strategy on tracking, measuring, and reconciling coal from the mine plan to the customer is needed to achieve this. The ultimate aim is to have confidence in the coal measurement, accounting, and reporting processes so that the effectiveness of the entire planning process can be measured for compliance with business standards. For such leading practice it is necessary to determine measurement protocols at carefully selected measuring points. The design of such critical measurement points to allow for integrity and accurate reconciliation in the context of integrated mine planning is the topic of this article, with reference to a typical surface (dragline) coal mine operation. A general surface coal mine flow diagram was developed. For a flow and distribution system for such a mine, five critical measurement points are expected. These are the output of mine planning and scheduling process; post-mining pit survey and highwall mapping; the quantity and quality of feed material; quantity and quality of coal product; and the coal distribution process which extends from the product to the preparation plant and point of sale to the customer. In order to prevent inherent human errors, key data must be captured and recorded electronically and automatically. A digital mining approach allowing for automation tracking, measuring, reconciling and reporting of coal along the value chain is recommended.	[Tetteh, M.; Cawood, F.

J	Degato, DD				Degato, Demissie Damite			INNOVATION AND PATHS TO SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY	RISUS-JOURNAL ON INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Innovation; qualitative comparative analysis; sustainability; Fuzzy assessment	GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK	The traditional approach to innovation assessment has mainly focused on the economic outcomes and failed to capture the ecological and social dimensions of sustainability. By giving high attention to the role of specific kind of innovation (technological innovation), there is little empirical work on whether combining different kinds of innovation leads to progress in social-ecological sustainability in developing countries. The sustainability orientation in the assessment of innovation performance becomes increasingly important for achieve successful transformation towards sustainability. The research question of this study is under what condition or combination of conditions the intervention for innovation reconciles the trade-offs between socioeconomic and ecological performance and thus improve progress towards sustainability in poor countries. Combing concepts and methods from literature on strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR), value chain upgrading, sustainability, and technological capability, this study identifies different mechanisms and conditions for building innovation capacity and then empirically evaluates the relationship between the degree of innovation capacity and the progress towards social-ecological sustainability by taking four cases from Ethiopia. The data for this study is collected using key informant interviews, focus group discussion, and biodiversity and innovation scorecard questionnaire. Mixed methods combing comprehensive fuzzy evaluation, biodiversity scorecard and qualitative comparative analysis are used for analysis. The study found that combing value chain innovation and green governance innovation either with technological upgrading or innovation platform learning are sufficient conditions for achieving social-ecological sustainability. We also found that innovation in green governance and in value chain are necessary conditions for sustainability.

J	Yue, HJ				Yue, Hong-Jiang			Academic Performance of Indigenous Issues- Taking Original Equipment Manufacturer Research as an Example	JOURNAL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES			English	Article						China; OEM Phenomenon; Bibliometrics		Advocated for the localization of international issues under the voice of meaningful research has become increasingly high, after 30 years of development, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) phenomenon as a living localization issues exist. This paper is a systematic review of the bibliometrics, which is a typical indigenous topic, which can be traced to the interpretation of Chinese scholars and its unique performance. The study found: (1) The academic community on the local issues - OEM phenomenon is response, but far from showing a prosperous situation; (2) Intensive units engaged in OEM research mainly concentrated in the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta region of several key universities, which is with other research topics throughout the country blossom everywhere in the different characteristics; (3) Collaborative research is the main theme of foundry research, in the middle-aged scholars and young students in the mode of cooperation, the formation of "student first" and "professor second" two common modes of cooperation; (4) OEM research results are distributed in the field of industrial industries, but also covers business management and other economic management areas; (5) OEM research mainly formed a "global value chain" as the center of the macro-level expansion of economic research-oriented trends and "OEM enterprises" as the center of the expansion of business management level of management research-oriented trends; (6) The academic achievements of OEM research more from the English literature to find the theoretical basis for research, independent discovery and construction of the foundry "Chinese theory" is more than the lack of; (7) OEM research, both empirical research and case studies are more deductive way to verify the Western theory, the lack of a paradigm of the development of local unique theoretical contribution; (8) The state and central departments funding is an important research model of OEM research, local government funding for OEM research initiative is not high.

J	Asokumar, B				Asokumar, B.			A Study on the Avian Meat Processing and the Environment	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Meat Processing; Avians; Environment; Bio wastes; Broiler farming; International meat processing standards		India is the fifth largest producer of poultry meat which constitutes 95% of total avian meat processed in the Globe. It contributes to the food & Nutrient security to a significant extent. Requirements of the amino acids from animal source is largely met through poultry in India. This research paper has focus on Broiler segment of the poultry industry. The organized and scientific method of broiler slaughtering and processing constitute just 7%. The demand for broiler meat is catered by unorganized slaughtering and vending operations. The enforcement of existing regulations to monitor the hygiene and environmental pollution during slaughtering and disposal of bio wastes are inadequate. Solid bio wastes from poultry processing across the country harbor the pathological sources for Epidemics, unacceptable public hygienic conditions and affect the quality of life. As a stake holder, the public are exposed to such environmental pollutants from unregulated processing through air and water. By adopting proper processing methods, the wastes can be converted in to wealth and add value to the economy besides making the environment clean. This paper identifies causal factors such as pollutants, review of regulatory measures and remedial measures suggested by World Health Organisation, International Food Policy Research Institute, Food and Agriculture Organisation, International Standards committees and various research scholars by extensive review of literature. The discussions with breeders, integrators, wholesalers, retailers and health administrators form the base on which recommendations are made to make the Processing and marketing activity to add value in the value chain and enhance the quality of life on this planet earth.

J	Heise, H; Overbeck, C; Theuvsen, L				Heise, Heinke; Overbeck, Christina; Theuvsen, Ludwig			The Initiative Tierwohl (Animal Welfare Initiative) from the perspective of various stakeholders: assessments, opportunities for improvement and future developments	BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT			German	Article								In order to increase the well-being of animals in livestock farming, the Initiative Tierwohl (ITW) was launched in January 2015 with the objective of implementing higher animal welfare standards on the broadest possible basis in pig and poultry farming. For the successful establishment of the ITW, its acceptance by the various stakeholders in the meat value chain is necessary. In this article, therefore, the attitudes of 22 stakeholders to the ITW will be determined on the basis of interviews with experts. The analysis of the interviews shows that the launch of the ITW is largely assessed as positive by the stakeholders surveyed. Thus, an industry initiative could have every chance of achieving a vast increase in the animal welfare level in Germany. However, some structural and content-related shortcomings of the ITW are currently leading to acceptance problems with various stakeholders. The limited financial resources of the ITW and the manner in which ITW communicates with the consumer are criticised, amongst other things. The interviews also show that the gain in reputation for the food retail sector which it was hoped that the ITW would bring has not materialised so far. Therefore, the attractiveness of participation for the food retail sector could decrease in the future. This could ultimately lead to a food retailer leaving the ITW, which could have a major effect on the continued existence of the ITW, due to the high concentration of food retailers in Germany. In order to prevent a withdrawal, the ITW's communication with the consumer would have to improve. In addition, the future funding would have to be reconsidered, so that the food retail sector does not have to take this on alone in the long term.

J	de la Llave, AN; Monroy, HC; Galvan, MM				Noyola de la Llave, Aline; Ceron Monroy, Hazael; Magdaleno Galvan, Mauricio			Public management alternative for the tourism sector The case of Nuevo Leon, Mexico	TEORIA Y PRAXIS			Spanish	Article						Tourism agents; cluster; collaboration; tourism management model; organization		Various Mexican governments have adopted tourism as an important strategy to promote economic development and competitiveness of those regions that have tourist attractions. Whatever the government vision is, the functioning of the tourism sector depends largely on the collaborative work and organization of those agents involved in tourism promotion. The objective of this work is to propose a public management alternative that allows organizing the tourism sector in Mexico and, simultaneously, helps to consolidate competitive environments for this industry. The case study of Nuevo Leon is presented, where the government has been responsible for promoting a tourism management model that has made it possible to coordinate the work of different agents which are incorporated to the tourism value chain: the Tourism Cluster of Nuevo Leon. In order to generate the proposal, a focus group methodology was used to collect the concerns of the public, private and academic sectors; as were case studies. The results have been actions with the objective of improving the competitiveness of the destination.

J	Velandia, GR				Rincon Velandia, Guillermo			Measurement of tourism spending at a subnational level: Situr Santander	TEORIA Y PRAXIS			Spanish	Article						Tourist spending; measurement of expenditure; economic impact of tourism		The Tourist Information System of Santander (Situr Santander) is a pilot experience in Colombia whose essential purpose is to measure the impact of tourism from an economic, social, cultural and environmental perspective at a subnational level. This information is considered essential for the management and planning if it's long-term sustainability wants to be secured. The measurement of tourism as an economic sector requires the study of demand and supply. As for the demand, the estimation of tourist spending during their stay in a territory makes it possible to know the distribution of income throughout the value chain and assess the contribution of tourism to regional development and growth. The estimate of receptor tourist expenditure followed the guidelines of the World Tourism Organization and recommendations of InRoute. Data was collected through an online survey applied to a sample of monthly visitors initially contacted in person, facilitating tourists to register in detail each of the expenses incurred. The methodology has been adopted by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism to perform the same measurements in other departments of Colombia. The results allowed knowing the composition and magnitude of tourist spending, plus income received in each of the primary activities associated with tourism.

J	Baporikar, N				Baporikar, Neeta			Cluster Approach for Entrepreneurship Development in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Advantages; Approach; Cluster; Development; Entrepreneurship; Grouping; India; Location; Policy	POLICY; INNOVATION	Clusters are increasingly recognised as an important feature of modern economies. Their presence has become more pronounced in the global economy-not less, as was sometimes assumed. Complementary concepts such as the global value chain point out that strong clusters benefit from strong external linkages and are well positioned to take advantage of them. Although there is still less evidence on the role and impact of cluster approach for entrepreneurship development, the experience and the conceptual framework suggest otherwise. Clusters can enhance the rate of entrepreneurship development and there are different ways to raise economic benefits for entrepreneurs from existing clusters. More complex is the question of how economies can develop new clusters and aid entrepreneurship development. With acase based approach, so this paper discusses and deliberates on the cluster approach adopted for entrepreneurship development in India.

Neeraja			Value Chain of Groundnut-An Analysis of Constraints and Opportunities Ahead	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Constraints; groundnut; value addition; value chain map		Groundnut is primarily a suitable crop to rabi season which has a complex value chain to understand, the study traced the value chain of groundnut realizing its importance as a primary source of oil. Recent statistics show that even at all India level only 22 per cent of area under groundnut is irrigated. The value chain defines the roles and responsibilities of each player from the producer to the consumer. There is a vast potential in catching the untapped potential of groundnut as products like edible oil, ground nut cake, raw and fried forms and even export quality peanuts. The value chain is complex and there is absence of intuitional network to from the supply of inputs particularly seed, high seed cost, development of adoptable cultivars with preferred qualities from research, marketing mechanism, low remunerative price even the MSP fixed is not sufficient to cover the cost of production. On the other side farmer is forced for distress sale, neither warehousing nor own storage space is available. A suitable mechanism of value chain comprising of quality supply of inputs, new emerging farmer producer organization and networking capabilities with processors and redefined role of marketing federations / facilitators help the starving groundnut crop in marginal lands and rejuvenating oilseed improvement programmes will help bridging the yield gaps so that the farmers become inclusive and reap the benefits of value chain.

J	Aboumasoudi, AS				Aboumasoudi, Abbas Sheikh			Selection of an Optimal Network-Ranking Model to Achieve the Optimal Production Line Value Chain: a Case Study in the Textile Industry	FIBRES & TEXTILES IN EASTERN EUROPE			English	Article						optimal value chain; data envelopment analysis (DEA); network-ranking models; ideal decision making unit	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; SUPPLY CHAIN; EFFICIENCY; DEA; WEIGHTS; BANKS; UNITS	Fulfilling needs and organisational resources with the least cost and highest quality is the main reason to achieve the optimal value chain. Application of most of the current techniques has merely been intended to choose the best scenario. However, industrial units need to build an ideal scenario as a value chain which focuses on intangible interstitial and hidden factors: good (good nature), bad (bad nature), fixed (obligatory nature) and free (not identing their nature) and creates value. Therefore the model presented in this article answers this issue. First of all, we present a model based on the network approach of data envelopment analysis, then assess and rank the stages based on the scenarios for the stages forming the value chain, and finally the ideal decision unit is presented. For this reason, the general efficiency is designed with two natures; 1. input-centered (concentration on the costs) and 2. output-centered (concentration on the incomes).

J	Adhitya, A; Tan, ST; Tan, E; Chew, W				Adhitya, Arief; Tan, Suat-Teng; Tan, Edwin; Chew, Wee			In Silico Process Optimization and Quality by Design with Business and Environmental Sustainability Considerations	JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION			English	Article						Process analytical technology (PAT); Quality by design (QbD); Design of experiments (DoE); Process development; Process optimization; Epoxidation	PHARMACEUTICAL PROCESS-DEVELOPMENT; PROCESS ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGY; INDUSTRY; TRENDS	In designing pharmaceutical manufacturing alongside the principles of quality by design (QbD) and process analytical technology (PAT), unit operations process development and corporate decision-making processes such as business profits and environmental impact assessments are often undertaken separately. This paper presents a strategic three-tier framework linking the process, operations, and business/enterprise levels for process development and improvement alongside an in silico optimization approach. At the process level, first principles reaction kinetics and semi-batch process parameters are used for process simulations. Data exchanges between the process and operations levels were achieved through the OLE for process control (OPC) protocol with real-time chemometrics modeling of in situ spectroscopic measurements. At the operations level, multivariate statistical models were utilized for continuous process improvement in conjunction with profit maximization and environmental waste considerations at the business/enterprise level. In silico optimization of consecutive semi-batch epoxidation reactions was performed using MATLAB/Simulink. Pareto-optimal operating parameters within the design space that considers product quality and process efficiency, profitability, and environmental impact were arrived through systematic simulations conducted using design of experiments (DoE) and partial least squares (PLS) modeling. A simple three-tier methodological framework was proposed to bridge process development, profitability, and environmental assessment. Through such a framework, the links between process, operations, and business/enterprise levels toward sustainable development and product value chain become more transparent. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated demonstrate how process development choices could impact business/enterprise decision-making.

J	Liu, C				Liu, Chang			A bionic incremental model of the fashion industry value chain based on a multicellular network	MEMETIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Multicellular structure network; Fashion industry; Bionic increment modela; Value-added modes	STRATEGY; SYSTEMS	With the development of the fashion industry, it is useful to analyze its value chain increment mechanism in different social environments and economic development situations. In this paper, we propose a bionic increment model of the fashion industry value chain (FIVC) based on a multicellular network structure. First, we summarize the main factors influencing the increment in the FIVC, and regard these as symbiotic biological tissue cells in a multicellular network structure. We then explore the relationships between the cells of different biological tissues in various simulated environments. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the FIVC based on our multicellular network model. A simulated analysis based on a simplified six-cell network is used to demonstrate the flexibility of the bionic increment model. In the six-cell network, the profitability of an enterprise is determined by its four abilities: (1) basic operational ability, (2) human resource utilization, natural resource development and utilization ability, (3) marketing ability, and (4) fashion brand influence, and scientific innovation ability. Through the simulation results, we find that the multicellular tissue network model can effectively simulate the incremental process of the FIVC, which conforms to the intuitive cognition. It can help an enterprise to predict and regulate its value chain increment, and thus has both practical and theoretical significance.

For Ambalavao Atsimondrano located in the suburban area of Antananarivo, Madagascar, the horticultural chain appears as a buoyant sector; many rural or urban households are dependent upon it. Despite the reputation of the region in this field and support from different organizations, Rural Microenterprises (RMEs) encounter problems in their development. This study highlights the factors blocking entrepreneurial development including education of horticultural entrepreneurs and their ability to deal with complex situations. The aim of the study was to identify the factors affecting the growth of RMEs. A focus group on 33 small farmers considered as RMEs was conducted taking into account their individual characteristics. A typology and value chain analysis resulted in their classification and in comprehension of their empowerment in management. The results indicated that there were 3 types of entrepreneurs or promoters: the experienced traditional (36%), the educated young (33%), and the professional young (31%). Ishikawa diagrams highlight the problems related to entrepreneurial development in funding and information systems. Our conclusions insist on the necessity of improving communications strategies among microentrepreneurs, guidance for entering the market, and professionalizing the horticultural trade, while emphasizing the importance of cooperation between producers.

This study used data collected from five districts in rural Rwanda under supper food project between August and September 2014. The study applied a stochastic profit frontier model to data collected from 846 households growing sweetpotato, among which 327 were value chain participants; 312 were "spillover" households that received planting material from participant households, and the remainder control households with no project links. Results showed that average level of profit efficiency in sweetpotato production systems is 55%; suggesting that an estimated 45% of profit is lost due to the combined effect of technical, allocative and scale inefficiency. The profit efficiency of participant households was 64% compared to 20% of the control households. Moreover, the profit efficiency of the female beneficiary, female spillover, and male beneficiary households was found to be 55%, 70%, and 90% against 17% for male control households, respectively. Findings suggest that an orange-fleshed sweetpotato based value chain intervention can enhance the profit efficiency of the poor and disadvantageous households, if designed with special attention to women's needs. Thus, polices and programs aiming at improving the livelihood of smallholder should be designed targeting women and resource poor.

J	Botha, FC				Botha, Frederik C.			Sugarcane RD&E: over managed and underperforming?	SUGAR INDUSTRY-ZUCKERINDUSTRIE			English	Article						innovation; technology funnel; project portfolio; code of conduct	INNOVATION	In general, few productivity improvements in sugarcane have occurred during the past three decades. At the same time, production costs have increased and production statistics reflect decreased yields globally. In comparison to the 'golden years' of new technology and improved germ plasm in the second half of the previous century, little more than optimisation of existing practises has emerged from the past two decades. Given the slowdown in new technology delivery, it is not surprising that many industries have placed more scrutiny on how they manage their Research & Development institutions and investments. The result of this 'slowdown' has created a perception that poor management of research projects and programs by scientists is at the core of the problem. This has led to the introduction of 'real' managers with the subsequent management of R&D as if it is a 'normal' production and sales business through well established 'business models'. Strong emphasis has been placed on project selection, project management and minimising risk. Research, especially in the discovery phase, is a very high-risk endeavour and a high proportion of all projects fail. Institutions that have a low appetite for risk quickly run out of new technology innovation. Because of the inability to predict, a discovery project cannot easily accommodate management issues such as budgeting, milestone definition and timeframes. Managers generally prefer D and Extension over R because of the higher predictability and lower perceived failure rate. The key to proper management of R&D is a recognition that researchers and managers operate under very different codes of conduct. If this is not properly managed, then conflict between researchers and the rest of the business follows. It has become customary to view RD&E as a unit following a 'systems' approach. Despite obvious advantages of this approach, it often fails to recognise the most significant shortfall(s) in the value chain. This practice can unnecessarily inflate the cost, slow project progress and is dependent on consensus that tends to favour the lowest common denominator or more vocal team members. Consensus and innovation tend to be opposing objectives, as innovation requires thinking with an 'outside the box' mindset. Consequently, innovation can be stifled using this approach. Peer review is a great tool to measure progress in projects and selecting projects for development. It is not suited for selection of new innovative ideas. With no obvious improvement in technology delivery and adoption, it is timely to ask whether the current approaches are achieving their objectives. In addressing this question it is important to look at the global evolution of R&D models and modern trends in highly innovative businesses. Instead of trying to ensure that every research project entering the technology funnel delivers a product, a greater emphasis is needed to create an innovative environment where all role players are focussed on key strategic objectives, and all research results are seen as key learnings for future deployment.

Recent changes in legislation and payment models have intensified a shift from volume-based to value-based care, transferring risk from payers to providers. The American College of Radiology's Imaging 3.0 initiative encourages radiologists to become leaders in this changing health care landscape, helping to redefine value relative to health outcomes that matter to patients. Finding value and areas for improvement can prove difficult. However, through the imaging value chain, a plethora of opportunities are easily identifiable. It will be critical for musculoskeletal radiologists to leverage information technology and develop meaningful metrics to assess and demonstrate imaging's contribution to improved patient outcomes and reduction in costs, and to advocate for appropriate reimbursement.

J	Komen, SK; Ngeny, JM; Osena, E				Komen, Simeon K.; Ngeny, John Mark; Osena, Emily			Bridging the potato variety gap: a review of the Kenya - The Netherlands potato project (2012-2015): its success, challenges and opportunities	OPEN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Variety introduction; market niche; variety evaluation; intensive management; accelerated availability		Potato is Kenya's second most important staple crop which contributes immensely to the food security and income of smallholder farmers in the Kenya Highlands. Despite its importance however, crop yields are very low (7.7 to 9.5 t/ha) against a potential of over 40 t/ha. Many reasons are cited to explain this including inadequate good quality seed of suitable varieties, seed recycling, low soil fertility, limited use of agro-chemicals and leaf diseases. Potatoes were introduced in the late 19th Century from Britain and later Germany. During the 1980's several Dutch varieties were brought in for evaluation but the process could not be completed as the test sites were allocated to other uses. This review highlights progress made with new varieties in terms of evaluation, registration and the associated technology identifies challenges and solutions. Until 2012 only 15 varieties had been in commercial use, mostly originating from temperate countries with a few local releases in collaboration with the International potato center (CIP). With increased demand for processed potato products driven by the urban middle -income population, and its preference for fast foods, there was need for high yielding varieties. Since 2012 over 100 Dutch and local varieties have been evaluated under conventional performance trials at seven locations spread across different potato-growing counties. Normal agronomic practices were followed and several yield parameters were measured. Several high-potential Dutch varieties failed due to their susceptibility to low management practices. From these, 33 varieties have been released from seven Dutch companies and local breeders and two parallel evaluation procedures have been conducted since 2013 one conventional and one intensive. Consequently, 44% and 56% of the released varieties came through conventional and intensive channels respectively. In terms of usage, those released consist of 61% for table use and 39% for processing. Mean tuber yields of controls under conventional and intensive evaluations when compared, indicates 191% increase. Accelerated availability of superior varieties can be achieved through collaborations with countries with well-developed potato value chain. Local varieties under good management can increase tuber yield substantially.

The project involved literature research, on-site visits and meetings with farmers, research institutions and stakeholders, information compilation, database establishment and a project webpage. A strategy with three main objectives and associated actions was implemented. The first objective focused on the improvement of scientific and technological knowledge of East African research organizations. For this, state-of-the- art research on innovative technologies and practices for enhanced product quality was assessed; a web-based knowledge-sharing platform was created; the "East Africa Potato Research and Knowledge Exchange Forum" was constituted and six meetings with visits were realized. The second objective focused on private and civil society actors and governmental services and aimed at reinforcing their capacities for generating and adopting innovative technologies and practices. Sixteen innovation sessions were conducted. Guidelines for enhancing product quality along the potato value chain in East Africa were elaborated and disseminated. The third objective targeted governmental bodies with competences in policy-making for promoting changes in policies. Proposals for policymakers were developed and transferred to relevant authorities.

First, the biopharmaceutical process are mapped to the cloud platform, which can not only adapt to the revolutionary changes in the way of biopharmaceutical research and but also build a network management platform for pharmaceutical research and development. Secondly, based on the green crowd, we reconstruct the organization structure of the cloud platform, production process, and value chain-driven portfolio, etc.Then, we divide the core of the cloud platform architecture into five substages. The green screening, reorganization, and crowd data processing will be completed by the cooperation of these stages. Finally, the drug green crowd architecture is embedded into the time domain conversion interface and the state transition interface. In addition, the state energy consumption model of the biological pharmaceutical cloud platform is constructed. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional task-driven energy consumption management mechanism, the proposed management mechanism can ensure higher throughput, higher effective flow rate, and higher effective energy consumption ratio.

The approach to portfolio management requires attention to the integrated management of projects; this is why the organizational structure matrix "differentiated" could be a useful reference point. This chapter proposes, therefore, a reworking of the organizational structure design criteria considering both the Value Chain of Porter is the matrix structure "differentiated". Ultimately, the contribution configures the characteristics of the organizational model for portfolio in relation to the type of project - internal/process, external/product mix - in order to improve the performance of internal projects whose objectives are not always explicit. The basic idea of this work is to apply the concept of Porter's value chain not only functions but also the portfolio of projects that the company has.

In addition to the major automobile companies, Japanese investors have also invested in small and medium enterprises in automobile parts and components in Thailand. Since the 1980s, the automotive industry has been a driving force of the Thai economy. Currently, Thailand is one of the world largest automobile producers. In this study, we analyze the global input-output table. Backward and forward multiplier analysis is used to conduct interindustry linkage analysis of Japanese automotive industry. Unlike a conventional trade statistical analysis, this global input-output table allows for the analysis of interconnection between economic sectors around the world. From our multiplier analysis, Japanese automotive industry has high backward linkages domestically. Internationally, its forward multiplier is among the top five after metal, chemicals and rubber, electrical and optical equipment, and wholesale and retail.

VALUE CHAIN OF SHALLOT AGRIBUSINESS IN MEDIUM LAND OF MAJALENGKA, WEST JAVA, INDONESIA	SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						value chain; shallot; marketing patterns		This study has a purpose to assess the value chain of shallot agribusiness in medium land of Majalengka. The data is collected through interview using a questionnaire that was prepared in advance. Respondents in this study include agroinput actors, growers or shallot farmers, market participants (wholesalers, retailers), financial institutions, partner institutions, and required resources.

It was proposed to make a small empirical model to test the impact on satisfaction, taking as a case study Leonisa.com the Colombian company, which operates in Europe through electronic commerce. It was found that the mixture of quality throughout the value chain can generate satisfaction and customer loyalty, so a strategic orientation towards quality and innovation in e-commerce can maintain and positioning the company in a very competitive market.

B	Berberich, R	Camilleri, MA			Berberich, Roland	Camilleri, MA		Creating Shared Value and Increasing Project Success by Stakeholder Collaboration: A Case in European Manufacturing	CSR 2.0 AND THE NEW ERA OF CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP	Advances in Business Strategy and Competitive Advantage (ABSCA) Book Series		English	Article; Book Chapter							CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; BUSINESS; CSR; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; SOCIETY; GROWTH; TRUST	This chapter introduces the idea of accessing new resources by collaborative interaction with stakeholders to optimize the value chain and product development process. It is acknowledged that Creating Shared Value (CSV) could be a value driver by revisiting the supply chain (Porter & Kramer, 2011); however, in a world of scarce and often inaccessible resources, wastage is becoming increasingly detrimental. With project expenditure rising (PMI, 2012) and continuing high rates of failure (Balogun & Hope Hailey, 2008; Langley, 2014) small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) could find themselves in a position where crucial innovation becomes unaffordable and non-achievable. It is suggested that utilizing ` the crowd', pragmatically incorporating collaborative engagement with stakeholders, could not only alleviate this problem but increase project success rates, lower costs and allow SMEs to fulfil social responsibilities with CSV.

After reviewing existing frameworks that highlight different MNC choices regarding the integration, responsiveness, and dispersion of firm value chain activities, I perform a cluster analysis on a comprehensive and confidential database of US MNCs. The results reveal five configurations which both support the importance of key insights from existing frameworks while at the same time highlighting underexplored configuration characteristics, like the low levels of integration in US MNCs, the global sourcing arrangements for accessing foreign inputs and distribution, different approaches to regional expansion, and the limited geographic expansion of US MNCs pursuing product diversification. I argue that these underexplored characteristics suggest directions for future research to better reflect the international configuration choices of MNCs.

Richard, II; Dmytriyev, Sergiy; Elias, Allison			Integrative Stakeholder Engagement: Stakeholder-Oriented Partnership Between the Coca-Cola Company and World Wildlife Fund	STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT: CLINICAL RESEARCH CASES	Issues in Business Ethics		English	Article; Book Chapter						Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder-oriented partnership; The Coca-Cola Company; Sustainability; Freshwater conservation	RESPONSIBILITY; CORPORATE	Stakeholder engagement lies at the core of stakeholder theory even though management scholars have not researched engagement thoroughly relative to other aspects of stakeholder theory. In fact, practicing managers, not academics, have led exploration of and innovation in stakeholder engagement. This paper provides scholars with analysis of a practical integrative stakeholder engagement conducted by The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) in partnership with World Wildlife Fund (WWF). This case is unique in that the analyzed integrative stakeholder engagement was both extremely successful and sustainable by going beyond the original partners and spreading among stakeholders across the entire value chain and beyond. Triggered by community concerns in India, TCCC's best practices in engaging multiple stakeholders to preserve freshwater spread across all continents and went on to be adopted by other companies and their stakeholders which were outside of TCCC's direct reach. The analyzed case is also valuable in showing that TCCC, though enjoying the leading position in its industry and having considerable influence over its value chain, chose to engage stakeholders in its freshwater conservation initiative through a collaborative, dialogue-based process, demonstrating a stakeholder mindset both on the part of the company and multiple stakeholders.

This paper analyzes the concept of scalability in entrepreneurship in order to increase understanding of the subject, its benefits and challenges in practice. The documentary research shows that most of the characteristics and challenges of scalability in both types of enterprise are similar, although social enterprises have some peculiarities mainly associated with research and development of low cost, maintaining an affordable price, integration of a non-traditional value chain, involvement with the market, generating social capital and the establishment of a necessary linkage with sustainability.

Methodology: A multiple regression analysis was employed to assess the combined effect of the knowledge bases, factors such as age of the household head, land size, marketing channels and geophysical factors (such as land slope) on linseed productivity. Findings: The findings reveal no differences in productivity between trained and untrained farmers. They further show that training and the interaction between training and experience positively influence productivity. Our findings, however, reveal farmer education to have an inverse yet insignificant effect on productivity. Furthermore, we found that factors such as the slope of the land and the choice of marketing channel also play an important role in influencing productivity. Practical implications: Moving away from the traditional top-down approach could be the answer to avoid a mismatch between the information given by trainers and what the farmers actually need. Theoretical implications: The study used interaction variables of knowledge bases, and attempted to demonstrate the importance of a tacit knowledge base, which is often not well documented and therefore neglected in research. Originality/value: The research demonstrates the combined effects that interactions between several knowledge bases have on the productivity of linseed farmers.

This often involves identifying root causes or other major factors that impact process performance in value chain. Extant literature has confirmed that root cause analysis (RCA) tools have individual attributes to identify the root causes. However, there is a gap in respect of identification of the relationships among different root causes such as interaction between different causes and levels of significance of each cause. Besides, ways for structured integration of RCA tools applications is also missing. This paper provides: 1) the procedure to identify the significance and relationships of root causes; 2) a framework for RCA tools application in an effective sequence to identify the root causes systematically and accurately for problems of different nature.

We propose online real estate management system that includes advanced modules that can be bundled together, creating differentiation and enhancing the value chain. We propose a simplified implementation architecture for an integrated demand and supply chain management system for online real estate services. We use a formal specification language for specifying the functional components of the demand chain management system and interaction with real estate entities and actors. We choose an open source Customer Relationship Management system as a platform to manage some of the online real estate modules. Other value-added modules are integrated from third-party providers using their open interfaces.

J	Crawford, M; Ferrier, G; Griffith, G				Crawford, Maria; Ferrier, Greg; Griffith, Garry			Non-compliance with Market Specifications in a Victorian Pasture-fed Beef Value Chain	AUSTRALASIAN AGRIBUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						non-compliance; market specifications; pasture-fed; beef; value chain		Pasture-fed beef is being increasingly demanded by global beef consumers. However, pasture-fed beef value chains are struggling to maintain continuity of supply and consistent quality of product year round. Pasture-based production systems are influenced extensively by environmental conditions, pasture species, grazing management and livestock management systems. This variability, compounded by variability in market outcomes, could have a significant impact on the long term viability and profitability of producers in the value chain. This study aimed to assess the level of non-compliance in one southern pasture-fed value chain, with the intention of using the results to focus further work on areas of production and supply most critical to sustaining the market. Nineteen months of carcass grading data over 2012 and 2013 from almost 63,000 cattle were evaluated to determine the levels of non-compliance with the relevant company specifications. Hot standard carcass weight, P8 fat depth and sex were the carcass attributes that were compared and analysed. The 2012 data set comprised 3,905 heifers and 9,922 steers. Some 66% of the heifers and 62% of the steers did not meet the preferred company specifications for carcass weight and fat depth. For heifers, the cost of non-compliance was estimated to be $63 per carcass and for steers it was $47 per carcass. The 2013 data set comprised 19,099 heifers and 30,014 steers. A total of 78% of the heifers did not meet the highest value specification on the grid, with more than 50% of heifer carcasses being too light. Just on 60% of steer carcasses did not meet the 2013 weight and fat specifications with 39% of all the steers being overweight. The foregone value in non-compliance for heifers was estimated to be $84 per carcass and, for steers, $87 per carcass. Across the whole dataset, the weighted average cost of non-compliance was $78 per carcass.

S	de Rozario, P		Alijani, S; Karyotis, C		de Rozario, Pascale			THE INNOVATION DILEMMA IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY: FRENCH DOMESTIC CREDIT INSTITUTIONS	FINANCE AND ECONOMY FOR SOCIETY: INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY	Critical Studies on Corporate Responsibility Governance and Sustainability		English	Article; Book Chapter						Globalization; banking industry; innovation dilemma; European credit institutions; finance global value chain	CHAINS	Purpose - This chapter addresses the issue of value creation in the retail banking sector, focusing on France. The author shows that since the 2007 financial crisis, banking organizations have used a disruptive innovative approach to regain the trust of retail banking customers. This innovative hybrid design is not only driven by efficiency and fully dematerialized solutions, but also considers human, social, and territorial development aspects. Methodology/approach - This chapter is based on an EU statistical analysis (2009 - 2013) of two strategies used by French, Italian, and German national banks to manage the 2007 financial crisis: closing retail bank branches and lay-offs. Interestingly, in France, bank units and employee numbers fell the least. A complementary qualitative analysis of the principal banking innovations promoted by R&D directors helps to explain the main features of the French strategy to cope with the mistrust of clients and employees. Findings - Though low-cost models are promoted as major innovations today ("banking is necessary, bankers are not"), and result in massive offshoring and restructuring levels to face new global competitors such as Google, Amazon, and PCCW-HKT, the French retail banking sector, previously state regulated but progressively deregulated, has adopted an original strategy to regain trust and loyalty. Rather than adopting these low-cost models strictly, with full dematerialization, it focuses on balanced innovation - such as the "neighbourhood bank format," which improves knowledge of the expectations and needs of local clients and environments. These solutions are not only global or local, but a mix of both dimensions. Research implications - Global industries like finance are embedded in both territorial and historical relationships and governance. This means that they can only be observed from this dual perspective, which is a dilemma that characterizes today's economy. Innovation decisions and design particularly illustrate the banking sector's embeddedness, with the dichotomy between fully digitalized options and fully territorialized services. Therefore, innovation is neither a "Champion" or leadership question, nor a mere ICT option. It is a hybrid combination to restore trust and relations. Practical/social implications - The implications of such a balanced approach to innovation are highly important in terms of offshoring, layoffs, and outsourcing practices, which are adopted as essential, and taken for granted by owners and CEOs in global value chains such as finance. The given data and analysis give concrete means to integrate local cultural and institutional habits, so that innovation make sense to stakeholders. Originality/value - This chapter suggests a critical approach to innovation strategies and trends in the finance sector.

The following four articles are from four scholars who delivered speeches and engaged in dialogues at the seminar focused on the opportunities and challenges China faces as it pushes financial innovation against the backdrop of the One-Belt-One-Road Initiative. How should China enable the critical regions involved in the One-Belt-One-Road Initiative to develop rapidly? How should its leaders advance domestic structural adjustments in China? How should they effectively improve China's relationship with the countries along the route of the One-Belt-One-Road Initiative? How should the Chinese government further enhance an atmosphere of mutual trust with the US government to pursue development through cooperation instead of confrontation? The One-Belt-One-Road Initiative should have its own core values as well as platforms and mechanisms for dialogue. In addition, China should attach importance to financial infrastructure construction and promote industrial cooperation.

GENDER EQUITY AND ACCESS IN THE CARIBBEAN ICT SECTOR	COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL: DIGITAL EMPOWERMENT: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF INCLUSION IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN	Studies in Media and Communications		English	Article; Book Chapter						Gender-sensitive research; gender mainstreaming; females; ICT policy; Caribbean development; ICT4D		Purpose - This study examines the problem of unequal access to the Caribbean ICT industry on the part of women, and considers causes, consequences and possible solutions. The latter includes integrating gender perspectives in ICT policies and programmes to increase access for all to education and employment opportunities for national development. Methodology/approach - Mixed Methods research techniques (questionnaire surveys, elite interviews and focus group discussions) were used to collect data from national stakeholders in Jamaica and St Lucia. Findings - Despite policy commitments to gender equality and the deployment of ICTs to promote development, significant gaps persist between policy and practice. Results show that disadvantages in ICT access for women result in gender differences in sector involvement. Gender socialisation and the resulting discrimination in education and employment undermine commitments to inclusive development. Consequences include untapped opportunities for innovation, efficiency and business along the ICT value chain relating to development. Research limitations - Case studies only represent Anglophone Caribbean and may not reflect all subregional contexts. Practical implications - The paper demonstrates the value of collecting, analysing and using data disaggregated by sex to identify needs of vulnerable groups relating to inclusive development. Social implications - Equitable access to ICTs for women through training, community Internet-access-points, and support to establish/expand Micro Small and Medium-sized Enterprises will enable women to combine paid and unpaid family caregiving work and to participate in the ICT value chain. Originality/value - There is a dearth of gender-based analysis of ICT policymaking in the Caribbean. The paper contributes theoretical, methodological and policy analysis geared towards understanding and promoting inclusive access and gender equality in ICTs for sustainable development in the Caribbean.

Daniell) is a West African shrub which is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Its importance for local people in Benin has been little documented. This study takes up this issue and was carried out to assess local knowledge, use value and the economic importance of the species for local people. Ethnobotanical and economic surveys were conducted with 606 respondents from 13 socio-cultural groups in southern Benin. Ethnobotanical and economic indices (citation frequency, ethnobotanical use value and mean income generated) were computed and their significance tested using generalized linear models and Kruskal and Wallis tests. The results showed that S. dulcificum was well known to local people in southern Benin (100% of respondents), who mostly grew it in their home gardens. All parts of the plant were used, mostly for medicinal, food and spiritual purposes. Knowledge of the shrub and its use value varied among the socio-cultural groups, decreasing along a gradient from south-east to south-west. Knowledge and use value were also dependent on gender, age and activity, and concentrated among men, adults, elderly people and traditional healers. Economic data showed a short marketing chain. The low average income generated by selling the fruit (about US$ 28 yearly per seller) reveals the low economic value of the species, which is a declining subsistence resource. Optimising the conservation and uses of the species would require (i) nutritional, phyto-chemical, pharmaceutical, phenological, morphological and genetic investigations, (ii) the development of sylvicultural method, (iii) inclusion of the species in formal conservation policies and (iv) development of a value chain by establishing a structured production channel.

J	Garcia, HC; Kolbe, D				Garcia, Haydee Calderon; Kolbe, Diana			Dynamic capabilities of Eport Service Providers in the Fruit and Vegetable Sector: Approaches to Overcome Internal Export Barriers	GERMAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			German	Article						dynamic capabilities; distribution of fruit and vegetables; export performance; export service provider	BORN-GLOBAL FIRM; MARKET SUCCESS; PERFORMANCE; INTERNATIONALIZATION; COOPERATIVES; PERSPECTIVE; INNOVATION; VENTURES	Intermediaries are the mainstay of fruit and vegetable commercialization in foreign markets. However, they face strategic problems that undermine their competitiveness and impede their international development. In order to compete in export markets, these mainly small and medium-sized enterprises require dynamic capabilities which are not possessed by all of them. Existing research has not fully researched dynamic capabilities which determine the success in the exportation of fresh fruit and vegetables. Based on seven indepth interviews, our contribution in this work is to determine what specific dynamic capabilities of the fruit and vegetable distributing companies contribute to an improvement in the export performance. The results of the conducted explorative and qualitative study show that four dynamic capabilities, the relationship management, the consumer orientation, the transparency and the communication along the value chain and brand management can help to solve most of the internal barriers and strategies and as a consequence influence positively in the export results.

The protracted crisis has wrought a number of significant changes within the Spanish communications sector. A prime example is the Prisa group, Spain's "national champion", whose total annual revenues in the wake of a long string of divestments have shrunk to levels similar to those the company reported in the early nineties. Within the "mutating oligopoly" that has always dominated the sphere of Spanish communications, the Telefonica group has re-entered the media landscape as a television broadcasting company and the void left by the retrenchment of Prisa has been filled by Planeta and Mediapro. The research presented here was undertaken to provide an analytical overview of the current status of Spain's major communications groups, the significant changes the communications sector has undergone in recent years and the threats it faces going forward.

Logistic regression analysis was employed to test the model on primary data collected from a sample of 315 Albanian farmers engaged in the production of sheep and goat milk. The study results support our hypotheses that trust, uncertainty and investment in specific assets are key determinants of long-term relationships. Implications at managerial and policy-making levels are discussed. At a managerial level, dairy owners and managers need to build trust with farmers and mitigate uncertainties as a precondition for long-term relationships. At the policy level, the government subsidy schemes need to be further refined in order to motivate farmers to increase flock size and strengthen vertical relationships in the dairy value chain, the latter being a precondition also to achieve traceability and improve standards.

However, uncertainty about the production and market environment of such a non-traditional commodity can be a major hindrance against commercialisation and scaling out of irrigated fodder production. This makes ex-ante analysis of profit portfolio and its determinants necessary in order to improve farmers' investment and risk management decisions. Using a stochastic approach to farm profit analysis to account for business uncertainty, this paper simulated and compared the level and distribution of profit that smallholders in Koga irrigation scheme (Ethiopia) can generate from irrigated Rhodes grass seed and from traditional irrigated crops. The finding shows the absolute and comparative profitability of irrigated Rhodes grass seed. Though 0.19 times less profitable than irrigated onion, irrigated Rhodes grass seed is 4 times, 1.27 times, and 1.25 times more profitable than irrigated barley, irrigated wheat, and irrigated tomato, respectively. Profit from the commodity is robust to adverse business conditions such as yield reduction, cost increase, and price reduction, assuring optimism about positive financial returns from investments to expand production. Long-term business viability can be improved and farm income further stabilised through interventions targeted at fodder agronomy to enhance crop yield and at value chain development to improve market linkages and output price.

An answer to global value chains and cost minimization	REVESCO-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS COOPERATIVOS			Spanish	Article						Cooperation; microfirms; SME; strategic management; technology adoption; informal economy	INNOVATION	The aim of this article is to analyse the cooperation tie between small and medium enterprises in the footwear industry like a response to the global value chain and cost minimization. Statistics data from governments and research projects are analysed. 81 small and medium enterprises participating at the Al-Invest were studied. The principal result is that the cooperation tie is the development factor and the family is the genesis of generating value. The conclusion is that enterprise internationalization has a positive impact under the local system, only when the cooperation mechanism exists, including in poor economies with obstacles for innovation.

The post hoc study contributed to the grouping and estimation of cost drivers, the accumulation approach allowed the valuation of processes of the whole human resource within the company. The activity-based costing is considered as an alternative solution to the problems posed by traditional methods of costing in this type of organizations. The distribution of fixed costs and expenses in the agencies of the company allows to add the whole budget, to analyze the participation of activities in the areas of the value chain and the fixed cost in the value chain. The activity weights allow to pay for activities based on classification according to criteria. The selection of cost drivers, moreover, depends on the selection of cost drivers by production line and the cost-benefit analysis by production line.

The study focuses on the synergies and connections with the urban dynamics, the general touristic attractions in the city and, more specifically, with the gastronomic offerings in the city and the region. Firstly, we analyze the gourmet store market, locations, product categories and distribution channel access to the local market. We study the difficulties inherent in the insertion and actual visibility of these products in the local touristic offering. We identify and enumerate deficiencies, weaknesses and opportunities to enrich the touristic offering and to expose and consolidate the image of Cordoba as a culinary tourism destination of excellence. Finally, is detected the need for a redefinition of its commercial and sustainability strategies and its adequate insertion in the value chain of the local and regional gastronomic offer.

J	Hilary, RS; Kibwika, P; Sseguya, H				Hilary, Rugema Semaana; Kibwika, Paul; Sseguya, Haroon			Partnership construction and value co-creation to address voids in rice production: The case of rice value chains in Uganda	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE			English	Article						partnership construction; co-creation; value chain; network; one stop center farmer associations		Since the establishment of One Stop Center Farmer Associations (OSCAs) in Uganda 13 years ago, no documentation of the work done had been carried out. This study was conducted on the partnership and value co-creation initiatives implemented by two OSCAs in the rice value chain in Luwero and Bugiri districts, Uganda. The methodology used involved use of semi structured interviews and check lists for focus group discussions as well as key informant interviews. Eight focus group interviews were conducted, with an average attendance of six members per group (48 members) in Bugiri and 48 members in Luwero district. Interviews were also conducted for 44 key informants. A total of 140 respondents were interviewed both in the focus group discussions and as key informants. The information was analyzed with NVIVO software. Findings indicate that partnership construction and value co-creation occurred in the OSCA value chains, but have not yet reached the ideal status, although they have advanced through the stages of development. There is an increased number of actors with vast interests interacting with the OSCAs for value co-creation. However, the cooperative co-creation of value along the chain requires a focus on achieving all actor value propositions as well as optimal outcomes for all. The study, therefore, recommends that in the process of constructing partnerships and co-creation, it is necessary to be aware of differences in each actor's views, motivations, and ways of working. This will lead to complementing each other through realizing and accepting differences to make the partnerships work.

They are also the main cooperative partners in the Silk Road Economic Belt Based on the WIOD noncompetitive input-output tables of these three countries from 1995 to 2011, we first structurally decompose the main factors affecting the proportion of those countries' agricultural outputs in terms of GDP. We also investigate the different effects of four categories of factors, namely intermediate inputs, consumption, investment and exports. We find that intermediate inputs and consumption are the main forces behind the decline in the proportion of agricultural GDP in these three countries. Furthermore, the different intermediate inputs of industries and the different degrees of consumption of various sectors can result in different effects. In contrast, however, investment and exports tended to drive increases in the proportion of agricultural GDP in China, Russia and India.

J	Keca, L				Keca, Ljiljana			Value Chain Analysis and Socio Economic Aspects of Non-Wood Forest Products in Central Serbia	AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE			English	Article						value chain analysis; non-wood forest products; socio-economy; trends; market; Serbia	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENT; BIOECONOMY; SERVICES	The value chain represents a detailed outline of the process that a product or service passes from raw materials, production and distribution to the consumer. The analysis of this process is the core of this research that examines the development opportunities of a sample of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) based on the sustainable use of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) in a specific area of Central Serbia. The research focuses in particular on the dynamics of purchasing and marketing on NWFPs, both in terms of quantities and market value. The subjects of the research are:purchased and sold quantities in analyzed companies, as well as the prices of these products in the market. The research included 55 companies engaged in purchasing, processing and sale of NWFPs. The response rate in the research was 87.3%. In this paper, the following NWFPs are considered: mushrooms, medicinal and aromatic plants and forest fruits. All interviews, which were conducted, contained qualitative and quantitative questions and a section of socio-economic questions. The data are divided into those related to the purchase of raw materials, the sale of final NWFPs on the domestic market, and to NWFPs export. The aim of the research (in terms of the analyzed companies) were: income / outcomes, processing facilities, supply, export destination, price (purchase and sale) and distribution channels. The primary use of parametric statistics through regression analysis was to determine the average annual growth rates (AAGR) (in the purchase, sale on the domestic market and exports). The most of the SMEs in NWFPs sector of Central Serbia are situated in rural areas (app. 67.4%) and 63.5% are small and micro enterprises. All of them are privately owned. Most of the SMEs in Central Serbia are engaged in mushrooms and forest fruits business (83.3%). SMEs in NWFPs were only working at 52.5% of capacity. Regarding the quantity of NWFPs that are processed and placed on the domestic and foreign markets in Serbia, fungi were the greatest product in the period examined (1993-2014). In Central Serbia export orientation of NWFPs is higher by 2.57 times, compared to sales on the domestic market. The most common value chain is: supplier-processor-wholesaler- retailers-consumers.

J	King, B; Hill, M				King, Barbara; Hill, Megan			Mapping the extension capability of the Goulburn Valley fresh pear network	RURAL EXTENSION AND INNOVATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						social network; information access; farmers; advisory services; information networks		Declining demand for canning and fresh pears, along with rising costs and diminishing returns, mean that Goulburn Valley pear growers are facing major production, market and investment decisions. Access to information and support about market opportunities, consumer preferences and quality protocols is critical for growers making reinvestment decisions; however increasing privatisation of advisory services makes it more difficult to source information. This study used social network analysis to understand how a sample of 25 pear growers use information networks to support their production and investment decision making. The findings show that growers' closest information-sharing relationships are with family members, staff and close neighbours. Fruit Growers Victoria and marketing agents are important sources of marketing information while some growers travel overseas to seek information. Industry and government organisations could strengthen the network by providing greater opportunities for growers and other stakeholders throughout the value chain to connect and share information.

Leakey, RRB		Protecting the Rights of Farmers and Communities While Securing Long Term Market Access for Producers of Non-timber Forest Products: Experience in Southern Africa	MULTIFUNCTIONAL AGRICULTURE: ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA			English	Article; Book Chapter								The participatory domestication of agroforestry trees as an incentive to alleviate poverty, malnutrition, hunger and land degradation has to be linked to the commercialization of the products in ways that ensure that the farmers are the beneficiaries of their germplasm improvement activities, as well as from the marketing of the products. Currently, international law is deficient in providing adequate protection of the rights of poor farmers and their communities, as the legal instruments of Intellectual Property legislation are focused more on the protection of commercial companies and entrepreneurs. PhytoTrade Africa is engaged in addressing the sustainable use and commercialization of natural products produced by indigenous plants, especially trees of the Miombo woodlands in southern Africa. Initially the market focus has been on wild-harvested naturally occurring resources using innovative approaches to protecting the Intellectual Property Rights of poor communities and the businesses they work with, including Patents, Trademarks, and Geographical Indicators, with the intention of securing long-term strategic market access and to be able to influence commercial strategy. The approach which has been developed is to work with indigenous communities and local companies and to help them to secure long-term access to these markets through the protection of their intellectual property rights. Experience to date indicates that, by enabling market opportunities for these local resources, significant livelihood options for otherwise marginalized farmers and producers can be facilitated. Partnerships between producers and the local-to-global cosmetic, food, beverage, herbal medicine and pharmaceutical industries are developed by carefully constructing commercial agreements with leaders in the relevant sector. Critically this involves the establishment of a strong and viable trade association that is forward thinking and market oriented. Through these partnerships it is possible to ensure long-term relationships and supply agreements. Such agreements ensure that the target producers remain in the value chain. This paper also explores opportunities for protecting farmer-improved germplasm through the registration of Plant Breeders Rights in compliance with the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) and proposals for an affiliated African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI).

B	Leakey, RRB	Leakey, RRB			Leakey, Roger R. B.	Leakey, RRB		The Role of Tree Domestication in Value Chain Development	MULTIFUNCTIONAL AGRICULTURE: ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA			English	Article; Book Chapter								Internationally, there is interest in increasing the trade in "green" market products, such as organic, fair trade, reduction of forest degradation for reduced deforestation and mitigation of climate change, and environmental goods and services. This crucially needs to be extended to the many poor, hungry and marginalized smallholder farmers in developing countries. In this context, agroforestry tree domestication has made great progress over the last 20 years, especially in Africa with the emergence of many new tree crops for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries across many agroecological zones. Tree domestication is important for the enhancement of economic returns as value chains from local to global become more sophisticated and demand higher quality, greater uniformity and a regular and continuous supply. Local farmers are now developing cultivars creating direct benefits from the marketing of food and nonfood products in local and regional markets. This creates business and employment opportunities in local cottage industries. Likewise, through the indirect environmental and ecological services provided by trees, food security can be greatly enhanced by closing the yield gap (the difference between the potential and actual yield) of modern crop varieties. In this way, agroforestry is adding income generation to agroecological approaches which together reverse the cycle of land degradation and social deprivation and transform the lives of poor farmers. However, these benefits do not come without some risks from the loss of genetic diversity, local rights over genetic resources and exploitation by unscrupulous entrepreneurs. Agroforestry developments are therefore focusing on better access to "green" business opportunities for poor smallholder farmers in Africa by maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks.

J	Luo, Y				Luo, Yu			Development of the foreign trade economy of china under the new normal context of global trade	AGRO FOOD INDUSTRY HI-TECH			English	Article						Global trade; the new normal feature; China's foreign trade; the principal component analysis		The development of the world economy drastically changed since the global economic crisis, and the status of global trade is renewed. China experienced unprecedented progress as the country adopted an open economy, the reform implementation, and the rapid advancement of foreign trade, which effectively promoted social and economic development and improved the international influence of the country. The four main features of the new normal global trade are summarized based on the literature findings. These features include low-and medium-speed growth, regionalization and grouping, the "South rising North", and the contraction and reconstruction of the global value chain. Import and export trade volumes were analyzed in the current study. The six basic influencing factors were established by studying the index system of the foreign trade economic level of China. The factors that influence the foreign trade economic level of China were examined by employing principal component and nonlinear regression analyses, and the correlation was determined. A regression model was established, and the development trend of China's foreign trade economic level was predicted.

S	Malcolm, B		Bhalla, PL; Singh, MB		Malcolm, Bill			Agribusiness Perspectives on Transgenic Wheat	WHEAT BIOTECHNOLOGY: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS	Methods in Molecular Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Agribusiness; Transgenic wheat; Wheat; Value chain	MODIFIED GM TRAITS	Declining yields of the major human food crops, looming growth in global population and rise of populism, and ill-founded bans on agricultural and horticultural crops and foodstuffs which are genetically modified have potentially serious implications. It makes the chance less than otherwise would be the case that agribusiness value chains in the future will meet the growing demand around the world for more and different foods from more and wealthier people. In the agribusiness value chain, transgenic wheat, meeting a consumer "trigger need" also must meet the "experience" and "credence," risk-related criteria of well-informed consumers. Public policy that rejects science-based evidence about the reductions in costs of production and price of genetically modified agricultural products and the science about the safety of genetically modified foods, including transgenic wheat, has imposed significant costs on producers and consumers. If the science-based evidence is accepted, transgenic wheat has potential to improve significantly the well-being of grain growers and consumers all over the world.

The research findings revealed that the production of open-pollinated bitter gourd seed was profitable and the net return was BDT 42,018/ha (1 USD = 78 BDT) with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.28. The net return was BDT 124,097/ha with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.53 for the hybrid seed of bitter gourd. Different marketing channels were used to sell bitter gourd seed. Of them, value chain-I: seed producer - seed company - seed wholesaler - seed retailer (district level) - seed retailer (sub-district level) - seed user and value chain-III: seed producer - seed company - seed wholesaler - seed retailer (sub-district level) - seed user were found more efficient than other value chains. Consumer paid lower price in value chains-I and III.	[Mallick, Soma; Shivakoti, Ganesh P.; Datta, Avishek; Kuwornu, John K.

J	Jimenez, KM; Yaguache, JVO; Escalante, MGT				Marlow Jimenez, Kevin; Ordonez Yaguache, Jose Vicente; Tapia Escalante, Max Gustavo			Productive specialization by a multi-criteria selection process that considers water use of the products in the province of loja, ecuador	REVISTA CIENCIAS ESTRATEGICAS			Spanish	Article						Climate change; multi-criteria; water use; territorial specialization; potential commodity chains		Climate change is impacting food sovereignty in various populations; however, considerations such as water use in the commodity chain thrust have not yet been analyzed in depth. There are various studies on commodity conglomerates and territorial benchmarking that identify winner or potential winner sectors, which identify chains that are competitive in "sugar", "spices and condiments", and "coffee" manufacturing (UTPL, 2011). However, water use as a key factor in territorial specialization has not been taken into account as selection criteria. It is estimated that in Ecuador there is a water use of 2.007 cubic meters per year per inhabitant; 88% of which is internal; this implies several challenges, including the need to consider factors associated to climate change when creating local plans and projects. Considering the provinces with greatest surface of agricultural units, based on data from INEC, Manabi has 15.8%, Guayas has 11.2%, Loja has 7.6%, Los Rios has 7.3%, Esmeraldas has 7.1%, and so on. Loja does not have the highest productivity in the majority of crops and is characterized by a low water use. This proposal seeks to establish guidelines for socio-environmental creation and management of projects based on the use of a multi-criteria methodology considering factors such as water use for the selection of potential commodity chains. The results obtained are tools for decision-making as they allow to direct public and private efforts toward the activities with highest potential in the territory.

Currently the farm gate production of Tasmania's bioeconomy contributes around 7.4% to the overall Gross State Product (GSP). This figure is considerably higher than for Australia, where the bioeconomy contributes 2.5% to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Based on this measure, Tasmania's economy is more in line with the economies of Brazil (5.7%) or New Zealand (7.2%). It is estimated that Tasmania's bioeconomy currently contributes 16-20% of overall economic output, when taking into account the economic impact of related value chains that reach from agricultural suppliers to retailers. Government policy for economic growth in Tasmania aims to build up this sector over the following decades. To achieve the stated growth targets, technologies must be combined with business capabilities in order to effectively and efficiently commercialize innovation while maintaining sound environmental practices. A technology-driven, irrigation-led transformation is currently underway in the state, turning Tasmania's bioeconomy into a highly knowledge-intensive sector of the economy. To fully realize the economic, environmental and social potential of investment in irrigation infrastructure, there must be similar investments in research, knowledge creation, marketing, value chain innovations and capability development.

Increasing business competition and information technology development have both led to huge corporate organizational changes and have raised the importance of intangible assets along the value chain. Value creation and the success of organizations increasingly depends on the leverage of knowledge available internally, as nowadays it has become essential to understand employee portals' business value and to build adequate change management programmes. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Strategy Map (SM) show an organization's objectives, how they are achieved, and the link between the goals of the various sub-units and how these act together to produce the overall results. BSC and SM clarify how intangible assets are aligned with strategy, to create value for the organization. However, the concerns related to change management seem not to have been properly addressed. To conveniently deal with these matters, the authors propose a framework to map the cause-effect relationships that generates business value, as well as provides top management and decision makers with the information needed for a suitable top-down commitment and sponsorship, which is essential to bring about the appropriate change management and benefits' realization. SM and Benefits Dependency Network (BDN) were combined, resulting in a suitable framework to help organizations enhance their knowledge, mitigating the risk of investment failure or misuse, and a timely contribution to capture more value from investments in intangible assets. The developed framework helps organizations address their concerns related to value creation and change management, and it has been applied to this Employee Portal case study. This case study allows us to conclude that, although the promotion of organizational culture and corporate alignment are not usually frequent goals of organizations, and do not motivate investments in the development of employee portals, they are generally recognised as being essential tools for decision-making and value creation.

Consequently, requests from governments, customers, manufacturers, and other interested stakeholders, for environmental information about aerospace products are becoming widespread. Presently, requests are inconsistent and this limits the ability of the aerospace industry to meet the informational needs of various stakeholders and reduce the environmental impacts of their products in a cost-effective manner. Energy consumption is a significant business cost, risk, and a simple proxy value for overall environmental impact. This paper presents the initial research carried out by an academic and industry consortium to develop standardised methods for calculating and reporting the embodied manufacturing energy content of aerospace products. Following an action research approach, three potential methods are identified and applied in a real manufacturing environment. Suitability for use across the aerospace value chain is assessed. The benefits, implementations issues, areas of data uncertainty, and differences in results are outlined. Results show companies could be over/under reporting the embodied manufacturing energy content of parts by a factor of 10. The subsequent business and EU policy implications for industry reporting and evaluating product risks are discussed. The paper concludes the novel research outcomes will be valuable to businesses and other interested stakeholders seeking to report or understand the embodied energy content of aerospace products and associated data uncertainty, as well as inform the development of future industry standards.

Usually, there is a trade-off between value chains that focus on being responsive to customer needs and those that focus on supplying at the lowest possible cost. If demand uncertainty is low, a low-cost value chain is the best strategic fit; conversely if demand uncertainty is high, a responsive value chain is the best fit. A poor fit means lower chain surplus to be shared among the chain participants. We provide an outline of an analytical framework for determining the optimal level of responsiveness for a food value chain. We then present and discuss two case studies. Both feature initiatives aimed at internalising positive chain externalities and capturing chain goods within the Australian beef value chain. We use our framework to show how these initiatives are predicted to promote responsiveness and thus achieve a better strategic fit and higher surplus for the whole chain. Verifying that such a move would indeed contribute to higher chain surplus would require some new measurements of whole-of-chain outcomes so that the economic relationships making up the framework could be estimated and analysed.

Capability Database of Injection Molding Process-Requirements Study for Wider Suitability and Higher Accuracy	JOURNAL OF POLYMER & COMPOSITES			English	Article						Process capability database; injection molding; process variation; tolerance standard		Generally, there is little disagreement that an early consideration of dimensional accuracies achieved in production is conducive to the success of development of injection molding products. While different process capability databases (PCDBs) provide guidance for a meaningful estimation of the expected part variation, the adoption of corresponding guidelines and (proprietary) software tools seems to be, however, limited in industrial practice so far. This research paper addresses the gap between the available PCDBs and the requirement of designers in practice and investigates the key drivers for an improved applicability of corresponding database solutions in an industrial context. A survey of database users at all phases of product value chain in the plastic industry revealed that 59% of the participating companies use their own, internally created databases, although reported to be not fully adequate in most cases. Essential influences are the suitability of the provided data, defined by the content such as material, tolerance types, etc. covered, as well as its accuracy, largely influenced by the updating frequency. Forming a consortium with stakeholders, linking database update to technology changes and connecting dimensioning standards to database offerings are proposed solutions.

Effective innovative development of industry in the EU is provided through support for inter- industry contacts within the cluster organizations. Target setting. Due to deepen cooperation between domestic and European business, there is a practical need for the development of the cluster concept of the national economy on the basis of European experience. Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. The problems of cluster networking companies actively studied in western and domestic economic science. Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. However, missing are studies that have analyzed the types of clustered services and analyzed the prospects for their development. It should be noted that the establishment of the necessary infrastructure cluster is the basis of effective cluster cooperation that promotes competitiveness at all levels. The research objective. The article is the study and analysis of approaches to design and implement different types of cluster services provided by the cluster services in the European Union. The statement of basic materials. The authors summarized practical experience of European cluster services in an organization such as market research, mediation in finding partners, project support, organization of technology transfer and support in obtaining financing. We demonstrate the role of these services in enhancing inter-sectoral innovation cooperation network participants. Conclusions. Cluster organizations provide the appropriate enabling environment for the development of advanced technologies and new business models, acting as "kickers" to attract companies and research institutions from different sectors and countries to jointly develop innovative solutions. They also facilitate the access of SMEs to global value chain and facilitate their participation in long-term cooperation with strategic partners from other countries.	[Palyvoda, O.

The success of companies operating in various sectors is determined by the quality of products, while the quality is ensured by qualified employees having appropriate skills and knowledge, whose work should be appreciated by monetary work pay established based on reasonable and clear criteria as well as other means of motivation. The process of human resources management in a business company places an ever-growing importance on the development of competences of employees, strengthening of cooperation, empowerment of employees as well as their work pay and motivation in order to achieve an employee's work quality and productivity, satisfaction of customer needs and successful operation of a company. In the process of the company's human resources management, special focus should be given to the satisfaction of the expectations and needs of new employees (who are usually young and inexperienced) as well as their integration, which ensures the generation of new and creative ideas in the company and, at the same time, high quality of products and work productivity.

This approach can also be the basis for the growth of the value of integrated companies or groups, strategic projects and economic sectors. The mineral resources sector is characterized by a high level of vertical integration, and its own effect of technological, economic and institutional factors that determine the value of mineral assets and products. Assessment of value of the projects of the sectoral level can be carried out with the application of the concept of added value and value chains designed on this basis. The aim of the present research is to substantiate scientifically an approach to assessing the project for establishing the tin industry in the Republic of Kazakhstan taking into account the concept of value added. We use the following research methods: comparative analysis, system approach, strategic analysis, and managerial decision-making methods. Scientific novelty of the research consists in the following: the research identifies specific differences in designing value added chains in the mineral sector that include economic, technological, and institutional factors; the research shows that the specifics of mining projects determines the value of mineral assets and the entire value added chain; the algorithm for assessing the strategic investment project of the sectoral level in the mineral resource sector includes an assessment of effects for the main stakeholders(1); the organizational-economic mechanism for creating the tin industry based on the development and comparison of different options of value added chains. The object of the research is a project on creating the tin industry in the Republic of Kazakhstan on the basis of Syrymbet tin deposit. The research justifies the application of the value added concept for selecting one of the options of the project of deposit development; we propose a model for designing the value added chain in the mineral sector, develop an algorithm for creating the tin industry, taking into account the interests of the state and subsoil users. The results of the study can be used by mining companies and by state authorities that manage subsoil use, because they complement existing methods for assessing strategic sectoral projects with new effects and help manage them. In continuation of the research we plan to carry out quantitative evaluation of various effects of the strategic project and comparative analysis of the variants of value added chains in the organizational-economic mechanism of formation of the tin industry in Kazakhstan.

J	Satria, D; Li, E				Satria, Dias; Li, Elton			Contract Engagement in the Small-Scale Tuna-Fishing Economies of East Java	BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						contracts; fishers; intermediaries; social capital; transaction costs; Indonesia	TRANSACTION COST ECONOMICS; INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS; RISK PREFERENCES; PERSPECTIVE; TRUST; MARKET; ORGANIZATION; MIDDLEMEN; GROWERS; TRADERS	We examine the informal contractual relationships formed by artisanal fishers (AFs) and intermediaries in the small-scale tuna-fishing economies of East Java, Indonesia, using data from a survey of 436 boat captains. Our exploration of the factors motivating AFs to engage in such contracts uses instrumental-variable probit regressions to control for endogeneity in our transaction-cost economics model. This model incorporates the importance of household characteristics, transaction characteristics, transaction costs, risk behaviour, and trust in the choice of contract between AFs and their intermediaries. These intermediaries play an important role in facilitating transactions and contractual relationships between AFs and processors in the marketing value chain. We find that social capital is a statistically significant instrumental variable in our model. We also find that risk behaviour and trust are not statistically significant in influencing the choice of governance structure. Penulis menelaah hubungan kontraktual informal yang dijalin oleh para nelayan terampil (artisanal fishers, AF) dan para pedangan perantara pada perekonomian perikanan tuna skala kecil di Jawa Timur, menggunakan data survei dari 436 orang kapten kapal. Eksplorasi kami terhadap faktor-faktor yang memotivasi para nelayan terampil untuk terlibat dalam kontrak-kontrak tersebut menggunakan variabel instrumental regresi probit untuk mengendalikan endogenitas pada model ekonomi biaya transaksi. Model ini menggabungkan karakteristik rumah tangga, biaya transaksi, karakteristik transaksi, perilaku risiko, dan kepercayaan sebagai variabel-variabel yang memepengaruhi keputusan untuk melakukan perjanjian kontrak antara nelayan terampil dan perantaranya. Para perantara memainkan peran penting dalam memfasilitasi transaksi dan hubungan kontraktual antara nelayan terampil dengan pengelola dalam rantai nilai. Temuan kami menunjukkan bahwa modal sosial merupakan variabel instrumental yang signifikan dalam model, sedangkan perilaku risiko dan kepercayaan bukanlah variabel yang signifikan secara statistik dalam mempengaruhi pilihan struktur tata kelola.

It should clarify which measures and activities a fashion company needs to integrate in its value chain in order to offer branded second hand merchandise in a self-operated store. The research paper relies on a desk-based research and aims to illustrate the topic by means of a descriptive approach, processing the existing literature. Key findings demonstrate that fashion brands need to integrate complete lifecycle strategies, sustainability communication, and reverse logistics structures, like take-back schemes, for offering second hand clothing. The main limitations evolve from the research design. Further, empirical evidences need to be conducted for a more fundamental understanding of the new business model.

J	Sukphisal, B; Wongsurawat, W				Sukphisal, Burin; Wongsurawat, Winai			Challenges for the development of an integrated agro-food-energy-biochemical nexus in Thailand	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Thailand; Bio-energy; Bio-refinery	POLICY	Purpose - This paper aims to synthesize the history of bio-refinery in Thailand and analyze the public policy challenges hindering the industry's growth and development since year 2000. Design/methodology/approach - The authors assembled dispersed data on the industry structure, history of investment and the current state of bio-refinery in Thailand from numerous public organizations and media outlets. The chronicle covers the initial launching and subsequent market growth of ethanol, biodiesel and bio-chemicals. The most innovative analysis in this study is the identification of the key players in the bio-refinery value chain. The authors supply insights about each player's stake, bargaining power, strategies and relative success/failure during the past few decades. Findings - Instead of working together to develop bio-refinery, it appears the Thai petroleum companies, policymakers and automotive companies often delay or block developments that would benefit bio-fuel and bio-chemical producers and crop growers. Conflicts of interests have caused policymakers and regulators to favor already overly protected industries. Seventeen years of bio-fuel policy from 2000 to 2016 has shown that the major objectives of the government's bio-fuel/bio-refinery policies have failed. Originality/value - Using Thailand as a case study, this paper illustrates the critical role of politics, special interest groups and lobbying in determining the viability of bio-fuel/bio-refinery industries in developing countries.

J	Tury, G				Tury Gabor			The impacts of technology and work organization innovations on the automotive industry's spatial structure: empirical evidence from Volkswagen	TER ES TARSADALOM			Hungarian	Article						automotive industry; global value chain; work organization; structural transformation; Volkswagen		During its history, automotive production developed from craft production into a globally organized industry with an international production and distribution network. During the past 140 years, since Nikolaus August Otto's patent of the four-stroke internal combustion engine, it became obvious that innovations in technology and work organization play key roles in the sector's structural transformation and that decisions about them determine their vertical integration. Such innovations also include the distribution of competencies affecting the vertical and horizontal resource allocation. This study analyses this structural transformation, describes in detail its most important stages and highlights their impact on the spatial production patterns. As a part of this, it examines the relationship between Fordist mass production and the evolution of international production, considered to be an early phase of globalization in the automotive industry. However, the greatest impact on the industry's worldwide organization and geographical distribution was not mass production but rather lean production methods originating from Japan before the Second World War. Nevertheless, the global adaptation of these changes emphasizing the corporate organizational system and in-company relations had to wait until the 1980s. This also changed the relationship between the parent company and its subsidiaries and, in turn, the spatial pattern of automotive production. The study analyses the technology outsourcing and modularization processes and the work organization innovations introduced during the period, explaining their consequences for geographical production patterns. In addition to the historical overview, the above insights are also confirmed via the investigation of Volkswagen's development between 1960 and 2010. The firm's internationalization process during this period work organization and technological innovations had a significant impact on the company's spatial organization. Through the expansion of opportunities (i.e., developments in technology and labor organization, information technology and communication developments), the geographic structure of Volkswagen's operation underwent significant change. Finally, the geographical transformations also modified the global automotive industry's value chain configurations resulting in its current shape.

Methods: This paper analyzes the nature of financing lease and explores the simulative influence of financing lease on regional economic development, value chain innovation, cross-border operation and coordinated development on this basis, to discuss how to fully play its economic role in the background of overall innovation-based economic development in China. Results: As an important means of industrial upgrading and social transformation, financing lease should be innovative in terms of ways, ideas, and forms in the context of innovation-based economic development. Conclusion: The innovative development of financing lease has become an inevitable trend, which requires more and more enterprises to improve their original management pattern in the financing lease. What's more, it devours those who are reluctant to improve. The development of innovative economy is advancing with the time, which is constantly moving forward.

The value chain involves stake-holders with varied responsibilities in the cyber-market. Cloud computing emerged out of virtualization, distributed and grid computing, and has altered the value creation landscape, through strategic and sensitive information management. It offers services that use resources in a utility fashion. The flexible, cost-effective service models are opportunities for SMEs. Whilst using these tools for value-creation is imperative, a myriad of security concerns confront both providers and end-users. Vulnerabilities and threats are key concerns, so that value created is strategically aligned with corporate vision, appropriated and sustained. What is the extent of impact? Expert opinions were elicited of 4 C-level officers and 10 security operatives. Shared technology issues, malicious insiders and service hijacking are considered major threats. Also, an intuitive strategic model for Value-Creation Cloud-based Cyber-security is proposed as guidance in fostering IT-enabled initiatives.

Natural Gas Liquefaction Technologies - An Overview	OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE			English	Article								The liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry continues to play an important role in the global energy market. As the liquefaction process is the critical segment of the LNG value chain, this review describes and compares five of the most significant recent and emerging liquefaction technologies: propane precooled mixed refrigerant, Ap-X (R), dual mixed refrigerant, mixed fluid cascade, and optimized cascade. In addition, since the liquefaction train is the core of the liquefaction process, three key components of the liquefaction train are analyzed: refrigerant compressors, compressor drivers and heat exchangers. The size of liquefaction trains has grown steadily as developers seek to realize economy of scale in order to achieve lower unit costs. Technology selection of process and equipment should be based on technical and economic considerations including experience, reliability, process efficiency, site conditions, and environmental impacts.

Pinsent Masons has a ground-breaking team of research analysts providing the firm with in-depth sector and market analysis. This innovative approach has benefits for Pinsent Masons and also for the research team. These include increased visibility within the firm and developing a role as a trusted adviser to the business. The team are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, including experienced law librarians. In this article, Kelly and Helen, who are both from a law librarian background, will explain Pinsents' unique approach to business and sector insight. The article covers how the team adds value to the firm and charts the development of our existing skillsets to meet this new challenge. The article also includes some practical insight into approaching business research and how to overcome common obstacles, notably the challenge in expanding our output from traditional legal research to more business and commercially aware pieces.

But it is essential to shift the farmers towards organized sector to ensure fair practices. This is possible by improving the backward linkages through extension advisory services. So a study was taken up with the objectives of analyzing marketing efficiency of milk types of Karnataka milk federation and to map the present backward and forward services rendered to producers and processors. Value chain analysis method was used where in range of actors involved in the business were interviewed to collect data. Marketing efficiency was arrived at using secondary data. Among 4 types of milk, 'Shubham' milk expressed highest marketing efficiency due to its high fat percentage. Al services (100%), obtaining feed at discounted price (88.33%) and availing veterinary services (75.84%) were the backward services availed by majority of producers. More than half of the dealers (58.34%) received advisory services on storage of products and sweet preparation. Six predictors-total milk production, milk retained for family, annual income from livestock, backward services availed, herd size and price of the milk explained 99.8 per cent variation (r(2)=0.998) in the amount of milk sent to cooperative societies by the producers.

J	Ryynanen, T; Rusko, E				Ryynanen, Toni; Rusko, Elina			Professionals' View of Consumers' Packaging Interactions - A Narrative Analysis	PACKAGING TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE			English	Article						packaging; consumer; narrative analysis; qualitative research		The consumer's role in the packaging value chain thinking has increased. This paper identifies the basic functions of packaging as well as the importance of the visual and structural elements from the consumer's view. However, it is unclear what packaging experts associate with consumers' packaging interactions. Professionals working in the field are still in the key position of defining directions in the packaging industry. The paper investigates how professionals perceive consumer interactions with packaging, and identifies challenges in consumer-centred packaging development. The research materials were collected from 14 theme interviews with representatives of higher education, packaging research and packaging design agencies. As a result, five narratives and five challenges for consumer-centred packaging development were constructed. The narratives describe the following: (a) the symbiotic product-packaging relationship; (b) the everyday context highlighted in purchase and use situations; (c) how consumers become aware of packages; (d) a fashion system of packaging; and (e) everyday routines and rituals involving packaging. The aims of the paper are to raise the awareness of how professionals perceive consumer interaction with packaging, to provide insight into factors relevant for consumer-centred packaging development in industry and to identify the potential challenges, from the professionals' view, for adopting a consumer-centred model.

J	Sedana, G; Astawa, ND				Sedana, Gede; Astawa, Nengah Dasi			Panca Datu Partnership in Support of Inclusive Business for Coffee Development: The Case of Ngada District, Province of Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia	ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						inclusive; business model; value chain; economic incentive		Coffee development has big potential as coffee is one of the globally traded commodities in the world. Arabica and Robusta are the most popular coffee varieties produced by smallholder farmers in Indonesia, including those in Flores Island, Nusa Tenggara Timur Province. The produce of this island is well known in the global market as Flores coffee. Coffee farmers have poor knowledge and skills in farm management, which, along with poor postharvest practices, had contributed to low productivity and low quality of coffee beans. A project (AIP-PRISMA) has been implemented in Ngada District in Flores Island with the goal of increasing productivity and developing goodquality coffee. This study aims to describe the model business implemented in coffee development and the roles of actors involved in the business model. Ngada District was purposively selected as study site because a coffee development center exists in the island. Data were collected using focus group discussion (FGD) and documentation techniques. In this study, data collected is fully analyzed using descriptive method. The results of study pointed out that there are five main value chain actors involved in the market system. The first three are the coffee farmers' cooperative, PT. Indokom Citra Persada (coffee exporter), and the Bank of Nusa Tenggara Timur (a local government bank). Also, there are two supporting value chain actors, namely the Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI, a research institution), and VECO-Indonesia (an international non-government organization or NGO). Inclusive business among the actors was based on a business model. There is a strong partnership among the five actors locally called panca datu (panca is five, and datu is element). Sustainability of inclusive business is happening because each actor plays the roles and generates an economic incentive for each.

VALUE ADDITION AND EXPORT PERFORMANCE OF MANGO FRUIT IN INDIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Marketing; Pickle; Pulp; Squash and Ice cream; Export		The present study on "Value addition and export performance of mango fruit in India" was conducted in Northern parts of Karnataka based on the highest area and production of the fruits with the objective to analyze the value addition costs and returns in value chain management and its performance in international markets. The results revealed that, the total cost incurred in marketing each quintal of mango fruit and pickle was -417 and -466. Similarly, -590, -564 and -543 were the costs found to be incurred in marketing hundred litres of mango pulp, ice cream and squash. Difficulty in raw materials procurement (sourcing the raw materials) and inadequate grading, processing, storage, market information and transportation facilities were the major problems faced by the marketers in marketing the different value added products of mango. Nepal is unstable importer of Indian mango because it retained only 1.84 per cent of its share from the previous year by losing 98.16 per cent to Bangladesh. Saudi Arabia was the most unstable importers of Indian mango during the study period as the country did not retain any amount of its share from the previous year. As per this paper, large quantities of mango fruits are wasted during its peak season. So, apart from minimizing the wastage of the fruits, processing and preservation of mango is also necessary because of its rich nutritional value.	[Shwetha, M.

Before the table upgrade, Visy Paper 2 had limited stock activity on the bottom wire, resulting in less than optimal turbulence to assist in drainage as well as formation. To compensate, machine speed and formation was mostly governed by the addition of drainage/retention aid chemicals. The doses of drainage aid required to achieve desired speeds appeared to negatively impact paper strengths.

J	Soutar, BM				Soutar, Bradley M.			Winner of the New Speakers Contest at the 2016 Appita Fibre Value Chain Conference	APPITA			English	Article								The Maryvale Mill's conventional Kraft batch digesters play a significant role in the manufacturing of Australian Paper's high quality packaging papers. Ensuring that every available minute is optimised is crucial in supplying the highest quality unbleached Radiata Pine Kraft pulp to Maryvale's three packaging paper machines. Batch digester cycle times are under constant review for improvement opportunities, especially when it comes to utilising or minimising wasted cycle time. Optimisation drives regular trials, some of which provided support to reconfigure the steaming/heating process in order to improve overall performance. Further troubleshooting around elevated "total cycle time" on certain individual digesters unveiled deficiencies associated with the depressurisation configuration. Consequently, improvements were made to digester steaming/neating configuration and depressurisation strategy. This enabled cook temperature to be reached more quickly and elevated cook temperatures to be maintained for longer. Overall digester steaming/heating time was reduced while cooking time was extended subsequently due to reduced cooking temperature. These improvements provided the opportunity to increase pulp production by 20ADT/day and minimise steam usage by 16%.

Ecuador is known as the main banana exporter in the world, and this product represents 28% of agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP), banana accounts for 2% of Ecuador's total GDP. There are approximately 7 300 banana farmers in Ecuador the bulk of whom are located in "La Provincia de El Oro", a primarily coastal region with weather conditions ideally suited for banana production. The El Oro Province, according to an Agriculture land and production poll 2013 report (knows in spanish as ESPAC), has about 4 000 banana farmers covering 64 000 hectares of farm land and anual production of 2 600 000 tons of bananas. This represents 43,3% of all Ecuadorian banana production. This Project will provide a detailed description of the value chain of banana production; including the farm production process, industrialization, marketing and distribution, transport, and final consumer receipt. The description of the full banana production life-cycle will allow for comprehensive analysis of both economic and market factors which impact the banana farming industry. For banana farmers, prices are set by the National Goverment who consider factors such as customer demand, product appearance and overall quality. Given the steady climate, Ecuadorian bananas are harvested year round, however the proce paid by exporters fluctuates, which causes farmers to make various adjustments and other considerations along the value chain,	[Saltos, Maria Beatriz Garcia; Maldonado, Fernando Juca] Univ Metropolitana, Quito, Ecuador; [Maldonado, Oswaldo Marcelo Juca] Univ Tecn Machala, Machala, Ecuador		Saltos, MBG (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana, Quito, Ecuador.	bachigar@hotmail.com; fjucam@gmail.com; rudyj80@hotmail.com		Juca Maldonado, Fernando/0000-0001-7430-2157			Arias P., 2014, ESTUDIOS FAO PRODUCT, V1; Centro de Comercio Internacional, 2015, EST COM DES EMPR; Food And Agricultural Organization of United Nations, 2012, COMM PROD; Frances A., 2001, ESTRATEGIAS EMPRESA; Givnish T.J, 2005, P BIOL SCI, V272; Porter M., 2002, VENTAJA COMPETITIVA; PORTER M.E., 2010, VENTAJA COMPETITIVA; Porter M.

A STUDY ON FINNISH SMEs	MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING REVIEW			English	Article						competitively distinct operations; high efficiency operations; turbulent business environment; operational performance; financial performance	FIRM PERFORMANCE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; STRATEGY; INNOVATIVENESS; FLEXIBILITY; ORIENTATION	Aligning resource choice and operations decision in the value chain (input-process-output) is one of the most important functions of a firm not only to make its operations to be competitively distinct but also very important for the firm's growth and survival. However, the role of competitively distinct operations in maintaining better performance in dynamic and changing business environment has remained unclear. Therefore, this paper examined the relationship between competitively distinct operations, high efficiency operations and operational performance (research model one). In the similar manner the relationship between turbulent business environments, operational performance and financial performance were also examined (research model two). The study was conducted considering survey responses from 61 small and medium size enterprises from Finland. Correlation test and structural path modelling was used to test and validate the proposed hypothesis and research model. The results showed that competitively distinct operation enables high efficiency operations, which influences operational performance positively and significantly. In the similar manner, operational performance influences financial performance positively and significantly. Likewise, turbulent business environment was found to have a negative impact on operational and financial performance. The research findings are found to be adequate enough to highlight the importance of aligning resource choice and operations decisions in reducing the impact of turbulent business environment on organizational performance.

Family ties, preconceived images and trust: How local community defines market collaboration in the Dutch fish chain	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Collaboration; Networks; Social factors; Trust; Value chain	SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; EMBEDDEDNESS; NETWORKS	Vertical chain collaboration is a strategy for customers' value creation. However, Dutch fishermen are hardly participating in integrated value chains. While supply chain literature describes factors that contribute to successful chain partnerships, scarce research has been done on the dynamics of the sociocultural context for chain collaboration. In 10 semi-structured interviews, representatives of supply chain parties were asked for their perceptions on chain collaboration, trust, and the role of the local community. The interviews were directed at obtaining so-called 'tacit' knowledge, the non-spoken codified truths of social networks. Without generalizing, this research provides benchmarks to monitor how the different domains, laid out in this study, impact chain collaboration: community values, network participation and company competences. An overview is given of socio-economic factors blocking and enhancing chain collaboration at company and community level. Factors such as the strong bonding of family with business in tightly knit networks, a high level of social control, entrepreneurial autonomy, and loyalty as community norm hamper collaboration within the supply chain. Respondents' discourse demonstrates that cultural codes and identity form the very core of the entrepreneur, driving rather than 'embedding' economic behavior. Kinship, religion and peer pressure determine 'windows on the world' when engaging in chain collaboration. Consequently, any analysis of economics that does not integrate sociological and psychological methodology is flawed from the outset. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data were gathered from individual chain members through qualitative interviews and analyzed according to definitions of concepts in the literature and their arrangements within a conceptual framework. We identified several fragmentations that constrained value chain performance and weakened its integration. The major causes of fragmentation were a lack of value chain thinking, opportunistic traders, weak cooperative organizations, poor information sharing, and less support from the malt factory and breweries to upstream members of the chain. A conceptual framework was designed to guide future analysis, open managerial and policy dialogues, and initiate questions for future research to identify new ways of linking small-scale farmers to the large agro-processors in Sub-Saharan Africa.

J	Norris, S; Norris, C				Norris, Stuart; Norris, Chris			Modelling the sugarcane value chain: A real time decision making tool	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article						sugarcane; sugarcane harvesting; harvesting; logistics optimisation; web-based tool		While readily able to account for cash costs in the harvest and transport links of the sugarcane value chain, the Australian industry does not currently have any way of evaluating the impact on industry value of these operations. The harvesting sector is generally compensated for tonnes harvested, without consideration to either cane quality or recovery of pre harvest cane. Growers are compensated for product supplied to the mill based on tonnage and sugar content as determined by the CCS formula, which can be shown to overestimate actual recoverable sugar under conditions of high extraneous matter in the milled product. Significant previous work in Australia and internationally has generated datasets which correlate harvester operation and sugar recovery, however this work generally focussed only on a single 'relationship'. There has been limited work in the development of more sophisticated models which evaluate the impact of multiple factors on the value chain. Published work on harvesting losses and the impact of cane quality on mill recovery, as well as our research on harvesting losses has been used to develop a sophisticated 'harvest and sugar recovery value chain' model. This model has been used by the Australian industry and international clients, and has now been developed into The Sugarcane Harvesting and Logistics Optimisation Tool (SCHLOT), a web -based multi -parametric mathematical model. SCHLOT takes physical and agronomic properties of the crop, field configuration and transport systems, harvester configuration and operation and both harvester and grower payment systems. This information is used to derive probable cane yield, composition and quality, and financial implications along the entire value chain in order to estimate final sugar, molasses and bagasse production as well as financial performance of each sector. The impact of each 'phase' on direct costs and crop value is considered, allowing users to balance direct costs against value destruction. At the field level, this allows a harvesting operating strategy to be agreed prior to harvest which results in the highest net return, with consideration to 'starting' value, loss of value and direct costs. At the Industry level, the tool allows the impact on all stakeholders of both harvesting practices and harvest payment systems to be evaluated.

J	Paulina, NT; Carlos, TT; Oswaldo, LB				Paulina, Naranjo-Taco; Carlos, Taco-Taco; Oswaldo, Lopez-Bravo			Integral production chains for blackberry production	CIENCIA UNEMI			Spanish	Article						value chains; marketing; blackberry cultivation; small producers		Blackberry cultivation in recent years has had a growing behavior in the national and international market. In Bolivar, Ecuador, blackberry production is on the rise in the sectors of Guanujo and Chillanes. In the last place mentioned, there is the presence of associations of small producers, and its weaknesses are the marketing and the low prices that they received for their natural product. The objectives allowed the chain mapping, as well as the identification of operators and their functions. A market research that was conducted at the level of final consumers (buyers in supermarkets) and among food service operators in the main hotel plant of Guayaquil, showed results of potential demand and therefore on the basis of this, to plan production, processing and marketing of blackberry pulp. Furthermore, this work demonstrates how in the social-economic sphere it is not contrary the approach and use of administrative-market tools, which are used in an orthodox way at the enterprise level in favor of vulnerable groups such as the small rural producers. The value chain allows improving the income of those involved; creating jobs in the micro-region, being part of the revitalization of the local economy and good living.

Modeling a clinical process for differentiated thyroid cancer health care in Hospital Base Valdivia, Chile	REVISTA DE CALIDAD ASISTENCIAL			Spanish	Article						Disease management; Comprehensive health care; Thyroid neoplasms; Neoplasms		Objective: To design a clinical process model in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer in order to improve accessibility to this treatment. Material and methods: Based on modified Participatory Action Research, a model design process was conducted using a literature review and meetings with organisations committed to the redesigning process, and to agree an improved and feasible process. Results: The process map was constructed by participatory action including, characterisation of the value chain, fault detection in the flow of the process, relevant documents and process for proposing modifications and approvals necessary for this purpose. Links were established between the main process and the support and strategic processes. The participatory model helped to cut the waiting times for diagnosis and treatment of this disease from 12 to 4 months. Conclusions: For each unit to be able to fully visualise the map of the process and understand their contribution as a set of integrated contributions and not fragmented, helps in the comprehensive management of patients and operation processes based on the hierarchical and dominant organisational model in Chilean hospitals. To analyse and remodel clinical processes by participatory action helps to limit failures in the fluidity of care of the patients, by presenting each participating unit with a general view of the process, the problems, and the possible solutions. Furthermore, this approach helps to clarify the process in order to make it more efficient, to harmonise relationships, and to improve coordination in order to optimise patient care. (C) 2015 SECA.

Value Chain Analysis of Animal Feed Sector in Indian States of West Bengal and Odisha	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Value chain analysis; animal feed; chain actors		The animal feed sector in India is not new but performance of the sector is not well understood or documented, even though value-chain analysis provides a methodological tool to do so. To provide a better understanding of the sector, a study was carried out to evaluate the value chain performance of the animal feed sector in two eastern states of India, in terms of value addition, employment and profitability. Quantitative data were collected for each link in the value-chain on operational and financial performance. The strength and weaknesses of each link of the value chain were assessed and appropriate upgrading, management and development strategies were suggested. The results indicated that the animal feed value chain is relatively simple including only five main stakeholders groups; major feed input supplier, minor feed input supplier, animal feed producer, feed marketers and service providers. About 58.26 and 36.47 percent of input is supplied by trader and miller respectively. Capacity utilization in small firms (production capacity <35000 tonnes per year) is 54 percent and in large firms (production capacity >35000 tonnes per year) is 51 percent. Wholesaler is the main actor in forward value chain marketing 46 percent of the feed. Employment generation in small mill was 67 jobs per mill where as large mill created about 144 jobs per mill. Male represent 98 percent of the labour force in the feed producing mills. Feed ingredients cost represent 80-90 percent of the total operating cost of the firms. The major factors impacting on the performance of the value chain relate to inputs, to feed production, to marketing, transportation, sale of product, low value addition on successive links in the chain, and low export. This paper highlights the benefits of value-chain analysis as a useful tool to understand sector performance and argues for its wider use in identifying critical factors and actions to support animal feed sector improvements.

The data collection instrument comprised a (01) in-depth interview guide applied to general management respectively. The findings reveal the construction of the tools for the determination of environmental costs through Porter value chain and environmental ratios as a way to strengthen the range described in the value chain. It was also found that the empirical knowledge of management has allowed them implement actions to protect the environment, because they seek to reuse coffee shell, as a byproduct, and realize that the smoke emanating from the stage of roasting Coffee does not contaminate the environment, however, it is necessary to apply an environmental management system to ensure that the process of making of People's Power for the Environmental. Finally, the structure of environmental costs, allowing the prevention and evaluation of corporate behavior towards the environment was developed.

The environment used to contextualize the information is Romania and CNADNR (Compania Nationala de Autostrazi si Drumuri Nationale din Romania). The literature research, open data as well as my own practical experience are used as entry data for the four parts of the paper: (i) the context leading to the PPMM need identification, (ii) an overview of the existing public (procurement) maturity models; (iii) discussions and (iv) summary, limitations, and outlook. The paper provides arguments of an upstream intervention in the value chain of road transport infrastructure and highlights the benefits of such an intervention. Elements such as Romanian cultural dimensions, type of market structure or impact of the outcomes of public procurement process for road infrastructure are considered relevant entry data for an intervention which aims to contribute to the improvement of performance at a procurement process level. The results of this paper serve as a starting point for further reflection on the performance in road infrastructure public procurement area in Romania. In addition to the awareness of the need for an intervention at a contracting authority level, the paper arguments that market structure or national cultural dimensions must be considered as entry data in designing maturity models.

J	Camacaro, MV				Virginia Camacaro, Maria			APPLICABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT TOOLS IN BUSINESS UNITS OF THE METROPOLITAN AREA OF LIBERTADOR MUNICIPALITY IN THE STATE MERIDA, VENEZUELA	VISION GERENCIAL			Spanish	Article						management; decision; strategy; DAFO; Value Chain		The present study was aimed to determine the applicability of qualitative and quantitative administrative management tools among managers of business units in Merida - Venezuela. This field research is exploratory and descriptive, following as methodological strategy a systematic description of events based on the characteristics of the study sample, which consisted in 84 managers. The instrument that was used for data collection is the questionnaire, with thirty- eight (38) multiple-choice items intended for managers of companies of the productive sector affiliated to the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Libertador Municipality of Merida, Venezuela. The results were presented by a quantitative analysis. Some of the research findings highlight that most of the quantitative tools used by managers to manage their business units are: the cost-benefit relationship, decision graph, basic calculations and least used are indicators of profitability and investment. While qualitative tools used for administrative management are the situational analysis, value chain reengineering and little-used graph problems, DAFO, management indicators, just as the use of qualitative and quantitative tools as a determined of the level of training of managers. Given the findings, suggests extending the studies related to the use of qualitative tools and its organizational relevance, and develop analysis to predict under which conditions the qualitative and quantitative tools are used.

J	Cesario, M				Cesario, Marisa			Coagglomeration patterns in Portuguese labour-intensive industries: complementarity and specialisation dynamics	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The aim of this paper is to analyse the patterns of industrial agglomeration in Portugal in order to understand their underlying dynamics. Industries tend to be concentrated geographically, rather than due to random causes, natural advantages or Marshallian forces. Empirically, industry pairwise coagglomeration is measured using the Ellison and Glaeser (1997) metric, with the goal of understanding the complementarity versus specialisation dynamics behind the industrial geographic concentration in Portugal. It is concluded that the most prominent industrial clusters in Portugal are as follows: textiles and clothing, footwear and transport, each one having a different agglomeration dynamic. While some sectors tend to benefit more from the interdependencies along the value chain (meaning vertical industrial relationships, related to complementary dynamics), others are more vulnerable to labour pooling (more to do with horizontal industrial relationships and specialisation dynamics), and others to both. For policymakers, for instance, it is of great use to know exactly the right triggers as the success of any programme results from the suitability of the initiatives being financially supported.

The concept of the value chain examines development factors in three groups: the leader, the internal environment and the external environment; it also takes into account the time factor. This article also presents the usefulness of three theoretical and conceptual approaches in reference to the idea of the value chain: the theory of development path dependency, the network theory, and the concept of smart specializations.

J	Lamla, J; Laser, S				Lamla, Joern; Laser, Stefan			Sustainable consumption in collectives of transnational value chains: The dynamics of reassembling electronic waste in its political economy	BERLINER JOURNAL FUR SOZIOLOGIE			German	Article						Consumption; Sustainability; Actor-network theory; Value chains; India; Electronic waste; Informal sector; Political economy	VALUATION; SOCIOLOGY; NETWORKS	This paper explores the question as to how excessive patterns of consumption may be transformed in a sustainable fashion by suggesting a change of perspective: to understand issues at hand, the analysis should shift from individual consumers to the collective and its complex value chain practices. Aside of approaches of new economic sociology, the paper builds upon a theoretical framework coined "actor-network pragmatism", which is a pragmatist reading of the actor-network theory inspired by John Dewey's approach on democracy. Ethical questions of sustainable consumption, then, are defined as political issues of collectives in value chains. The study embraces a democratic experimentalism that interprets issues of consumer society and its (side) effects as a challenge to a collective, emphasizing its need of research and reassembling. As an example the paper introduces the transnational bargaining process around the rising amount of electronic waste in India in order to elaborate on this perspective. This case study helps in acquiring more knowledge about the challenges of sustainable consumption its chances, barriers, and how to adapt to the challenges in practice.

J	Omedo, BB; Gowland, MJ; Nicholas, O				Omedo, Bebe Bockline; Gowland, Mwangi John; Nicholas, Ozor			Changes in Agri-Business Outcomes among the Dairy Beneficiaries of Contracted Extension Service Delivery Model in Kenya	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Dairy value chain; private extension service provision; benefit-cost ratio; Quasi-experimental design; Kenya		This study compared changes in uptake of agri-business practices, productivity and wealth creation between dairy beneficiaries and non beneficiaries of Contracted Extension Service Delivery Model (CESDM) implemented by Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Project (KAPAP) in selected counties of Kenya since 2010. Results showed a large increase in the proportion of beneficiaries accessing extension services from private service providers and expressing satisfaction with CESDM, attaining higher dairy productivity in milk and in gross margins per animal per year. However, there was only a marginal increase in willingness to pay or paying for the services and the majority of beneficiaries continued to sell milk through informal market outlets. On aggregate, CESDM posted positive net benefits and multiplicative economic power with the best performing dairy chains multiplying every shilling invested 4 to 46 times. On average, beneficiaries earned KES 4993 per farmer at a cost of KES 353 for services, inputs and equipment. We conclude that CESDM can be a viable and rewarding approach for delivering extension services to smallholder farmers but it is necessary to strengthen farmer cooperative societies because those paying for private services are still too few to sustain remunerative private sector investment in extension service delivery.

Purposive and random samplings were used to select 150 respondents. Data was collected using interview schedule and analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Results reveal that majority (60.7.0%) of the respondents were female, within the age of 36-42years, married (75.3%) and had secondary education (42.7%). Respondents had low knowledge of the proposed ban (58.0%); 56.0% had high awareness of the possible benefits but 56.0% had negative perception towards the proposed ban. There was significant correlation between sources of information (r=0.279, p=0.001), level of knowledge (r=0.281, p=0.001), constraints that respondents may face from the ban (r=0.165, p=0.043), awareness of the possible benefits (r=0.461, p=0.000) and respondent's perception to the proposed ban on cow hide consumption. Since more than half of the respondents had negative perception despite their awareness of benefits, concrete efforts need to be taken to improve livestock production in order to cater for leather industries and consumption.

J	Dao, MCE; Kone, M; Somda, J				Dao, Madjelia Cangre Ebou; Kone, Martine; Somda, Jacques			Livestock feed manufacturing from gathering pods of Piliostigma reticulatum: an opportunity for rural women in Burkina Faso	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Article						fodder; pod industry; exploited potential; commercialization; flour		Piliostigma reticulatum pods are increasingly exploited and marketed in Burkina Faso. As little knowledge exists about this activity, a survey was conducted in 2009 in the northern Sudan zone with 90 persons. Results show that gathering and processing pods is run by illiterate and poor women of 20- to 60-year-old. An average of 20, five and 10 tons is gathered by 20-35-year-old, 36-50-year-old and 51-60-year-old women, respectively. The collected pods are crushed into flour with the help of children. Its sale provides an average income of 40,000, 14,000 and 32,000 FCFA per woman, respectively (1000 FCFA = 1.5 (sic)). The Chi-squared test at 5% revealed that young women under 35 are most interested in sale and are concerned with trade (opportunities, value chain), while oldest indicate weaknesses in management and availability of pods (uncontrolled cutting of trees, bush fires, stray animals ...). Looking for new markets is the main solution proposed by young- and medium-aged women while older women want to fight against anarchic tree exploitation and livestock stray and graze. The results of this study demonstrate that gathering and processing P. reticulatum pods contribute to fight against poverty among rural women, decrease the unemployment rate and provide forage for animal breeders during the dry season.

J	Hohler, J				Hoehler, Julia			Breeders' organisations - driving forces of innovation for German dairy cattle breeding?	BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT			German	Article							COOPERATIVES	Future developments of world food markets present a challenge for agribusiness as a whole. Animal husbandry, one of the upstream stages in the food value chain, can contribute to this by selecting appropriate breeding animals and combining desirable traits. In Germany, animal husbandry in particular bears the stamp of cooperative organisations. Cooperatives are not generally seen as driving forces of innovation; nevertheless, they have for years contributed to a continuously improved performance, and in particular in dairy cattle breeding. Scientific findings on the correlations of innovation, profitability, organisation and networking activities among increasingly competitive animal breeding enterprises are not yet available. By means of case studies and multivariate analysis methods, this article highlights correlations as well as differences between the enterprises, and provides the basis for broader considerations from the viewpoint of animal breeders, breeders' organisations, and politics.

The research was performed through a systematic analysis by integrative contextualization approach, where were identified information on the recognition of the final consumer in relation to forest certification process in seven different countries. The results showed that only a small fraction in the consumer market is aware of the certification process in the forestry sector even in the economically developed regions. The findings show that one of the possible reasons for the increase of production of forest certified products in the last years is less by a requirement of final consumer and more for to a source of the product warranty along to intermediate actors in the forest value chain. There is also the possibility of requirements of forest certification made by intermediaries' agents, in forest supply chain, figure as non-tariff barrier. Moreover, the focus of marketing activities for better efficiency should focus its activities not only in the final consumer, should also focus attention on to intermediaries' agents.

The Influence of Demographics on the Coordination and Assistance of Sugar Industry as perceived by Sugar Cane Growers in Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu	PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Sugar Industry; Tamilnadu; Survival; Sugar Cane Growers		The survival of the sugar industry is extremely dependant on the relationship of that industry with cane growers of the nearby area as it becomes expensive to transport sugar cane from a far off area. Sugar cane the base raw material from which sugar is obtained is the key member in the value chain network of a sugar industry. Sugar industries need to have a motivated team of farmers who can perpetually continue to supply sugar cane to the industry. hence it becomes imperative to understand the perception of sugar farmers and how demographics has an influence over it. The study was conducted over a forty five day period in May and June 2015 at Panruti area in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu and included 105 respondents. This study should help the sugar industries to understand the significance of demographics in the way their role is perceived by the sugar cane farmers. The companies can employ a differentiated strategy based on demographics to ensure the mutual benefit of industry and farmers. Future studies can be based on farmers based on other sugar growing areas as also farmers of other crops who sell their produce directly to industries.	[Justus, T.

J	Blyschak, PM				Blyschak, Paul Michael			LNG in Canada: value chain, project structure and risk allocation	JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW & BUSINESS			English	Article								Given the significance of this crossroads, this article examines the history and modern characteristics of the LNG industry to illuminate the context in which Canadian LNG final investment decisions, whether positive or negative, are being made. In particular, this article examines the different project structures or 'economic models' LNG projects may adopt, as well how these models can impact the value chain and myriad of related contractual arrangements that coalesce to transport natural gas from upstream reservoirs across oceans to downstream consumers. Attention also shifts regularly to the specifics of the Canadian stage in the hope of drawing insightful comparisons and contrasts between the budding Canadian LNG industry and its international counterparts. For those interested in learning more about the Canadian LNG industry or the international LNG industry in general, this article serves as a comprehensive, albeit high-level, introduction from a Canadian perspective. For those with LNG experience in other jurisdictions, this article serves as a refresher complimented with considerations endemic to Canada's LNG industry. What will hopefully also be apparent to both groups of readers is that proponents of Canadian LNG projects are navigating diverse sets of circumstances the responses to which are often proving as instructive as they are interesting.				paul.blyschak@blakes.com					[Anonymous], 2015, APPL LIC IMP NAT GAS; Bakshi Vivek, 2012, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GA, P175; BLYSCHAK P, 2011, RJGLB, V10, P179; Blyschak PM, 2010, J INT ARBITR, V27, P579; Blyschak PM, 2011, J WORLD ENERGY LAW B, V4, P32, DOI 10.1093/jwelb/jwq021; Brownlie Ian, 2008, PRINCIPLES PUBLIC IN, P519; Coastal GasLink Pipeline Project, APPL ENV ASS CERT, P1; Dolzer Rudolf, 2012, PRINCIPLES INT INVES, V2nd; Environmental Assessment Office, 2013, GUID INV PROP CONS N; Farmer S.

J	Chauhan, S				Chauhan, Swati			Luvkush Crop Producer Company: a farmer's organization	DECISION			English	Article						Producer company; Collective action; Value chain; Livelihood; Marginal farmer		Producer companies are popularly known as New Generation Co-operatives (NGC). A producer company combines the characteristics of a private limited company and a cooperative society. It integrates the valuable features of cooperatives with the efficiency of a corporate company. The case is about Luvkush Crop Producers Company Private Limited (LCPCL), a producer company operating in Raisen district of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh (MP). The company is incorporated under Madhya Pradesh District Poverty Initiative Project (MPDPIP) with the help of the facilitating agency Action for Social Advancement (ASA). The company is engaged in production, procurement, marketing, selling, storage, processing, packaging, distribution, and trading of all agriculture produce. Small and marginal farmers in Madhya Pradesh have been susceptible to risk in the agriculture production. Producer company model is rising to integrate them into the value chain with the objective of increasing income. This case explores the potential of LCPCL as a collective institution. LCPCL is bringing change in the livelihood of small and marginal farmers by collective action. The major challenge in front of LCPCL is to generate sufficient capital.

J	Han, J; Shen, YZ				Han, Jian; Shen, Yanzhi			Exchange Rate Pass-through to China's Export Price: A Product-level Investigation	CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY			English	Article						exchange rate pass-through; export competitiveness; product heterogeneity; E31; F31; F32	US IMPORT PRICES; TRADE; MARKET; COMPETITION; QUALITY; POLICY; GOODS	Exchange rate movement usually results in changes in the production costs of exporting firms, and, therefore, the prices and the quantity of traded products. The present paper constructs a theoretical model to demonstrate that export products with higher productivity, or with larger market share, or of higher quality will experience a less complete pass-through. Using the six-digit harmonized system export data from the CEPII database over the period of 2000 to 2013, the present paper examines how product heterogeneity affects the exchange rate pass-through of Chinese exports. The empirical results show that the most competitive Chinese export products, or those least affected by exchange rate risks, are those of higher quality, with higher technological complexity and at the high end of the international value chain. Therefore, Chinese exporting firms should pay more attention to improving export quality and upgrading technology to better cope with exchange rate risks and to enjoy more bargaining power in the international market.

A Study on Quality of Women Employees in Medical Transcription	JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quality; women; work life; employee; medical transcription		'Tele' means distance. The term 'teleport', means 'distant place of working'. In practice, however, it refers to a specific mode of distant working, their services, using telemetric, on a site which is geographically separated from the main office. 'Telemetries' refers to a combination of information and technologies which connect the computers of employees to the computer of the main employing organization. As the current ratio of services being delivered on-site is 40 per cent or more, most Indian companies have a long way to go to move up the value chain in promoting home-based work which allow companies to use certain categories of employees effectively and profitably. The rapid spread of information technology combined with the deregulation and upgrading of telecommunications in virtually all countries has given considerable impetus to outsourcing or delocalization of work. The development of teleporting represents a convergence of a number of different trends, many of which have major implications for environmental, social and economic policy. How the industry, the governments and the policy-makers respond to these changes will seriously impact the future of the economy, on the employment possibilities as well as the quality of work life of people, especially women employees in the same field.

J	Burks, SF				Burks, S. F.			A simultaneous mining and mineral processing optimization and sustainability evaluation prepared during a platinum project prefeasibility study	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						sustainable health and safety; productivity; efficiency; project delivery; mechanization; optimization; tunnelling technology; rock cutting and boring		This paper develops themes explained at two SAIMM platinum conferences. Optimization techniques can be used to significantly increase the value of mining businesses by enabling better long-term planning decisions. Open pit and underground mine design, mine scheduling, cut-off grade and blending, stockpiling, and the linking of these to flexible elements of the metallurgical recovery processes are all evaluated together. Transport or sale of intermediate products and the requirements of the product metal markets can also be considered. Experience shows that net present value (NPV) can be increased significantly, usually even before the expenditure of significant amounts of project capital. Recent studies of NPV have aimed to simultaneously evaluate the impact of the optimized financial solution on the non-financial features of a project or operation. The case study presented comprised a commercially orientated review of the prefeasibffity study designs and cost estimates of a platinum group metal (PGM) project in South Africa, followed by value chain optimization and sustainability studies of the project carried out simultaneously to identify potential value uplifts to be gained and guide the owners' team going forward into the feasibility study phase. Some of the major aspects of the project that were found to have significant potential to add value included enhancement of the business model by the application of activity based costing and theory of constraints, focus on the highest net value portions of the orebody in the early years of production, enhanced and optimized scheduling of the underground mining operation, application of dynamic grind and percentage mass recovery from ore to flotation concentrate (also known as percentage mass pull) to optimize revenue, application of elevated cut-off grades early in the life of mine, matching of the mining and processing capacity, expansion of the operation subject to capital availability, and installation of downstream processing facilities subject to regional third-party capacities. The investigation of non-financial project features focused on demonstrating that a financially optimized solution could also have a number of other benefits. These are mentioned briefly in the paper, which aims to present the status of the project at an early stage of its development.	[Burks, S.

J	Willersinn, C				Willersinn, Christian			Potato losses in Switzerland from field to fork	AGRARFORSCHUNG SCHWEIZ			German	Article						food loss; potato supply chain; quality standards; loss treatment; consumer preferences		This study ascertains potato losses in Switzerland along the value chain from field to fork on the basis of questionnaires. The results show that 41-46% of all processing potatoes and 53-56% of all table potatoes are not eaten by consumers. These losses do not represent a complete waste, however. Three-quarters of table-potato losses and 90% of processing-potato losses are used as animal feed. Another 3-8% of potato losses is used to generate energy in biogas plants. Only about 5% of processing potato losses and 28% of table potato losses in total wind up as waste. In addition to harvest surpluses, quality standards exert a strong influence on quantities lost. Over 50% of all losses are due to quality defects in the potatoes. Around one-third of all potatoes with quality defects are rejected owing to their potential harmfulness to human health, whilst two-thirds of these potatoes are rejected because they fail to meet the freshness and quality criteria of trading partners and consumers.

The paper begins with a brief theoretical approach to the concepts of creativity, design and innovation and identifies some of the traditional company growth strategies. This paper provides, in the context of design management, a first empirical analysis on the relationship between company growth and the investments in design along the value chain, stressing the importance of the phase in which design gets applied for the first time (momentum). The empirical analysis was based on data captured from an online questionnaire on the Portuguese manufacturing industry. The multivariate data analysis focused on the analysis of variance and factor analysis. The pa- per has the merit to conclude that the companies growing more sharply apply design from generating ideas to processes and production and extending into the marketing phase.

B	Babatunde, Y	Hua, GB			Babatunde, Yomi	Hua, GB		Total Quality Management in Smart City Development	SMART CITIES AS A SOLUTION FOR REDUCING URBAN WASTE AND POLLUTION			English	Article; Book Chapter							BUILT ENVIRONMENT; SPACE SYNTAX; CITIES; SYSTEMS; TQM; CONSTRUCTION; REJOINDER; LESSONS; IMPACT; NEEDS	Wastes and pollution are associated with an uncoordinated urbanization trend. This exploratory study investigates total quality management's (TQM) role in smart city development. It delineates smart cities and its conjoined relationship with digital cities. It submits to the complementary relationship between TQM and quality function deployment (QFD) and highlights stakeholder engagement as central to smart city development strategy, underpinned by social theory. It distils that stakeholders and built environment professionals need to work collaboratively to maximize the benefit of smart cities as being an innovation value chain, leading to the use of IT-enabled platform such as building information modelling (BIM). This culminates in the design of an integrative framework with ICT (focusing on BIM) and TQM serving as the information architecture and the ideological premise respectively. It then presents the close-loop (front-end) and open-loop (back-end) approaches to smart city development, discusses future research directions and concludes with implications.

New institutional arrangements, upgrading and market access in the South African citrus industry	QUALITY AND INNOVATION IN FOOD CHAINS: LESSONS AND INSIGHTS FROM AFRICA			English	Article; Book Chapter						South African citrus industry; institutional arrangements; small-scale farmers; quality; upgrading; market access	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; FRESH VEGETABLES; GOVERNANCE; STANDARDS; TRADE; SUPERMARKETS; EXPORTS	The shift towards the use of private quality standards in global agrifood chains has raised concerns worldwide that small-scale farmers become excluded from lucrative export markets. In South Africa, given the historical exclusion of small-scale farmers from export-oriented agriculture, the government has therefore introduced different new institutional arrangements (IAs) between small-scale farmers and established agribusinesses to promote access to such markets. This chapter aims to analyse these IAs to understand whether and how these IAs contribute to enhanced market access for small-scale farmers. Based on a conceptual framework on quality specifications and upgrading grounded in Global Value Chain analysis, the chapter first discusses the quality demands and standards in the South African citrus sector which manifest in a 'Ladder of Market Access'. The following analysis reveals that IAs are able to promote the required product and process upgrading to include small-scale farmers into global export markets. Further upgrading opportunities, however, remain elusive as agribusinesses manage to position themselves as 'gatekeepers' which places barriers to farmers' involvement beyond the farm gate. These insights provide the basis for a set of practice-oriented recommendations specifically addressing policy-makers and other actors in the South African citrus industry to improve the design of smallholder support programmes.

The theoretical approach of Ecological Economics examines the flows of energy and matter of the city metabolism in a circular analysis. In this context, wastepickers perform an important function reinserting the elements disposed into the production cycle. The study aims to analyze the incidence of the wastepickers (consolidated in CURA Ltda.) within sub-footprints associated with paper and cardboard and solid waste of the population of General Pueyrredon. The results show that both sub-footprints are affected by wastepikers although they do not contribute significantly reducing them (1.27 % paper and board footprint and 0.6 % MSW footprint).

J	Bravo, MVC				Cevallos Bravo, Marco Vinicio			Competitiveness and Costs	REVISTA PUBLICANDO			Spanish	Article						competitive advantage; costs; SMEs; cost management	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW	The starting point for the development of this research was based on the idea that while the issue of competitive advantage and cost, both differentially, appeared as a research topic of many articles the specific issue of competitive advantage and costs, ie the role of strategic cost management to develop a competitive advantage had been less considered in the literature. A literature review was performed using the Google Scholar regarding the appearance of terms: competitive advantage, competitive advantage and costs, costs. All revisions were made for the period 2000-2015. The analysis of the literature revealed that the issue of competitive advantage and cost has been poorly treated and only 6 references in Google Scholar, with a near-zero impact on the scientific community according to the number of citations found.. In relation to the analysis of competitive advantage Michael Porter's ideas continue to influence the literature. It was possible to detect some important gaps in the literature in Spanish, such as the need to develop research that may require implementation strategies regarding the competitive advantages of SMEs. Studies that can define whether the source of competitive advantage lies in the activities of the value chain or resources and can allow implementation proposals for the case of SMEs. Investigations that go beyond the theoretical aspects regarding the potential benefits of the various cost management systems and their application to achieve a competitive advantage.

In recent years, sweetpotato has become a cash crop for smallholder farmers driven by the need to generate income in a market economy. Marketing opportunities exist for Highland sweetpotato, especially in coastal markets, because of income growth and urbanisation. Despite this, long distance sweetpotato marketing has been problematic. The objective of this research was to identify socio-economic constraints to, and opportunities for, improving the marketing efficiency of the long distance sweetpotato value chain in PNG. The results from the value chain analysis suggested that although there was a demand for high quality Highland sweetpotato in coastal markets, the long distance sweetpotato value chain was underdeveloped. This was due to several constraints: lack of access to support services (credit, extension and market information); poor infrastructure (roads and the transport system and storage and market facilities); inadequate postharvest management; lack of business skills, financial literacy and marketing planning; unclear price signals; lack of trust among chain players, uncoordinated value chain activities; and declining demand. The main conclusion was that to transition from subsistence farming to semi-commercial/commercial farming, smallholder farmers need to become more market-oriented and better equipped with business skills. Furthermore, they need to be prepared to change their current marketing and postharvest practices in order to supply high quality products to the right markets at competitive prices. Government also has a key role to play in terms of providing an appropriate enabling environment, including a reliable transport system, business development services and a locally appropriate pricing and grading system. This environment is necessary to support the effort of farmers in adopting improved marketing and postharvest practices.

The work is based on research of specialized literature on the subject in the case of Latin America. The research results indicate that these countries have made progress in the field of design, implementation and evaluation of plans and programs, however in the field of assessing progress it is not satisfactory, specifically in terms of monitoring and evaluation of public programs. One of the reasons that explain the above situation is that these countries do not have a solid database to reflect the accounting, financial and proprietary records of programs and projects in the public sector. Therefore, a strong statistical system would provide qualitative and quantitative quality information to calculate the cost of the program's goals in order to be able to monitor the physical and financial evaluation of programs and projects in the public sector.

J	Cottle, D; Fleming, E				Cottle, David; Fleming, Euan			Do price premiums for wool characteristics vary for different end products, processing routes and fibre diameter categories?	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						hedonic models; value chain; wool sales	NONLINEAR PROFIT-FUNCTIONS; SELECTION INDEXES; CLIP PREPARATION	No Australian wool price hedonic studies have separated auction data into different end product-processing groups (PPR) on the basis of all fibre attributes that affect the suitability of wool sale lots for PPR. This study was conducted to assess: (1) whether including information about PPR groupings is more useful in understanding price than clustering by broad fibre diameter (FD) categories, and (2) if the 'noise' of macroeconomic effects on price can be reduced by using a clean price relative to the market indicator (RelPrice) formula or a log RelPrice formula compared with log price or clean price. Hedonic models using data derived from 369 918 Australian auction sale lots in 2010-2011 were estimated for these four dependent price variables. Linear FD models predicted less of price's variance than quadratic or exponential models. Segmenting wool sale lots into 10 PPR before wool price analyses was found to increase the proportion of price variance explained and thus be worthwhile. The change in price with a change in FD, staple length and staple strength differs significantly between PPR. Calculating RelPrice or log RelPrice appears a better price parameter than clean price or log price. Comparing the RelPrice and clean price models, the mean absolute percentage errors were 6.3% and 16.2%, respectively. The differences in price sensitivity to FD, staple length and staple strength across PPR implies a complex set of price-setting mechanisms for wool as different users place different values on these wool properties. These price-setting mechanisms need to be incorporated in hedonic models for agricultural products that possess this characteristic. The wool price premiums can be used to estimate relative economic values when constructing sheep breeding selection indexes and can help determine the most profitable wool clip preparation strategies.

J	Degobert, M; Brangeon, S				Degobert, Muriel; Brangeon, Samantha			Bringing value to waste in developing countries Case study of two independent islands (Vanuatu and Haiti)	SOCIETY AND BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						Developing countries; Waste; Value chain; Recycling		Purpose - This paper aims to analyse the link that exists between "waste" and "resource" in two developing nations where waste is widely available in the public realm and where economic opportunities are scarce. Over the past few decades, researchers, businesses and policymakers have become increasingly interested in analysing the link that exists between "waste" and "resource". In developing nations, this link is particularly strong, as waste is widely available in the public realm and economic opportunities are scarce. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is the result of two pieces of research carried out simultaneously at Paris Dauphine University. Field data were collected through interviews with different stakeholders involved in the value chain (businesses, scavengers, local authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), etc.), as well as observations as a result of time spent by the researchers living and working in these countries. The limits to the methodology used in this paper are linked to the changing economic and political contexts of these countries, which may affect the nature of the obstacles identified in the value chain. Findings - This research has led the authors to identify different types of economic and social "value" which generate and represent waste in developing countries. The authors have analysed waste as a means for value generation for various stakeholders in a given society, as well as an object that can increase in value throughout the recycling process. However, this process of adding value - for those who benefit from the waste, as well as to the waste itself - is, in the case of Haiti and Vanuatu, limited. The authors have attempted to understand some of these limits, which represent a lost opportunity for these countries. Originality/value - In this paper, the authors have chosen to analyze this link between "waste" and "resource" in two island countries (Haiti and Vanuatu), which share similar geographical, economic and social characteristics, and to attempt to understand the various types of value that waste offers at different social levels.

J	Gamme, I; Berg, G				Gamme, Inger; Berg, Geir			Operational Integration in Health Care versus Mass Production	QUALITY INNOVATION PROSPERITY-KVALITA INOVACIA PROSPERITA			English	Article						collaboration; health care; integration; inter-functional; mass production	SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION; PERFORMANCE; INTERFACE; SYSTEM; IMPACT; ARCS	Purpose: Operational integration has been studied by several authors. However, still there are many research questions to be raised. Methodology/Approach: Two value chains have been studied within two different sectors: the health sector and the car component industry ( mass producer). The research methodology is based on semi-structured interviews with selected persons from different levels within the organizations. The data was transcribed, coded and further analyzed to find enablers or disablers to operational integration in both sectors. Findings: From this study, factors such as management commitment, colocation, and job-rotation can be seen as contributing factors in both organizations. Both experience disablers such as working as functional silos and little alignment of overall goals. Differences are seen in the greater use of job rotation within health care, while the mass producer had more mechanisms to facilitate working in cross functional teams. Practical implication: This paper presents empirical findings of success factors and pitfalls for operational integration within the value chain of two different types of organizations. Based on this mapping, recommendations on how to achieve better operational integration will be presented. Originality/Value of paper: The research initiative provides knowledge experiences from operational integration in two different Norwegian organizations representing two different sectors.

In a world marked by increased competition, the location of productive activities becomes a key factor for a firm's success. In fact, we have witnessed a strong process of offshoring in recent years. This increased global socioeconomic integration, together with the increased ability to relocate activities poses a challenge for territorial governments, who often lack the ability to analyze the complex environment and propose actions to turn these global opportunities into benefits for their inhabitants. This document reviews concepts and elements from contemporary economic geography, urban economics and value chain management, contributing towards a new conceptual and capability framework that governments may use to develop business attraction and retention policies.

In such context, the proposed research aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the various important retail enablers in India. A combined approach of interpretive structural modelling and fuzzy MICMAC is adopted to identify and classify the key enabling factors based on their direct and indirect relationship. Based upon the literature survey and expert opinion 13 key enabling factors have been identified. Thirteen identified factors are government policies/regulations, supply chain, management commitment, location of store, image of the store, consumer culture, availability of skilled manpower, technology adoption, globalisation/competition, product localisation, real estate/infrastructure, workforce management and value conscious consumers. The MICMAC analysis reveals that four of these factors can be classified as independent, three factors as linkage and six factors are classified as dependent. However no factor is classified as autonomous. The fuzzy MICMAC shows that four factors can be classified as independent, nine factors as linkage and no factor is classified as autonomous and dependent. Based on this classification companies can devise marketing strategies across the retail value chain to become successful.

We argue that East Asia, apart from being the center of global manufacturing, is emerging as one of the world's leading final markets for consumption goods. This reorientation has nontrivial implications. First, the average lead time for the region's exporters will fall, translating into lower transportation and inventory costs. And second, East Asia will host more high value-added downstream value chain activities.

As an example for highly energy and material intensive technologies, the aluminium die casting value chain was introduced from a technical perspective. Furthermore its complexity and environmental relevance was highlighted. There is a need to provide analysis and decision support for improving such production systems at the right and effective spot, as possible fields of action are manifold. Against this background, the following chapter analyses existing research approaches which reduce the environmental impact of complex industrial production systems. After a short description of existing approaches, a comparative evaluation of these approaches is conducted to differentiate the specific individual scopes and constraints. This detailed analysis of the current state of research will support the subsequent deduction of further research demand to support the transition towards energy and resource efficient industrial production.

J	Kanecki, K; Zycinska, K; Tyszko, P				Kanecki, Krzysztof; Zycinska, Katarzyna; Tyszko, Piotr			Clinical and health care aspects of respiratory tract disorders in Poland	ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						respiratory tract disorders; COPD; health care; cost drivers; Poland	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; EXACERBATIONS; COSTS	Introduction. Respiratory diseases constitute a public health priority worldwide. This is related to the increasing exposure to microorganisms, toxic factors, allergens, drugs and smoking, as the most important factors. Increasing costs of health promotion, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of respiratory tract diseases forces the search for effective strategies in the reduction of costs without making a significant impact of these activities on health results. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an example of these diseases with increasing incidence, which has few known modifiable factors and absorbs large medical and social costs. Objectives. The aim of this study is to present the conception of cost driver analysis that could be useful in constructing a good combination of the EBM-based treatment with cost reduction decisions. Material and methods. Analysis of cost drivers was based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines and Polish recommendations of COPD diagnosis and treatment. The proposition of cost reduction strategy in COPD treatment was based on identification of cost drivers in value chain conception. Results and conclusions. An increasing incidence and treatment costs of COPD force the search for methods of costs reduction in health care. Identifying, evaluating and modifying the cost drivers with use of the value chain conception could be an effective method in achieving these objectives.

S	Kircher, M		Lau, PCK		Kircher, Manfred			Regional Pillars of Competitiveness in Chemurgy and Green Chemistry	QUALITY LIVING THROUGH CHEMURGY AND GREEN CHEMISTRY	Green Chemistry and Sustainable Technology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Bio-based fuel; Bio-based chemicals; Bio-industry infrastructure; Bio-based industries; Bio-based industry research and education; Bio-based industry acceptance; Bio-based industry cluster; Bio-based industry region		The change from fossil-to bio-based chemical processing and value chains is a tremendous challenge and if done right it provides a great opportunity for established chemical clusters as well as biomass-producing regions. Both need to adapt or develop pillars of competence which determine their regional competitive position: Infrastructure, industries, science and education, public administration, public acceptance and cluster-building. While biomass regions benefit from feedstock availability, established clusters are especially strong in further processing along the value chain. Based on the example of Europe's leading chemical cluster Antwerp-Rotterdam-Rhine-Ruhr (ARRR), a bottom-up approach into chemurgy and green chemistry is presented which combines strategies and activities on county, state, and multi-national level.

J	Le, S				Le, Sebastian			AACo's Northern Beef Value Chain: Analysis of performance and interventions	AUSTRALIAN AGRIBUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article							INDUSTRY	AACo is one of northern Australia's largest beef producers. The new Livingstone beef processing facility represents the formation of a new value chain component for the company, the success of which could also help facilitate the broader development of an alternative marketing channel for the northern cattle industry. A speculative analysis of the of the AACo northern beef value chain suggests that it may be difficult to achieve sufficient levels of chain surplus despite an existing high level of coordination between stages. The main obstacles to performance indicated include poor quality transport infrastructure, climate variability, the relatively low value of the specific targeted beef market, and the cost of skilled labour in the region. Potential interventions are suggested, but further analysis will be required after all stages of the value chain become fully operational to confirm the findings of this study, and potentially provide greater evidence for effective targeted interventions.

J	Lee, CS; Song, B				Lee, Chang-Soo; Song, Backhoon			Vertical specialization in the Korean manufacturing sector	JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE			English	Article						Global value chain; VS; VS1; World input-output table	WORLD-TRADE; EXPORTS; GROWTH	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to answer for questions regarding vertical specialization in the Korea's key exporting industries, such as the changing pattern toward VS or VS1 and the changing trend in the location of slicing up the value chain in these industries. Design/methodology/approach - The framework of Koopman et al. (2014) is adopted to calculate the industry-level vertical specialization indices, VS and VS1. Findings - VS1 is a dominant type of vertical specialization in the key exporting industries of Korea. The increasing net vertical trades (VS1-VS) verifies the upward trends in the locations of slicing up the value chain in the industries empirically. Research limitations/implications - The net vertical trade (VS1-VS) of each industry is an important indicator of the location of slicing up the value chain in the environment of the international production network. Originality/value - The industry-level calculations of VS and VS1 are necessary in order to remedy the aggregation bias from the country-level calculation of VS and VS1 functioning in the opposite direction.

New bio-based chemicals which function as the "feedstock" for products we use every day have made great strides to compete with petroleum-based chemicals based on performance and price for existing applications, while offering expansions into novel and innovative areas. However, to compete successfully in the market place with petroleum-based technologies on an even playing field, the bio-based sector needs to substantially scale-up production and overcome a wide array of challenges. An expansive series of stakeholder conversations and convenings identified key areas of potential collaboration across the biochemical technology value chain. In response to this critical need for a center of scientific excellence in the biochemcial technology sector, an industry-focused Biochemical Technology Leadership Roundtable (BTLR) is being organized by the American Chemical Society (ACS) Green Chemistry Institute (GCI).

From a case study of a Chinese manufacturing firm, we show evidence that traditional firms can utilise the analytical tool of technology mapping to capture new innovation opportunities in emerging industries. In contrast to prior studies that mainly explore how firms learn and accumulate knowledge and capabilities in different growth stages within their respective industry, this study suggests that accumulated technological competency not only can propel a firm to move up on the current value chain but can also help it leap to an emerging market to capture new opportunities. These findings imply important policy applications and point out new research directions.

J	Melissa, AL; Angelica, SR				Melissa, Alava-Larrea; Angelica, Sanchez-Riofrio			Cerveceria Nacional: A commitment to sustainable development in Ecuador	CIENCIA UNEMI			Spanish	Article						Corporate Social Responsibility; sustainable development; stakeholders; triple bottom line; competitive advantage	RESPONSIBILITY	The aim of this paper is to present CSR as a new strategy, within the running of the company, that generates positive results for the company and all the agents involved in it. By the method of case study, CSR processes performed by an Ecuadorian company, Cerveceria Nacional, are analyzed. Cerveceria Nacional is among the top five most successful companies in Ecuador and leader in the beverage industry. In 2013, it had annual income for 443.6 million dollars. The study concludes that CSR does not mean making philanthropic actions by the company. CSR actions must be based on the incorporation of social activities linked to the value chain of the company and its various stakeholders. These activities should be evaluated throughout the process producing reports before and after implementing CSR mechanisms.

Phenolics Value Chain and L-Lactic Acid Bioproduction from Agricultural Biomass	QUALITY LIVING THROUGH CHEMURGY AND GREEN CHEMISTRY	Green Chemistry and Sustainable Technology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Chemurgy; Aromatic acids; Phenolic acids; Antioxidants; Building blocks; Biopolymers; PLA; Biphasic bioreactor system; Biocatalysis; Biorefinery; Green chemistry; Agricultural feedstock	FERULIC ACID; BIOTECHNOLOGICAL PRODUCTION; HYDROXYSTYRENE DERIVATIVES; MICROBIAL-PRODUCTION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BACILLUS-PUMILUS; CHEMICALS; DECARBOXYLASE; ESTERASES; ENZYME	To make the quantum leap from conceptualization of an idea to possible commercialization of a product, at first it would be desirable to have the opportunity to showcase the potential of a given product stream, successes, and the challenges involved. Using agricultural biomass as model feedstock, we feature in this chapter the tasks that were carried out in our laboratory in the context of bioproduction of vinyl phenols from two phenolic acids-vinyl guaiacol from ferulic acid and vinyl syringol from sinapic acid-as value-added chemicals. As a proof of concept, these monomers were polymerized to produce new biopolymers with improved properties. Along a similar product line, direct fermentation by a Rhizopus fungus of a nonfood feedstock to produce an optically pure L-lactic acid, a precursor to the well-known polyester, polylactic acid (PLA) was also featured. Technological advances made in these studies include the discovery and characterization of new enzymes viz. feruloyl esterases that release phenolic acids from lignocellulosic biomass. Guided by the 3-D structure of a phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD), a novel sinapic acid decarboxylase (SAD) was evolved to effect the biotransformation of sinapic acid to vinyl syringol. Throughout the development, process optimization of various kinds was explored that include in situ recovery of water-insoluble compounds exemplified by vinyl guaiacol in a biphasic aqueous-solvent bioreactor system. We commented on some of the recent advances made in related areas and the necessity to push the green chemistry and innovation agenda forward for a sustainable future.

J	Mugabira, M; Chivaka, R				Mugabira, M.; Chivaka, R.			Value chain analysis: Critical success factors for competitiveness in Uganda's commercial sugarcane industry	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article						critical success factors; entrepreneurial traits; productivity; financial; competitiveness; Uganda's commercial sugarcane industry		Pursuing an agricultural productivity agenda is no longer a choice but a must for growth in sub-Saharan Africa. This research contributes to the current debate on why some countries advance in the global marketplace, and others fail to do so. This paper unpacked this question from the macro level and examined it at the meso and micro levels of Uganda's commercial sugarcane industry. The focus of the paper was to provide an assessment of the critical success factors for the Ugandan commercial sugarcane industry competitiveness. The research shows that entrepreneurial traits, productivity indicators and financial indicators are critical success factors for competitiveness. Although the critical success factors reveal a fit between performance categories based on quantitative data, qualitative evidence offers contrary and interesting results. The high performing enterprises mainly attributed their competitiveness to the internal environmental factors under an entrepreneur's control. These entrepreneurial traits, such as personal involvement, passion and timely application of agronomical practices, can be developed and nurtured as a business culture that results in competencies and capabilities for high sugarcane productivity. On the other hand, both the medium and low performing enterprises attributed their competitiveness to the external environmental factors that are outside the entrepreneur's control. Interestingly, cane pricing was a contentious issue between producers and buyers. This suggested an information asymmetry on the cost production structure that could lead to a market failure and thus the necessity to review the cane payment system.

Alternative integrated energy chain for Caribbean power markets: methanol/vegetable oil fuel blends	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ENERGY ISSUES			English	Article						energy supply chain; alternative fuel; natural gas; biofuel; decision analysis under uncertainty; Caribbean energy supply	NATURAL-GAS; ECONOMICS; TRINIDAD; DIESEL	The high price volatility of crude oil and its derivatives has resulted in unmanageable power generation costs in many regions worldwide. This paper proposes a unique alternative fuel blend, namely methanol and biofuels that have hitherto escaped the purview of policy-makers. Availability of fuel supply, lower environmental impact, job creation and reduction in fuel subsidy are some of the socio-economic benefits. A framework was developed for examining the economic feasibility of this alternative considering the entire energy value chain. The case study used is the power generation markets of the Caribbean. A probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo simulations was adopted to account for uncertainty in key input parameters. The results indicated that the methanol/vegetable oil chain is a feasible alternative for the Caribbean. The methanol/vegetable oil chain was also found to be more economically competitive than most other energy supply chain options.

To deal with this question, we analyze how corporate social responsibility and decent employment opportunities, as proposed by the ILO, are present in the strategy and actions of Inditex, one of the most important global value chains of the textile and clothing cluster. We conclude that the creation of institutional agreements between companies and global unions to promote fundamental labor rights is considered to be an instrument of corporate social responsibility and risk management for organizations. However, the empirical research highlights the disparity of the power relationship between a multinational and its subcontracting networks. This asymmetry is established by fast fashion model production. The model of fast fashion management promotes poor working conditions in the developing-country suppliers.

Mainly because customs liberation that existed between two ex CEFTA partners ceased to be valid by entering Croatia in EU, and leaving CEFTA. Bosnia and Herzegovina was most important trading partner for Croatia, with the highest rate of trade liberalization within CEFTA 2006. At the same time Croatia was the most important trade partner for B&H. According to above mentioned the aim of this paper is to find out the possibility of the promotion of foreign trade between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia for consumer products (milk and dairy products). Those FMCG earlier exchanged between two partners became today more costly. For that reason, to make these products more attractive to their consumers retailers and producers from both countries must jointly work to create greater value, i.e. compensate far the price difference trough creation of the value chain between B&H and Croatia retailers and producers.

J	Poleshkina, IO				Poleshkina, Irina Olegovna			Supply Chain Management as a Driving Force for Generating Competitive Advantage for Dairy Companies	Economic and Social Changes-Facts Trends Forecast			English	Article						competitive advantage; logistics costs; supply chain management; value chain; dairy products		The study aims to uncover the reserves to generate competitive advantages for the participants of the market of perishables in the case of the dairy sector due to the formation of effective supply chains, as this category of goods is the most demanding in terms of periods and conditions of transportation and terms of preservation. The research technique is based on the concepts of value chains and supply chain management. In order to optimize the distribution of functions between the participants of the dairy chain a process-based approach has been applied. The research has revealed the main reasons for high aggregate costs and the places of their formation at each stage of the dairy supply chain. The article proposes the mechanisms to address three main problems arising from the process of building relations between the participants of the dairy supply chain in Russia. These problems are associated with a disproportionate margin distribution between the participants of the chain, with non-compliance of the quality of raw milk with the requirements for the production of specific types of dairy products, and with distrust of the supply chain participants, which increases transaction costs and forces to create reserve supplies which reduce the competitiveness of the whole dairy supply chain in general. In order to improve the competitiveness of all participants in the dairy chain, the article presents several mechanisms for solving these problems. The first is margin distribution based on the costs incurred by each participant of the dairy chain. The second is the use of a mathematical model to determine the assortment of goods of a dairy enterprise on the basis of the incoming volume and quality of raw milk according to the seasonal factor and the demand for dairy products. The third is the feasibility of refusal from the formation of reserve supplies by all participants of the dairy chain, which will not only minimize aggregate costs, but also significantly improve the quality of dairy products actually available to consumers in retail trade.

In terms of methodology, qualitative case study strategy was used. The results of the analysis of the business model show that the company is reactive to customer requirements, however, from the perspective of change models it was possible to identify a series of actions that would evolve the business model, by introducing new products and services. In conclusion, the traditional way of designing business models has a limitation as to predict their evolution over time which can be overcome with changing models.

Modelling financial type 2b globalisation and its effects on trade, investments and unemployment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS AND ECONOMETRICS			English	Article						financial globalisation; globalisation types model; economic cycles; effects; trade; investment; unemployment; migration		The description and teaching of economic globalisation still lacks a comprehensive formal and normative theory. The globalisation types model is a proposal to bridge this deficiency. This paper analyses the repercussion of financial transactions on the evolution of economic cycles and links the speculative part of financial type 2b globalisation to physical demand and trade flows of globalisation type 1, capital investments of globalisation type 2a, as well as human migration of globalisation type 3a. The result is a cognitive model showing the influence and systemic effects of financial transactions performed on commodity exchanges causing increased volatility of commodity prices and the repercussion on economic cycle of the global industry value-chain of the real economy. It represents the keystone of the globalisation types model integrating by system dynamics modelling the interactions of the various economic globalisation types and subtypes.

VALUE CHAIN MANAGEMENT IN BANANA AND SAPOTA FRUITS AND ITS SUPPLY FORECAST IN INDIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Value chain; banana chips; fruit; raw sapota; marketing		The present study on "value chain management in banana and sapota fruits and its supply forecast in India" was conducted in Northern Karnataka based on the higher concentration of area and production of the fruits with the objective to analyze the costs and returns in value chain management. The results were based on primary data collected, with the sample size of eight processing units, twenty wholesaler cum commission agents and twenty retailers for each of the fruit crops. The results revealed that the total cost incurred by the processors in processing of raw banana into each of one quintal of fruits and chips and raw sapota into one quintal of fruit was of '1068, '5385 and '1047, respectively. The degree of value addition in the above cases was found to be in the order of 42, 59 and 58 per cents, respectively. The marketing cost incurred by the retailers in marketing one quintal of banana fruit, chips and sapota fruit was found to be '91, '78 and '110, respectively. The quantity of banana exported has increased at the rate of 21.78 per cent per annum and in terms of value it has increased at the rate of 29.13 per cent per annum. Since the stakeholders in value chain of both the cases of fruits (banana and sapota) are not integrated, there is a great opportunity to integrate and strengthen the value chain. The concerned statutory bodies have to give due attention for providing proper approach roads to the farms, processing units, cold storage, marketing facilities and export opportunities.	[Shwetha, M.

The model involves two commodities in this industry, namely crude palm oil (CPO) and refined palm oil (RPO), each has different added value. Design/methodology/approach: The model built will define the behavior of government in controlling palm oil industry, and their interactions with macro-environment, in order to improve the competitiveness of the industry. Therefore the first step was to map the main activities in this industry using value chain analysis. After that a conceptual model was built, where the output of the model is competitiveness of the industry based on market share. The third step was model formulation. The model is then utilized to simulate the policy mix given by government in improving the competitiveness of Palm Oil Industry. Findings: The model can accommodate government's policy mix which is then optimized. The model has been built structurally based on hierarchical multi-level system approach, while in the process element, the subprocesses are built using VCA approach. The model can simulate industry performance, and show that such government policy mix can improve the competitiveness of Indonesian palm Oil Industry. Research limitations/implications: The model was developed using only some policies which give direct impact to the competitiveness of the industry. For macro environment input, only price is considered in this model. Practical implications: The model can simulate the output of the industry for various government policies mix given to the industry. The techno-economic aspect is also discussed. Originality/value: This research develops a model that can represent the structure and relationship between industry, government and macro environment, using value chain analysis and hierarchical multilevel system approach.

With globalization, the power concentrates into the hands of few firms in almost all industries. These firms, which have become multi-national enterprises, target the markets of developing countries for further growth. Thus, local firms under pressure may convert this difficulty to their favour only if they can develop capabilities and create a congruent organizational culture to the those of giant firms. This research makes a case study on two Turkish firms that drew the attention of giant firms leading to the joint ventures formed in different time periods. By examining the activities of two case firms before their forming joint venture, this research finds the commonalities across two cases regardless time. Therefore, the results of this research provide a guidance to Turkish firms on what they need to do in future for drawing the attention of giant firms. the results indicate an important theoretical contribution by linking the social capital theory to the pre-conditions of international strategic alliances.

Today, an efficient system of enterprise logistics is mandatory in order to build up and safeguard competitive strategic advantages. In seeking to meet the demands of a dynamic and global market environment, enterprises have to develop and strengthen their employees' competences with a lasting effect, thus optimising their value chain. In this chapter, the results of the project "eQuaL 2.0 e-qualification for efficient logistics processes" are introduced. The project dealt with the concept of a new type of problem-oriented knowledge management for enterprise logistics processes' qualification. The eQuaL 2.0 knowledge base contains vital information concerning relevant issues and problems in enterprise logistics which are linked with the methods to deal with due to the semantic structure of the knowledge base.

J	Bardt, H				Bardt, Hubertus			Potential Consequences of the Energiewende for the Manufacturing Sector in Germany	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article								The abandonment of nuclear power and new focus on renewable energy sources represents a fundamental change in the structure of Germany's electricity supply. In the wake of this change in energy policy (which is widely referred to as an energy turnaround), prices started to rise immediately and further increases are to be expected in the years ahead. For the manufacturing sector, this cost burden has been mitigated by exempting energy-intensive sectors from additional costs. However, this causes high levels of uncertainty for large electricity consumers as their current exceptional status may be called into question at some point in the future. Moreover, the price and cost effects of the German energy policy are not only restricted to energy-intensive enterprises. The metal production, parts of the chemical industry and other industries closely linked to electricity consumers in a complex value chain face higher price and cost risks, as do large segments of the manufacturing sector, which work closely with energy-intensive companies. These dense networks are critical in the joint development of innovations, one of the German industry's main competitive advantages. This strength of the German economy may turn into a risk if the future of electricity-intensive industries is hampered by rising national energy prices. A potential relocation of energy-intensive companies to other countries would also weaken the competitiveness of other areas of German industry. Such risks need to be compared with new market opportunities provided by the energy turnaround.

J	Marginean, S				Marginean, Silvia			EMPLOYMENT DYNAMICS IN ROMANIA AFTER THE CRISIS. A GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS PERSPECTIVE	STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Global Value Chain; Employment; Economic Crisis; Globalization; Romania		After the 2008-2009 crisis, the challenge of understanding the mechanisms and structure of the world economy has begun to generate different approaches of economic globalization. This article uses Global Value Chain framework to examine the impact of the crisis on sectorial employment for six selected industries from Romania (Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal, Electrical and Optical Equipment, Transport Equipment, Machinery, Textiles and Textile Products, Chemicals and Chemical Products). With more than 70% of Romanian exports, and almost 14% of the employees these were the main real transmission channels for the crisis, other than financial markets. The study found that dynamic of the employment in these sectors has a different pattern than the national one. Employment in the sectors which are parts of Global Value Chains was very sensitive to global crisis: the average number of employees dropped by 15% in 2009 (comparing to 10% - the percentage for the whole economy) but they didn't follow the national recovery trend (in 2013 the total number of employees increased by more than 11% in Romania but the numbers stayed almost the same in the six selected industries). These findings suggest that Romania need to understand the specificity of these trends and to use the right policy tools in order to achieve economic growth and development through participation in Global Value Chains.

Its sustainability is compromised by income distribution inequalities. This study aims to analyze the mechanisms which underlie the creation and distribution of value added considering the organization of the value chain and the type of governance that regulates the relationship between the actors. Investigations have focused on ten value chain agents. They were chosen on the basis of product, market, geographic location and degree of enclosure. The findings have identified three types of value chains: domestic, global and mixed. The most frequent governance structure is related to "directed model". The fisherman is the main generator of value added with the intermediaries dominating the value chain and capturing the bulk of revenues.

However, this phenomenon little is known so far about wage and working conditions. This article focuses on plants in Tuscany of luxury global firms that reverse previous off-shoring by bringing manufacturing back home. Drawing on interviews with workers and privileged informants, the article outlines the deterioration of working conditions through the subcontracting relationships of value chain. The main thesis of this paper is that in order to understand the on-going changes there is a need to shows the structural role of interlacement of capital, intangible assets and labour.

J	Trimble, J; Chilumani, KR; Sibangiso, N				Trimble, John; Chilumani, Khesani R.; Sibangiso, Ngwenya			Strategies for community focused postal service development	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						innovation; postal service; service optimization; simulation; value chain		To maintain its relevance, the postal system must look at ways to innovate and optimize. It must optimize its use of resources and delivery of current services. It must employ innovation to develop new opportunities and services. The key will be to leverage its infrastructure and build on its strong community linkage, while taking advantages of emerging trends in information and communication technology. This study uses information gathered from the postal systems in Africa and other less developed settings. It also draws on postal expansion options identified by the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in the areas of e-post, e-commerce, e-government and e-finance, as a basis for a framework orientated to community service in southern Africa. This framework is designed to facilitate the development of a more effective postal research strategy that is well integrated into the overall business strategy of the post office, building on existing services and incorporating new e-postal services. This overall process should encourage regional and continental integration of postal services and foster citizen and community empowerment.

J	Rasiah, R; Krishna, VG; Ratnavelu, K				Rasiah, Rajah; Krishna, Vignes Gopal; Ratnavelu, Kurunathan			Do contractors undertake more learning and innovation than multinational subsidiaries at least developed host-sites? A study of clothing firms in Cambodia	ASIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION			English	Article						innovation capability; value chain; contract firms; integrated multinational producers; clothing	TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES; PRODUCTION NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; EXPORT	This paper seeks to test the argument that contractors introduce significant learning and innovation activities comparable more or than integrated multinational clothing producers at least developed host-sites. This follows from recent developments in the theory of multinationals that lead firms are increasingly abandoning peripheral innovation activities that are characterised by low value added operations to focus on branding and associated R&D activities. Any such development will offer opportunities for contract manufacturers, both national and foreign owned, to upgrade and specialise in innovative activities related to manufacturing at distant host-sites as the brand holders at major markets will then specialise on product R&D and design, and branding activities. The results from tobit regressions show that contract firms show higher process technology and innovation capabilities (ICs) than integrated firms in the clothing industry. Hence, there is econometric evidence to support the argument that changes in manufacturing offers tangible opportunities for contract manufacturers in global value chains to upgrade into cutting-edge processes and techniques, and ICs.

The nature of the milk market systems in the two study areas was reflected in the magnitude and dynamics of milk consumption; the informal market was particularly important for a 'subject to deprivation' group in both cases. Producer-based estimates did not account for milk from outside the study area, whereas retail surveys omitted details of the producers' own consumption and their direct sales. Consumer surveys captured the widest variety of informal milk sources but, like retail studies, omitted producers' consumption. Therefore the most accurate rapid estimation of markets for consumable products may be obtained by triangulating producer data with consumer surveys ( informal market) and adding reliable ( and usually relatively easily obtained) data from processors and retailers to capture trade through formal channels.

Post-Harvest Practices of Ginger in Odisha, India-Present Status and Scope for Development	AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA			English	Article								Ginger is a major cash crop of the Odisha (earlier called Orissa) state of India, which is mainly grown in the tribal dominated districts. The lack of proper pre- and post-harvest management and absence of value chain have been causing huge losses to the farmers in these areas. The loss of ginger after harvest has been reported as high as 20-30 %. Thus, an initiative was taken up under the National Agricultural Innovation Project of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research to improve the post-harvest management and strengthen the value chain of ginger. The different weak links were identified and some need based interventions were incorporated into the system with forward and backward linkage support so as to reduce wastage and to assure good remuneration to the farmers. This paper presents the status of the postharvest management of ginger in Odisha state of India to provide a guideline for future researchers and policy makers for the development of the system.

Possible implementation of a virtual platform to improve citrus marketing in Andalusia (southern Spain). Information needs of producers and exporters	ITEA-INFORMACION TECNICA ECONOMICA AGRARIA			Spanish	Article						Value chain; distribution; price formation; cooperatives; services		Andalusia is the second largest citrus producer in Spain, and thus, the citrus industry has an extraordinary economic and social importance in the region. However, the citrus value chain comprises a scattered primary sector in contrast to a very concentrated and well organized purchase and distribution sector, as well as a non-transparent market. The aim of this research was to explore the information needs of the different agents in the citrus value chain and to study the possibilities of implementing a virtual platform to share information in order to improve their marketing decisions. Primary sources were used for this work: a survey was conducted among citrus production experts in Andalusia. Survey results were analysed according to the legal nature and the activity of the respondents. The strategic action of implementing an information platform may be feasible since a clear demand for information has been detected from the survey population which represents 65% of the Andalusia citrus production. In addition, a public-private management model was preferred by the respondents to control the platform although the responsibility for it should be private. The majority of respondents would be willing to pay for the services provided by the platform, although some aspects regarding access restrictions service quality and price should be considered.

Whether consciously factored into the operating mode or not, logistics and distribution channel management plays a critical role in the life, and death, of a firm. From the rudimentary beginnings of the start-up company to the hectic world of the growth company and onto the relatively secure existence in mature markets, the value chain consisting of logistics and distribution channel linkages follows the firm, until it solidifies into immutable form of the mature value chain and begins to exert an inexorable pressure on the survival of the entire chain, and conversely the chain imposes its will on the members. The emergence of mature industry value chains is often driven by the need to monopolistically control logistics and distribution channels which provides a competitive advantage but also introduces a serious exposure to pending shock loadings of the chain.

However, their potential is often greatly diminished by preconceived and opposing notions within the community on what drives economic growth. The Dollar Game is an innovative curriculum where participants collectively build an understanding of how innovation, income distribution and export affect their communities. Teams play different scenarios, starting with an island economy isolated from grants, subsidies, and trading opportunities and builds to a connected economy where they eventually lose ownership of the local value-chain.

J	Brown, G; Daly, M				Brown, Graham; Daly, Michael			THE INDUSTRY, ACADEMIA AND GOVERNMENT NEXUS IN GEOCHEMISTRY	ELEMENTS			English	Article								Geochemistry is a key specialist sub-discipline in the global exploration and production of resources. It complements conceptual geological thinking, analytical modelling and traditional fieldwork as part of a multi-disciplinary effort. When properly integrated into the discovery process, geochemistry is a key component of exploration success: conventional geochemical techniques have, for example, played an important role in the discovery of many deposits of base metals, precious metals and oil and gas. Going further along the value chain, geochemistry also plays a key role in the management of oil and gas reservoirs as they are produced. Geochemistry, therefore, is an integral part of both petroleum and mineral industries and it continues to develop and improve its contribution.

J	Guenther-Lubbers, W; Theuvsen, L				Guenther-Luebbers, Welf; Theuvsen, Ludwig			Regional economic effects of biogas production: an analysis based on the example of Lower Saxony	BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT			German	Article							IMPACT	Biogas production has been considerably expanded in Germany during the past decade. However, the current Renewable Energy Act (EEG) and the fact that almost no new biogas plants were built have created the impression that biogas production has reached a turning point and that a basic re-orientation is called for. At individual plant level numerous analyses results are already available concerning eventual effects on production factors such as soil, capital and work. Yet, comprehensive regional economic analyses that consider every stage of the biogas value chain are rare. Against this background, the regional economic effects of biogas production, based on the results of an empiric survey among biogas plant operators, and among up- and downstream stakeholders in Lower Saxony, are presented here. In detail, the regional distribution of payment flows and amounts during the various operational phases of a biogas plant are analysed; the effects on added value and the workplace along the biogas production line are also determined. Results show, among other things, that a large part of the added value remains within Lower Saxony. At about 70 percent during the construction phase and considerably higher figures for annual expenses (effort) and income (yield), and compared to the national level, this rate is above average.

J	Muradov, KY				Muradov, Kirill Y.			RUSSIA-ASEAN: TRADE AND GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						trade; statistics; international trade; global value chains; value added; input-output tables; ASEAN; Russia		Traditional trade statistics that originate in customs records are inadequate to measure the complex interdependencies in today's globalised economy, or what is known as the global value chains. The article focuses on Russia-ASEAN trade. The author applies innovative methods of measuring trade in value added terms in order to capture the unobserved bilateral linkages behind the officially recorded trade flows. First, customs and balance of payments sources of bilateral trade data are briefly reviewed. For user, there are at least two inherent problems in those data: the inconsistencies in "mirror" trade flows and the attribution of the origin of a traded product wholly to the exporting country. This results in large discrepancies between Russian and ASEAN "mirror" trade data and, arguably, their low importance as each other's trade partners. Next, the author explores new data from inter-country input-output tables that necessarily reconcile bilateral differences and offer greater detail about the national and sectoral origin or destination of traded goods and services. Relevant data are derived from the OECD-WTO TiVA database and are rearranged to obtain various estimates of Russia-ASEAN trade in value added in 2009. The main finding is that sizable amount of the value added of Russian origin is embodied in third countries' exports to ASEAN members and ASEAN members' exports to third countries. As a result, the cumulative flow of Russia's value added to ASEAN members is estimated to be 62% larger than the direct gross exports, whereas for China and South Korea it is, respectively, 21% and 23% smaller. The indirect, unobserved value added flows can be largely explained by the use of Russian energy resources, chemicals and metals as imported inputs in third countries (China, South Korea) and ASEAN members' own production. The contribution of these inputs is then accumulated along the value chain. Finally, the most important sectoral value chains are visualized for readers' convenience. So far, it's apparent that Russia is linked to ASEAN countries through intricate production networks and indirectly contributes to their trade with third countries.

In the light of theoretical references such as competitiveness and competitive advantages, it was possible to carry out a descriptive study which evidenced the importance of this issue in exports realized mainly by countries like Bolivia and Peru, and imports from the EU and Asia. Thus, Andean countries could play an important role if they take advantage of their traditions and turn them into business and welfare opportunities for the world population.

In cultivation, quality can be influenced by choice of site, management, and variety. In order to investigate the effects of variety and the environment, comprehensive quality tests were performed on 12 varieties in the Organic Wheat Trial Network in 2012 and 2013. It became apparent that many quality traits which are laborious to measure correlated significantly with traits which are easier to measure, while the thousand-kernel weight and the test weight do not correlate significantly with any other trait. For most quality traits, the influence of the genetic effect is greater than that of the environment; hence, breeding and variety choice are very important. The analysis of the interaction showed that under high temperatures during grain filling some varieties yield significantly lower values for important quality traits such as e.g. protein content and tin baking volumes. This different reaction of the varieties correlated significantly with the time of ear emergence. Varieties which reacted to the high temperatures also showed a lower stability for the respective trait. These findings may be helpful for ensuring high-quality Swiss (organic) wheat production once a larger dataset has been validated for the various actors in the value chain.

Besides the waste created at home, schools and other public places it is also generated by various sectors like hospitals, industries, farm and other sources. Waste based business helps in addressing the problem of waste to a great extent. The present study analyses various actors in the value chain of waste business and perception of manufacturers regarding challenges and concerns of such business. The total sample size comprised of 156 manufacturers dealing in waste based business units from Northern India i.e. Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The study concluded that in waste based business, 13 different value chains were followed. The major challenges and concerns were found to be inadequate supply of electricity, shortage of raw material availability followed by shortage of labor, low demand of end product, rising prices of raw material, restriction on use of plastic, high taxes, high competition due to new entrants and excess interference by the government.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			POSITION PAPER FROM THE COST ACTION FP1003 BIOMATPACK Impact of Renewable Materials in Packaging for Sustainability - Development of renewable fibre and bio-based materials for new packaging solutions	CELLULOSE CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								RENEWABLE PACKAGING INNOVATION NEEDS FURTHER SUPPORT Forest based packaging counts for around 35-40% of the global packaging market and 40% of the paper and board production is used in the packaging market. Hence, the packaging market is of enormous importance for the forest based sector. To give the forest industry a competitive edge this Action has focused on packaging solutions based entirely on renewable resources in order to remove the serious disadvantages associated with future paper and board packaging solutions that continue to rely on non-renewable materials. The Action has explored possibilities that the forest itself could offer as a raw material base for different components within a given package, thus exploring the full potential of the fibres. The main objective of the Action has been to enhance the knowledge concerning packaging from the forest sector and thus identify potential new renewable packaging solutions. Since a sustainability approach is the scope of this COST Action, aspects related to technical, environmental, economic and societal outcomes has been addressed taking the whole packaging value chain into account. The Action has included partners from 19 European COST countries, New Zealand and CEPI. COST is an intergovernmental organisation supporting the collaboration of nationally funded science and technology research through the creation of networks. Also known as Actions, these networks allow scientists to grow their ideas by sharing them with their peers and thereby give impetus to their research, career and innovation.

J	Elina, S; Riitta, M; Helena, WJ; Liisa, P				Elina, Saarivuori; Riitta, Molarius; Helena, Wessman-Jaaskelainen; Liisa, Poussa			Connecting water footprint and water risk assessment: case packaging board	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						freshwater use; production plant; risk assessment; water footprint; water impact	IMPACTS	A company can evaluate water impacts related to its activities with the help of water footprint (WF), allowing manufacturer to identify freshwater consumption and degradation hotspots along the value chain. However, WF does not directly consider the environmental or process related risks caused by water use. This study aims at providing a framework for more extensive and complementary water assessments by connecting two environmental tools, WF and water risk assessment. Product system of a packaging board is used as a case example. WF assessment is carried out in accordance with the ISO 14046 Standard. Risk analysis focuses on the WF hotspots by analysing the local environmental circumstances and the main risks, their likelihood and consequences. The results show that water stress indicator is sensitive to input and output water qualities. The significance of local environmental circumstances (potential for droughts and shallow water levels, upstream water storages) on the water-based risks are highlighted in the results. The use of complementary methods reveals opposing interests: the lowest WF results of the studied scenarios include a risk for poor product quality. The results offer valuable information to a manufacturer on self-inflicted water impact and the role of indirect water use, helping to integrate water risk approach in the strategic planning.

People buy Fairtrade-branded goods because of the social discourse around it what.friends, newspapers, teachers and others tell them about that it guarantees, what it achieves and that is its social acceptability rather than because of the advertising. The social discourse is favourable to Fairtrade but bears little relation to observable fact Methods used by the brand owners and others to control and manipulate the social discourse are identified.

J	Khaleda, S; Murayama, Y				Khaleda, Syeda; Murayama, Yuji			Identification of Suitability of Sites for Microenterprises for Value Chain Development: A Study in Gazipur District, Bangladesh	GROWTH AND CHANGE			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; MULTICRITERIA; GIS	In recent years, many commercial poultry farm microenterprises (MEs) have flourished in rural areas with the help of an extensive microfinance program in Bangladesh. These poultry MEs are in a key position for the profitable operation of other actors in the poultry subsector value chain. But not all these MEs are located in suitable places, which results in poor input supply and marketing facilities for their products and thus cause higher costs and less profit. The government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and donor agencies apply the same policy for providing support services to all these poultry farmers, irrespective of their locations. Thus, this paper tries to explain the poultry value chain in Gazipur District, where the concentration of poultry farms is highest, and to delineate suitable sites for poultry MEs using the multicriteria evaluation technique within a Geographic Information System context, utilizing factors such as flood-free land, and infrastructures related to the poultry business-enabling environment of the value chain. The delineation of suitable land areas for farms can help NGOs, as well as the government, to design interventions and appropriate policy development for farmers in different locations, and thus help all farmers to increase their profit and sustainability.

J	Lukic, R				Lukic, Radojko			THE ANALYSIS OF FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CREATION OF AN ADDED VALUE AS AN INDICATOR OF TRADE EFFICIENCY IN SERBIA	EKONOMSKA MISAO I PRAKSA-ECONOMIC THOUGHT AND PRACTICE			Croatian	Article						global retail chain; growth and structure of added value; determinants; added value per employee; innovation and electronic trade		Due to its economic significance, global value chain has lately been extensively researched both in theory and practice. In that context, the added value created through the whole chain value is analysed. The concept of added value is also analysed not only on the global, but also on the national and entrepreneurial level. Regarding that fact, in this work we comparatively analyse the effects of application of concept of added value in the trade of the European Union and Serbia especially. Within this, the dynamics of size, structure and determinants of added value are envisaged in the context of trade in Serbia. The research which is based on the original official statistics of added value of trade in Serbia showed that in terms of its size it is a very significant economic category, as it is in the European Union, and it represents an important source for improving the efficiency of business management, human resources, growth and development of trade in Serbia.

J	Sanchez-Hernandez, JL; Espinosa-Segui, A				Luis Sanchez-Hernandez, Jose; Espinosa-Segui, Ana			Regional segmentation of the salted codfish market in Spain: Implications for Norwegian producers	NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Spanish markets; regional conventions; Norwegian codfish producers; consumption patterns; salted codfish	QUALITY CONVENTIONS; VALUE CHAIN; FISH MARKET; FOOD; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; WINE; WORLDS; GOVERNANCE	Sanchez-Hernandez, J.L. & Espinosa-Segui, A. 2015. Regional segmentation of the salted codfish market in Spain: Implications for Norwegian producers. Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift-Norwegian Journal of Geography Vol. 69, 00-00. ISSN 0029-1951. The article draws on the theory of conventions to analyse the shift in the geographical origin of salted codfish consumed in Spain. Since the mid-1990s, Norway has lost most of its market share to new suppliers such as Iceland. The authors analyse a dataset comprising statistical data and information from semi-structured interviews conducted with Spanish processing companies, retail outlets, foodservice managers, and private consumers. They find that this substitution process is a consequence of the ability of new suppliers to meet the more complex demands of the increasingly segmented Spanish market. Further, regional consumption patterns in Spain are diverging from the comparatively homogeneous situation that underpinned the traditional Norwegian hegemony. Industrial, market, and public conventions have become more influential in the most populated regions, such as Madrid, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. The authors argue that a stronger focus on the upper segment of the Spanish codfish market, based on domestic, ecological, and civic conventions, might constitute a reliable strategy for Norwegian producers to recapture some of their market share. It is concluded that concerned consumers in Spain are still sensitive to attributes related to origin, sustainability, and local development, all of which underpin the Norwegian salted codfish production system.

J	Gollisch, S; Theuvsen, L				Gollisch, Simon; Theuvsen, Ludwig			Risk management in the farm supply sector - characteristics, challenges and implications	BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT			German	Article								The farm supply sector has always played a vitally important role in the agricultural value chain due to its function as an intermediary between agriculture and its upstream and down-stream stages in the value chain. Against the background of sustained structural change and increasingly globalised markets, however, the remaining businesses of this sectors are faced with existential challenges. Narrow margins, increasingly volate prices for raw materials and the danger of disintermediation of some parts of the entire value chain have made it inevitable for this sector to incorporate aspects of risk strategy into their business management. The following article deals with these issues by analysing two major aspects: what are the specific requirements for an integral risk management system in the farm supply sector, and how should the risk management be set up? This evaluation is based on the analysis of several branch-specific factors which contribute to the high degree of economic and organisational complexity of businesses in the farm supply sector.

J	Rodriguez-Lopez, J; Aguaded-Gomez, I				Rodriguez-Lopez, Jennifer; Aguaded-Gomez, Ignacio			The Music Video Value Chain: Music Video into Cultural Industries' Commercial Circuits	ADCOMUNICA-REVISTA CIENTIFICA DE ESTRATEGIAS TENDENCIAS E INNOVACION EN COMMUNICACION			Spanish	Article						Music Video; Phonographic Industry; Cultural Industries; Value Chain; Promotion; Distribution		The music video is part of the cultural industries as a commodity produced by record companies. It is based on a theme song for the construction of an audiovisual product and at the same time sold other items like disk. This dual nature makes the music video a cultural product itself and a promotional tool for other items in the entertainment industry. This paper raises the value chain of the music industry through various agents involved for subsequent extrapolation to the music video as a product of the culture industry. It aims to show the internal structure of the phonographic industry during the phases of development, marketing and distribution of the product and compare the value chains of the disc and the music video and differences of those physical products digitally created and online distributed. The methodology is based on the description and comparison of both products of the record industry. The main conclusion is a defense to the music videos's autonomy as format, with the creation of its own value chain and its establishing as an independent product from other commodities produced by the phonographic industry.

Strategic alliances of operating firms in mobile communication industry are grouped according to the basic activities of value chain analysis, thus, strategic alliance model of the companies in the mobile communication industry is set up. As a result, it is seen that supply alliance, technology alliance and distribution alliance increases sustainable competitive advantage. Morover, the number of partners composinf the alliance rather than the number of alliances create value and increase sustainable competitive advantage in marketing alliances, and service and content alliances.

J	Hamann, K; Griffith, G; Mounter, S				Hamann, Karen; Griffith, Garry; Mounter, Stuart			Evaluating the consequences of imports on a local value chain: the case of Danish pig meat exports to the Australian market	AUSTRALIAN AGRIBUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article								Imports of pig meat into Australia have grown rapidly in recent years and now total around 150Kt pa (shipped weight). This is well over 300Kt in carcase weight terms, and makes up two-thirds of processed pig meat production and about half of domestic consumption. A recurring question is whether these trends have harmed the domestic pig industry and, if so, to the degree sufficient to warrant safeguard action under WTO regulations. While the Productivity Commission regularly examines the aggregate data to test this hypothesis, in this paper we investigate the value system that coordinates the imports of Danish pig meat into the Australian pig meat market, and we seek to identify which parameters impact this value system. We find that the Danish pig meat industry built its current position in the Australian market (about 40Kt pa, mainly middles for bacon) based on the following determinants of value: economies of scale in production, processing and logistics; uniform quality of the middles; high food-safety and veterinary standards; the ability to supply a customised product "made to order"; and a long-term focus on the customer. Other conributing factors include Australians' strong preference for ham and bacon which means that Danish suppliers can obtain higher prices in Australia for middles than they can elsewhere, and the recent strength of the $AU: the $AU/Euro rate has fluctuated between 0.64-0.86 over recent years. Import prices set domestic prices for manufacturing type pig meat, and imported products are typically cheaper than domestically produced pig meat suitable for manufacturing. Given the latitude allowed by the arguably ineffective country-of-origin labelling laws, cost efficient manufacturers will use imported product. This has resulted in a considerable degree of industry consolidation as well as a marked decline in the production of pigs more suitable for manufacturing pig meat in Australia. Those producers who are left have moved out of the processed market towards the fresh pork market and, to a lesser extent, towards export markets. We also examine one of the dominant value chains in this system and analyse how it achieved and maintains success.

The analytical framework is based on an analysis of private and value chain-level net benefits from alternative policy actions and research and training initiatives. Seven candidates for policy implementation with the best prospects for success are examined: industrial policy; improving food quality; branding and labelling; encouraging strategic alliances; increasing the managerial role of members in housewives' groups; educating members of housewives' groups and group leaders; and improving the organisational structure of housewives' groups. A suitable institutional setting is essential for policy success. We describe a chain governor and cooperative research centre for cottage foods that would fit neatly into the existing policy milieu in Thailand. This paper highlights the potential to improve the performance of housewives' groups and stimulate its growth as a key income-generating activity for rural households in developing countries.

J	Yasin, AWN; Griffith, G				Yasin, Ade Wiguna Nur; Griffith, Garry			Value Chain Investment for Sustainable Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation: A Case Study of the Indonesian Boiled Fish Market	AUSTRALASIAN AGRIBUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						Value chain; Poverty reduction; Indonesia; Boiled fish; Horizontal and vertical integration		Poverty is serious and widespread in the rural coastal areas of Indonesia. Government data suggests that more than 7.8 million people in more than 10,500 villages live below the poverty line. A rapid poverty reduction program has been conducted since 2011 through the provision of infrastructure that supports more productive industries. However, even if the infrastructure is available, can small-scale food producers in coastal areas achieve self-propelled development if they are still poor? The value chain approach to development is suggested as a complement to the existing infrastructure development program by opening up market channels for high value products through vertical linkages. Pindang or boiled fish is used as a case study, since the industry is quite large and it involves many low-income people. Its current value chain is analysed to define the bottlenecks. This leads to a conclusion that to achieve greater economic development, small-scale pindang producers could consider (a) improving their product quality and diversifying their product range, (b) increasing economies of scale by upgrading horizontal linkages, and (c) introducing new leading firms within vertical linkages.

Development of network-ranking modeling in planning effective efficiency of multi-stage production industries value chain: A case study of textile industry	BULGARIAN CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Value chain; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Ideal decision making unit; Network- Ranking models; Linear Programming	SUPER-EFFICIENCY; DEA; UNITS	In order to manage the organization, in n-stage production industries it is important to know whether it is better that, in any of the n-stages of production, a semi-manufactured good is directly sold in the market or it is allowed that completely manufactured good is sent to market at the end of chain. Which of them will have effective efficiency and more profit? Also, it is of great importance for the macro-level planners, in order to strengthen the internal productions against imports and also to gradually create a brand and empower it to gain sustainable competitive advantage in any stage of goods exports. Presented model, formulated through linear programming, can evaluate and assess the strategy of pure profit management by efficiency based on each of production stages work stations (White Box). In fact, a network-ranking model is considered for multi-stage series processes using collective performance analysis to p-stage processes. The ideal decision unit could reach the efficiency of 1 due since it consists of production stations whose efficiencies are 1. With this decision unit, a set of improvement strategies for all 10 understudy production stations can be suggested. It can be claimed that the suggested strategies are based on reality. When two or more networks have the same efficiency, they can be ranked by means of this ideal decision unit.	[Aboumasoudi, A.

J	Ali, J; Kumar, S				Ali, Jabir; Kumar, Sushil			Understanding the contract structure for mango and empirical analysis of its determinants	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						India; Factor analysis; Contract arrangement; Contract attributes; Vertical coordination; Mango value chain	TRANSITION AGRICULTURE; TRANSACTION COSTS; DESIGN; ENFORCEMENT; CHOICE; RISK; PREFERENCES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the structure of contractual arrangements in mango orchards and factors affecting the mango contract design in India. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on personal structured questionnaire survey of 83 contractors in one of the major mango growing areas in India. A snowball sampling approach was adopted to select suitable respondents for the study. Descriptive statistics have been computed to understand the contractor's response on contract attributes. Factor analysis was used to categorize the contractors' responses on various attributes of the mango contract. Further, a logistic regression model has been developed to determine the factors affecting the contract decisions. Findings - The study identifies nine aspects of mango contracting covering orchard owner, orchard and contract management characteristics. Further, a logistic regression model has been developed to assess the factors affecting the contractor's decision on the time of entering into mango contracting, i.e. pre-flowering or post-flowering stage. Regression analysis results clearly indicate that contractors who prefer pre-flowering contracts pay significantly higher attention to contract management attributes. On the other hand, those contractors who normally enter in contract once the mango trees have flowered are more likely to pay attention to orchard-related features. Practical implications - Specifically, the results have implications for contract terms, contract efficiency and effectiveness and overall performance. Finally, the study provides suggestions for a future research agenda to analyze mango production contracts. Originality/value - Though contracting in mango growing is a common phenomena, there is limited analysis on identifying the key contract attributes and factors affecting the contract structure.

J	Bukenya, JO; Ssebisubi, M				Bukenya, James; Ssebisubi, Maurice			Price Transmission and Threshold Behavior in the African Catfish Supply Chain in Uganda	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS			English	Article						African catfish; price transmission; price linkages; supply chain		The issue of price linkage in the catfish supply chain in Uganda is important because catfish has become an important traded species with exports to regional markets rising even faster than production, yet limited research has been undertaken to understand the linkages and the non-linearity in the price transmission mechanism. This paper explores the issue using monthly price data from January 2006 to August 2013, and applies threshold autoregressive approaches to test for the existence of a long-run relationship and price asymmetry. The results show that prices in the catfish value chain are tied together by a long-run relationship. It is also revealed that ex-vessel and wholesale price adjustments to retail price changes are symmetric while ex-vessel price adjustments to wholesale price changes are shown to be asymmetric. The direction of causal relationships was observed from the retail to the wholesale and ex-vessel markets, indicating that retailers are the price leaders in the Uganda catfish supply chain.

An empirical application for fish sector	ECONOMIA AGRARIA Y RECURSOS NATURALES			Spanish	Article						Value chain; quality; consumer behavior; fish products; traceability		The aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework that allows implementing a traceability system in fish sector and getting the maximum benefits. The conceptual framework proposed is based on the creation of networks between actors along the value chain. The creation of these networks would not only facilitate value chains with high levels of security but also would inform the consumer about the relevant intrinsic properties that provide the product quality (e.g origin). Regarding the signaling of traceability, clear, credible and easy to use informative signals need to be implemented. Finally, it is necessary to improve the process of authentication or verification of intrinsic properties at critical points of the value chain.

In this sense, the value chain concept is to be understood as a set of client specific dimensions which should be researched by the company with the purpose of enhancing the company's general economic and marketing activity. These dimensions are divided in two categories, behavioural (observed) dimensions and psychological (unobserved), respectively. The value chain logic is that the company's marketing activities determine psychological reactions which generate behavioural reactions which are directly associated with the company's economic performance. The following quantitative marketing research will analyse how the client's psychological variables interact with the behavioural ones; for this, structural equation modelling is used	[Cetina, Iuliana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Dumitrescu, Luigi; Tichindelean, Mihai; Opreana, Alin] Lucian Blaga Univ, Fac Econ Sci, Sibiu, Romania		Cetina, I (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.	mihai.tichindelean@ulbsibiu.ro	Tichindelean, Mihai/AAH-2726-2019; Opreana, Alin/I-1178-2016	Tichindelean, Mihai/0000-0003-4888-4776; Opreana, Alin/0000-0001-8860-1609	European Social Fund within the Sectorial Operational Program Human Resources Development;  [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/133255];  [133255]	This work was supported by the strategic grant POSDRU/159/1.5/S/133255, Project ID 133255 (2014), co-financed by the European Social Fund within the Sectorial Operational Program Human Resources Development 2007-2013.

J	Dyma, OO				Dyma, O. O.			Prospects for implementation of the sustainable development strategy by domestic retailers through the private labels introduction	MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS			Russian	Article						own trade label; private label; retail network; sustainable development; market research		The aim of the article. The aim of the article is to identify prospects of sustainable development strategy implementation through private label development. Further retailers' steps on the promotion of sustainable development ideas among the participants of the value creation network and the end-users through private labels are offered. The results of the analysis. Private labels are becoming more and more popular in Ukraine. A buyer is more likely to spend his / her money on private labels for consumer products and household chemicals. Private labels can also be found in stores of consumer electronics. On a global scale, there are examples of retailers with the share of private brands reaching up to 100%. National retail networks are gradually increasing sales of goods under private labels. The share of private labels in the domestic retail sales is 5%, and is showing significant growth rates. Private labels allow retailers to tighten control over producer, draw customer attention by lower prices and generate higher revenue due to the low costs of products which are sold under a private label. The social advantages of a private label should also be considered. Lately, more and more attention is paid to environmental pollution and negative effects on human beings. This problem could be solved with the help of private labels through regulation and education of value chain participants and customers. Analysis of the top global retailers' best practices on implementing the principles of sustainable development allowed to reveal the following activities: charity, energy efficiency, renewable energy, optimization of water consumption, emissions regulation, naturalness and quality management, staff training, supplier management, old (spoiled) product processing management, cooperation with state authorities. It revealed several trends, that are common to the retail market: major efforts are concentrated on "internal" efficiency. This is accomplished through energy efficiency and staff training, which undoubtedly will increase the efficiency of the network in the long run; the vast majority of retailers pay much attention to working with the supplier, monitoring the naturalness and high quality of the product, which is sold through the network. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Private labels are a major means for spreading sustainable development ideas among customers and manufacturers. Retailers, which are in the chain of value creation, should take initiative to strengthen the stability of the socio-economic environment. Unfortunately, research has not shown high activity of domestic retailers in sustainability managing across the entire value chain. But the positive experience of foreign retailers can help domestic networks choose the right path and approaches in the development of private labels at the early stage. The role of domestic retailers in ensuring the sustainability of economic, social and environmental parameters of the human existence environment should be examined more detailed in the future.

J	Fernandez, PE				Elisabet Fernandez, Paola			THE BOOK IN THE PROCESS OF DIGITIZATION AND CONVERGENCE. MUTATIONS IN PUBLISHING AND MEDIA CONSTITUTE INTELLECTUAL WORKS.	PERSPECTIVAS DE LA COMUNICACION			Spanish	Article						Publishing Industry (IE) New information and communications technology; book		In the digital context, the production processes of goods and intellectual works are characterized by technological, economic, social and cultural changes. The printed book, that intellectual goodness to (re) produced literary culture since the XV century, finds its most significant mutation in marketing support. Thus, the intellectual work in electronic or digital formats, requires us to reflect on the mutations occurred, especially from the XXI century, both economic and social-cultural structure. The paper will study the literary (regardless of playback support) from the changes brought in the value chain and production routines of publishing market goods. In turn, three specific aspects of analysis, allowing us to observe the mutations of the book in the digital scenario is proposed: the globalization process that outlines the new publishing structure (which outlines new profiles of authors and readers); the relationship between the written word and new technologies; the new role for the State, as guarantor of the provision to the public of goods and intellectual works and as agent to preserve a constitutive element of national identity. The overall objective is the description of a full overview of the current status of the book, with a focus on a series of partial articular considerations to enable those interested in the theme address it in national and international contexts.

J	Islambegovic, SN; Gadzo, A				Islambegovic, Selma Novalija; Gadzo, Amra			EVALUATION OF CUSTOMERS' PROFITABILITY IN THE ACCOUNTING PRACTICE OF TUZLA CANTON COMPANIES	EKONOMSKI VJESNIK			English	Article						Profitability management; customers' profitability evaluation methods; sectorial analysis of business indicators; transition economy; Tuzla Canton		The aim of the paper is to clarify and systematize the methods of evaluating customers' profitability on a scientifically based methodology. It also aims at investigating the relationship between business results achieved by individual sectors in the companies from the Tuzla Canton (TC) and the applied method of profitability management, in the function of generating such results. The analysis was conducted on the appropriateness of the current approach to profitability management according to information resources which served as the basis of the approach. Certain limitations were identified, which in practice lead to an inaccurate evaluation of customers' profitability. The transitional economy, characterized by macroeconomic instability and a low competitiveness factor in general, along with other numerous external limitations, requires that companies effectively rearrange their value chain, in the function of finding internal resources, in order to achieve long-term profitability of the customer portfolio management. The origin of modern trends in creation and maintenance of comparative advantages of the company lies in adoption of the "Customer Relationship Management" (CRM) business philosophy. The research results indicate insufficient knowledge of the management about the key "drivers" of success in achieving comparative advantages and point to inadequate organization of the accounting function which is not able to support a modern approach to business performance management.

S	Lubyova, M; Babos, P		Jamilov, R; Akbar, YH		Lubyova, Martina; Babos, Pavol			THE NEO-TRANSITIONAL PARADOX: RESTRICTIVE CAPITAL REGULATIONS, AUTHORITARIAN STATE AND LIMITED WELFARE TYPE OF CAPITALISM EXAMINED IN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT	NEO-TRANSITIONAL ECONOMICS	International Finance Review		English	Article; Book Chapter						Economic integration; international economic order; varieties of capitalism	HINDER DEMOCRACY; VARIETIES; ECONOMIES; EUROPE	In this paper we show that the neo-transitional economies are less neoliberal than could be expected given their 25-years long transition towards building market environment, supporting entrepreneurship and restoring capitalism in general. According to factor analysis results based on a cross-sectional sample of 134 countries during the period of 2010-2012 we find that the neo-transitional economies are characterised by relatively restrictive trade and capital regulations, average level of labour protection and low activity of state in terms of tax-based redistribution and social cohesion support. We briefly review several theoretical frameworks, such as the World System Theory, Commodity Chain and Global Capital theory, and Varieties of Capitalism framework, and point towards their limitations in explaining these transitional outcomes. We conclude that these frameworks are not capable of providing the explanations mainly because of their limited or no concern for labour and capital, and their interactions with the national institutions. We conclude that the history of industrialisation and path dependence provides a more plausible framework for explaining the neo-transitional outcomes. Furthermore, the consideration of the 'resource curse' and authoritarian regimes in many CIS countries can explain their neglect for tax-based redistribution and the high degree of government interventions in trade and capital regulations.

These tools have recently received more and more attention from the international academic and professional community, given the urgent need to promote a socially, environmentally and economically sustainable development of tourism. The use of reporting systems can encourage responsible practices by tourism businesses, improving internal processes and activities along the tourism value chain, as well as enhance consumer confidence in respectful companies and in responsible tourism. Through the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the chapter develops a critical assessment of the reporting systems currently available in Europe, in order to support the diffusion of responsible policies and practices in the tourism industry and the businesses' commitment towards clients. Particular attention is paid to small and medium-size tourism enterprises, since they have more difficulties in organising their business according to social and ecological principles and to develop the conditions under which a product can be defined as "responsible." The analysis underlines that the evaluation of these tools, in terms of their effectiveness and reliability in monitoring business responsibility, depends on the criteria taken into account for the analysis and then on the auditors' selection of appropriate variables.

B	Musalia, LM		Malik, PK; Bhatta, R; Takahashi, J; Kohn, RA; Prasad, CS		Musalia, Levi Mugalavai			Climate Change: Impact of Meat Production	LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE	CABI Climate Change Series		English	Article; Book Chapter							ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT	Between 1961 and 2009, the world recorded a continued increase in the demand for meat, driven by the fast growth in population, economic improvement, changes in eating habits and rapid urbanization. This has resulted in improved livestock production that is projected to continue even into the future. However, raising animals for food has been identified as a major contributor to climate change. As more meat is produced to satisfy the increasing demand, it is important to understand its effect on climate change, which continues to be a threat to food security. Livestock production contributes 14.5% of the total greenhouse gases (GHGs) that originate directly from the animal in the form of enteric emissions (39%), or indirectly from activities in the meat production value chain like animal feed production and processing (45%), manure decomposition (10%) and slaughter, processing and transportation of animal products (6%). The amount of GHGs emitted in meat production depends on the type of feed and the capability of the animals to digest and utilize feeds, thus minimizing the amount of waste excreted. The production of meat is a very inefficient system where animal proteins require 11 times more fossil fuel compared to plant protein. The efficiency of meat production reduces in the order of fish, poultry, pork and beef. Efficient meat production systems also cut down on the emissions associated with the production of massive feeds. Meat production systems involving ruminant animals and feeding fibrous or poor-quality feeds contribute significantly to enteric emission and manure production, and the inefficiency of feed utilization and meat from these systems has a high GHG effect.

BUILDING CONFIDENCE IN EAST ASIA: MARITIME CONFLICTS, INTERDEPENDENCE AND ASIAN IDENTITY THINKING	Palgrave Pivot		English	Article; Book Chapter								Rapidly growing economic interdependence is a significant factor in East Asian security. Aided by regional free trade agreements and multilateral frameworks, East Asian interdependence is now qualitatively different, with FDI playing a critical role even as the region enmeshes itself in the production value chain. Hence, a conflict seems unlikely because of high costs. The causal relationship between domestic stability and economic development, between growing prosperity and democracy, and democracy and peace are evident. Undoubtedly, a major deterrent for China in undertaking military adventures is its critical economic ties with the rest of the region. Since East Asia is still grappling for a stable order, it is necessary to create and strengthen robust region-wide institutions while building a regional balance of power.	[Naidu, G. V.

J	Odozi, JC				Odozi, John Chiwuzulum			Cross border trade in grain between Nigeria and neighbouring Niger: Risk management assessment along Sokoto Illela-Konni border land	COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE			English	Article						regional trade; food security; risk; value chain; borderland; grain production		Grain is an important marketable commodity that is hampered by risk of interrelated dimensions, particularly in borderlands of West Africa. Assessing the extent of risk in borderlands can be valuable for policy-makers and likely to contribute to increased regional trade through effective management. Risk management along the grain supply chain was investigated. The methodology was qualitative using desk review of literature and field survey and interviews. While the survey revealed evidence of substantial volume of grain exchange, most of the traders indicated transportation, high taxes and low production of grain as the most important risk factors limiting trade. Production was found to be limited by low access to agricultural insurance, fertilizer, irrigation and credit. Although farmers had access to production information, market information was inadequate. While public grain reserve exists to manage price risk; the capacity was insignificant compared to the magnitude of grain trade in the region. The guaranteed minimum grain price was not collectively determined but by government and their contractors.

Integrating Green Fiscal Reforms into the Agricultural Transformation Agenda: Panacea for Boosting Soil Enrichment and Water Conservation for Sustainable Food Production in Nigeria	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; deforestation; green growth; value chain analysis; green fiscal reform; Willingness To Pay; Marshalian consumer surplus	ENDOGENOUS STRATIFICATION; MODELS; TRUNCATION	Nigeria had a booming agricultural industry and prominent world market shares in many of its commodities at independence. With the continuous decline in these, the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) has been floated to promote twelve commodities in production along their value chains. Various innovations and expected benefits feature in the programme. The cultivation methods and other activities within the nodes of the value chains do not however specify green growth strategy promoted by green fiscal reform policies. This implies the shortchanging of green growth strategy in the national development process and so the compromising of sustainability. This paper valued the environmental services loss resulting from deforestation associated with "slash and burn" arable crop expansion and the benefits of "green grabbing" - the deliberate appropriation of nature in the ATA. The profitability of food crop production with and without green fiscal reform policies integration was also assessed. Sampling procedures that included the stratified, simple random and purposive sampling were used at various stages depending on the objective. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaire. The analytical tools adopted were the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) of the referendum type, on-day site travel cost method and the budgetary analysis. Results showed that 66.37% forest land use changes occurred in a seven year periods for arable food crops expansion. The environmental services loss as depicted by the Willingness To Pay (WTP) was averagely N0.60billion/year. The stock recreation value derived from "green grabbing" for the same period with 5% of the Nigerian population of 150 million visiting the Obudu Mountain Resort (OMR) for recreational purposes considered was N4.41 x 1012 million. The recreation use benefits of the OMR based on the Marshalian consumer surplus computation was slightly higher for the same period. Profitability in food crop production without green fiscal reforms was higher as compared to when it was considered. This will encourage the food crop farmers to engage in actions that are inimical to environmental sustainability in the ATA. Sustainability of farming livelihood is therefore more likely to be ensured with green fiscal reform policy instruments integrated into the ATA. The ATA therefore cannot be sustainable under the current "business as usual" practice of "slash and burn" agriculture. The need to integrate green fiscal reform policies into the agenda therefore is urgent.	[Okojie, L. O.; Sanusi, R. A.] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Farm Mgt, Abeokuta, Nigeria; [Popoola, A.

J	Sanchez, LMO				Ortiz Sanchez, Luz Marilyn			The classic political economy and the cyberculture. The chat market as exchange of goods and services	ENUNCIACION			Spanish	Article						Value chain; cyberculture; economy; symbolic products; network		This article is an important part of the doctoral thesis topics "Configuration of the semiotics of the chat: a multimodal view", in which the reflection on the media and the means of production ownership is proposed, from the relationship between the users of electronic devices and the virtual - real ownership consequences, bearing in mind that the cloud production relation and the electronic interaction bring about a series of epistemological implications characterized by the virtuality whose market and process of interaction is the web. This interaction allows a straight relationship with the research about the chat in a cyberculture world and specifically the chat as an emergent language, since the relationship between the language and the culture, the language and the knowledge and the most relevant one, the language and the economy, from a production system point of view, are a way to understand the symbolic products of the current society.

J	Rosi, B; Potocan, V				Rosi, Bojan; Potocan, Vojko			The Integration of the Supply Chain: Rationalization vs. Synergy	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; quality of management; innovative restructuring; integration; synergetic effect; rationalization effect; business re-engineering; value chain	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; BUSINESS CYBERNETICS; STRATEGY	Management can improve results of enterprises, above all, by an innovative re-allocation of available resources and a synergetic integration of their working. A significant factor of the quality of management in enterprises such as business systems (BSs) is their restructuring by an innovative integration aimed at achieving better business results through synergetic effects. BSs can improve cooperation between their parts or their cooperation in broader integrations. Our research is focused on the supply chain (SC) as an instance of a possible integration of logistics in or between BSs and on the economic reasonableness of their participation in an SC, aiming to take advantages of value chains. In practice, each BS can create its own SC or can participate in broader SCs. For that reason, the economics of the participation of a BS's parts in an SC, and BSs as parts in broader SCs, are considered. Additionally, the business processes of an SC are examined as the cybernetic entities of the basic, management, and information partial systems of the participating BSs. To create an integration process, the concept of Business Re-Engineering, which enables the simultaneous realization of both rationalization and synergetic effects and their direct support to the creation and exploitation of a competitive advantage of value chains in an SC, is applied.

S	Rossignoli, C; Ricciardi, F	Rossignoli, C; Ricciardi, F			Rossignoli, Cecilia; Ricciardi, Francesca	Rossignoli, C; Ricciardi, F		The Yoox Group Case	INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS: TOWARDS A DYNAMIC MODEL FOR UNDERSTANDING BUSINESS NETWORK PERFORMANCE	Contributions to Management Science		English	Article; Book Chapter							ANALYTICS	This chapter illustrates a case study that shows how the new internet-based information technologies can quickly make traditional business models a thing of the past, giving rise to new business models in which the consumer influences the organizational relations of the companies in the value chain. In fact, the advent of online and mobile technology has levelled the playing field for the smaller businesses, enabling them to leap the traditional barriers to achieve the economies-of-scale usually the sole domain of larger companies. Further, the pervasiveness of ICT has not just changed communication and purchasing processes, but also has led many businesses, particularly the retailers, to redesign their competitive strategies. One such player is Yoox, an e-commerce intermediary that serves the designer fashion market in 100 countries from a position of leadership. This chapter retraces the historical journey of Yoox Group and conducts an in-depth analysis of its business model. The discussion shows that Yoox Group can be defined as an "e-commerce intermediary" from the organizational perspective and that "e-intermediation" can be a form of extra and inter-organizational support for e-commerce processes. E-commerce processes are highly complex because they imply the fashion producers' externalization of the entire internet marketing and sales process, from the outsourcing of Web marketing activities and price-setting to billing and logistics. Hence, we will investigate Yoox's role as its own network's market maker and mediator and its business network governance mechanisms. The chapter concludes by demonstrating that not one of the theories on inter-organizational relations outlined in Chaps. 2, 3 and 4 can, in isolation, frame the success achieved by Yoox.

J	Stojanovic, V; Jugo, E; Ceric, A				Stojanovic, Vladimir; Jugo, Elvir; Ceric, Anes			BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET	CASOPIS ZA EKONOMIJU I TRZISNE KOMUNIKACIJE			Croatian	Article						globalization; market; business competitiveness		Production stagnation, inflationary trends and rising unemployment developed countries are solved through a fluster restructuring of their economies and a comprehensive economic recovery, rather than through constant strengthening of the role of the state in economic lift, increasing state sector of the economy or the increased paperwork in economic relations. Economic policy measures were routed to the strengthening of market mechanisms and market regulation of the flow of goods, capital, labor and knowledge, increasing growth, productivity and international competitiveness. Measures restructuring of the economic system go towards the development of new technology intensive manufacturing and software. Expanding business in markets around the world has a primary goal the achievement of competitive advantage. A precondition for achieving competitive advantages are primarily developed production factors for each industry and company. For each state it is primarily important that the volume of foreign trade is constantly increasing and that government policies strive to provide the best and take advantage of the influx of foreign investments. For a government to attract as much investment it needs to carefully manage the numerous economic factors, must have a legal system that can protect the rights of the owner. In this way, the state provides a tailwind for companies to its expansion on the international market finds the optimal location for all of its production activities in the "value chain'. Each stage in the value chain must be stored in places where conditions are most favorable filctors, company when investigating a location outside your home country, has two main priorities: product placement and cheap labor. In addition to these two priorities listed specific importance are the resources, transportation and supply, stimulate the state. The structure of local taxes must be known when the decision on the polbrmance at the new location. Undertaking are available four international strategy (international, global, multinational and transnational) that can be applied when it comes to two key factors, cost reduction and adaptation to local markets where it is to achieve a satisfactory level of competitiveness. In addition to the strategies outlined serious companies at foreign markets have a strategic orientation that favors global products and brands typable all its products and services in order to reduce costs which opens a larger space for investment in other new markets. No successfid companies and that did not adjust their assortments special preferences of the country to develop local brands that are targeted to segments of the local market. For the company it is very important to identify the potential economies of scale. Capacity markets around the world, has a particularly important role to support investment in research and development. A special advantage of the company is its orientation towards achieving a standard and recognizable quality level placed on numerous markets around the world. Global company its efficiency is achieved by using the potential economies of scale in all its activities in the value chain. Each company has its costs to maintain low in order to survive global competition. The transfer of activities to another company and moving activities outside the country are no longer free options for consideration, but an imperative to maintain a satisPctory competitive positioning of both the domestic and foreign markets. The company's success in the international market has great significance for the nut in terms () sustainable economic growth and development.

S	Strasser, J	Strasser, J			Strasser, Joseph	Strasser, J		Conceptual Approaches	BANGLADESH'S LEATHER INDUSTRY: LOCAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY	Springer Geography		English	Article; Book Chapter							GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS; VALUE CHAIN; INFORMAL ECONOMY; GOVERNANCE; STANDARDS; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; MEXICO; TRADE	The theoretical framework of this study draws on the global value chain (GVC) perspective that is complemented by considerations of informality, subcontracting and middlemen to explore and to uncover the informal dynamics in inter-firm linkages at the lowest end of the leather value chain. Strategies to overcome development constraints are drawn from the debate on economic upgrading in GVCs and embedded in the institutional context to achieve sustained competitiveness. Given its limited practicability, the global production networks (GPN) approach is deemed inappropriate for the extent of this study, although its notion of power, being negotiated in social interaction regardless of the firm's position in the chain, has been integrated. In the end of this section four research questions are outlined to analyse the complexities of inter-firm relationships in Bangladesh's leather industry, their informal dynamics and potential strategies to overcome structural constraints and to reposition themselves within GVC governance. The theoretical approaches synthesised in Table 2.1 constitute this study's analytical framework to understand the complexity of value chains. Considerations of informality, subcontracting and middlemen are added to the GVC perspective to explore and uncover the informal dynamics in inter-firm linkages at the lowest end of the leather value chain. Strategies to overcome potential constraints are drawn from the debate on upgrading in GVCs and embedded in the institutional context to achieve sustained competitiveness.

S	Strasser, J	Strasser, J			Strasser, Joseph	Strasser, J		Methodology	BANGLADESH'S LEATHER INDUSTRY: LOCAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY	Springer Geography		English	Article; Book Chapter								Qualitative research complemented by specific quantitative methods has been chosen as an approach to explore and understand specific dimensions of the complexly governed leather value chain. The data source of this study is drawn from empirical field studies in Dhaka, Bangladesh and other sections of the international leather value chain in 2010-2014. Conceptualising the Bangladeshi leather industry within a global value chain served as an analytical framework to define the coordination of inter-firm activities, their business dynamics and power asymmetries at the corresponding nodes in the chain. The complexity of transactions in the chain, the ability to codify these transactions and the capabilities in the supply base were key determinants for an analytical understanding of the value chain. After introducing the research design, which links the development of a conceptual framework, the definition of research questions and data collection coherently, the study site and research methods will be presented. Ultimately, limitations that are inevitably entailed by research in a socio-cultural environment that differs greatly from the author's will be addressed.

It looks into the organisation of the industry by analysing interactions of the dominant actors and tracing product flows within both subsectors leather processing and leather goods/footwear. In the leather processing industry emphasis is placed on the procurement of raw material the coordination of which is modified during the Muslim festival Eid-ul-Azha. The access to the international market will be analysed in light of trade and domestic policies and the power asymmetries within the tannery sector. Three areas have been identified as having strategic importance for leather processors to turn to informal practices and strategies to counteract dysfunctional institutions and power asymmetries on the way to global market entry: chemical imports, leather exports, and environmental regulation. Particular importance is attached to subcontracting schemes in the coordination of the leather goods and footwear subsector. The analysis of both subsectors leather processing and manufacturing ends with suggestions to improve their competitiveness. Upgrading strategies in the tanning industry will be assessed against the backdrop of the reality of informal dynamics in the export related areas. As for the leather goods and footwear subsectors, it is explored the extent to which the MSMEs interviewed learn and receive assistance to upgrade from local lead firms. Learning effects by foreign market integration will be examined to the extent that MSMEs have benefited from external development projects.

Constraints to Occupational Diversification among Rural Women in Anambra State, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Occupation; diversification; rural women; Nigeria		The study was carried out in Anambra State, Nigeria to ascertain constraints to occupational diversification among rural women. Questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 462 rural women. Percentage, mean scores, standard deviation, factor analysis and student's t-test were used for data analysis. Major constraints to occupational diversification were grouped into labour, institutional, technical and social problems. The study identified solutions to problems to include provision of adequate physical infrastructure such as roads, electricity and pipe-borne water in rural areas (74.2%), provision of social amenities such as hospitals (73.6%), establishment of industries in rural areas to create job opportunities (72.9%) and appropriate government policy on women empowerment (65.8%), among others. There was a significant difference between means of farm and non-farm income. The mean of farm income was. 31,022.8 while the mean of non-farm income was. 125,364 (t=12.136; p=0.05). The study recommends the inclusion of non-farm occupations in rural extension services especially value chain of cash crops as a means of improving income generation.	[Ajani, E.

A study on cognitive and psychomotor factors of hill farmers on adoption of agri-horti farming system	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Adoption and knowledge level; Agri-horti farming system; Field crops; Horticultural crops; Training needs		Adoption of agri-horti system and associated factors need to be viewed in totality which calls for the empirical evidences to design pin pointed programmes in order to enhance productivity. The study conducted in Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir state revealed that the farmers' adoption level of seed component of field crops and plant protection components of fruit crops were found to be low. Most of the respondents reported high level of training needs with respect to training and pruning, field sanitation, weed management, selection of fruit plants and diseases management. The farmers' characteristics like family occupation, land holding, economic motivation, innovation proneness and information sources utilization were found to be positively and significantly associated with their training needs. The farmers' preferences regarding training programme organization included one week duration, more focus on practical aspects with demonstration method and organization of training in small group in their own locality before sowing and planting season. Therefore, the study has highlighted the need for restructuring the training programmes to benefit the farmers operating agri-horti farming system. Such an approach would boost production and generate additional income for producers and other small scale operators along the value-chain.	[Chahal, V. P.; Nain, M. S.; Singh, Rashmi; Chandel, S.

J	Durr, J				Duerr, Jochen			Agro-extractivist value chains and regional development: the case of the Lower Tocantins River in the Brazilian Amazon	NOVOS CADERNOS NAEA			English	Article						Agro-Extractivist ValueChains; Regional Development; Lower Tocantins River; InputOutput-Tables		The Lower Tocantins river region offersa wide range of agricultural and extractiveproducts like acai palm fruits, pepper, oil palmsand manioc, whichare produced for localand national consumption and for exports. These productsdo not only generate value added in the agricultural sector, but also indirectly in other sectors like agro-industry and commerce. The value chains of agricultural and extractive products form the basis of the rural economy and hence for the development of the nine municipalities of the region. Twentyvalue chains are analyzed from primary producers to final consumers, including all the intermediaries in between. The evolution of the regional economy is then revealed by combining the structural value chain data with production data from the municipal level for the years 2001-2011. The results showthat agricultural and extractiveoutput valuehas increased by more than tenfold, mainly due to an enormous growth of acai plantations. The strong price increases also influenced positively the output value of all products, but only for halfof them an increase in output volumes could be observed. The regional value added is 50% of the agricultural output value. Therefore, the price boom should also have generatedhigher benefits to the regional non-agricultural sectors, including theacai traders and processors as well as the palm oil industry. These dynamics have consequences for the economic, social and ecologicaldevelopment of the region.

Value Chain Development Programme in Bauchi State, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Sesame; value chain; Bauchi State		The study characterized Bauchi State sesame value chain development programme that started in April 2008 aimed at maximizing agricultural revenue through the production of sesame. Ninety respondents purposively and proportionately selected constituted the population for the study. The study revealed that the respondents on average produced 6.49 90kg/bag of sesame and realized about N86,000 annually. The respondents perceived that the agencies have played most of the roles expected of them especially in supervising day to day activities of the demonstration farms (M=3.64) and in establishment of demonstration farms (M=3.55). Major constraints to the implementation of the programme as perceived by the respondents were marketing problems (M = 2.52) and lack of access to credit facility (M = 2.40). The study recommended that effort should be made to ensure that farmers get money for all seed produced and prevent exploitation of farmers by middle men.	[Gizaki, L.

J	Hunka, F				Hunka, Frantisek			Managing Processes in the REA Framework	JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN ACCOUNTING			English	Article						value modeling business ontology; REA ontology; managing process		The resources, events, agents (REA) ontology provides rules and guidelines for business process modeling utilizing the value-modeling approach. The core element of this approach is an REA model at the business process level. The REA model is usually governed by an information entity, such as a contract or a schedule. Although the REA model provides all necessary entities and relationships for value modeling, its support for information entity value creation, and its flow to the related process that it will govern, deserves deeper elaboration. The aim of this paper is to examine and propose a solution to information entity value creation within the REA model and its transfer to a related business process in compliance with the REA value chain concept. In order to distinguish standard REA business processes from those in which the information entities are created, these processes are called managing processes.

In doing so, the interview outlines the different definitions, framings and reconfigurations of those practices, enacted by network users, which have been labeled as "pirate" by different economic and political actors of the Internet value chain. Following Manach's reflections, the interview provides a few benchmarks towards a critical perspective on "piracy" as an ensemble of situated practices which places us, perhaps for the best of our society, in the condition of being "all pirates" of today's digital networks - engaged in the construction and sharing of cyberknowledge.

STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF DAIRY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN FAISALABAD, PAKISTAN AS BASIS FOR THEIR EFFICIENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Cluster analysis; dairy value chain; farm typology; milk buffalo; CatPCA (Categorical Principal Component analysis)		Qualitative and semi-quantitative data from 139 interviews with farmers in Faisalabad, Pakistan, was subjected to cluster analysis to identify homogenous groups of farms regarding production strategies, milk yields and marketing. Four distinct production systems were identified. Semi-commercial smallholder-mixed systems (SSM; 31%) combined crop and livestock production, and fodder was primarily produced for own livestock. Semi-commercial smallholder dairy producers (SSD; 21.6%) had few buffaloes and cattle and low income. Commercial smallholder dairy producers (CSD; 37.4%) were mostly well-off and produced substantial quantities of milk year-round. Commercial large-holder dairy farms (CLD; 10%) showed the highest input and output levels. In all systems, most of the produced milk was sold in the increasing order of percentage (SSM: 69%, SSD: 69%, CSD: 87%; CLD: 94%). Negligence in breeding, wastage of high yielding buffaloes, high costs of feedstuffs, an unfavorable marketing system and lack of a diversified dairy value chain were the main constraints for all production systems. Improving efficiency of the resources usage; especially with respect to animal genetics and nutrition, should be encouraged in dairy farmers of Faisalabad as well as other major cities in Pakistan to produce milk upto the maximum potential of their animals. This could satisfy the need of milk production for sale, serving both the increasing urban demand for milk, as well as income generation for the farmers. To this end farmers' endeavors must be supported by initiatives from government and private bodies.	[Tariq, M.; Hagmann, J.; Dossa, L.

Improving mill value chain by coupling sugarcane supply management and payment system models	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article						supply chain management; incentives; by-products; quality sugarcane; coupling models; cane payment system; information system		Research in the sugar industry value chain has been mainly focused on logistical opportunities and primarily on the upstream of the milling sector. Recent research has begun to address opportunities in information transparency, collective participation, value sharing and payment incentives. Because of co-product developments, some millers tend to modify both supply management and payment system. In practice, implementing such modifications requires technical solutions, economic assessments and collective participation of millers and growers. This paper presents a decision support system, called COMPA, to assess economic impacts on the sugarcane value chain of new supply planning and new cane payment systems. The COMPA software is the result of coupling two existing tools: MAGI (R), assessing the impact of new supply chain management on global value production, and PEMPA (R), assessing the impact of new cane payment systems on growers' revenue and on revenue sharing between stakeholders. COMPA scenarios outputs are compared on the basis of the total production, the individual revenue and the value sharing including sugar and co-products. The results can be used to support and facilitate negotiation between millers and farmers. The COMPA software has been used on Reunion Island to compare two different supply chain scenarios and payment systems. Simulations highlighted opportunities for improving sugar industry efficiency while facilitating the negotiation process between millers and farmers.

J	Chudasama, A				Chudasama, Arvind			Knowledge, an underexploited input for increasing not only cane productivity	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article						knowledge; inputs; productivity; marginal gains; social organisation		Increasing cane productivity continues to be one of the greatest challenges in the sugar industry against the backdrop of yield stagnation. Expansion in cane production will largely have to come from increasing productivity as expanding current areas and or identifying suitable new cane-producing areas become less of an option. Unlike the sugar beet sector, particularly in the EU and USA where beet productivity rates at farms are on average around 30% less than those obtained at research stations, the probable divide between cane yield differences at a farm and research station, is markedly higher. This paper argues that one of the compelling reasons explaining the huge difference in yields in the cane sector is probably to do with under exploitation of knowledge as an input. Whereas in the USA and EU there are examples of effective collaborative structures among growers, factories and research stations facilitating knowledge transfer, with the exception of Australia and South Africa, the cane industry is bereft of such successful models. In countries where cane yields are hovering at around 50-70 t/ha, opportunities for significantly increasing yields through employing the concept of marginal gains, whereby each aspect of the value chain in the production of cane is addressed to the highest standard, are real.

This study compares two global companies, the Mexican Su Karne and the Brazilian business consortium JBS-Friboi, which is the leader in the world market, and the possible implications of their business models on the network value of Mexican beef meat. First, as context, a revision is made of the recent behavior of livestock production and beef meat exportations from Brazil and Mexico. The cases are analyzed through documental review and interviews with officials and experts involved in the value network. As a consequence of a more competitive environment in the global market, the Mexican packers will have to find new competition strategies, such as diversifying markets and building strategic alliances to exploit economies of scale and scope and standardize quality.

Similarly in material procurement, the Fujitsu Group is aiming to reduce environmental loads in the upstream areas of its value chain through its business partners by promoting green purchasing activities. Since these activities were started in 2001, the Fujitsu Group has been considering both regulatory compliance of supplies and business partners' promotion of environmental activities, both of which are important. Therefore, the Fujitsu Group is working to promote the establishment of the Environmental Management System (EMS) at business partners, and after that, eliminating restricted chemical substances completely, responding to trends of legal restrictions and establishment of the Chemical substances Management System (CMS) related to them. Moreover, reducing CO2 emissions, preserving biodiversity, and conserving water resources have been added as themes of its activities one after another, considering the trends of international environmental issues. Furthermore, the Fujitsu Group not only requires these activities to be conducted, but also supports business partners in various ways and considers that promoting activities in cooperation with business partners is important. This paper introduces the main activities of the Fujitsu Group's green purchasing.										0	0	0	0	8	FUJITSU LTD	KAWASAKI	1015 KAMIKODANAKU NAKAHARA-KU, KAWASAKI, 211, JAPAN	0016-2523			FUJITSU SCI TECH J	Fujitsu Sci.

J	Hughes, B				Hughes, Boris			A Different Way to Get to a Better Bottom Line in Publishing	PUBLISHING RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article						Print; Publishing; e-Books; Supply chain; Digital; Publishers		Considerable changes are taking place in the publishing industry, and to survive publishers cannot sit back and wait for the changes to take effect. With e-books supposedly pulling ahead in the publisher's race, the publishing industry must revise its business models to adjust to new demands. While e-books are attractive, print is still the major revenue engine within the world of publishing, and digital print is the future. Considering the entirety of the supply chain, it can be seen that digital book printing books saves money, supports more titles and increases efficiency. There is a different way to get a better bottom line, and publishers must consider the whole value chain, not just the unit price.

J	Laura, P; Pedro, A				Laura, Piedrabuena; Pedro, Arbeletche			Business Strategies in the Dairy Complex of Northern Uruguayan Coast	AGROCIENCIA-URUGUAY			Spanish	Article						dairy complex; business strategies; value chain; domination and dependency relations; Uruguay		Uruguay has a vast experience regarding milk production and processing for local and international markets. This food-processing chain has allowed great development of production capacities in the primary and industrial phases, as well as in the commercialization of its products. The agrarian phase of milk production in Uruguay takes place in two main regions: the South Cuenca and North Coastal region. The aim of this research is to further the analysis regarding business strategies used by milk industries settled in the North Coast; and their impact on the agroindustrial complex, mainly during the primary stage, by identifying technical, economic, and financial relations. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative techniques allowed to understand more deeply the relations of domination in the complex. Although the three industries have similarities regarding size and number of producers -with very similar plants- they show important differences in both their agrarian base, and in their vertical strategies in the three identified areas of analysis; which justify their comparative study. The ownership structure of capital does not necessarily match the ways of exercising power within the complex; there are other factors that affect its actions and determine its dynamics.

To fundament the analyze it was used the production fragmentation concept. It was made a matrix of countries according to their position in the two selected indicators. As a result it was found four types of countries: (i) surplus technology leaders; (ii) deficit technology leaders; (iii) surplus technology followers and (iv) deficit technology followers. The paper concludes that the traditional theories about international commerce cannot explain the matrix as a whole. To do so, it is necessary to use the production fragmentation concept that is a new concept in the global value chain theory.

Therefore, we developed descriptive, qualitative application of semistructured interviews with managers of the links in the value chain of an agribusiness located in the northern region of Rio Grande do Sul Using the technique of content analysis, the data obtained from the interviews semistructured were analyzed as well as identified and mapped the value chain of agribusiness, which has vertical payment. It is noted that there is flexibility as to the requirements relating to the structure of the properties of farms. As for the size of the farm, it is believed that this interferes with the reduction of fixed costs of integration.

Smart Grid's concept is being more and more recognized for its importance for representing a way to meliorate the energetic efficiency of the electric system, reducing consumption, allowing intensive use of energy generation renewable sources. Therefore, the goal of this article is to explore and present Smart Grid's concepts and its global evolution, so as perform an assessment on Smart Grid's tendencies in Brazil. In order to do this, we shown the concepts of Smart Grid, its benefits and impacts in the electric system's value chain, the barriers to its diffusion in Brazil and the paths of investments incentives for deployment of the new technology. Accordingly, we reach the conclusion that the researches point to a long and challenging trajectory for the development and implantation of Smart Grid's technology in Brazil, which is still in an embryonic phase of pilot projects for the knowledge and technology development implantation.

J	Hameri, AP; Borg, A; Eloranta, E				Hameri, Ari-Pekka; Borg, Ari; Eloranta, Eero			Vendor-managed inventory in a global maritime supply chain - The case of a Brazilian pulp producer	MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS			English	Article						commodity shipping; international supply chain management; vendor-managed inventory; international maritime transport and distribution		Global trade lanes rely on shipping companies and operators to transport their goods. This may be changing as producers increase their control in downstream logistics. We examine how the flow of pulp from Brasilia to main markets in Europe has evolved, and how the roles of producers, ship operators and distributors in the value chain have changed and will continue to develop. By using an in-depth case study, we show some disruptive changes in the structure and operations of the concerned supply chain. The case company signed a long-term contract with a shipbuilder and operator company to transport its total export volume of wood pulp. Thus, the pulp producer's dedicated fleet enables a move from fluctuating, unreliable pulp shipments towards pre-scheduled, accurate deliveries to destinations within close proximity of the pulp customers' sites. Moreover, the pulp producer under study has also agreed with its key overseas customers that vendor-managed inventories (VMIs) will be implemented on a global scale to reduce inventories across the supply chain and improve customer service. In the current body of knowledge, VMI is mainly applicable in local contexts. There are only few cases documenting VMI implementation on a global scale, not to mention in the global maritime context. The case reported could serve as a precedence of novel solutions for supply chains more generally.

A structured questionnaire was developed as an instrument of data collection and applied to a population of 40 brazilian private hospitals in the period may to July 2010. Data analysis was qualitative and the results being obtained from a convenience sample cannot be extrapolated to all Brazilian private hospitals. The results showed that there is evidence of the practice of ICM in the hospitals surveyed, namely through: assigned purchases; scheduled shopping and service bundling. From ICM practices identified in the hospitals surveyed, only the ' bundled services' can be considered as an exclusive practice of ICM in the hospital sector. The other two, although they are being practiced by hospitals, are not unique in the industry. According to the statements of the hospitals surveyed The ICM is not on daily costs. There is also no evidence of its practice on internal processes, such as surgeries, sterilization materials, clothing processing, testing, etc. As a last finding considered relevant we highlight the fact that in the case of ' fair distribution of economic benefits' arising from a possible practice of ICM, in the perception of hospitals, higher expectations fall on their suppliers.

The paper takes an empirical study on the introduction of 3D-modelling tools in the building section in a Scandinavian engineering consultancy firm as its point of departure. The discussion identifies three different structural aspects, which all are affected by the use of ICT: Internationalisation vs. Local markets, Outsourcing vs. Structural integration, and Division of work between actors within the value chain.

J	America, C				America, Carina			Integrating sustainability into Business Education teacher training	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						business education; curriculum design; curriculum development; business economics education; education for sustainability; environmental education; sustainability; sustainable development; teacher education; teacher training	CONTEXTS	Businesses are increasingly coming under scrutiny from stakeholders who expect them to report how they protect the environment, how they guarantee no human and labour violations in their value chain, and how they function on ethical business principles. Businesses are trying to adjust to these changing environments for the betterment of society and the planet while still concentrating on profit. The same awareness and inquiry would be expected from business education student teachers who teach business principles and business operations. This study, which was conducted at three universities, describes the perspectives and sustainability virtues of pre-service business education teachers who attended a workshop aimed at integrating sustainability in their teacher training curriculum. A qualitative framework was adopted using three methods: focus-group discussions, reflection based on a video recording and a critical analysis of the curriculum. Findings suggest that incremental shifts in critical self-awareness of business education pre-service teachers occurred. A business education and education for sustainability synthesis is recommended and provided as a conceptual framework in this study. This synthesis can be a useful place to start to elicit critical self-awareness when pre-service teachers have to deal with the complex mix of the five types of learning, namely disciplinary, situational, practical, fundamental and pedagogical learning.

Through an investigation in an epistemological and ontological manner about the innovation and business processes, the organisational infrastructures and collaborations, and the information and communication technologies, the results show in an automotive context that these types of services are indeed involved in both the new product development process and in the operations management. Besides, as a part of the service sector, the after-sales service, in this context and this research, provides significant contributions to change management, since it is now a full actor in technology management and beyond.

J	Bartkowiak, P; Bernat, T				Bartkowiak, Piotr; Bernat, Tomasz			RENEWAL OF HEALTH SYSTEM MANAGEMENT IN POLAND - GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS	TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS			English	Article						medical markets; health care; purchase group; Poland		The medical market in Poland constitutes 0.6% of the world health market considering value and only 7-8% of GDP is spent on health care. Meanwhile, in Germany it is 10.5% and in the US the sum reaches 16% (OECD, 2010). Such proportions demonstrate the necessity on higher expenditures for Polish health care system or, even more, they should encourage dealing with such poor means more effectively. In relation to the above given, the expense assessment in hospital purchasing strategies should play an important role in daily business activity of health care institutions and their suppliers. Creating group purchasing organizations could be helpful. The elaboration is written on the basis of the authors' research (Bartkowiak, Domanski, Luty, 2013; Bartkowiak, Domanski, 2013). It analyses economic and legal conditions of creating Group Purchasing Organizations (GPO) in the health care system in Poland and GPOs in shaping the value chain on hospital services market The main objective is to describe the importance of GPOs in Polish health care system in the pattern of value optimization.

B	Becker, K	Rajagopal			Becker, Kip	Rajagopal		Process Innovation and Value Chain Management	ARCHITECTING ENTERPRISE: MANAGING INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGY, AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS			English	Article; Book Chapter								Process innovation is a chain of activities designed to reduce the cost and time of manufacturing a product or delivering a service with the desired quality and competitive advantage. The most challenging issue in process innovation and improvement is identifying the redundancies in the manufacturing or services delivery process and eliminating them to reduce the cost and time involved in the process of generating the final output. Therefore, it is essential for managers to understand the process at work and find a critical path to optimize the time and cost of carrying out an innovation. The relevant executives can design an efficient process to improve workable ideas that will make a real difference to the organization as they move the innovation into the marketplace. This chapter discusses the capabilities and competencies of companies in carrying out process innovation and value chain management, and analyzes the process outcome and focus. The chapter also addresses various issues referring to managing process improvements, and developing an innovation value chain.

The digital age has changed the needs of customers, and with the new demands, as well as declining mail volumes and strong competition in new and profitable areas, postal operators face huge challenges. This makes it important to focus on the strengths and unique selling propositions (USPs) of postal operators, and build a service portfolio around these strengths in order to maximize their USPs. This article summarizes the findings of Postal Services in the Digital Age, and creates, based upon the input and findings of other authors, a picture of the core postal competences, value propositions and new roles that would enable postal operators to strengthen or regain their position as connectors and solution-providers.

J	Burr, T				Burr, Thomas			Making Distribution Markets: Market-Wide Institutions in French and American Bicycle Distribution, 1865-1914	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							TRADE; COMMUNITY; FRANCE	Scholars usually analyze market-making within specific parameters. Market sociologists analyze institutions primarily between competitors; global value chain scholars study institutional innovation along exchange sequences; and varieties of capitalism scholars examine national institutional frameworks. I analyze how entrepreneurs and trade associations used market-wide institutions such as exhibitions and publications in French and American bicycle distribution systems between 1865 and 1914 to improve exchange efficiencies and to influence other market actors and the markets' environments. I argue that market-makers adjusted these institutions to market conditions, and also to national institutional frameworks.

J	Dansereau, LP; El-Halwagi, M; Stuart, P				Dansereau, Louis Patrick; El-Halwagi, Mahmoud; Stuart, Paul			Margins-based planning applied to newsprint manufacturing	TAPPI JOURNAL			English	Article							VALUE-CHAIN; MODEL	The North American newsprint industry is facing a difficult financial situation due to a major market decline. The application of supply chain management concepts could greatly help this struggling industry by enhancing the cost-effectiveness of operations. In this paper, an integrated tactical planning model based on optimization was used to exploit manufacturing flexibility in order to adapt production to changing market conditions. This model was applied to a real case study of a newsprint mill with overcapacity in its thermomechanical and deinking pulping lines. Results show that by using a margins-based planning model to identify better-adapted operating policies in case of varying wood chips and recycled paper prices, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) can be increased by up to 35%. The benefits of exploiting manufacturing flexibility were found to be more important in difficult market scenarios, highlighting its pertinence for providing more-robust planning approaches. Pulp and paper companies would benefit from using a margins-based planning model to manage the complexity of their operations in the face of market volatility.

J	de Oliveira, FF; Moura-Leite, RC				de Oliveira, Franciele Fanaia; Moura-Leite, Rosamaria Cox			Practices of corporate social responsibility in sustainability model	REVISTA CIENCIAS ADMINISTRATIVAS			Portuguese	Article						Actions; Social Responsibility Strategy; Responsive Social Responsibility		Social responsibility (SR) developed by organizations should not be made in an abstract manner. Social responsibility activities need to be linked to the business and should benefit the local community. The use of such practices characterizes the use of strategic SR, because it benefits all of the parties involved. Similarly, actions can also present practices with a responsive nature that occur when companies develop actions in order to reduce the damage of the value chain and be a good citizen (PORTER; KRAMER, 2006). Thus, this paper aims to describe the actions of corporate social responsibility developed by strong SR companies in their respective sectors and identify whether the actions taken by them can be classified as strategic or responsive. The methodology used in this research followed an inductive qualitative model and adopted the content analysis method to collect information disclosed on the Internet about SR. We analyzed two companies in two sectors that are known by the propensity to adopt socially responsible practices, these are: the cosmetics industry and the energy sector. In this sense, the study becomes relevant for both academic environment and society in general, because the strategic actions performed by organizations allows them to differentiate themselves in a highly competitive market and optimize the efficient use of resources. Thus, confirming that the majority of actions undertaken by the companies included in this research have a strategic character.

J	Dyma, OO				Dyma, O. O.			Contemporary understanding of the intermediary services	MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS			Russian	Article						service; intermediary services; services marketing; characteristics of services; mediator		The aim of the article. One of the most important trends of our time is the rapid growth of service sector in almost all countries, both developed and developing. Attention should be paid to intermediary services, which have specific characteristics - dualistic nature of needs, satisfaction of the producer and final consumer. Today we can observe transformation of the intermediary's role. Wholesalers are being replaced by logistics companies. Some functions of wholesalers are being fulfilled by manufacturers and retailers. Retailers, manufacturers and service companies are expanding their sphere of influence and are focusing their efforts on integration and coordination of participants in the value chain to ensure maximum satisfaction of consumer needs. Therefore, we need to make a critical analysis of the category of "intermediary services" and represent the author's understanding of the category of "intermediary services". The results of the analysis. Exploring a wide range of research papers devoted to the marketing of services allows us to conclude that it is difficult to distinguish between goods and services. In domestic and foreign literature, there are many definitions of services which are substantially different. Some definitions attempt to cover most of the features of services, while others can be quite vague, treating the "service" as "a specific type of product". The variation in the definition of the "service" may be due to differences in approaches to understanding the "service". So we have identified four different approaches to the understanding of the service category, taking into account the whole process of consumption of services, ranging from the emergence of the need for a particular service to the satisfaction of this need. The analysis has distinguished the following main characteristics present in the definitions of the "service" : process / result, consumer satisfaction, immateriality, tangibility, relationship. In addition to these characteristics, it is necessary to supplement the list with new ones that should be inherent in all goods and services in the current economic and social conditions. The advent of modern information technologies, changing social values and the transformation of consumption process (from individual ownership to joint consumption) require the following characteristics to be applied to "services" : sustainable development, mass customization and automation, the consumer's active participation in the production process. Intermediaries are able to implement the mentioned characteristics in the process of production and consumption, taking over the function of coordination and integration in the value chain. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Thus, definition of "service" needs consideration. Firstly, this is due to the dramatic changes in the nature of services. Secondly, the role of service organisation is changing. Thirdly, the actions that can be called "service" are numerous and varied, as well as objects to which these actions are directed. Fourth, the service sector is constantly changing, and the service is a flexible object whose boundaries vary depending on the intentions of the service supplier and / or customer. Fifthly, tangible goods can become a service fairly easily. The traditional role of the intermediary is changing. This is due to large-scale changes in the system of consumption and they have strong impact on the nature of goods and services. The task is becoming more complicated due to the individual character of intermediary services. It increases the risk of poor quality of service. On the other hand, immateriality and variability of services creates opportunities of continuous improvement of the service quality by adapting the procedure of performance. Permanent improvement of the quality of services will ensure a strong producer-middleman-consumer bond and profitable long-term cooperation. It is important to deepen the understanding of the role of the intermediary in coordination and integration in the value creating network. It is necessary to pay attention to the role of intermediary organizations in the new information (electronic) economy.	[Dyma, O.

S	Hintze, S; Luthje, C		Gilbert, N; Ahrweiler, P; Pyka, A		Hintze, Stephanie; Luethje, Christian			The Evaluation of Value Chain Marketing Strategies: An Agent-Based Approach	SIMULATING KNOWLEDGE DYNAMICS IN INNOVATION NETWORKS	Understanding Complex Systems Springer Complexity		English	Article; Book Chapter							INNOVATION; PRODUCT; CONSUMER; MODEL; ORIENTATION; PROTOCOL	Value chain marketing (VCM) has shown to be a promising strategy to overcome immediate customers' innovation resistance and thus increase the success of supplier innovations. By pursuing VCM, suppliers of entering goods such as raw materials, parts, or components enlarge their target group beyond their immediate customers (manufacturers) and target their downstream customers (applicators) as well. The nature of the VCM process depends on the timing of integrating the immediate customer. Based on the results of multiple case studies focusing on supplier innovations in the field of coatings and sealants, we confirmed that the effectiveness of VCM strategies depends on the newness of supplier innovation and the overlap between the knowledge bases of the involved actors. The analysis further suggested that the newness of innovation and the knowledge overlap are somehow interrelated. In order to assess the overall performance of VCM strategies, we propose an agent-based model and consider a multiplicity of VCM scenarios. In this paper, we provide a theoretical and conceptual foundation for the VCM model to simulate different settings in which supplier innovations are either implemented successfully or fail. We focus on the development of the model and not on the communication of the results of this model.

J	Kozlowski, RM; Mackiewicz-Talarczyk, M; Barriga, J				Kozlowski, Ryszard M.; Mackiewicz-Talarczyk, Maria; Barriga, Jorge			THE ROLE OF ESCORENA (EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF COOPERATIVE RESEARCH NETWORKS IN AGRICULTURE) IN AGRICULTURE KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER	SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES A-AGRONOMY			English	Article						ESCORENA; knowledge sharing; technology transfer		ESCORENA system was established in 1974 by FAO and European research institution. The European System of Cooperative Research Networks in Agriculture is an umbrella for cooperation between research institutions focused on food, agriculture and related fields. The ESCORENA is a bridge between FAO and agriculture to e.g. inform about newest FAO priorities elaborated in 2013, namely: supporting farm and production restructuring including agriculture, forestry and fishery; fostering land consolidation process; supporting local development strategies through participatory approach; strengthening capacity for rural stakeholder; integration of smallholders and SMEs into the value chain; providing support on adding value to products and services, activity and income diversification. Joint activity of high ranking specialists and agriculture research centers within ESCORENA under auspices up to now is characterized by e.g. organizing some thousands global consultations, conferences, workshops, seminars, and some knowledge share-fairs etc., which took place not only in Europe but in Near East, Africa, Asia, North and South America. ESCORENA and Networks which belong to ESCORENA publish recognized Journals like: Journal of Natural Fibers (in co-operation with INF&MP), Scientific Bulletin of ESCORENA (in co-operation with Arad University, Romania), EUROFLAX Newsletter, Buffalo, Nuts and allied. The examples of spreading/sharing knowledge and technology transfer e.g. in the scope of bast fibrous plants: starting production of linseed and derived products in Balkans countries (after the FAO/ESCORENA conference in Banja Luka, B&H, 2004), growing interest in production and processing of flax and linen goods in China (after conference in Shenyang, 2001) and renewed interest in flax and linen in Norway, Finland, Sweden (after conference in Tampere, 1998), also in East European and Asian countries after the FAO/ESCORENA congress at famous Vavilov Institute (1998) in St. Petersburg, Russia. Plans for future: elaborate more farmer focused approach, improve efficiency of technology transfer, continuation of publishing and organizing workshops and meetings, apply for funds e.g. through COST Actions and other.

J	Lin, LM; Lee, TD				Lin, Li-Min; Lee, Tain-Dow			Symbolic Economy and Creative Management: Cultural and Creative Industries Urging for New Approaches	ENCATC JOURNAL OF CULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND POLICY			English	Article						Symbolic goods; Social network; Experience marketing; Publishing industry; Performing arts		It is hard to apply empirical data to outputs of cultural and creative industries (CIs) due to their embodiment of aesthetics, taste, and experience. This article starts from the production side, showing the value chain model being inefficient to delineate the synchronical process and value accumulation of CIs. The article then refers to John B. Thompson's allusion to Pierre Bourdieu's concept of field and capital that defines the logic of the field and establishes a paradigm for CIs analysis. While it is inappropriate to use marketing strategies to decipher the consumption of outputs of CIs as symbolic goods, the examples of publishing industry and Broadway theatre industry explain that not only the consumption of outputs of CIs but also the way to consume such goods need to create experience and lead to accumulation of symbolic value. Therefore, though research on CIs has to consult marketing strategies and business models, it urges mostly a systematic sociology of culture.

Building a Better Livestock Market in Benin and a Safer, More Reliable Food Supply	INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						African agribusiness; livestock marketing; value chains; regional trade; private-public partnerships; cooperatives; producer self-managed livestock markets		The Nikki Regional Livestock Cooperative (UCOPER-Nikki) was concerned when Benin's national government made local authorities responsible for livestock markets. They knew that improved markets and infrastructure were essential to their economic future and a reliable, safe livestock/meat supply for customers locally and in southern Benin, Nigeria and Togo. A cooperative managed market was proposed in partnership with local government. Three years later the market is a reality. Total sales in 2011-13 approached $10 million USD, and the market is more profitable for producers, with positive impacts along the value chain including feed and animal health, livestock trade and processing, retailers and consumers.

Integrated water resources management performance analysis: results of a pilot study in West Africa	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA			English	Article						benchmarking; IWRM assessment; water governance; West Africa		This paper describes a pilot study that aimed at testing a set of indicators for the evaluation of the national water sector in West African countries. The set of indicators is based on a representation of the water sector as a production system embedding a value chain. The information relating to the production system is structured in three blocks: the context, the functioning (inputs and outputs) and the governance. The pilot study covered five countries and the results were debated in two regional workshops, led by the Water Resources Coordination Center of the Economic Community of West African States. The results show that the method gives an in-depth analysis of the water sector, in particular of water governance. The governance indicators can be used for periodical integrated water resources management (IWRM) audits but the complexity requires significant efforts in order to collect reliable data, in particular in West Africa where information tends to be fragmented.

The increasing emphasis on business development guided by attention to the requirements and demands of customers, cause nowadays, that the organizations of the commercial sectors work in the creation of a competitive differential. The collaborative business management strategy S&OP is looking for the attention of people who are interested in the improvement of their skills; in order to achieve this differential. With the case study methodology, the objectives are to get knowledge, identify, and analyze the characteristics of the company using analysis tools like SWOT, process analysis, value chain. All with the purpose to get a robust management tool that fits with the requirements and demands of the organization. The analyzed results showed that the principles of collaboration and internal communication were the pillars necessary against any attempt of business development. This supports the proposal of a management structure based on the five step S&OP process. As a complement to this study a methodology CPFR was identified as the platform for an integrated work with the rest of the companies of the supply chain.

J	Garcia, FSM; Aranda, DA				Sanchez-Montesinos Garcia, Francisco; Arias Aranda, Daniel			Servitization: An essential tool on future media firms management	INTANGIBLE CAPITAL			Spanish	Article						Absorptive capacity; motivation; servitization; Customer Relationship Management	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; IMPACT	Purpose: This paper analyses the relationship between adaptation and servitization with absorptive capacity as mediating variable in local media companies. The study focus such relationship within the use of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems in those companies. Results show that low levels of absorptive capacity of the companies are related not only to technological aspects of guidance or investment in R&D companies in this sector but they are also closely related to motivation to change of its members as well as the involvement of managers in adapting to servitization. This fact allows the firms to identify the needs of their current and potential customers through the provision of services to add value to the media product. Design/methodology: This article is based on a sample of 54 publishers of regional and local press. We used path analysis, which allows us to determine the degree of influence of each of the dimensions of the constructs studied (motivation to change, absorptive capacity, and performance of the company in the dual capacity as workers and processes). Findings: The results support the hypothesis that absorption capacity is essential to evaluate, assimilate and apply especially, for commercial purposes, external expertise to guide these companies towards new business models that add new value to the customer. In order to integrate the customer inside the value chain a shift from an operations model to a production model of service operations is crucial. Currently, newspaper companies are going through difficult times. Readers and advertisers which are the two main sources of income seem to be turning to other means of communication which adversely affects its financial performance. To meet these challenges, newspapers must change the way they organize their activities. However this requires a catalyst such as motivation to change, such as in the case of web newspapers trying to maximize servitization based on knowledge of customer needs. This evolution of the traditional model weakness occurs due to low levels of absorption capacity of these companies explained by other variables such as low motivation towards change of the members of the organization. Research limitations/ implications: Our work presents the characteristics of an exploratory study with limitations as we deal exclusively with media release written for regional and local character, which makes the results difficult to extend to other sectors and even within the publishing industry nationwide. Some aspects of this work have not been sufficiently developed, such as those related to the importance of multidisciplinary training, the organization of work in these companies and their leadership, and the origin of the dual nature of these companies. Practical implications: The results of our study show that media companies should emphasize, especially in the case of publishers of written newspapers, customer relationships for readers and advertisers. This is where the implementation of IT systems to inform about customer preferences allows media companies to get closer to their customers (readers and advertisers) differently as they used to do. In the case of online media, publishing companies seemed not to have a clear objective and preferences to allow them to add services to the traditional product in order to foster satisfaction for readers and advertisers and improve knowledge. In this paper we show a model for motivation to involve managers to find variants or alternatives to the current business model in order to meet the needs of their customers. Originality/value: We are facing a shortage of scientific literature that relates, directly, absorptive capacity, CRM and servitizacion applied to media companies in print and much less so obviously highlight the importance of motivation change as a variable to explain the varying ability of companies belonging to this sector. This Research also proves that this sector has a special need to develop motivation to initiate servitization strategies for future survival.

J	Tellez, JCS				Sanclemente Tellez, Juan Carlos			The small retailers and their contribution in the realization of Inclusive Businesses in Colombia	REVUE INTERVENTIONS ECONOMIQUES-PAPERS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY			Spanish	Article						BOP; inclusive business; neighborhood shopkeepers; poverty; retailing; supermarkets		The Inclusive Business, approach from the study and argumentation in business strategy, are business initiatives that incorporate into the value chain of a company, to low- income communities, seeking to improve their quality of life. Companies have decided in recent years to invest significantly in this business considering essentially the motivation of profitability and develop actions that allow them to generate social value responding to their corporate social responsibility strategy. Shopkeepers neighborhood ("tenderos de barrio") in Colombia are traders engaged in retail distribution in the country, basically necessities and daily consumption of the general population and openly compete in the market against the main commercial rivals of large retail companies. From an empirical investigation with shopkeepers ("tenderos de barrio") in the city of Medellin (Colombia), is proposed in this article (by way of reflection), that this type of small traders can develop inclusive business with other entrepreneurs from the community, generating improvement in the quality of life of its environment and establishing actions of "informal", "unplanned" and implied corporate social responsibility and thereby contribute to social, environmental and economic aspects of the community in developing their business.

J	Shin, KH				Shin, Kyoung-Ho			Global interconnectedness and multiculturalism in undergraduate sociology courses in the USA	INTERNATIONAL STUDIES IN SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION			English	Article						global interconnectedness; multiculturalism; undergraduate sociology courses; MUPCAG		'This study attempts to explain a process of inserting global transnational elements into an undergraduate sociology course. After a review of global themes covered in introductory sociology textbooks, the author administered two projects (Global Multiculturalism and Sociology of Wal-Mart) in an undergraduate sociology course. The current study reports the techniques used within these projects called the Multi-Phase Class Activity of Globalisation (MUPCAG) model used in General Sociology classes, student reactions related to them, and the significance of the projects in terms of teaching and learning. The MUPCAG model was to enhance students' understanding of global multiculturalism and interconnectedness, in particular, students' critical thinking about the issues of globalisation. It was observed that students showed more flexible and diverse approaches when exposed to concrete concepts, such as commodity chain, global city and global intersection in class discussion.

J	Cardoso, AFSP; Torkkeli, M				Soares Passos Cardoso, Andreia Filipa; Torkkeli, Marko			Innovation in footwear companies - does it pay off?	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Innovation; Networking; Research and development; Low-and medium-technology sectors	KNOWLEDGE; INDUSTRY; GOVERNANCE; PATTERNS; REGION	Purpose - Low- and medium-technology sectors' (LMTs) role in modern economies has been overshadowed by the argument relating knowledge creation to R&D and thus to high-tech industries. Nevertheless, whereas a broader definition of innovation has enabled LMTs to emerge as innovative environments, a blind reliance on non-R&D-based indicators may be harmful too by neglecting LMTs' contribution to the development of cutting-edge, R&D-based knowledge. This paper aims to provide answers to the following questions: do LMTs innovate? Do they induce high-tech innovations across other sectors? Do networks have an impact on LMTs' innovation commitment? Can LMTs' innovation commitment be related to a better performance? Design/methodology/approach - The research method used in this work was based on a case study approach using in-depth face-to-face interviews with representatives from two footwear companies and one technology supplier. Findings - Collaboration with relevant stakeholders along the footwear value chain proved fundamental to the creation of innovation opportunities for all parties involved. Both footwear companies have embraced innovation strategies, allowing them to take over new functions along the value chain and build successful international paths. These strategies involved active participation in cutting-edge, high-tech knowledge prompting innovation at higher-tech companies too. Research limitations/implications - The paper fails to establish a clear causative relationship between companies' performance and their R&DI commitment. In addition, due to the number of companies involved in the study, the findings cannot be simply extrapolated to the whole Portuguese footwear sector. Originality/value - The paper highlights the commitment to innovation in a traditional sector and explores an underresearched topic - that of LMTs' involvement in R&D activities.

In the digital media value chain, Rights Expression Languages (RELs) are used to enable controlled access to digital resources, addressing several different issues from the description of licenses to access and usage control, payments, etc. A REL is an essential component of any security infrastructure supporting differentiated controlled access to digital resources, and providing adequate protection of intellectual property rights. Among these, the project has selected the MPEG-21 part 5 open standard, which can be implemented in XML, and is one of the main current contenders for a general-purpose REL. Our scheme is designed in the light of CONVERGENCE's ability to distribute and manage any kind of digital resource in a large distributed environment, and this chapter explains how REL data is embedded into the CONVERGENCE data unit, the Versatile Digital Item (VDI) and introduces a basic set of security features, based on digital certificates, for the enforcement of the rights and conditions expressed in CONVERGENCE licenses.

J	Vadali, S; Chandra, S				Vadali, Sharada; Chandra, Shailesh			Supply Chain-Consistent Threshold Accessibility Measures for Megaregion Economic Development	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							GEOGRAPHY	Supply chain networks (comprising buyer supplier connections) are integral to specialized manufacturing industries and are vital to the growth and development of megaregions. Transportation planning in megaregions requires an understanding of specialized industry sectors and the enhancement of the effects of the business network. Positive externalities and a competitive advantage can be augmented through transportation interventions. The directness of linkages and enhanced access between buyers and suppliers in any production network enables agglomeration economies, maximizes returns from investments, and can contribute to industry competitiveness. Physical transport networks are vital in ensuring directness in manufacturing sectors in which value chain segments are separated physically. This paper presents a framework for a behaviorally consistent directness measure explicitly linked to transportation infrastructure in megaregions, characterized by supply chains that enhance business networks.

Such a modest initiative has enabled 600 families to move from subsistence to commercial farming. As a cooperative, Meru Herbs has made significant improvements to their products by moving up the value-chain through processing organic certified ingredients into gourmet foods. Critical factors contributing to the success of Meru Herbs include a creative product-mix designed to overcome logistics costs, customer focused, and strategic partnerships with Friends of Meru Italy and Value Added in Africa which provided provisions for investment and market brand development respectively. The performance of Meru's own branded tomato sauces, which are the first to bear the Proudly Made in Africa label, enter international markets provide new opportunities and challenges going forward.

J	Herrera-Gonzalez, R; Quesada, A				Herrera-Gonzalez, Rafael; Quesada, Ariela			Determinants of the value chain and innovation management in the metal-mechanic sector in CostaRica	DIRECCION Y ORGANIZACION			Spanish	Article						Value chain; innovation management; innovation		The internal and external competitive environment facing all organizations, especially those which are productive, it imposes a number of challenges, against which must take strategies that incorporate innovative capabilities, and the management of the value chain and innovation, to establish mechanisms that allow them to differentiate themselves in the market by adding value as a source for the competitiveness and sustainability. In Costa Rica this is an issue that has gradually gained importance and for certain sectors is essential today. In order to identify relevant aspects of the value chain and innovation management in the metal-mechanic sector in the country, a study was conducted that allowed further develop a proposed index of the value chain to present the variables that have greater weight in the process among which were considered: communication for innovation, innovation, performance, competitive environment, marketing, sales, supplies and ICT. This study was made possible after the application of an online survey of companies in this sector. Also, from the information obtained, an econometric model was developed that allowed us to know which variables related to innovation management in the company influence the rate of innovation in the value chain. Variables significant at the 5% correspond to seek business opportunities in the weaknesses of competitors (OCC) and creating new products or services (CNPoS) and the creation of new products or services (CNPoS) and modifying existing product or service (MPoSE). The econometric estimation reaffirms the importance of innovation in companies, and how this should be reflected in the development of their development strategies. The results confirm the relevance of the size of the company, this means that a smaller size, its capacity for innovation tends to decline, a situation that is repeated in the value chain indices. From this perspective it is relevant that the bodies responsible for setting policies and implement programs to concentrate their efforts on providing small and medium enterprises to improve their capacity for innovation in the value chain of the company. Those companies that have experience as exporters tend to have better results in innovation and its value chain indices. The deal with the challenges posed by new market forces companies to adapt their strategies to compete. In this regard, companies should make greater efforts to explore new markets, as this is an element or factor that promotes innovation. One aspect to which you must give attention is the low average rating in the value chain for business-university relationship, marked by a lack of communication between business and academic bodies along with little innovation projects so joint. Sectoral studies on the management of innovation and value chain, results in a set of data and assessments for countries in transition to an economy based on innovation should be considered in setting policies and especially in developing financial and technical instruments to promote innovation and adding value.

The blue water footprint for cabbages was estimated; the value of the water was then calculated as the gross margin and value added per cubic metre of water at the respective stages along the value chain. The analyses show that the attributes of the products have a major influence on the degree of access to the highest value market alternatives, and hence on the ability of smallholder farmers to generate the highest possible return from the water they receive for agricultural purposes.

Germans are still reluctant to change their reading habits and strongly support the diversity of small bookshops. Germany's biggest book distributor and wholesaler KNV strongly believes in the future of the printed books and is building the most modern media distribution center in central Germany. KNV is also placing a lot of efforts in supporting small and medium size bookshops and in establishing multi-channel strategies and promoting online and digital sales. After many unsuccessful efforts to establish an e-reading platform in Germany by various organizations, the "Tolino" platform has the potential to grow to a real significance alongside to Amazon and Apple. Therefore, KNV will support its clients to become part of the new alliance, initiated by the major book chains, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.

J	Harsche, J; Imelli, B; Jaensch, K				Harsche, Johannes; Imelli, Birgit; Jaensch, Kerstin			Identifying development prospects of the bio-energy industry by comparing markets featuring different structures	BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT			German	Article								This study aims at gaining insight into the bio-energy industry's structure and location requirements in different regions. Moreover, an indication is to be given as to the further development of this economic sector. Based on the cluster concept the study is broken down into a written survey of 560 bio-energy companies and 20 interviews with industry experts based on interview guidelines. The regions surveyed are Southern Hessen, one of the most powerful economic regions in Central Europe; Central Hessen, located between the northern and southern part of the federal state and thus featuring a structure typical for both a central and peripheral region; and Northern Hessen, largely showing traits of a peripheral region. The results of the written company survey show that the bio-energy sector mainly consists of small and medium-sized enterprises specialised in bio-energy to varying degrees. Important factors for a bio-energy production site are availability of raw materials, a good transport infrastructure, and proximity to suppliers and customers. Transport infrastructure, for example, is rated much better in the central region of Southern Hessen than in other areas of the federal state. As for the availability of raw materials Central Hessen and the peripheral region of Northern Hessen, regardless of their large agricultural regions and forest areas, lag behind the state's central region. Most of the companies surveyed plan investments, expect growing sales figures, and some of them intend to increase their number of staff. A significant proportion of industry players rate the situation of the bio-energy sector as 'good' or 'very good'. An impressive half of those surveyed think prospects for the future are 'good' or 'very good'. Bio-energy companies located in Central Hessen are especially optimistic. The interview results suggest that the value chain in the bio-energy industry is still in the process of being set up. Experts consider insufficient availability of raw materials and an uncertain political and regulatory framework as major obstacles to the bio-energy sector's development.

In accordance with the conceptual framework of the theory of conventions, six types of criteria are taken into account: industrial, market, domestic, public, civic, and ecological. Statistical data supplied by food authorities and semi-structured interviews with actors in the value chain provide empirical evidence enabling us to state that domestic conventions, related to geographical origin and traditional salted cod recipes, are increasingly challenged by industrial and market conventions as the main arguments for assessing quality. Nevertheless, regional diversity is still apparent in specific market niches like restaurants and specialized retailing, where values of tradition, proximity and reputation remain influential.

The arrogance of success is to think that what was did yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow. The journey from the invention of Fire to the electric bulb, from the air gliders made by Wright Brothers to the Boeing 707, from the typewriter to Laptop and Tablets, from the days of hand-written letters to e-mails, the whole transformation of the Human Era is entirely based on a single aspect: INNOVATION.

J	Tsai, T; Lu, SH; Liu, G; Liu, SB				Tsai, Terence; Lu, Shaohua; Liu, Gary; Liu, Shubo			Beijing Tianyu Communications: Winning in the 3G Era	ASIAN CASE RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article								As emerging markets such as mainland China grew to be vital for the global commercial players, leading mobile telecommunication giants increasingly turned to China for opportunities. China's fast-expanding mobile telecommunication market became a throat-cutting battlefield for both international and local players. Among these competitors, Rong Xiuli's Tianyu had the local advantages. In order to sustain Tianyu's hardearned success, Rong decided to upgrade Tianyu brand and firmly secure a foothold in the 3G era. In 2002, Rong Xiuli closed Beijing Benephon, the then largest distributor of Samsung Mobile Phone in the Chinese market, and established Beijing Tianyu Communication Equipment Co. Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "Tianyu") entering the handset manufacturing industry. Despite the growing pains in the beginning, Tianyu eventually went ahead of other domestic mobile phone manufacturers. In 2008, Tianyu reached a sales volume of 24 million mobile phones and a market share of more than 6%, ranking after Nokia, Samsung, and Motorola in the Chinese mobile phone market. A transition from the second generation (2G) communication technologies to the third generation (3G), however, was initiated at the end of 2008. Mobile phone manufacturers responded by investing heavily on technology upgrades. 3G also elevated the position of telecommunication operators in the industry value chain. As such, Tianyu's advantage in the 2G market could not necessarily guarantee its success in the 3G market. Adding to the uncertainties, demands for 2G mobile phone dropped sharply due to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Despite the oppositions from many colleagues, Rong Xiuli launched a campaign to win the 3G market, reconfiguring almost all the resources to the new business. The case describes Tianyu's success in the 2G mobile phone market and its entry into the 3G market.

As research has to provide an efficient answer to this problem, this evolution will challenge the traditional role of the university. In order to positively impact the business environment, universities and research institutes are considered to open the knowledge market to industry and to deliver desirable outputs. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the appropriate policies and structures that agricultural universities have to address in order to participate in both generating top-quality scientific knowledge and accelerating the translation of agro biotechnology knowledge into innovation and commercial products. To analyze the financial allocation along the innovation value chain, we have performed an analysis using the linear model of the innovation process. At both the national and UASVM level, the first stage of the value chain is predominantly targeted comparing with the early technology and product development stage.

If enterprises can achieve the objective of providing customers with services in accordance with their individual needs, they are more likely to obtain high customer satisfaction. This study selected multinational 3C distributors in Taiwan as the subjects and their internal MIS (management information system) databases as data sources. Data mining was employed to screen important and relevant information from the MIS databases. The key factors affecting the service quality of customized logistics, as obtained from the benchmarking platform of cost information, were used as the contents of a hierarchical structure. After the information was input into the linear planning model, better solutions were obtained. Moreover, the results were saved in the ABC (activity based costing)-KMDSS (knowledge management decision support system) database. The rules for enterprise operation in the knowledge database, together with data from the ABC-KMDSS database, were used for the CBR (case-based reasoning) method of knowledge reasoning to determine the proper decision-making for logistics services of relevant customized products.

J	Adzic, S; Ocic, O				Adzic, Slobodan; Ocic, Ozren			THE FEASIBLE STRATEGIES OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF HIP PETROHEMIJA	HEMIJSKA INDUSTRIJA			Croatian	Article						HIP Petrohemija; Portfolio analysis; Feasible strategies; Strategic models; Value chain; Critical realism		In this paper authors have presented a case study of HIP Petrohemija company (Pancevo, Serbia) with the aim of generating feasible strategies for technological and economic development. The research philosophy is based on the critical realism, while the research methodology is qualitative. The paper begins with the introduction to the history of HIP Petrohemija, followed by the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats) analysis, and the SWOT analysis results that were used to construct TOWS (Threats, Opportunities, Weaknesses & Strengths) matrix. This procedure generated two feasible strategies, both of which are subjected to further tests. The three portfolio models: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, General Electric (GE) matrix, and Nine specimen standardized strategies were used to describe the current situation of HIP Petrohemija, needed steps for the company to produce more finalized products, i.e., polymers, as well as the actions aimed at minimizing losses. This however did not provide sufficient data for determining the appropriate strategy for the company. The dilemma was solved with the help of Ansoff matrix, which showed that merging with, in its value chain, the distributor, not with to the supplier will be more profitable for the HIP Petrohemija. Contemporary Porter's models - Five Forces and Value Chain Analysis, further confirmed the advantage of this strategy. The last model used in this paper is the Competitors Differentiation Iceberg Model that answers what the core competence of HIP Petrohemija is, with the results indicating the high quality of finalized products. Finally, the authors conclude that both strategies that were generated by the analysis are feasible - the merging with the supplier of raw material, as well as the merging with the large distributor of finalized products, with the latter being more profitable in the case of HIP Petrohemija.

Various types of mobile applications have evolved to provide ubiquitous and instant customer service to capitalize on this opportunity. One application is mobile tagging, a mobile-based innovative tool for convergence marketing. The accumulated academic knowledge on mobile marketing lacks consumer-centric information about this phenomenon.

Lubricants combine indispensable performance characteristics in transportation and industry with considerable economic value. The transition from mineral oil-based lubes to biodegradable lubricants from renewable raw materials is ongoing. Biolubricants originate from vegetable oils (triglycerides), wax esters and plant polymeric carbohydrates. Chemical sciences and plant biotechnology are crucial disciplines in designing environmentally acceptable lubricants for a wide variety of applications. Important actors in the biolubricant value chain are vegetable oil milling facilities, lubricant manufacturing industry, regulators and end users (for consumer acceptance).	[Bart, Jan C.

Today, due to the convergence of telecommunications, information technologies, Internet, World Wide Web and finally entertainment together with global markets and competition, we are living in an open multimedia services market and the information society is reality. As the competition between operators and service providers in the communications sector increases through, the actual value of networks and communications is decreasing. The remaining assets for future growth of the companies rely on the value of services, content and end systems that are increasing substantially within the new world of convergence and the much more complex multimedia services value chain that has emerged. The split of networks, service platforms, services and content requires on the one hand clear positioning of market players to face these challenges and on the other hand to establish a technological foundation for open business models. In this chapter, we want to trace the evolution of service and service platform concepts in telecommunications and outline technologies for converging networks and services and their latest developments.

Traditional impact factors primarily focus on classic bibliometrics, typically not of value to the Humanities, open access journal articles, multiple-authored articles, or authors writing in a non-English language. New impact factors are under development to satisfy the need to exemplify the open access research advantage. Measuring institutional repository value stems from a variety of non-traditional processes, including faculty post-print and student ETD deposits, a process improvement approach, and value-chain/value-stream mapping.

At present, Chinese scholars study the problem of manufacturing chiefly from two perspectives: The first is to discuss the status quo of Chinese manufacturing from the perspective of industrial competitiveness, with countermeasures put forward against manufacturing upgrading. The second is to directly discuss the upgrading of manufacturing from the perspective of global value chain, with the following proposal put forward: Chinese manufacturing upgrading should stretch from the low end to both ends of value chain. In addition, a discussion is also made to the role of producer services in promoting manufacturing, and the role of governmental regulations in upgrading manufacturing. Although these two perspectives are rational, they have some defects: Both of them are based on the hypothesis that the institutional environment in which manufacturing lies is stationary, and manufacturing is considered and measured with systems as exogenous variables; so the impact of institutional environment on manufacturing upgrading is overlooked. Based on reviewing previous literature, this chapter analyzes and discusses the path evolution of manufacturing in the transitional period in mainland China.

B	Chun, S; Thakor, AV		Thakor, A		Chun, Samuel; Thakor, Anjan V.			Unblocking Innovation: Breaking the Shackle of Assumptions	INNOVATION AND GROWTH: WHAT DO WE KNOW?			English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter introduces a new approach to innovation, based on identifying the key assumptions in the prevailing business model of the firm or the industry and discarding a few key assumptions supporting the existing business model that are widely accepted within the industry. The idea is that every business model has a set of explicit and implicit assumptions based on which the model is constructed. These assumptions often have to do with consumer preferences for various product/service attributes, the demand for the product/service at any given price, the nature of the value chain from production to the ultimate distribution of the product/service to the consumer, and so on. Often, these assumptions are supported by experience or historical data. The key to innovation is to identify which of these assumptions can be discarded or replaced with new assumptions, so that a novel business model emerges, and this model leads to spectacular new growth. This chapter discusses how an organization can systematically approach innovation this way and provides numerous examples of instances in which this approach has been successfully implemented.

The applications are primarily used for linking actors in the agricultural value chain, accessing real time information on prices, buyers and sellers, transport and haulage, and other relevant information services in the agricultural value chain. Limited evidence from Ghana and elsewhere show that cell phone applications have resulted in increased incomes but the impacts and sustainability of other ICT applications have proven elusive. The role of ICT in overcoming the key constraints in the agricultural value chain and for making evidence-based decisions will be greatly enhanced if farmers, aggregators, and other stakeholders in the value chain pay attention to their business scope and schedule planning, executing, monitoring and control, procurement, risk planning, and stakeholder communications in a "project management" context. When this is done, ICT applications will facilitate supply chain management through sharing of timely and pertinent information on producers, buyers and other services, thereby helping to promote industry competitiveness. The major challenges to the widespread use and sustainability of ICT remain access to the appropriate ICT tool, poor road and storage infrastructure (particularly in the farming communities) and illiteracy on the part of the majority of smallholder farmers.

From this perspective, this study aims to investigate the integration between the strategic positioning and cost management of a stainless steel processing company. To this end, we carried out an exploratory research through a case study, using data collection technique to non-structured interviews and documentary research. It was observed that strategic positioning is oriented differentiation strategy, and that the first stage of the value chain, the selection of suppliers, has begun the process of adding value of the company, which guarantees the quality of their products. It was found that factors such as idleness of production and investments in technological innovation are not considered by management to determine its cost drivers. It is concluded that the costing system used by the company is committing to inefficient implementation of a strategic management based on cost information that gives you a competitive advantage. And, to be deployed GEC, the company should, in principle, know your value chain, particularly its cost drivers, adopting a costing system able to measure them.

S	Duguid, P		Adner, R; Oxley, JE; Silverman, BS		Duguid, Paul			NETWORKS AND KNOWLEDGE: THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PORT COMMODITY CHAIN, 1703-1860	COLLABORATION AND COMPETITION IN BUSINESS ECOSYSTEMS	Advances in Strategic Management-A Research Annual		English	Article; Book Chapter						networked society; Port commodity chain; vertical integration	MARKETS; TRADE	Diversified trading networks have recently drawn a great deal of attention. In the process, the importance of diversity has perhaps been overemphasized. Using the trade in port wine from Portugal to Britain as an example, this essay attempts to show how a market once dominated by general, diversified traders was taken over by dedicated specialists whose success might almost be measured by the degree to which they rejected diversification to form a dedicated "commodity chain." The essay suggests that this strategy was better able to handle matters of quality and the specialized knowledge that port wine required. The essay also highlights the question of power in such a chain. Endemic commodity-chain struggles are clearest in the vertical brand war that broke out in the nineteenth century, which, by concentrating power, marked the final stage in the transformation of the trade from network to vertical integration.

BREADFRUIT (Treculia africana) MARKETING ACTIVITIES AND RETURNS IN AHIAZU MBAISE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, OF IMO STATE, NIGERIA	SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Ahiazu Mbaise; breadfruit; marketing; value chain activities		This study on marketing of breadfruits (Treculia africana) and returns was done in Ahiazu Mbaise local Government area of Imo State, Nigeria. The specific objectives of the study were to describe socio-economic characteristics of respondents (sellers and buyers) of African breadfruit; identify value-chain activities available in processing and its storage in compliance with consumers' order and preferences; determine factors influencing decision to supply African breadfruit; and constraints with its post-harvest management in the study area. Threestage random sampling technique was used in selecting locations and respondents through which eighty (80) farm households who gather/harvest, process and sell breadfruits were selected and interviewed with structured questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and probit regression model. Result revealed that 65.80% of the respondents were females and 81.20% of them were married with mean household size of 9 members. Their literacy level was high as 97.6% of them had at least primary education. Predominant marketing activities were fruit gathering/harvesting, processing, storage and packaging, transportation, and sales. Socio-economic factors of gender, household size, income, level of education, years of farming experience and labour significantly influenced supply of breadfruits to consumers with challenges of seasonal scarcity, and tedious methods of processing deterring the enterprise in the area. We recommended provision of credit support to enable fruit gatherers purchase and use shelling machines and good storage facilities to smooth any fluctuations in supplies during off-seasons and help fight overdependence of households on roots and tubers.

Wang, J		Optimizing Routes with Safety and Environmental Criteria in Transportation Management in Spain: A Case Study	MANAGEMENT INNOVATIONS FOR INTELLIGENT SUPPLY CHAINS			English	Article; Book Chapter							VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; SUPPLY-CHAIN MANAGEMENT; AIR-QUALITY; DELIVERY POINTS; ALGORITHMS; SAVINGS; COSTS; ABSENTEEISM; VALUATIONS; MODELS	The object of logistic management is to optimise the whole value chain of the distribution of goods and merchandise. One of the main aspects of such an analysis is the optimisation of vehicle routes to deliver final products to customers. There are many algorithms to optimise the related vehicle routing problem. The objective function of that problem usually involves distance, cost, number of vehicles, or profits. This study also takes safety and environmental costs into account. Thus, the authors develop variants to traditional heuristic algorithms, in which they include the traditional costs along with safety and environmental cost estimates for real scenarios in Spain. This methodology is called ASEC (Algorithms with Safety and Environmental Criteria). These considerations raise the value of the global objective function, but permit a more realistic cost estimate that includes not only the internal costs involved in the problem but also the related externalities. Finally, real cases are discussed, and solutions are offered using the new ASEC methodology.

B	Gendron, MS	Gendron, MS			Gendron, Michael S.	Gendron, MS		Understanding Your Organization and Its Competitive Environment	BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE APPLIED: IMPLEMENTING AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE			English	Article; Book Chapter								In order to implement ICT to create value, it is necessary that the organization and its environment are analyzed. ICT is more than the hardware and software that does business-rule processing; rather, it must support business strategy. Understanding the competition, knowing the internal business processes of your enterprise, and turning that knowledge into ICT recommendations are tantamount to creating competitive advantage. In this chapter, conceptual frameworks and concepts for understanding the organization, its value propositions, and its competitive environment are addressed. At the core of the ICT value search is the thorough examination of the organization using value search models. External value search models focus primarily outside the organization and yield competitive information about other organizations, while internal value search models largely focus inside the enterprise. The value search models-including corporate unbundling; value chain deconstruction; comparative strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats (SWOT) analysis; and competitive forces analysis-all provide tools for the business analyst to discover ways to implement ICT for competitive advantage and to explain those advantages to management.

The existing literature suggests a considerable diversity of models of OE in organisational and funding terms, and there is the need to gain a better understanding of the distinctive pathways to sustainability that are linked to specific organising and funding logics. However, this very diversity and the insufficiently developed notion of sustainability in this context hamper the efforts aimed at categorising and comparing different models, and this chapter considers these questions in more depth. To this aim, we analyse and categorise the main funding arrangements by first identifying the key components of each distinctive OE system in the Section 'System Elements', whilst reflecting in parallel on the notion of sustainability. In the Section 'System Configurations', we offer a detailed description and analysis of the most prominent funding models of OE to illustrate the diversity of funding arrangements and distinctive organisational logics underpinning them. We explore the logic of these business models by unpacking each distinctive form of organising around four key aspects: customer offer, value chain configuration, funding and profit formula, and strategic positioning. In the Section 'Sustainability', we seek to refine our understanding of the concept of sustainability in the context of OE, giving due consideration to non-economic definitions of this concept and to some of the core objectives attached to OE. We suggest that sustainability can be ultimately apprehended and defined through a number of key variables. The section 'Open Education: Motives and Implications' examines the motives behind the OE movement, its wide-ranging implications, and considers how OE fits in with the trends in the higher education (HE) sector as a whole. We discuss the future for this radical innovation, emphasising the central role of communities of practice and the need for institutional support. We argue that the development of sustainable communities is the fundamental basis of any OE model and that reflexivity is required in order to ensure the sustainability of this innovative practice. Similarly, the systematic development of collaborative practices and networks between the main actors at community, institutional and national levels is considered key to the development and embedding of OE initiatives within the overall educational sector. The concluding section brings together the various strands of our argument on the nature and characteristics of the various OE business models, their sustainability and the way forward.

But in doing so, it is very common to find activities that do not really add value to these products or services which implies a negative impact on system productivity. These activities can be classified as waste according to the philosophy of Lean Manufacturing, which in turn provides us with tools that allow eliminating this waste and thereby improving the flow and increasing the productivity of these production systems. In this paper, which is an applied research result, it is shown the analysis and improvement of the value chain of a production line of office chairs. Firstly, waste are identified in the value chain, then is determining the most appropriate lean tools for removal and finally a cost-benefit analysis is made for implementing the proposed tools.

Flooding irrigation drainage water using on natural pastures has also had adverse effects on the long-term productivity of desert ranges. This study examines the economics of halophytes as feed for sheep using saline irrigation water from drainage collector systems on a representative farm. Cost-benefit and rate of return analyses show that the project is economically feasible for reused water with 1400 mg/l mineralization levels or less. At higher mineral concentrations in water, or in more saline soils, bioremediation through halophyte fodder production can be profitably implemented if new market incentives exist. Value chain analysis is applied to evaluate alternative incentive systems for sheep operations based on saline water irrigated halophyte fodder production.

An institutional analysis of commodity chain evolution: a Case study of sawn wood in Uganda	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW			English	Article						commodity-chain; sawn-wood; scarcity; evolution; adaptive-cycle	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL-SYSTEMS; COLLAPSE; REORGANIZATION; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH	Efforts to address wood scarcity have ignored the forestry value chain and extant literature treats commodity chains as static constructs. Using the adaptive cycle framework, the evolution of the sawn wood commodity chain in Uganda was analysed to examine how policy and governance, physical, and socioeconomic factors interacted to shape its profile over time. Results show that the chain has evolved through one adaptive cycle and is currently undergoing reorganisation. The policy and governance environment had the greatest influence but inadequate coherence with the socioeconomic and physical environments resulted in a system vulnerable to exogenous disturbances. The examination of commodity chains as complex adaptive systems provides beneficial insights to supplement traditional cross-sectional studies focussing on structure, functioning and distribution equity. There is a need for adaptive institutions with focus on development of a cogent strategy for proper coordination in the sawn wood production and distribution system.	[Kambugu, R.

Biomass and biowaste have the potential to be used much higher up in the value chain, e. g. as food ingredients, animal feed, chemical building blocks, materials, fuels, and phosphorous-rich fertilizer. Biorefineries will take over from oil refineries. A biorefinery can use all of the different components in optimized value-adding purposes.

Characterized within the analyzed relations in the commodity vertical will be the demand-offer relationships on partial levels of the commodity chain on the basis of which the functional relations of the simultaneous model of the above-mentioned market will subsequently be specified. The quantified model enables the definition and description of the main determinants of the beef offer and demand. The data used was acquired from the Situation and Forecast Reports (MA CZ), from the Annual Reports on the State of Agriculture (UZEI) and from the Family Accounts Statistics (CSU), for the period from 1995-2010. With regard to respecting the simultaneous relations, the model estimate was carried out by the means of the two-level method of least squares with the subsequent statistic-econometrical verification. The acquired model shows a sufficient robustness for market analyses and the possible simulation calculations.

The management of knowledge and the learning process in SMES clusters: a study case	ECONOMIA SOCIEDAD Y TERRITORIO			English	Article						clusters; knowledge; nonparametric statistics; small and medium enterprises (SMES)		Learning is a process of production and appropriation of knowledge that occurs in interaction with others. In this interaction, several studies consider the critical role developed by territory. However, the mere proximity and complementariness in the value chain is not sufficient for associativity among smes: the involvement of other actors (government, universities, institutions, chambers, among other) is also required. The process of interaction between them led to the development of different concepts: innovation systems, industrial districts and clusters. This paper presents guidelines and results of an investigation carried out in a metallurgical cluster integrated by ten smes in the Olavarria Partido in Argentina. The enquiring is focused on the processes of knowledge management in the cluster. Through an exhaustive review of the literature concerning the concepts of organizational learning and clusters, we designed a methodology analyzing the learning ability of the group.

J	Melnychuk, VM				Melnychuk, V. M.			The implementation and development features of packaging customer value mechanism formation	MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS			Russian	Article						customer value; customers'value mechanism formation; material value; service value; emotional value; social value; summary value; total value		The aim of the article. The article investigates the package customer value mechanism formation as the primary product of flexographic enterprises. The printing companies that use fleksohafic prints andflexographic enterprises have become important issue of creating customer value in the sphere of packaging for food industry. The results of the analysis. The result of scientific research is author's definition: "the product customer value mechanism is a system of integrated management, marketing and economic complex of tools which influence the value creating process, contribute to the manufacturer and customers relations development, increase customer loyalty and mutual benefit, which leading to manufacturer activities economic performance improving ". Within the systematization of theoretical foundations of customer value of goods it is possible to identify four its components: material, service, emotional and social) that are the basis of package customer value mechanism formation. Material value of packaging is formed by flexographic companies basing on production management and quality management principles. Service customer value of packaging is formed by creating optimal conditions for work with customers and development of appropriate relationships with industrial customers. Emotional value is associated with flexographic companies' activities on the principles of marketing cooperation. The social value of the packaging is considered from the point of the main packaging characteristics for society. Methodical basis of the package customer value mechanism formation is a complex approach which takes into account its multiattributive and a lot of stages of its content filling. The number of stages of package customer value depends on the number of links in the production of the final product which actually designed packaging. Final and binding element in the chain assessment is packaged of product. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Improving the package customer value mechanism for flexographic companies is a complicated process that requires not only understanding of its content system approach but also a detailed study and analysis of the customer value processes creating and connections between these processes. The study of the package customer value mechanism formation by flexographic companies determined that not only all the flexographic companies occurrence and processes involved in the packaging customer value creation, but other members of the value chain, as well as consumers (industrial and final). Moreover, it should take into account the complexity of package customer value mechanism formation. The author indicates the necessity of its construction not only using logical methods, but clear mathematical and econometric tools as well that are the basis for further research.	[Melnychuk, V.

The aim of this chapter is to analyze the current situation of Internet usage and electronic commerce in agri-food cooperatives in the province of Lleida, Spain. To this end, a questionnaire was completed by olive oil and sweet fruit cooperatives in 2010 that addressed the following aspects: computer equipment, Internet connection and presence, and finally, the level of electronic commerce. The results provide information on aspects to consider for ensuring that agricultural cooperatives take full advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies, resulting in a useful tool for the managers of these organizations as well as for policy makers concerned with encouraging and promoting the social economy.

J	Morell, M				Morell, Marc			"Never trust space": Urban Labour within Class Formation/Struggle	QUADERNS-E DE L INSTITUT CATALA D ANTROPOLOGIA			Catalan	Article						production of space; class formation/struggle; urban labour; gentrification; rent gap; Majorca		Drawing on an ethnographic sketch in which I describe a cat sterilisation programme in a gentrifying neighbourhood in Palma (Majorca), I look into the class relation the rent-gap hypothesis holds. I argue each of its moments of devalorisation and (re) valorisation of the urban environment subsumes the labour developed by different groups that form a single class, since they cooperate within a same value chain. Against the mere description of the spatialisation of classes that are already formed, there is a need to explain how spatialisation intervenes in the struggle that makes them.

The Trinidad and Tobago Model: Learnings for Ghana and Africa	GOVERNANCE OF THE PETROLEUM SECTOR IN AN EMERGING DEVELOPING ECONOMY			English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter presents the Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) Model of value addition from natural gas, its characteristics and the lessons Ghana and other African countries can learn from it. It undertakes a critique of the policy-making and decision-making system of T&T's energy sector, including implementation of programmes. Moreover, investment strategies in using oil revenues for gas development and gas revenue for human resource development are illustrated. Also addressed are T&T's effective analyses of the industry's value chain as well as supply and demand factors to achieve optimal benefits. In this context, T&T's state sector participation in the oil and gas (O&G) value chain is highlighted. Furthermore, T&T's use of innovative strategies through local value-added building blocks and in natural gas development to meet changing market requirements, and sustain a competitive advantage in the industry are discussed. The chapter concludes with how T&T is leveraging its strengths for sustainability by becoming an energy services exporter, among other strategies.

Service management needs to be able to measure and control all players that are involved within the Service Value Chain in order to ensure a maximized productivity. The paper discloses possible perspectives and approaches how services, which are handled by different actors in the SVC, can provide an additional value for all the actors and the productivity can be managed. The requirements for a KPI driven management tool are discussed: adequate measures for effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility. From a real world example the issue of managing service productivity via KPIs is being shown.

In this work, a novel approach based on emergent distributed scheduling is proposed to overcome the traditional separation between task scheduling and execution control. An interaction mechanism designed around the concept of order and resource agents acting as autonomic managers is described. The proposed Manufacturing Execution System (MES) for simultaneous distributed (re) scheduling and local execution control is able to reject disturbances and successfully handle unforeseen events by autonomic agents implementing the monitor-analyze-plan-execution loop while achieving their corresponding goals. For detailed design of the autonomic MES and verification of its emergent behaviors, a goal-oriented methodology for designing interactions is proposed. Encouraging results obtained for different operating scenarios using a generative simulation model of the interaction mechanism implemented in Netlogo are presented.

B	Nieto, FS; Valdes, RA; Gonzalez, EG		Landry, SJ		Saez Nieto, Francisco; Arnaldo Valdes, Rosa; Garca Gonzalez, Eduardo			Automation in ATM: Future Directions	ADVANCES IN HUMAN ASPECTS OF AVIATION	Advances in Human Factors and Ergonomics Series		English	Article; Book Chapter						automation; air traffic management; system performance		The current Air Traffic Management (ATM) Systems need to develop their businesses and strengthen their value chain as a whole to be able to cope with the expected growth in air traffic. Today's ATM processes are not sufficiently geared, or flexible, to maintain the schedules of the airspace users. It has been broadly recognized that the future ATM capacity and safety objectives can only be achieved by an intense enhancement of integrated automation support. To ensure overall performance of ATM system, the high-level automation principles described in this study are to serve as a guide for its development. The main objective pursued by the "research" into "Higher Automation Levels in ATM" is to explore unconventional and high risk areas, involving new technologies and concepts around the theme "Toward higher levels of automation" in future Air Traffic Management Systems. This study aims to provide basic and applied research that will be required to bring the ATM System into the high degrees of automation required by NextGen and SESAR and beyond, up to and including full automation. At the same time, this research also seeks to apply existing methodologies and techniques in new ways, potentially applying scientific disciplines that have not previously been brought to bear in the air traffic domains	[Saez Nieto, Francisco; Arnaldo Valdes, Rosa] Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Garca Gonzalez, Eduardo] CRIDA, Madrid, Spain		Nieto, FS (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain.	franciscojavier.saez@upm.es; rosamaria.arnaldo@upm.es; egarcia@crida.es					[Anonymous], 2008, DLM07100010200; Dave Nakamura Aircraft Working Group Co-Chair, 2009, C AIRCR CONS; Hollnagel E., 2002, COGNITION CONTROL PR; Kaber D.

This paper describes operations research solutions to a variety of problems in the e-commerce value chain. HP's objective was to use these solutions to grow its share in the online sales market. First, we identify and quantify the impact of key drivers of online traffic to enhance our market planning and budget allocation process. Next, we apply Bayesian modeling and Markov chain Methods to predict which customers are most likely to buy which product, and when and through which marketing channel they are likely to make a purchase. Finally, we use a hybrid forecasting approach combining time-series and regression modeling to predict customer orders for optimizing warehouse inventory holding and ensuring timely fulfillment of customer orders. Since 2009, the integration of these solutions into HP's marketing planning and warehouse operations processes has helped to generate an additional $117 million in revenue for HPDirect.com.

First, we review literature about tourism's contribution to development. Second, the current configuration of global value chains in tourism industry is analysed. Third, we put forward the hypothesis that how the GVC approach can be used to study the role that tourism SMEs may play in the present context of globalisation. This may be a new way of analyzing the tourism's contribution to the economic development and in particular, a new tool for the recognition of the significance of SMEs.

P; horticulture; transnational private regulations; Vietnam	CERTIFICATION	International horticulture markets are increasingly governed by transnational private regulations that create a new set of challenges not only for the market but also for local governance and policy regimes. Accordingly, resources from a range of international governance institutions and donors promoting development through neoliberal market rules have been directed towards ensuring that market entry barriers are not prohibitive. This paper presents the results of a recent study undertaken in Vietnam that assessed outcomes within a single value chain governed by GLOBALG. A. P, where technical and financial assistance were provided to smallholders. The constructivist approach high-lights that, in addition to typical market entry barriers, additional obstacles existed that prevented smallholders from market participation. These were socially, culturally and historically situated and rooted in informal institutions. Failing to incorporate these into assistance planning may lead to the unequal distribution of development benefits associated with these changing market governance arrangements.

Beekeeping Cooperatives in Santa Fe and Eastern Cordoba provinces. Argentina: IIFinancing, innovation, decisions, relations, strategic vision and group perceptions	CIENCIAS AGRONOMICAS			Spanish	Article						Beekeeping; Social Economy; Cooperatives		Beekeeping cooperatives are important structures in the activity value chain. Activities related to the primary processing (extraction) and some logistics and marketing operations are developed by these cooperatives. The aim of this study is to know the factors affecting their performance in Santa Fe and East of Cordoba, in order to improve understanding of its performance through the identification of variables that influence the strategies of market linkage. Variables that explored relational and decisional aspects, financing and innovation processes inside the organizations were surveyed. As a general conclusion, it is important to stress the main function cooperatives have in the institutional restructuring of the territory, oriented to find a regional dynamic and to face the challenges that globalization poses. In this sense, we highlight -in relation to discussed factors-that the efforts of these kinds of organizations should be oriented to generate an active participation of its members and should be managed by qualified personnel, to facilitate the development of alliances, contractual structures and links with official or private programs allowing progress toward a competitive production chain and achieving production postharvest processes. The achievement of these links offers the possibility of confronting complex environments and promotes the continued adoptions of innovations: this situation favors the development of successful companies.

B	Yao, Y		Wang, L; Zhu, L		Yao Yu			Sustainable Development of the Tricholoma Matsutake Industry in Tibetan-Inhabited Regions of Yunnan, and Their Participation in the Global Market: Discussions Based on Value Chain Analysis	BREAKING OUT OF THE POVERTY TRAP: CASE STUDIES FROM THE TIBETAN PLATEAU IN YUNNAN, QINGHAI AND GANSU			English	Article; Book Chapter						Trichohoma Matsutake Industry; Sustainable Development		This chapter probes into the tricholoma matsutake industry by applying value chain analysis. The author argues that the Tibetans found in the areas that produce tricholoma matsutake receive an extremely small portion of the profits from the global market. This is not only disadvantageous to the interests of the Tibetans but also to the protection of tricholoma matsutake resources. Merchants of tricholoma matsutake in China should work together to enhance their role in the global market and bring an end to the current situation in which they are merely passive price-takers, so as to help the Tibetans gain a larger proportion of the overall profits. Meanwhile, local governments should put higher premiums on the regulation and protection of tricholoma matsutake resources. Moreover, various organizations should establish and maintain effective rules on the collection of tricholoma matsutake. Only with multidirectional policies can China's tricholoma matsutake industry follow the path of steady and sustainable development.

J	Zhou, QS; Yang, MX; Zhang, PF; Qiu, Y				Zhou, Qishen; Yang, Mingxing; Zhang, Pengfei; Qiu, Ying			Study on the Innovative Jewelry B2C Business Model in China and Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH IN AFRICA			English	Article						Value of user experience; B2C business model; Jewelry; Innovation		According to the forecast of relevant business data, current jewelry consumption in China and Africa has become increasingly active and has great potential for further development. For now, the industrial value chain of jewelry e-business as a whole is far from a mature state; industry convergence degree is relatively low; market segmentation is high; the demand of customers is large, however the supply is full of chaos. Under the general context of rapid development of e-commerce in the Internet, the structure of jewelry industry requires further adjustment and further improvements. The concept of symbolic consumption has been proposed to highlight the increasing significance of extending symbolic value and experience of the commodity. This paper conducted an innovative and exploratory study on the jewelry B2C business model in China and Africa based on the value of user experience. The contents of this paper include four aspects. Primarily, it analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of jewelry B2C business model. Customers become the main players in the market and can select jewelry products based on their own preferences. Secondly, it explains the value of user experience by exploring the emotions, memories, feelings and deeper identity of value during the consumption process to expand broader space for product value. Furthermore, it provides an explicit analysis of innovative jewelry B2C business model concentrating on combining jewelry with customers' emotions. In addition, it explores the implications of innovative B2C business model in the jewelry industry by creating superior customer experiences.

J	Adebayo, SA; Oladele, OI				Adebayo, S. A.; Oladele, O. I.			Vegetable farmers' knowledge of value chain in southwestern Nigeria	ASIA LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						vegetable production; value chain knowledge; southwestern Nigeria		This paper evaluated knowledge of value chain among vegetable farmers in southwestern Nigeria. Cluster sampling technique was adopted for selecting 450 urban vegetable producers as sample and interview schedule was used to elicit information from respondents. The questionnaire consisted of 35 items on the concept of value chain, cooperative production, sales channels, input and output, post-harvest and trade. Data were analyzed using percentages and linear regression model. The result showed that 73.3% of the respondents work closely with the supplier, 91.8% received feedback from the consumer through the retailer on consumer preference. Majority of the respondents do not belong to any cooperative producer group (72.0%) and do not sell their products collectively (76.9%). The linear model regression results show that that there was correlation between independent variables and knowledge of value chain among vegetable farmers (r = 0.53). Significant determinants of knowledge of value chain variables were age (t = -3.70), farm size (t = 4.81), household size (t = 4.68), dependants (t = -9.25), distance to farm center (t = -5.35), subsidy received (t = -1.82) and information (t = -2.46). Therefore, to ensure that small-scale and resource-poor farmers stand a chance to participate in these expanding markets, policy makers and researchers must place greater attention towards the needs of poor small landholders and tenant farmers.

J	Barachini, F; Stary, C				Barachini, Franz; Stary, Chris			Better Balanced Economies - A Management Challenge for the 3rd Millennium	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; value chain analysis; environmental measures		The incorporation of non-economic indicators in corporate management systems could help to bridge the gap between poor and rich economies. We propose the capitalisation of labour costs, the provision for costs caused in indirect value chains, environmental and social measures in scorecards, new remuneration schemas for managers, and a change in management attitudes towards knowledge management. The application of the combination of the proposed concepts could positively influence the distribution of wealth and resources, as societies could become more balanced world-wide. We are convinced that the proposed scorecard measures and the necessary change in management behaviour must be driven and supported by knowledge managers operating in world-wide value chains.

J	Arias, JD; Martinez, MMV; Cardelle-Elawar, M				de la Fuente Arias, Jesus; Vera Martinez, Manuel Mariano; Cardelle-Elawar, Maria			Contributions of the Psychology of Innovation and Entrepreneurship to Education, in the Knowledge Society	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			Spanish	Article						Psychology of Innovation; Psychology of Entrepreneurship; Education for Innovation and Entrepreneurship; Competency in Innovation and Entrepreneurship; Knowledge Society	PERFORMANCE; SUCCESS	The globalized Knowledge Society of the 21st century brings with it important changes in models of work and lifestyle, triggered by the revolution in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). It has led to new ways of understanding knowledge itself, human activity, and consequently, professional and economic activity. In this current socio-educational and socio-economic context, more than ever, it makes sense to ask whether the mission and vision of commonly used educational models, that is, the educational purposes pursued, should be adjusted in the light of new context-driven training demands for the present and upcoming generations. This paper is structured in several parts. First, the concepts of Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship are defined, as well as their relationships and role in the R&D&I value chain. Next is a justification of why the Knowledge Society needs persons with creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship. Third, and at the heart of this review, we address the need for a Psychology of Innovation and Entrepreneurship and its contributions to educational processes for developing these competencies. Fourth, we suggest the implications of such contributions in an emerging educational paradigm, Education for Competency in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, where we analyze what kind of learning would be involved in this competency, as well as cross-curriculum proposals to be integrated across educational processes. Conclusions and further educational implications are discussed in closing.
