J	Hansen, NW				Hansen, Nana Wesley			International company restructuring and the effects on high-skilled employees in lead companies	COMPETITION & CHANGE			English	Article						Global value chains; high-skilled employees; international company restructuring; employment conditions	TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS; OFFSHORING EVIDENCE; VALUE CHAINS; EMPLOYMENT; MOBILITY; WORKERS	International company restructuring involving knowledge intensive jobs causes increasing concern about the effect on the globalization of high-skilled employees. Drawing on case studies in four Danish-based companies, this article argues that high-skilled employees in lead companies are rarely insulated from international restructuring processes. However, effects on wage and working conditions vary dependent on the motivation for restructuring, and as companies learn to take advantage of pools of skilled employees abroad. Continued international restructuring appear to challenge the insulation of high-skilled workers over time. Further, the article shows that knowledge intensive companies increasingly apply relational global value chain governance with multidirectional consequences for wage and working conditions among the high-skilled employees.

J	Chalemba, L				Chalemba, Leonard			Application of Telecommunications Technologies to Agricultural Market Information Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Malawi and Ghana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agricultural Value Chain; Esoko; Information and Communications Technology; Market Liberalisation; Smallholder Farmers; Sub-Saharan Africa; Telecommunications Access; Traders	LIBERALIZATION	This review presents a comparison of the potential of offering agricultural market information services that incorporate information and communications technology (ICT) in Ghana and Malawi. A comprehensive analysis was done involving data on economic indicators related to telecommunications services provided by the statistics division of the United Nations, and the current initiatives on agricultural market information systems in the two countries. The review reveals that Malawi needs more work to be done to improve service delivery of its ICT-based market information system projects than Ghana. Main areas for improvement are mobile phone subscriptions by low-income smallholder farmers, Internet access by the same category of farmers, and sustainability of offering the services in question without heavy reliance on governments and international donor agencies. The recommendations drawn from this review do not only apply to Malawi and Ghana but also to other Sub-Saharan African countries.

J	Pierce, GL; Cleary, PF				Pierce, Glenn L.; Cleary, Paul F.			The K-12 educational technology value chain: Apps for kids, tools for teachers and levers for reform	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						K-12 education; Educational technology; Value chain; Cloud computing; Student achievement; School reform; Innovation; Economic competitiveness	METAANALYSIS; ECONOMICS; BENEFITS; GROWTH	Historically implementing, maintaining and managing educational technology has been difficult for K-12 educational systems. Consequently, opportunities for significant advances in K-12 education have often gone unrealized. With the maturation of Internet delivered services along with K-12 institutional trends, educational technologies are poised to help support the transformation K-12 education by providing student access to educational resources on an anywhere, anytime, any device basis. In addition, an emerging body of empirical research shows that when implemented systematically, technology can support a wide range of potential education innovations including inverted classrooms, peer-to-peer teaching and customized learning as well as increased academic achievement. A major public policy question is how best to insure educational technology resources reach all K-12 students in the shortest time and most equitable way possible. In response, this paper adopted an educational technology value chain model to assess potential avenues and barriers to implementing educational technology in K-12 systems. We find that a fully implemented educational technology value chain would directly benefit students, teachers, school systems and society. However, the analysis also finds that efforts to implement educational technology in K-12 systems still must overcome challenges and risks.

J	Rigolot, C				Rigolot, Cyrille			The social capital of value chains: a key dimension of their adaptive capacities. Illustration with the "comte" cheese value chain	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Article						comte; hard cheese; value chain; social capital; adaptive capacity		In the current period of milk crisis, the "comte" cheese value-chain is described as an example of economic success. Considering this value-chain as an illustration, this paper explores the importance of social capital to enhance adaptive capacities. After defining these concepts, we present the social capital of the "comte" value-chain, combining different types of social links between its actors, with its specific small cooperative units ("fruitieres") and inter-professional organization. On the basis of the internal journal of the value-chain and the literature, we show how these social links enable to adapt cheese production to the demand, in order to maintain high milk price. Furthermore, we show that social capital can also be used as a source of innovation for other issues, with practical examples in the social domain (evolutions of cheese markers' working conditions) and in the technical domain (improvement of cheese quality and farm self-sufficiency). The social capital of the value chain is exposed to a risk of erosion, but at the same time it enables to cope with this risk of its own erosion. These dynamic perspectives are discussed in the conclusion, as well as perspectives and general lessons.

Using activated biochar for greenhouse gas mitigation and industrial water treatment	MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						Activated biochar; Biochar; Lignocellulosic biomass; Oil sands; Organics; Produced water	OIL SANDS TAILINGS; NAPHTHENIC ACIDS; PYROLYSIS; EMISSIONS; BACTERIA; SAMPLES; YIELD; WOOD	This study explored the feasibility of using residual biomass to both mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and remediate water contaminated by hydrocarbons. Using produced (process-affected) water from Canada's oil sands operations as a case study, activated biochar (ACB) was found to have a higher affinity to organics than activated coal and removed 75 % of total organic carbon (TOC) from produced water in steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operations or 90 % of the TOC from synthetic tailings (ST) water sample. Up to 6 Tg dry biomass year(-1) would be required to treat the waters associated with the 93 x 10(6)-m(3) of bitumen recovered per year. Landfilling the spent ACB and flaring any biogas produced were estimated to provide a greater GHG benefit than the combustion of the biochar + organics for heat to offset natural gas demand. Net costs for the ACB were about 13.84 $ m(-3) bitumen for SAGD operations and 1.76 $ m(-3) bitumen for mining operations.

We present a study of how an intermediary firm, which has no direct contact with its end users, built up a learning business system across its supply chain network to develop sustained competitive advantage. We argue that an intermediary firm with specific internal resources can develop a learning business system in a supply chain setting, and that such a firm where it holds capabilities to integrate collaboration and leverage competition across its value chain can build up hard-to-imitate competences for itself and the supply chain as a whole. Our findings demonstrate that an intermediary firm can proactively lead its material suppliers, manufacturers and brands in participating in a structured learning business system to the mutual benefit of its supply chain collaborators. The system is underpinned by certification mechanisms that advance technological product skills, develop capabilities, and maintain competition by not designating particular upstream suppliers to downstream buyers, and may eventually allow the intermediary to "set the rules of the game" in its industry. Overall, we conclude that an intermediary firm can create a learning business system that develops and maintains deeply embedded competences through establishing mechanisms for both collaboration and competition across its value chain.

A profitability assessment of productivity amongst small-holder pig farmers, Mpumalanga, South Africa	ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH			English	Article								The majority of small-holder pig farmers in Mpumalanga had between 1- and 10-sow herds. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the current government agricultural intervention (supply of 10 sows and a boar) in terms of technical and economic feasibilities and ascertain whether the small-scale pig value chain system alleviates poverty. Data were obtained from 220 randomly selected small-holder pig farmers using a semi-structured questionnaire. The results showed that 58% farrowed <= 10 piglets/born/sow/litter, 44.2% practiced no weaning method and many fed swill and leftovers alone (41.6%). Pair-wise association revealed that the feeding of commercial feeds had a relationship with pigs in relatively good to very good body condition. Pigs in poor body condition were positively correlated with the feeding of swill alone. The economic models for the 10-sow unit proved that pig farming is unprofitable if the current management and feeding systems that operate in the commercial industry are utilised. However, only through a combination of cooperative systems, benefits of economies of scale, reduction of preweaning mortalities and structured government inputs can pig production be profitable at this scale of production.

J	Leenders, R				Leenders, Reinoud			The First Time as Tragedy, the Second as Farce? Lebanon's Nascent Petroleum Sector and the Risks of Corruption	MEDITERRANEAN POLITICS			English	Article								This article analyses the risks of corruption in Lebanon's nascent governance structures established in preparation for a thriving petroleum sector. Engaging with comparative theory on the 'oil curse', the article assesses the risks of corruption in the institutional and regulatory measures and policy tools that have thus far been developed down the sector's value chain and including revenue management and expenditure. Lebanon's political settlement, or the ways in which its political decision-making process evolved since the Ta'if Accord, consistently caused disappointing outcomes when it comes to sound institution-building and countering corruption; despite signs of awareness of the large stakes involved, this tendency is once again discernible in the country's preparations for petroleum sector governance.

However, MRAs in resource-constrained settings often struggle to provide effective oversight of market entry and use of health commodities. This paper proposes a regulatory value chain model (RVCM) that policymakers and regulators can use as a conceptual framework to guide investments aimed at strengthening regulatory systems. The RVCM incorporates nine core functions of MRAs into five modules: (i) clear guidelines and requirements; (ii) control of clinical trials; (iii) market authorization of medical products; (iv) pre-market quality control; and (v) post-market activities. Application of the RVCM allows national stakeholders to identify and prioritize investments according to where they can add the most value to the regulatory process. Depending on the economy, capacity, and needs of a country, some functions can be elevated to a regional or supranational level, while others can be maintained at the national level. In contrast to a "one size fits all" approach to regulation in which each country manages the full regulatory process at the national level, the RVCM encourages leveraging the expertise and capabilities of other MRAs where shared processes strengthen regulation. This value chain approach provides a framework for policymakers to maximize investment impact while striving to reach the goal of safe, affordable, and rapidly accessible medicines for all.

J	Campos, S				Campos, Stephanie			The Santa Monica prison and illegal cocaine: a mutual relationship	CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article							LIMA	This paper will demonstrate how women's labor in the transnational cocaine commodity chain (TCCC) links together the Santa Monica women's prison in Lima, Peru and the illicit cocaine market. Peru is one the fastest-growing economies in Latin America largely due to a neoliberal free market approach to economic development. It has encouraged foreign investment and also has a growing middle class. But a significant portion of the country's population has not benefitted. This has resulted in some women turning to drug smuggling or selling in order to generate an income. Due to war on drug strategies, many of them are caught and sentenced on drug trafficking charges. I argue that the prison and larger criminal justice apparatus benefit financially from the growing number of drug arrests due to the systemic blackmail of incarcerated women. The cocaine sector benefits from the internment of its ex-workers. It is able to recruit new low-level employees and maintain the protection of middle managers. It is in this way that this prison and the illegal drug market are enmeshed together through the labor of subordinate female smugglers and retailers. This study is based on ethnographic dissertation fieldwork conducted in 2008-2009 in the Santa Monica prison.

J	Scholtz, JH				Scholtz, Jan H.			Impact of ownership structure along the value chain in the manufacturing business	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						ownership structure; vertical manufacturing; chemical engineering; process synthesis; business structure; outsourcing	VERTICAL INTEGRATION	In the chemical and petrochemical industry, it is quite common that the manufacturing of a final product is the result of several consecutive steps which can be owned and operated by one or many participants. Although not always practical, equal ownership among all partners along the value chain is often recommended as a way to simplify business structure, ensuring all partners share equally in the ups and downs of an uncertain market. In contrast to this approach, there are instances where more benefit can be derived from having different owners and operators along the value chain. Examples which are common practice in the industry are the supply of utilities (e.g., electricity), feedstock, and services. In these cases, the nonintegrated approach offers value as: It provides the operator of the upstream or utility plants the opportunity to specialize, for example, by operating very similar plants around the world. Such specialization enables the use of regional operating centers, minimum onsite cash costs, optimized operating conditions, minimized energy consumption, and the optimal use of other variable cost parameters. This article shows that if outsourcing results in a cash cost saving by an upstream operator, the benefit to the downstream owner will (in financial reward) be proportional to the cash cost saving achieved. In absolute terms, the magnitude of the benefit is moderated by the size of the downstream capital investment (The bigger the downstream investment relative to the upstream investment, the smaller the impact of the saving on the economics of the downstream company). As a utility provider an upstream operator benefits from lower risk in terms of offtake and market price uncertainties. Such owners benefit from a lower cost of capital, and as such also have lower return expectations than players further along in the value chain (who are exposed to all the uncertainties in volatile markets). This article shows that the positive impact of such benefits to the return of the downstream partner is directly proportional the difference in return expectations between the upstream and downstream company. Once again, the absolute magnitude of the saving becomes more substantial as the ratio of upstream capital investment increases relative to the downstream capital investment. Economy of learning may also enable a specialized upstream company to obtain an asset at a lower capital than a less specialized downstream operator. This article shows that the positive impact of such a benefit is very similar to that of a lower return expectation by the upstream company.

Mineral resource management: Evaluating mineral resource throughput management	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Mining operations are increasingly challenged to sustain and improve its profitability. Mineral Resource Throughput Management (MRTM) is showing immense promise to become a fit for use mining management and improvement methodology. Research indicated that the three dimensions of MRTM, namely physical and non-physical constraint management, product payability improvement and optimised decision-making are largely based on the theory of mechanistic and organic systems, the theory of constraints and chaos theory. It also enhances best practices in quality and mining operations management. Managing the impact of variable geology (variable ore and ore body morphology), mining (variable and changing process flow chains) and beneficiation (material compatibility) conditions as well as external variables on production within the MRTM context, mainly centres around understanding and predicting the correct flow behaviour of ore (physical and quality) in downstream processes and synchronisation of the total mining value chain.

Technical and cognitive knowledge is necessary but difficult to master, which leads some firms to opt for outsourcing. This research draws on the study of a supermarket retailer that engaged an IT services firm specializing in the study of large commercial databases to perform all aspects of management control related to its jewelry sales activity.

J	Liu, Y; Deng, J				Liu, Yi; Deng, Jun			Antidumping under International Fragmentation: Evidence from China	REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS			English	Article							BUSINESS CYCLES; TRADE; PROTECTION	Applying a negative binomial regression model, this paper investigates how Chinese exports have reshaped the global value chain and the use of antidumping. We use trade in value-added statistics to distinguish between Chinese exports of intermediate and final products to its main trading partners, including the USA, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Germany, France and Italy, among others, and find that other countries welcome China as an intermediate producer, although not necessarily as a final good producer. We also find that a higher level of fragmentation reduces the likelihood of antidumping initiation and measures.

Silicon bricks represent an ideal opportunity to characterize and quantify the electronic material quality at an early stage of the PV value chain. Quantitative data on bulk lifetime can be obtained on bricks without any specific sample preparation, unlike unprocessed wafers. Spatially resolved bulk lifetime, interstitial iron concentration, and defect density measurements are demonstrated on bricks from different manufacturers including both high performance multicrystalline and older generation multicrystalline bricks. We find significant variability in bulk lifetime and iron concentration across the samples which is not related to its date of manufacture. However we do see a qualitative reduction in crystallographic defects in the newer high performance multicrystalline bricks. Data is parameterized in different ways to suggest possible paths to better predict solar cell efficiencies from an early stage of inspection. Brick level PL measurements were previously performed using a conventional area scanning PL imaging system, which is associated with light spreading artefacts of weakly absorbed light. To overcome these artefacts, a new line scanning photoluminescence imaging system is used. We show a reduction in contrast smearing between high- and low lifetime regions in the new setup leading to image quality suitable for defect detection and quantitative measurements without deconvolution correction.

S	Escaith, H; Inomata, S		Wignaraja, G		Escaith, Hubert; Inomata, Satoshi			The Evolution of Industrial Networks in East Asia: Stylized Facts and Role of Trade Facilitation Policies	PRODUCTION NETWORKS AND ENTERPRISES IN EAST ASIA: INDUSTRY AND FIRM-LEVEL ANALYSIS	ADB Institute Series on Development Economics		English	Article; Book Chapter						Global value chains; Multiregional input-output table; Average propagation length; Production networks		Deepening industrial interdependency in East Asia was not just a spontaneous phenomenon, but it has been carefully aided and facilitated by the series of policies implemented by national governments. The objective of the chapter is to provide a nontechnical introduction to the use of input-output analysis and graph theory for understanding trade in the global value chain perspective. Applying these topological properties to the East Asian and Pacific context, we show that the inter-industry network moved from a simple hub-and-spokes cluster to a much more complex structure with the emergence of the People's Republic of China and the specialization of several countries as secondary pivots. The densification of productive networks resulted from the coincidence of business strategies with the promotion of export-led growth policies from developing East Asian countries. These countries applied a series of trade facilitation measures that lowered tariff duties and reduced other transaction costs. Tariff escalation was greatly reduced, lessening the anti-export bias attached to high effective protection rates and improving the competitiveness of second-tier national suppliers. The other axis of trade facilitation focused on improving logistics services and cross-border procedures. While East Asia is well ahead of the rest of developing Asia in this respect, there is still a wide margin of progress in order to close the gap with best international practices.

J	Goswami, M; Singh, J; Kumar, V				Goswami, Mohit; Singh, Jaswinder; Kumar, Vijay			An enterprise based decision support system for engineering aggregate selection: a case study	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Decision making; Design strategies; Aggregates	EXTENDED ENTERPRISE; DESIGN; EIGENVECTOR; AHP	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that would help manufacturers to select the design concept that provides optimal solutions to the entire value chain involving multiple functional teams such as product design, development, planning, sourcing, service and marketing. The selection of an optimal design concept is based on the highest value index of a design concept. This is derived from quality function deployment (QFD) and a functional analysis system using customer requirement, quality deployment, development and design constraint as inputs. The framework systematically considers different alternatives to converge at an optimal solution. Design/methodology/approach - All high-level product requirements from customer and market analysis are translated into different engineering parameters using QFD. Thereafter, the functional analysis system technique (FAST) is employed to determine the range of functions and identify components that would achieve different functionalities. The relative importance of each function is determined by functional cost analyses, enabling us to generate different design concepts. Thereafter, business parameters are extracted from the business objective of each functional area. These business parameters are compared with different design concepts using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP), thus evolving the enterprise value index (EVI) for each design concept. Findings - The design concepts are evaluated with different business parameters using the AHP methodology to form EVI. The design concept 2 with highest enterprise EVI (4.549) is selected for further development. To validate the consistency of the business parameters, the consistency ratio (CR) has been calculated using Saaty's Eigenvector method. The value of CR is 8.4 per cent, which indicates that the judgment made in this paper as far as populating the business parameters weight matrix is concerned is quite reasonable. This framework would enable an enterprise's dealing in the area of complex engineering systems/aggregates to choose the design concept that would maximize the value of the enterprise. Originality/value - This research develops an integrated methodology for design concept selection from an enterprise point of view. Major functional agencies and their respective attributes are considered for the development of the framework and subsequent selection. An enterprise's mission and vision framework function as the primary input for the extraction of related attributes of the functional agency.

CONTRACT FARMING RISKS: A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article						Zambia; Monte Carlo simulation; outgrower scheme; risks; paprika smallholder farmers; sustainability		The objective of this study is to identify the key risks facing each of the stakeholders in the export-focused paprika value chain in Zambia. Although a deterministic cost-benefit analysis indicated that this outgrower scheme would have a very satisfactory net present value (NPV), a Monte Carlo analysis using an integrated financial-economic-stakeholder model identifies a number of risk variables that could make this system unsustainable. The major risks include the variability of the real exchange rate in Zambia; the international price of paprika; and the farm yield rates. This analysis points out that irrigation systems are very important for both stabilising and increasing yields. The analysis also shows the limitations of loan financing for such outgrower arrangements when at the sector level it is difficult or even impossible to mitigate the risks from real exchange rate movements and changes in international commodity prices. This micro-level analysis shows how critical real exchange rate management policies are in achieving sustainability of such export-oriented value chains.

J	Kim, JS				Kim, Jin S.			Investing in advanced materials: A market-driven methodology	TECHNOVATION			English	Article						Market-driven innovation; Value chain; Process innovation		This study proposes a market-driven methodology for investing in materials innovation. This methodology is the counterpart of a technology-driven methodology, the investment methodology for materials (IMM) proposed in 2005. The two methodologies complement each other in guiding materials investment in the early stages of innovation. This methodology consists of three modules (market, technology, and commercial) and 12 elements in the three modules. An overview of each element is provided, as are the associations between and among them. Furthermore, two unique challenges of materials makers in implementing a market-driven approach are highlighted: 1) materials makers are located upstream in the value chain, and 2) process innovation is a key constituent of materials innovation. A case study is provided to clarify the methodology for practitioners. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Religions have a growing importance for international business, shaping the value chain. Assimilating religious precepts can contribute to better business network management for actual and intended food producers. A qualitative case study based on interviews, non-participant observation, and document analysis was conducted. The main results are that trust and commitment give a competitive edge to the Brazilian Halal poultry network when serving Muslim markets worldwide. Knowledge transfer is influenced by the religious context, with a small group of companies (Islamic Centers) governing interpretations of the Muslim precepts.

J	Meng, QL; Wei, XC; Meng, W				Meng, Qingliang; Wei, Xiaochao; Meng, Wen			A Decision Method to Maximize Service Quality under Budget Constraints: The Kano Study of a Chinese Machinery Manufacturer	SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article							CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; MODEL; PRODUCT; ATTRIBUTES; BUSINESS; QFD; TRANSITION; MOTIVATION; LOGIC	Manufacturers are increasingly facing keen competition and improving customers' position in the value chain. Many of them have made efforts to promote service quality and enhance customer satisfaction. Research is lacking in considering the trade-off between service costs and customer satisfaction when tackling service quality issues in the machinery industry. A decision method is proposed for maximizing service quality in machinery industry under budget constraints, from the perspective of enterprise capacity and customer satisfaction. Due to the strength of the Kano model in acknowledging the nonlinear impacts of quality elements on customer satisfaction, we formalize the relationship between customer satisfaction and sufficiency of service quality elements quantitatively. And then we develop a novel nonlinear programming model to maximize service quality under budget constraints. In particular, we implement our model at Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co., Ltd., one of the largest Chinese construction machinery companies, to validate the efficacy of the method.

J	Meutchieye, F; Niassy, S				Meutchieye, F.; Niassy, S.			Preliminary observations on the commercialisation of Rynchophorus phoenicis larvae at Mvog-Mbi market in Yaounde, Cameroon	JOURNAL OF INSECTS AS FOOD AND FEED			English	Article								The palm weevil Rhynchophorus phoenicis is among the most consumed species of insects in Africa particularly in Western and Central Africa. This insect species is considered as a delicacy. The objective of this work was to assess the trade of palm weevil larvae in an urban food market in the capital city YaoundE. From the findings, it appears that the trade of R. phoenicis larvae is considered as a woman's business and is lucrative. A handful of 0.1 l of palm weevil larvae costs 1000 francs (US$ 2) which is quite a substantial income. Larvae are shipped from surrounding or distant villages and delivered with raffia or palm dead fibres as food substrates to keep larvae alive up to 4 days. Larvae pseudo reared on raphia palms using indigenous knowledge are much more preferred than of palm oil tree. Although this commerce is still very informal, the value chain involves various participants who control the market between producers in numerous villages and the retailers in the city and since the demand of this insect is somehow high, this business could be associated to a serious threat to palm tree ecosystems in Cameroon. The study suggests a mitigating research programme between the consumption of this insect and the conservation of palm tree ecosystems in Africa. Further investigations are needed for a better capture of palm weevils trade and its implications for value chains actors as well as for policy-makers.

J	Mose, GN; Mbeche, R; Ateka, J				Mose, George N.; Mbeche, Robert; Ateka, Josiah			Institutional Innovations for Smallholder Agricultural Production Systems in Kenya: A Case of Smallholder Tea Subsector	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Institutional innovations; smallholder farmers; farmer organisations; KTDA; Kenya	POLICY; AFRICA; GROWTH; GHANA; POOR	The smallholder tea sub-sector which is part of the larger Kenyan tea industry has enjoyed considerable success since its inception in the early 1960s. The planted area under the smallholder system, expanded from 2,522 hectares in 1962 to over 100,000 hectares in 2015; while annual production rose from 1.3 million kgs of green leaf to over 1 billion kgs of green leaf over the same period. Other industrial crops such as coffee, sisal and cotton that previously thrived have struggled to survive under diminished government direct investment in the agricultural sector. The smallholder tea subsector has conversely, managed to endure systemic constraints and challenges to remain competitive. This paper shows that while the relative success of the subsector can be explained by the adoption of modern technologies, there are other relevant factors including policy and institutional that KTDA has embraced to remain competitive. Evidence from the study suggests that innovative institutional arrangements and support systems which have been associated with enhanced farmers earnings. In addition, the participatory governance framework put in place post 2000, innovative approaches to the provision of advisory services and information sharing systems have provided an incentive for smallholder farmers to produce high quality teas that directly translated into better earnings. The presence of participatory governance, innovative and efficient systems that reduce costs and enhance farmers earnings are critical success factors for any smallholder agricultural value chain.

J	Serrano, VO; Martinez, MPL; Munoz, JPA				Orive Serrano, Victor; Latorre Martinez, Maria Pilar; Artero Munoz, Juan Pablo			Economic differences among regional public service broadcasters in Spain according to their management model: An empirical analysis for period 2010-2013	INTANGIBLE CAPITAL			English	Article						Outsourcing; Management model; Productivity; Public service television; Regional television		Purpose: This piece of research quantifies and analyses empirically the given economic differences among public service television in Spain according to the adopted management model (classic or outsourced). Design/methodology: In so doing, an average contrast of different economic variables studied in the literature is conducted (audience share, total assets, public subsidies, cost of personnel, suppliers spending and profit after taxes). In addition, these variables are related so as to calculate productivity obtained by each two groups of television operators. This analysis is conducted for period 2010-2013, featured by a crisis context in the Spanish economy. Findings: Management model adopted by each regional broadcaster impacts on different economic variables as obtained share, total assets, public subsidies, cost of personnel, suppliers spending or profit after taxes. Moreover, those public corporations adopting an outsourced management model present better productivity values. Research limitations/implications: Only one country has been analyzed for a 4 years period. Practical implications: Regional public service broadcasters with an outsourced model present less economic losses and require less public subsidies by their corresponding regional governments. Social implications: Outsourcing part of the value chain can be useful so as to guarantee sustainability of regional public service television. Originality/value: It has been proven empirically that the management model of a regional public service television impacts its economic results.

Key constraints and problems affecting the inland fishery value chain in central Mexico	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						fish value chain; inland fisheries; Lake Chapala; Lake Yuriria; Mexico	WATER-QUALITY; LAKE; CHAPALA; SECTOR	Anthropogenic activities have been the major cause of watershed deterioration in many parts of the world, negatively impacting inland fisheries. In Mexico, freshwater fishing represents a source of protein, income, and employment for rural communities; however, in the national fisheries statistics they only account for 3% of the total production, and increases have not taken place since the 1990s. Demand is higher than supply because the national market can only provide 50% of consumption, and these fisheries are currently passing through a complex situation that prevents an increase in production levels and fishers' incomes. This study examined the main production constraints and problems that prevent production from increasing to satisfy national demand. We considered value chain analysis and fish catch dynamic approaches. Fieldwork was conducted in 2 periods during 2011 and 2012 in 4 riparian communities near Lake Chapala and Lake Yuriria. The methodological approach considered socioeconomic factors and temporal variability of catch volume in both lakes. Results showed that production constraints are the result of watershed and fisheries mismanagement. Catch levels were strongly related to the environmental conditions of the lakes, which have shown instability and decline that affect fishers' livelihoods. In addition, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and the ineffectiveness of institutions to rule the actions of all actors who intervene in the management and use of these resources allow destructive strategies toward the fisheries. Finally, inland fisheries management is not considered part of watershed management policies, resulting in ill-adapted water allocation policies that affect fisheries production levels.

S	Rothaermel, FT		Thursby, MC		Rothaermel, Frank T.			COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN TECHNOLOGY INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES	TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: GENERATING ECONOMIC RESULTS, 2ND EDITION	Advances in the Study of Entrepreneurship Innovation and Economic Growth		English	Article; Book Chapter						Competitive advantage; strategy; value creation; SWOT; core competencies; Porter's Five Forces Model	COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; INCUMBENTS ADVANTAGE; DISCONTINUITIES; PERFORMANCE; ALLIANCES	This chapter introduces the reader to the meaning of competitive advantage and posits that a firm's strategy is defined as the managers' theory about how to gain and sustain competitive advantage. The author demonstrates how a firm creates its competitive advantage by creating more economic value than its rivals, and explains that profitability depends upon value, price, and costs. The relationship among these factors is explored in the context of high-technology consumer goods - laptop computers and cars. Next, the chapter explains the SWOT [s(trengths) w(eaknesses) o(pportunities) t(hreats)] analysis. Examining the interplay of firm resources, capabilities, and competencies, the chapter emphasizes that both must be present to possess core competencies essential to gaining and sustaining competitive advantage through strategy. Next, the chapter describes the value chain by which a firm transforms inputs into outputs, adding value at each stage through the primary activities of research, development, production, marketing and sales, and customer service, which in turn rely upon essential support activities that add value indirectly. After describing the PEST [p(olitical) e(conomic) s(ocial) t(echnological)] Model for assessing a firm's general external environment, the chapter explains Porter's Five Forces Model. The chapter then describes the strategic group model and illustrates that model by reference to the pharmaceutical industry. The author notes that opportunities and threats to a company differ based upon the strategic group to which that firm belongs within an industry. Finally, the chapter explores the importance of strategy in technology-intensive industries and emphasizes that sustained competitive advantage can be accomplished only through continued innovation.

S	Sjogren, S		Bitzan, JD; Peoples, JH; Wilson, WW		Sjogren, Stefan			MODELING AIRLINE EFFICIENCY - A COMPARISON OF INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES USING DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS	AIRLINE EFFICIENCY	Advances in Airline Economics		English	Article; Book Chapter						Airline efficiency; data envelopment analysis; deregulation; Malmquist total factor productivity	UNITED-STATES; AIR CARRIERS; PRODUCTIVITY; DEREGULATION; PERFORMANCE; PASSENGERS; INDUSTRY; DENSITY; SERVICE; OUTPUT	This paper aims to develop and test a new way of modeling airline operations and apply it to measure and compare the efficiency of international airlines, with a special focus on deregulation effects. The paper elaborates on the choice of variables, following the early work of Schefczyk (1993) and Scheraga (2004). The value chain of the airlines determines the variables included in three different models. Using data envelopment analysis, the efficiency scores show that North American airlines are more efficient in producing services offered to customers. Few differences are found between regions in allocating service output to match demand. One plausible explanation for this difference is that airlines operate within competitive environments. In a highly competitive market, management decisions focus on productive actions and cost reduction. In a less competitive environment, there is a higher degree of adjustments of the services produced. Using the Malmquist productivity index, measurements reveal that there is a catch-up effect for the European and Asian/South American airlines service production during the studied time period, which was from 1990 to 2003.

J	Verlinden, I; Markey, B				Verlinden, Isabel; Markey, Bram			From Compliance to the C-Suite: Value Creation Analysed Through the Transfer Pricing Lens	INTERTAX			English	Article								Business models in a global context have evolved at a much speedier pace than the international tax framework. The internet of things, powerful corporate identities, innovative ways to play the market and an increasing reliance on intangibles are vital elements that lead to unprecedented ways of 'value creation'. The Base Erosion & Profit Shifting (BEPS) project by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/Group of Twenty (G20) aims at ensuring that profits are effectively taxed where the economic activities generating the profits are performed. This is embedded in the premise that transfer pricing outcomes should be aligned with value creation. Many tax authorities and tax practitioners grapple with interpreting and translating value creation under innovative business models of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to the transfer pricing dictionary. In this article, the authors describe by means of examples how successful companies nowadays create value and unlock 'economic rent' across the value chain based on distinctive capabilities and unique business models. The authors subsequently put forward a novel economic approach to grasp value creation from a tax perspective in order to test whether there is a match with the transfer pricing outcomes. They started from the insights shared in 'Strategy that works' from PwC Strategy&, a playbook for the C-Suite to close the 'strategy-to-execution' gap.

The analyses were based on survey data sets obtained from 320 farmers and 100 traders and qualitative interview responses captured from sixty-two key informants selected from members of the chain. The structural equation modelling technique was employed to seek answer for the question of how value chain integration dimensions are related to performance. The results of the analyses showed the existence of positive relationships between coordination of activities and performance; between joint decision-making and performance at farmers-cooperatives interface; and between commitment towards long-term relationships and performance at farmers-traders interface. The study has made important empirical contributions in areas of value chain integration and performance and their interplays within the context of the studied malt barley value chain. The key findings of the study make important policy implications for agribusiness value chains in the developing countries. The study would open a venue for robust investigation based on a wider database from various agribusiness chains in Ethiopia or even beyond, for better validation of the findings.

The research revealed that MAS largely support the lean strategies; however, lot of MAS tasks in the organization are realized outside the Accounting Department. Yet, this does not cause any problems: all the groups of interviewees (managers, lean leaders, accountants) claimed that there was no discrepancy between current MAS and LM, but MAS should be altered that it would better adjust to the support of continuous improvement initiatives. The research helped to identify that MAS in the organization is loosely coupled. Such functioning of MAS is consistent with Lukka (2007) who proves that loosely coupled MAS responds better to the challenges posed by MA and facilitates the functioning of an organization in a change/stability situation.

J	Broich, A				Broich, Alexander			Not Like Other Media: Digital Technology and the Transformation of Educational Publishing	PUBLISHING RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article						Education technology; Publishing; Student needs; Digital; Adaptive; Value chain; Media; Netflix; iTunes		This article compares the surge of interest in educational technology to the technology-driven transformation of business models in content-driven sectors such as music, film, and television. Focusing on how technology is influencing educational learning materials, it argues that the comparison with providers such as iTunes and Netflix is fundamentally flawed. In other content-based sectors, technology has vastly improved the value chain and user experience without fundamentally altering the content of music, film, or books. Education is different, however. Education technology must transform the very nature of the educational process. In learning, the relationship between the student and learning content must be interactive, and differentiated. The most successful emerging education technologies show how publishers can create individualized learning experiences by using technology to shape content that meets the real needs of real students.

However, there is a significant need to assess the technological, biological, economic and environmental feasibility of bio-based chemicals, particularly during the early research phase. Recently, the Multi-scale framework for Sustainable Industrial Chemicals (MuSIC) was introduced to address this issue by integrating modelling approaches at different scales ranging from cellular to ecological scales. This framework can be further extended by incorporating modelling of the petrochemical value chain and the de novo prediction of metabolic pathways connecting existing host metabolism to desirable chemical products. This multi-scale, multi-disciplinary framework for quantitative assessment of bio-based chemicals will play a vital role in supporting engineering, strategy and policy decisions as we progress towards a sustainable chemical industry.

J	Roy, D				Roy, Devparna			Contesting Corporate Transgenic Crops in a Semi-peripheral Context: The Case of the Anti-GM Movement in India	JOURNAL OF WORLD-SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						anti-GM movement; India; anti-corporate; coalition politics	COMMODITY CHAIN	Market penetration by the hegemonic core state's agricultural biotechnology firms has been preceded and accompanied by a vigorous anti-genetically modified seeds (anti-GM) movement in semi-peripheral India. To understand the extent of anti-imperialism and anti-capitalism exhibited by the Indian state, it is useful to investigate the character of democratizing forces-such as the anti-GM movement-which interact with and shape the state. I use primary and secondary data sources to analyze the anti-GM movement in India and argue that the movement is anti-corporate without being anti-capitalist. Further, it is counter-hegemonic but not anti-systemic. These four traits reflect the strengths and weaknesses of exemplary coalition-building between right-wing nationalists, centrists, and left activists. The Indian anti-GM movement suffered an early failure when the Indian state commercialized Bt cotton seeds in 2002, following the entry of unauthorized Bt cotton seeds and lobbying by farmers' groups for legalization of Bt cotton seeds. However, an effective coalition between the right-wing, centrist, and left elements was built by about 2006. This was followed by a most significant victory for the anti-GM movement in February 2010, when the Indian state placed an indefinite moratorium on the commercialization of Bt brinjal seeds. A second, more qualified, victory was achieved by the anti-GM movement when the Indian state placed a hold on field trials of GM crops in July 2014. The anti-GM coalition has been successful in pressing ideologically different political parties to take steps against the multinational seed firms based in core states. Further, it has enabled the Indian state to move from a sub-imperialist to an anti-imperialist role regarding GM seeds. But until the anti-GM coalition in India resolves its inner contradictions and becomes resolutely anti-capitalist and anti-systemic, it will not be able to effectively challenge the anti-imperialist Indian state's pro-capitalist stance regarding GM seeds and industrial agriculture.

J	Alemu, AE				Alemu, Abebe Ejigu			Technology and market access via contracts and cooperatives for smallholders: Evidence from honey producers in Ethiopia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						contract; cooperative; honey; market access; smallholders; technology	AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES; CHOICE; CHINA; COST; PARTICIPATION; COORDINATION; ORGANIZATION; STANDARDS; COUNTRIES; ADOPTION	Smallholders in developing countries are facing high transaction costs and difficulties in accessing technology to improve productivity. This paper aims at exploring how technology acquisition and market access have driven smallholder honey farmers to contract participation or cooperative engagement by taking evidence from a sample of 412 honey producers in northern Ethiopia. A multinomial logistic regression model was employed. Both the descriptive and the empirical model suggest that market access, credit and technology constraint, an institutional void, household wealth and farmers' networks are the driving forces for smallholders' participation in contract and cooperative engagements. In addition, high value products are calling for contracts. Creation of access to credit, technology and market linkages to smallholders appear to be areas of intervention to upgrade the honey value chain and to mitigate high transaction costs and technology constraints.

Peroxide levels along the fragrance value chain comply with IFRA standards	FLAVOUR AND FRAGRANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						autoxidation; oxidation; peroxides; limonene; linalool; pinene	QUANTITATIVE RISK-ASSESSMENT; TOXICOLOGICAL CONCERN TTC; POTENT CONTACT ALLERGENS; OXIDIZED D-LIMONENE; OXIDATION-PRODUCTS; SKIN SENSITIZATION; SAFETY EVALUATION; ASSESSMENT QRA; LAVENDER OIL; AIR EXPOSURE	Autoxidation of certain perfume ingredients can result in the formation of sensitizing chemicals although the parent compounds are non-sensitizing. Peroxide values were determined for 875 freshly manufactured fragrance compounds, 34 hydroalcoholic fragrance products retrieved from retail establishments, 80 hydroalcoholic fragrance products retrieved from end-use consumers and in natural oils containing linalool stored either under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) or non-GMP conditions. Only 2/875 freshly manufactured fragrance compounds had peroxide values in excess of 10 mmol/l. There was no apparent correlation between the peroxide values and the concentrations of either linalool or limonene or the sum of their concentrations. None of the hydroalcoholic fragrance products retrieved from either retail establishments or consumers had peroxide values exceeding 10 mmol/l. Under typical storage and use conditions, there was very little peroxide formation. Utilization of GMPs that comply with IFRA standards results in products that comply with IFRA standards for preventing induction of sensitization owing to autoxidation of fragrance ingredients.

J	Cygler, J; Debkowska, K				Cygler, Joanna; Debkowska, Katarzyna			Coopetition Effect Determinants: Competitor's Size, Geographical Scope, Market and Technological Positions	ORGANIZACIJA			English	Article						coopetition; effects; competitor's attributes; classification trees		Background and Goal: The article is aimed at conducting an empirical analysis of the value and significance of coopetitors' attributes thanks to which coopetition, which is a combination of cooperation and competition between competitors, generates a substantial corporate profit. Four major competitors' attributes have been analysed: its size, geographical scope, market and technological position. The research also includes the Porter's value chain. Design/Methodology/Approach: The survey has been conducted on a sample of 235 high-tech companies operating in Poland and involved in coopetition. The sample is representative. The data have been collected at interviews with company top executives or owners. The research applies the method of classification trees, which, thanks to diagrams, sequentially divides the examined data space into classes (spaces) of similar properties. The assessment of the effect of coopetition, including its variants, made by the examined company served as a dependent qualitative variable. Four coopetitor's attributes and their variants were assumed as explanatory variables (predictors) affecting the assessment of cooperation. Results: The results of research indicated the necessity for an accurate competitor's profile selection. The significance of each of the four attributes may be different depending on the undertaken areas of cooperation with a competitor. The value of all the attributes of competitors is also diverse depending on the area of cooperation. A selected competitor's profile with regard to the four analysed attributes may become a stimulant to generate benefits in one area, while in another area it may become an inhibitor. Conclusions: So far, the selection of a coopetition partner has been treated universally, without scrutinizing on some specific needs in relation to the area of cooperation. The selection of an appropriate coopetitor's profile will allow for the cost reduction in search of appropriate candidates for cooperation and in relations management.

J	Overbergh, A				Overbergh, Ann			Innovation and its obstacles in Tanzania's Bongowood	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN CINEMAS			English	Article						Tanzanian popular cinema; Bongowood; African popular cinema; innovation in Bongowood; political economy of Bongowood; contemporary Tanzanian cinema		This article analyses selected 'forces for change' in contemporary Bongowood: Tanzania's Dar es Salaam-based popular cinema industry. It focuses on cases embedded in what I term 'core Bongowood': the production and distribution of Swahili-language movies, produced on low budgets, released on DVD and targeted at local (Tanzanian, and by extension Swahili-speaking) audiences. The 'forces for change' discussed are individuals or organizations in the industry, working to influence or alter it. The change they aim for can be creative in kind, i.e. related to the movies produced, or it can be related to Bongowood's value chain and inherent power relations. These organizations and individuals face several obstacles, most of them related to characteristics of the industry itself: a quasi-monopoly perpetuating an established imbalance of power, protected and reproduced by the most powerful players in it.

This study utilizes value-chain data envelopment analysis to investigate the effects of Information Technology and the trading activities of financial derivatives on the technical efficiency of a bank's production process through a two-stage analytical study with a firm-level data set. We find the impact of indicators related to capital adequacy ratios, exchange rate volatility, interest rate volatility, and long-term loans in relation to capital and ownership structure. Technical efficient precedes a reduction in problem loans, concentration of the operating units and developing information technology and utilization of financial derivatives. This paper provides a theoretical rationale and conceptualizing risk factors with environmental uncertainty. The innovation variables are determinants of the bank efficiency on Basel III Accord.

J	Aarstad, J; Pettersen, IB; Jakobsen, SE				Aarstad, Jarle; Pettersen, Inger Beate; Jakobsen, Stig-Erik			Assessing drivers of export orientation in the subsea oil and gas industry	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Export orientation; Innovation; Internationalization; Value chain position; Piggybacking; Subsea oil and gas industry	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; GENERALIZED-METHOD; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; FIRM; INTERNATIONALIZATION; NETWORKS; UK	The purpose of this short study was to identify the drivers of export orientation of firms in the subsea oil and gas industry in Western Norway. As the oil fields in the North Sea are approaching a stage of maturity, gaining knowledge of these drivers is crucial. An online survey was conducted of firms operating in the subsea oil and gas industry in the region. Consistent with previous research, the data reveal that product innovation and a majority share of international ownership increase firms' export rates. The use of instrumental variables indicates that both product innovation and international ownership are causes of subsea petroleum exports. The study moreover finds that subcontractors have a lower rate of direct exports than system providers, but international ownership in particular boosts subcontractors' export rates, probably by decreasing their market dependency on regional system providers. A clear recommendation for managers and stakeholders is that they should encourage foreign investments throughout the value chain. The results of such a strategy appear to be especially positive for subcontractors.

Improving smallholder livestock farmers' incomes through value chain financing in South Africa	DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE			English	Article						Environment (built and natural) - Agriculture; Labour and livelihoods - Microfinance; Sub-Saharan Africa		Separating the commercialisation of agriculture from other programmes to improve access to formal credit for smallholder farmers is a source of dramatic failures of most programmes. Despite the popularity of value chain financing, livestock agriculture remains marginalised. This paper analyses the MAFISA-NERPO Livestock Credit Scheme, a scheme which provides value chain financial products in order to improve the cash incomes of smallholder farmers in South Africa. Evidence shows that more than 80% of participating farmers receive average annual incomes of US$30,000. This implies that this scheme has addressed those factors hindering effectiveness and efficiency of smallholder credit institutions, using value chain finance.

J	Baiardi, D; Bianchi, C; Lorenzini, E				Baiardi, Donatella; Bianchi, Carluccio; Lorenzini, Eleonora			The price and income elasticities of the top clothing exporters: Evidence from a panel data analysis	JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS			English	Article						Clothing exports; Price and income elasticities; Parameter stability; Panel data analysis	UNIT-ROOT TESTS; TIME-SERIES; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ERROR-CORRECTION; TRADE; COINTEGRATION; INDUSTRY; DEMAND; STATIONARITY	This paper studies the main export function features of twelve top clothing exporters (China, Hong Kong, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, UK and USA) in the period between 1992 and 2011. Price and income elasticities are estimated for each economy using a panel data approach, after controlling for nonstationarity, cointegration and Granger causality. Rolling regressions are also performed, and show the existence of some elasticities instability over time, fundamentally related to the profound economic and institutional changes affecting the clothing trade in the period under consideration. The analysis suggests that most advanced economies, including Hong Kong, changed their position in the global value chain towards an "organizational'' role. China confirms its leadership in clothing exports although its rising price elasticity sounds a warning with regard to future prospects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Dynamics of Linkages and Innovativeness in Publicly and Privately Driven Agricultural Value Chains	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Linkages; Innovativeness; Publicly and Privately Driven Agricultural Value Chains		The study examined how linkages among actors in the cocoa and pineapple value chains relate to the innovativeness of actors in the chains. The study showed that a policy environment that promoted public sector leadership in value chain functions and service provision, tended to offer less incentives for smallholder producers in the value chain to forge linkages and interact horizontally or vertically. It concluded that actors in agricultural value chain could build their capacity to respond to challenges if they united their efforts. In terms of policy implication, the study makes a case for more private sector involvement in value chain functions and service provision as it is more likely to foster linkages towards systems innovation.

The capability framework defines a logical sequence of skill building based on the experiences of sustainability leaders that can speed learning for companies with less mature programs. Business improvement projects are designed to incrementally expand the span of concern from company objectives, to value chain viability, and ultimately to societal needs, while broadening the base of information and engaging a wider set of stakeholder views. The UNEP/SETAC sponsored pilot tests of the LCM CMM in Cameroon, Uganda, South Africa, India, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The results from the pilot conducted by Secretaria Distrital de Ambiente (SDA) and a network of 22 companies in Bogota, Colombia, are presented to illustrate how the capability approach can be applied and highlight lessons learned to promote further dissemination of life cycle practices. The companies were able to apply the concepts to develop accurate, representative assessments of organizational maturity and to identify reasonable improvement projects that delivered some financial value in the short term, addressed a management system gap identified in the maturity assessment, and could be completed within the schedule deadline of the contract (6 to 9 months). The projects included an LCA of cleaning products, collaboration among three companies to find a better solution for managing a waste stream of coffee "silver skins," a streamlined assessment of acrylic products, an LCA of disposable polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) cups, and a qualitative screening of operations of a transit company. The paper discusses how the results of the studies were used to identify specific improvement projects tailored to the specific needs and priorities of each company. The pilot projects showed that the capability maturity approach had intuitive appeal and the companies were able to apply the concepts to their organizations with limited technical support and identify an appropriate improvement project with LC relevance. This suggests there should be less emphasis on LCA as a tool to identify projects and more as a method to gain insights for effective implementation of business-relevant projects. One key question is how to sustain the energy and ongoing improvements fostered by this pilot program.

J	Kaci, A				Kaci, Ahcene			The Algerian poultry industry in the age of economic liberalization	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Article						Algeria; intensive farming; poultry farming; animal performance; agricultural policy		In this paper, we analyze the implications of trade liberalization in the Algerian poultry industry, using the Global Value Chain approach and SWOT method. The results of our research emphasize that the national Algerian poultry industry is currently changing, which gives rise to new constraints: the agricultural supplies industry is increasingly dependent on the world market, the products offered are not competitive, and the industry players are not well organized. Given the important role played by the poultry industry and the growing consumer demand, it is necessary to develop strategies based on technical, economic, and organizational actions.

To achieve this purpose, the paper is structures in two parts; firstly, the recent literature regarding relationship marketing paradigm is reviewed and the value chain concept is presented. The second part contains a survey-based research which uses book-store customers as target unit. Sales promotion and advertising are used as input variables in identifying the variation in the client's buying behaviour. Client behaviour was measured through three variables: monetary value spent by the clients within their last purchasing experience, buying frequency of the clients, and their buying intention.

The developments of energy policies in Malaysia were traced from the early 1970s with the introduction of the country's first energy-related policy all the way to 2010 with the country's first endeavour towards a biobased energy system. Analyses revealed that many of the policies were either: (1) directly responding to changes in global/domestic socioeconomic and political events, or (2) provided visions to guide developments of the energy sector in alignment with the country's growth agenda. Critical examinations of the country's actual energy consumptions during these 40 years were also conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these energy-related policies. Three noteworthy successes in Malaysia's energy landscape are: (1) the formation of PETRONAS as the national oil and gas company; (2) reduction of country's over-reliance on oil as a single source of energy by significantly growing the production and use of natural gas in a short span of time; and (3) creation of a thriving oil and gas value chain and ecosystem in the country. However, the country is still critically dependent on scarce petroleum resources, despite having an abundance of renewable reserves. Progress towards renewable energy has been too little and too slow.	[Abdul-Manan, Amir F.

Systematic analysis of funding awarded for viral hepatitis-related research to institutions in the United Kingdom, 1997-2010	JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS			English	Article						hepatitis A; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; funding; research	GLOBAL BURDEN; DISEASE	Viral hepatitis is responsible for great health, social and economic burden both globally and in the UK. This study aimed to assess the research funding awarded to UK institutions for viral hepatitis research and the relationship of funded research to clinical and public health burden of viral hepatitis. Databases and websites were systematically searched for information on infectious disease research studies funded for the period 1997-2010. Studies specifically related to viral hepatitis research were identified and categorized in terms of funding by pathogen, disease and by a research and development value chain describing the type of science. The overall data set included 6165 studies (total investment 2.6 pound billion) of which 76.9 pound million (3.0%) was directed towards viral hepatitis across 323 studies (5.2%). By pathogen, there were four studies specifically investigating hepatitis A (3.8 pound million), 69 studies for hepatitis B (21.4%) with total investment of 14.7 pound million (19.1%) and 236 (73.1%) hepatitis C studies (62.7 pound million, 81.5%). There were 4 studies investigating hepatitis G, and none specifying hepatitis D or E. By associated area, viral hepatitis and therapeutics research received 17.0 pound million, vaccinology 3.1 pound million and diagnostics 2.9 pound million. Preclinical research received 50.3 pound million (65.4%) across 173 studies, whilst implementation and operational research received 19.4 pound million (25.3%) across 128 studies. The UK is engaged in much hepatology research, but there are areas where the burden is great and may require greater focus, such as hepatitis E, development of a vaccine for hepatitis C, and further research into hepatitis-associated cancers. Private sector data, and funding information from other countries, would also be useful in priority setting.	[Head, M. G.] UCL, Res Dept Infect & Populat Hlth, London NW3 2PF, England; [Fitchett, J.

The existing food laws have brought about several desirable changes in logistics of postharvest handling and value chain of fresh horticultural produce. Synthetic pre and post storage treatment agents/molecules have been replaced with ecofriendly products. In last couple of years, some environmental and consumer friendly post harvest treatment materials like nitric oxide (NO), salicylic acid, methyl jasmonates (MeJA), ethanol, polyamines, 1-Methylcyclopropene, ozone, edible waxes, essential oils, biocontrol agents and irradiation are gaining popularity across the globe. These ecofriendly agents are equally effective over traditional synthetic chemicals in respect of bringing down the physiological and biochemical changes in the harvested produce. Application of nitric oxide, salicylic acid, methyl jasmonates (MeJA), ethanol, polyamines, 1-Methylcyclopropene, ozone, edible waxes, essential oils, biocontrol agents and irradiation have been proved effective in minimizing storage disorders likechilling injury (CI), scald; fungal diseases like stem-end rot, blue mold rot, green mold rot, anthracnose; regulation of ripening and senescence, etc. Quality traits of fresh produce were also found retained for longer period in fruits by application of these compounds.

S	Balkau, F; Gemechu, ED; Sonnemann, G		Sonnemann, G; Margni, M		Balkau, Fritz; Gemechu, Eskinder Demisse; Sonnemann, Guido			Life Cycle Management Responsibilities and Procedures in the Value Chain	LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT	LCA Compendium-The Complete World of Life Cycle Assessment		English	Article; Book Chapter						Life cycle assessment; Life cycle management; Responsibilities; Supply chain; Value chain		Product life cycles and companies' value chain dynamics now extend to far-away countries, linking a multitude of end-users with numerous upstream suppliers and manufacturers. The breadth of the sustainability issues of popular concern, together with the complex nature of supply chains from which they arise, leads to serious management challenges. These challenges have been met in different ways depending on the interests and the institutional context of the actors. Corporations are strongly focused on optimizing product performance through a reliance on life cycle assessment based procedures. Commodity sectors are often seeking harmonized sustainability performance across a broad geographical range. Management institutions and business associations are providing life cycle management frameworks for corporations, followed up with training, and further research into improved metrics. At regional level some efforts have been made to introduce life cycle approaches, e.g. sustainable procurement, but the formal application of structured life cycle management is not yet widespread. The different approaches taken by the above actors reflects not only their different situations, but also the lack of a clear universal framework for life cycle management and a more generalized toolbox that will support their sustainability ambitions throughout the value chain. Limitations of current life cycle assessment methodologies imply that not all sustainability challenges are addressed in a consistent manner.

The challenges facing the trade can be articulated as botanical identification, product and process documentation, and need for rural income generation in origins, as basis of international trade. In many countries the processing of plant extracts (vegetable oils, essential oils, solvent extracts for food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals) using plant raw material from wild collection, cultivation, horticulture and forestry has led to the bottleneck in commercialization of value added ingredients on global scale. The market development for MAPs, natural ingredients and final products are subject to continuous changes of legislation framework and market drivers. The demand for wild collected plant species is increasing by the day. At the same time wild collection has become a risk not only to nature, but as well to humans, due to disregard of process and product standards (Good Practices), resource -and risk management tool, amongst others. Likewise, cultivation and domestication is lacking a broad, international basis regarding understanding and definitions which leads in total to a dramatic shortage of raw plant material for value addition and trade - a worldwide issue. Process and product quality aspects got expanded by quality of documentation and (intercultural) communication in the context of international trade of MAPs. Not only the (cap) abilities on the seller's and buyer's side are crucial, but also the communication within the communities - knowledge management. For sustainable trade, rural income generation in the countries of origin and consumer safety cannot be ignored. Depending on the viewpoint MAPs as a whole trade sector is a forerunner in terms of strategic important natural resources. Trade promotion programs in Europe actively promote the value chains and secure their direct access to MAPs sources and natural ingredients by strengthening the producer, the exporter side in the partner country. International guidelines as well as national and regional legislation, which implement basically the Good Practices and can be certified by a private standard, represent the need for harmonization and cross-referencing in the sector. To subsume, the trade of MAPs and natural ingredients has overcome the technological bottlenecks from the past. The limitations of today's trade in MAPs and natural ingredients are principally the quality aspects such as product documentation, consumer safety and intercultural communication. The sustainable supply of raw material constitutes the principle bottleneck for the global trade.

It involves trust, regular exchanges, norms, networks, groups, proactivity and co-operation. The Tasmanian cherry industry value chain was examined as a case study to investigate the role of social capital in value chain effectiveness. The study found social capital to be very important in the value chain. Participants noted the success of the value chain is due to effective relationships leading to social and financial benefits. Development and maintenance of social capital takes effort and time by all value chain members. Social capital issues related to the operation of the value chain included a lack of connection between growers and retailers, a need for timely and effective communication and a need for better understanding of technical constraints. Social capital can be fostered by facilitating the development of relationships, education to address value chain issues and improving the effectiveness of communication.

J	Goler, D; Bickert, M; Doka, D				Goeler, Daniel; Bickert, Matthias; Doka, Dhimiter			Kromi can bllokaden - Albanian chromium mining revisited	ERDE			English	Article						Chromium mining; transition; glocalisation; critical resource geography; communist new towns; Albania		Chromium mining was one of the main economic pillars of socialist Albania. In the 1990s, in the wake of the economic transition, extraction nearly stopped altogether. However, chromium mining has undergone a certain revival since the beginning of the 21st century. Its background, context, problems and perspectives are highly diverse. In the following paper, these aspects will be assessed in a differentiated analysis and an evaluation from the position of a critical resource geography. On the one hand, chromite ore is exceedingly rare and highly valuable, which determines both global demand and economic dependencies. On the other hand, inefficiency, low levels of professionalism and widespread informality hinder a renewed economic valorisation of chromium as a resource. The study follows the commodity chain of chromium. Besides macro-and microeconomic issues, a variety of social and geographical aspects as well as the influence of variables relating to resource governance are discussed, both based primarily on qualitative field research.

This study is an assessment of the economic impacts emphasizing the direct economic impact, rather than just focusing on the perceived benefits and impacts affecting the region. Our analysis is based on extensive field research, including a site visit and interviews with industry participants. From this field research, we determined that the direct costs of bringing a Marcellus Shale well to production are in excess of seven million dollars.

J	Ibadin, PO; Oladipupo, OA				Ibadin, Peter Okoeguale; Oladipupo, Olugoke Adesina			Determinants of Intangible Assets Disclosure in Quoted Companies in Nigeria	ASIAN JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Voluntary disclosure of intangible assets; Nigeria; Corporate attributes		This study examined the determinants of voluntary disclosure of intangible assets by quoted companies in Nigeria. A disclosure index, based on the modified Value Chain Scoreboard (VCSB), was constructed to measure the dependent variables in four (4) models. The VCSB is intended to inform both the manager and investors about the company's innovational activities with emphasis on investment in intangible assets and their transformation to tangible results. The VCSB is described as a matrix of non-financial indicators arranged in three categories according to the circle of development (Lev 2001). The pooled and panel data, sourced from the annual reports and accounts of one hundred and fifty-seven (157) quoted companies for six (6) years from 2005 to 2010 were used. The Fixed Effects model was chosen for analysis of data. The findings revealed that Age of Company (AGEC) had a positive and significant influence on all classes of voluntary disclosures. Size of Audit Firm (SIZA) was positively and significantly related to overall voluntary disclosure of intellectual capital assets (VDIAOV), while the least disclosed class of intangible assets was voluntary disclosure of intangible assets relating to implementation (VDIAIM); and the most disclosed class was VDIACO. Given these findings, the regulatory authorities could grant awards in order to encourage more voluntary disclosure of intellectual capital by companies in relation to implementation since findings revealed that this phase of component is the least disclosed. Additionally, the big-4 audit firms can organize a mandatory continuous professional training as to extend their protocols and techniques in order to encourage more disclosures by companies audited by the non big-4 audit firms.

In the survey, the analysis of motivations showed that Zhejiang was in the preliminary stage. The most affected factors were the regional and domestic, then, the internal, and, finally, the international environment. The results showed that the global financial crisis, RMB rapid appreciation, and the weakening international market were the major international influencing factors. The increasing raw material cost and the insufficient domestic demand were the major domestic influencing factors. The excessively overburdened tax, the comparatively deteriorated competitive environment, the comparatively high commercial cost, and the overburdened industrial capacity were the major regional influencing factors. The lack of senior talents and the bottom locked-in value chain were the major internal influencing factors. As for these factors, the domestic and regional environment had a negative impact on the SMEs and positive impact on the high-tech enterprises.

J	Ojadi, FI; Walters, J				Ojadi, Francis I.; Walters, Jackie			Critical factors that impact on the efficiency of the Lagos seaports	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PRODUCTIVITY ASSESSMENT; AFRICAN	Background: Since the past two decades, the Lagos seaports have experienced vessel and storage yard cargo congestion, resulting in dwell times of about 30 days for containerised imports and high trade logistics costs. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify the critical factors that impact the operational efficiency of the Lagos seaports with a view to improving liner trade activities. Method: The study adopted an operational-based approach to understand the dynamics of the various interfaces of the port value chain. The research paradigm adopted for the study was therefore a combination of constructivism and post-positivism paradigms, which entailed the exploration and understanding of the various stakeholders in the port value chain. The epistemology of the research relied on the use of the exploratory sequential mixed method research technique (i.e. the qualitative approach followed by the quantitative approach) at the operational level of port operations. Results: The result of the research showed that significant challenges exist and that some of these challenges cut across all functions of port operations. Challenges are experienced in the areas of corruption, trade fraud, transport infrastructure deficits, the absence of a supply chain culture and shortcomings in the execution of the 'contract of customs'. Additionally, these factors include the deficiencies in services and facilities provided by state agencies and government-appointed service providers and private sector companies such as truckers, inland container depots, Inland Container Depots (ICDs) and terminal operators. Conclusion: Specific recommendations are made to address the issues identified which, if implemented, could significantly address the current inefficiencies observed in the Lagos seaport's operations.

Because the electronic intermediary is considered a Virtual Organization (VO), the chapter first tracks the evolution of the VO and then investigates its new role as an electronic mediator or broker. The shift towards the market poses a substantial threat to the survival of these intermediaries, leading some authors to argue that traditional intermediaries are a species in extinction, no longer indispensable thanks to the market's ability to do a more efficient job (Fielt, E. J. (2006). Designing for acceptance: Exchange design for electronic intermediaries. Ph.D.-Thesis, Enschede, The Netherlands: Telematica Institute; Giaglis et al. Information Systems Journal 12(3):231-246, 2002). This highly controversial hypothesis has unleashed intense debate in the literature. In fact, these theories tend to frame the role of the electronic brokers purely in terms of the costs of the intermediation, neglecting to factor in the value or the potential economies these create (Heijden van der and Ribbers (1996). The changing value of travel agents in tourism networks: towards a network design perspective. In W. Shertler, B. Schmid, & A. M. Tjoa (Eds.), Information and Communications Technologies in Tourism (pp. 151-159). Wien: Springer). As a result, the disintermediation theory has been a target of criticism, backed by empirical observations showing that far from disappearing the brokers have been recast as lead players. This is true especially in those markets where the value created is the result of the focal company's ability to manage increasingly complex value chains in outsourcing mode. The chapter concludes by arguing that, in practice, the traditional intermediaries will not all disappear. Rather, the virtualization-centric business sectors will simply transform their organizational structure to give life to new types of brokers, defined as electronic mediators, infomediators or cybermediators. Hence, the appearance of competely new markets for the electronic or cybermediators (Sarkar et al.

Assessing the economic impacts of drought from the perspective of profit loss rate: a case study of the sugar industry in China	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							NATURAL DISASTERS; COMMODITY PRICES; AGRICULTURE; COSTS; SPAIN; MODEL	Natural disasters have enormous impacts on human society, especially on the development of the economy. To support decision-making in mitigation and adaption to natural disasters, assessment of economic impacts is fundamental and of great significance. Based on a review of the literature on economic impact evaluation, this paper proposes a new assessment model of the economic impacts of droughts by using the sugar industry in China as a case study, which focuses on the generation and transfer of economic impacts along a simple value chain involving only sugarcane growers and a sugar-producing company. A perspective of profit loss rate is applied to scale economic impact. By using "with and without" analysis, profit loss is defined as the difference in profits between disaster-hit and disaster-free scenarios. To calculate profit, analysis of a time series of sugar price is applied. With the support of a linear regression model, an endogenous trend in sugar price is identified and the time series of sugar price "without" disaster is obtained, using an autoregressive error model to separate impact of disasters from the internal trend in sugar price. Unlike the settings in other assessment models, representative sugar prices, which represent value level in disaster-free conditions and disaster-hit conditions, are integrated from a long time series that covers the whole period of drought. As a result, it is found that in a rigid farming contract, sugarcane growers suffer far more than the sugar company when impacted by severe drought, which may promote reflections among various economic bodies on economic equality related to the occurrence of natural disasters. Further, sensitivity analysis of the model built reveals that sugarcane purchase price has a significant influence on profit loss rate, which implies that setting a proper sugarcane purchase price would be an effective way of realizing economic equality in future practice of contract farming.

J	Garcia-Muina, FE; Gonzalez-Sanchez, R; Medina-Salgado, S				Garcia-Muina, Fernando E.; Gonzalez-Sanchez, Rocio; Medina-Salgado, Sonia			The business model as a compass in dynamic environments: the case of Amadeus	DIRECCION Y ORGANIZACION			Spanish	Article						business model; resources and capabilities; value creation; tourism intermediation and Amadeus	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; TECHNOLOGY; FUTURE; CAPABILITIES; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; CREATION; PROGRESS; STRATEGY	Given the dynamic conditions of the tourism environment, the ability of firms to both analyze it and adapt to its evolution is determinant, not only for firm survival but also for creating sustainable competitive advantages and value creation. In addition, the tourism industry has been one of the great forgotten in studying the role of resources and capabilities. Taking into account the assumptions of the Resource Based View, the business model is a useful strategic tool for these objectives. Therefore, we offer a definition for business model and a description of its main dimensions - content, structure and governance mechanisms; in addition, in this paper it is analyzed how Amadeus, a technology leader in the field of tourism intermediation, is facing these changes. Technological innovation distribution became a strategic factor in the tourism sector in general, and airlines in particular. The analysis of these dimensions let us recognize the dominant logic of Amadeus' model and provide a holistic view of the company, contributing to better understand how the organization works, how resources and core competencies are employed through its entire value chain and, how the company redefines its operations when necessary. It is considered that the business model of Amadeus is virtuous, among other reasons, the complementarity between the different capabilities that make the structure dimension; It rests on a heavy investment in human and technological resources that allows the firm to develop innovation capabilities, stable relationships with customers and strong brand recognition. However, we have detected an issue that will demand special attention in the future: the appropriation of rents; in spite of the positive evolution of its revenues and results, profitability does not show the same trend.

J	Hathaway, M				Hathaway, Michael			Wild Commodities and Environmental Governance: Transforming Lives and Markets in China and Japan	CONSERVATION & SOCIETY			English	Article						governmentality; environmentality; commodification; contamination; China; Japan; Asia	NEOLIBERALISING NATURE; YUNNAN PROVINCE; COMMODIFICATION; TRADE; STATE; GLOBALIZATION; MANAGEMENT; ECOLOGY	This paper explores the relationship between forms of environmental governance and a transnational commodity chain for a wild mushroom that is picked in China and shipped to Japan. I argue that unlike some portrayals of environmental governance that largely assume a unified system working towards similar goals, governance comes from a number of sources and exhibits a range of forms, which at times overlap and contradict each other. In particular, this paper reflects on notions of commodification that are often argued to be part of neoliberal environmental governance. I show that diverse forms of environmental governance are shaping the texture of commodity chains, but not always working towards the overall increase in commodification. For example, in the last decade, the matsutake economy in China has been strongly influenced by several forms of environmental governance, such as a large-scale logging ban, the declaration of the matsutake as an endangered species, and its scrutiny in Japan as a potential object of contamination. I suggest that each of these forms of governance shapes the conditions of possibility and inflects the dynamics of this chain in different ways.

J	Ngombalu, J; Masila, G				Ngombalu, Janet; Masila, Gerald			Enhancing intra-regional grain trade in Eastern Africa through market information systems: The case of the Regional Agricultural Trade Intelligence Network (RATIN)	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			English	Article						food policies; food security; information and communication technologies (ICTs); market information services (MIS)		The Eastern Africa Grain Council (EAGC) focuses on promoting intra-regional trade in Africa in order to expand access to markets by the small holder farmers and traders. However, the lack of market information still remains a challenge, not only to farmers, but to all stakeholders in the value chain, as well as governments. Therefore, market information is largely considered a public good and its impact in facilitating and promoting regional trade can lead to increased earning for farmers, reduced transaction costs, increased regional trade, price stabilization, and improved food security. The provision of the market information system by the EAGC, the Regional Agricultural Trade Intelligence Network (RATIN), is discussed in this paper. A description of RATIN is provided with a discussion of the structure, conduct, and performance, as well as an examination of how RATIN has contributed to increased regional trade for grain in the Eastern Africa region, including a discussion regarding the challenges, lessons learned, and some conclusions.

Application for North-West Region of Romania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						cloud computing; service oriented architecture; open cloud architecture; IT services; innovative clusters; supply chain management		In order to stimulate and optimize the organization and management of innovative clusters from value chain perspective and guide their planning activities towards a differentiation strategy in which cluster members cooperate, we propose a Cloud Service Management System (CSMS) that provides IT services for these innovative clusters companies that can be customized for both enterprises with the associated clusters. Within such a system, actors begin to depend one on another and to take advantage of the local knowledge base. Each cluster is designed to have a different profile which will integrate all the companies mapped with it, with the objective of keeping the profile and data for each company. For the existing companies the idea is to migrate their services into the related cluster for integration within CSMS. Thus, our proposed CSMS will consider and meet different quality of services (QoS) parameters of each individual enterprise and service which will be included in specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs), after the negotiation between the cloud service provider and the CSMS. Realizing that technological progress is at the heart of regional development and decision-makers could support the development of technology clusters towards transforming them into regional innovative clusters, the application of our proposal aims to overcome existing bottlenecks in terms of business strategies and regional development policies in the North-West region of Romania.

To quantify these, we have developed a general equilibrium model of the Australian economy with detailed farming, processing and marketing information. We use the model to assess potential payoffs and distributions from various R&D scenarios that lead to demand expansion and productivity improvement. We find that productivity improvement caused by R&D is unambiguously beneficial to the whole economy while the benefits of export or domestic market demand expansion mainly accrue to the primary producers and processing industry, when the economy is at full employment. Also, productivity improvement from R&D on-farm may benefit processors while improvements postfarm may benefit farmers.

National and Industrial Strategies for Value Creation in a Global Context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industrial strategy; value creation; innovation network; global value chain		The development and growth of Taiwan's industries, especially the semiconductor and electronics industries, has been emphasizing overwhelmingly on cost-leadership innovation and strategy. Although such capital-intensive, volume-driven and cost-down strategies have been successfully measured by industrial and economic growth, the amounts of value created and captured in global value chain and innovation networks are insignificant. We apply the framework of creation and capture of value to analyze the industrial value creation strategy in newly industrialized countries for the last four decades. We examine their past industrial policy and business strategy, and argue that the transformation of policy and strategy must gear toward creating and capturing higher value in the global innovation network. Several managerial and policy implications are also discussed.

J	Votteler, R; Hough, J; Venter, C				Votteler, Roman; Hough, Johan; Venter, Chanel			An analysis of the solar service provider industry in the Western Cape, South Africa	JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article						Porter's Value Chain approach; Porter's Five Forces model; solar service provider; South African solar industry; renewable sources of energy; South African energy industry	COMPETITIVE FORCES	Scientists agree that rising electricity usage of the rapidly growing human race to improve its standard of living is negatively affecting the environment. To create a sustainable environment for future generations, renewable and environmentally friendly resources have to be exchanged for the present finite resources. In South Africa, coal plants are responsible for more than 90% of electricity production. This means that action has to be taken now to start a process of change to sustainable electricity resources. This paper focuses on the South African solar industry. Due to the high sun radiation levels, solar technology is one of the renewable energy sources with the greatest potential. The industry is in its infancy, characterised by accelerated growth expectancy and fuelled by factors such as government subsidies, the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices and the increasing focus on economical long-term sustainability. The expected growth necessitates a focus on the market positioning of solar service providers in the Western Cape, with the aim of taking full advantage of the opportunities associated with this industry. The main objective is to determine the current structure of the solar service provider value chain and subsequently areas of improvement to increase growth, stakeholder satisfaction and sustainability. A literature review was conducted to address the research objective, relevant approaches and the broader electricity industry. Porter's Value Chain approach was used as a foundation for the adaptation to the solar service provider value chain. Porter's Five Forces model was also used as a secondary approach, which analysed the competitive environment of the solar service provider industry in the Western Cape. The methodology entailed a qualitative research approach in the form of semi-structured interviews. All respondents were general managers or owners of a solar service provider, who were interviewed face to face. The research focused on the entire population of solar service providers in the Western Cape. Seventy-seven different service providers were targeted, of which 18 were interviewed. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using content and frequency analysis. To guarantee reliability, a pilot study was conducted to ensure that the respondents understood the questionnaire. The findings show that customer service is the foremost value driver for solar service providers. This entails the actual installation of the product as well as the people skills of the installation team. As most customers only have to be served once due to the long life span of the products, marketing also plays an obvious role in attracting new customers. The most important outcome of this paper is the determination and a better understanding of the solar service provider value chain in South Africa. The recommendations, especially with regard to marketing and service elements, could improve the performance of solar service providers. The consequence could be an increase in stakeholder satisfaction and an enhanced usage of solar energy in South Africa. Future research should focus on customers to reveal preferences and opportunities for marketing approaches.

Zero-tolerance for genetic pollution: Rice farming, pharm rice, and the risks of coexistence in California	FOOD POLICY			English	Article						Commodity chain; Transgenic rice; Genetically engineered organisms; California	COMMODITY CHAIN; CROPS	California's Rice Certification Act (RCA) requires specific planting and handling protocols for rice, including genetically engineered (GE) rice that could pose commercial risks to rice growers. Based on interviews with growers, marketers, activists, and other stakeholders, as well as secondary sources, this paper describes this policy's emergence and evolution using a global commodity chain approach. Several studies suggest that GE herbicide tolerant rice would yield profits for California growers struggling with rising weed control costs. Instead, GE rice was greeted with scrutiny by the California industry and legislators because Asian export markets had zero-tolerance for GE rice contamination. This paper examines how nature's agency-the "unruly" qualities of agro-ecosystem functions, the movement of wildlife, seeds, and pollen across space-strengthened narratives about risk and industry consensus around zero-tolerance rules for GE rice. In addition to recounting the origins of zero-tolerance demands and containment regulations for California rice, this research explores how calls for food safety and zero-tolerance rules are mobilized as surrogate for wider political economic aims.

J	Knight, GR				Knight, G. Roger			Commodity chains, mercantile networks and the early years of the Batavia firm of Maclaine Watson (1820-1840)	SOUTH EAST ASIA RESEARCH			English	Article						commodities; cotton goods; coffee; opium; trade; Batavia		This paper discusses the foundational history of a major European mercantile house in colonial South East Asia in the context of commercial developments that had both a regional and global reach. In so doing, it seeks to relate a local and historically particular event to a broader world pattern defined by three rapidly evolving commodity chains, based respectively on the production, distribution and consumption of cotton goods, coffee and opium. In this context, the paper argues that the hard-won commercial success of the firm in question resulted from a significant degree of withdrawal from the bilateral ties between colony and metropolis inherent in the cotton and coffee commodity chains. In their place, the firm had recourse to several varieties of the inter-Asian trade, of which the opium commodity chain constituted the key dimension.

J	Rimm, AM				Rimm, Anna-Maria			Conditions and Survival: Views on the Concentration of Ownership and Vertical Integration in German and Swedish Publishing	PUBLISHING RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article						Amazon; Book pricing; German publishing; Marketing strategies; Media ownership concentration; Swedish publishing		This paper compares publishing in two European countries with fixed respective free book prices: Germany and Sweden, when it comes to the phenomenon vertical integration. Concentration of media ownership is a central issue in today's global publishing industry and large international media groups are consolidating at a fast pace, taking over more and more links in the value chain of books. One of the foremost examples is Amazon-established in Germany and fast expanding in Europe, but not yet present in Sweden. This paper presents a broad overview of the two markets and interviews with several actors in the German and Swedish book trades are analyzed and compared Amazon's impact on the respective book markets as well as strategies for independent publishers are discussed. The question whether concentration of media ownership in the book trade affects publishing and distribution of "quality literature" is also raised.

J	Becue, M; Belin, J; Talbot, D				Becue, Mathieu; Belin, Jean; Talbot, Damien			Relational Rent and Underperformance of Hub Firms in the Aeronautics Value Chain	MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The present paper shows that in response to deep-seated changes in the aeronautics sector, tier-one hub firms now feature in the supply chain in the role of architect-integrators for key components. According to the Relational-Based approach, this pivotal position should enable them to achieve supernormal performance. Our statistical analysis, performed between the years 2000 and 2007 with sub-contracting firms in the aeronautics sector in the Aquitaine and Midi-Pyrenees regions, allowed us to identify the impact of this status on their main organisational features. Our conclusions suggest that, on the contrary, hub firms are under-performing. Our econometric analysis confirms the argument that hub firms are experiencing a financial performance which is both less robust and less persistent than the other firms in our sample population. In order to explain these findings which contradict the hypothesis of the development of a relational rent in the aeronautics industry, we investigated the most recent contingent factors. The architect-integrators' ability to harness this relational rent, the duration of the investment cycle and family-based capitalism all help to explain the under-performance of hub firms attached to this industry..

The analysis was focused on 60 companies dedicated to various activities in the value chain of the electricity industry. The metric totals 90 indicators, including 34 from the global reporting initiative (GRI) and 56 from the National Agency of Electrical Energy. In this research content analysis and correspondence analysis in panel were the used techniques, respectively. As data collection and analysis technique, the research used content analysis and correspondence analysis in panel techniques, respectively. Results showed a significant evolution in the disclosure level of the entities under study, as a result of ANEEL's social and environmental report disclosure. Despite the growth in the voluntary disclosure of the GRI model, it does not reach the level of disclosure resulting from the Brazilian regulatory agency's guideline.

J	Doyle, E; McGovern, D; McCarthy, S				Doyle, Eleanor; McGovern, Damien; McCarthy, Stephen			Compliance-innovation: integrating quality and compliance knowledge and practice	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE			English	Article						quality; compliance; innovation; Six Sigma; sustainability; absorptive capacity; knowledge management	6 SIGMA; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; VALUE CHAIN; MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE	Motivated by a gap in the literature linking compliance and innovation, this paper develops the novel concept of Compliance-Innovation (C-I). Based on a review of the literature and interviews with experienced practitioners, we characterise C-I as a transformational process to drive organisational improvements in sustainability and competitiveness. We explain how the organisational mechanism that permits identification and exploitation of knowledge for commercial purposes, i.e. Absorptive Capacity, may be enlarged through application of C-I because both external and internal contexts are appropriately and comprehensively incorporated. C-I's roots lie in the integration of quality and compliance knowledge into a central IT repository, and its potential for commercial exploitation through, for example, the Six Sigma approach is outlined - indicating its usefulness for orienting business focus, performance and innovation.

J	Drost, S; van Wijk, J; de Boer, D				Drost, Sarah; van Wijk, Jeroen; de Boer, Diederik			Including conflict-affected youth in agri-food chains: agribusiness in northern Uganda	CONFLICT SECURITY & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							LORDS RESISTANCE ARMY; PRIVATE-SECTOR; WAR; REINTEGRATION; SOLDIERS; VIOLENCE	Farming and agribusiness could help employ and reintegrate conflict-affected youth in regions recovering from civil conflict. This study addresses the constraints for youth to engage themselves in agribusiness in the worst conflict-affected regions of northern Uganda. Specifically, it explores to what extent beekeeping and honey business offer viable socio-economic opportunities to formerly displaced youth. Using a valuechain approach, the study draws on in-depth interviews with 23 (young) key stakeholders in the honey value chain, document analysis and focus group discussions. The results suggest that apiculture business can create employment for conflict-affected youth in northern Uganda due to the relatively low entry barriers, a young enthused vanguard and higher returns per unit input compared to other agricultural sectors in the region.However in order to succeed, this group requires support from community elders, government and business facilitators, because, due to their age and war background, these youngsters face the common constraints to farming and agribusiness, but at higher degrees of severity.

Strategic actors from the Virtual Innovation Society network were interviewed to identify critical semantic parameters that address this issue. As a result, this study suggests the characterization of inter-dependent added-values and its performance metrics, under the "managing as designing" approach, as input for managing the externalities, the integration of the articulation between business operations, strategy and information technology, and waste of innovation. In this context, the identification of the main managerial indicators for future command and control of existing innovation network operations under the "managing as designing" approach becomes a new challenge for future research.

J	Josephson, PE; Chao, M				Josephson, Per-Erik; Chao, Mao			Use and non-use of time in construction of new multi-dwelling buildings in Sweden	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						lead times; construction projects; productivity; value chains; delays; lean thinking		The aim of this paper was to contribute to the understanding of efficiency in value chains in new construction of multi-dwelling buildings in Sweden by giving three perspectives on how time is used and not used. One perspective concerns lead times from the start of briefing to final delivery. A second perspective concerns the fact that work in most projects goes on 40 out of 168 h per week. A third perspective concerns to what extent resources, here human resources, are used. Inspired by value chain thinking, value stream analysis and lean thinking, the analyses show major losses in construction processes and large variations in lead times. It is recommended that time gets more attention in initiatives for improving construction.

Emerging risks from bat bushmeat in West Africa	TRENDS IN GAME MEAT HYGIENE: FROM FOREST TO FORK			English	Article; Book Chapter						zoonoses; Ghana; fruit bats; spill-over; bushmeat; commodity chain; emerging infectious diseases	TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION; NIPAH VIRUS; FRUIT BAT; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; FLYING FOXES; ENCEPHALITIS; EMERGENCE; HENIPAVIRUSES; RESERVOIR; OUTBREAK	Despite major advances in medicine, infectious diseases still kill 15 million people around the world annually - one quarter of global deaths. In the past four decades, 65% of emerging pathogens have been those that were transferred from animals to humans (zoonoses) and three quarters of these zoonoses originated from wildlife. A leading source of human-wildlife contact is through hunting wild animals for food. Western and central Africans alone may harvest five million tons of bushmeat annually. This industry raises concerns across disciplines: epidemiologists fear zoonotic diseases, conservationists fear the depletion of endangered species, and development practitioners worry for the welfare of people who depend on wild meat for protein and income. Of the many animals hunted for bushmeat, bats pose a number of questions. Hosting almost 60 viruses that could or do infect humans, bats also are suffering population declines from overhunting. Yet their roles as reservoirs of human disease or as sources of valuable products are largely unexplained. The presence of henipavirus antibodies and Bartonella bacteria in Eidolon helvum in Ghana, as well as the potential for commercial hunting of these fruit bats, inspired a study to: (1) delineate how bats and their pathogens may come into contact with humans; (2) understand how, where, and how many bats are hunted, prepared, and sold; (3) identify and characterise potentially at-risk populations for bat-borne zoonoses; and (4) determine whether transmission of selected bat-borne pathogens is already occurring. Through interviews with over 700 Ghanaians, the demographics and perceptions of people involved in bat bushmeat trade were identified. Hunting, selling, and consumption are widely distributed across region and tribal lines, with hot spots in certain locales; butchering is concentrated in females and active hunters. Interviewees held little belief of disease risk from bats, saw little ecological value of fruit bats and thought that only specific tribes would consume bats. Serological and culture evidence strongly suggests there is no current spill-over of Bartonella but that there may be human exposure to a henipa-like virus.

J	Li, XH				Li Xiaohua			Institutional and Economic Support for Renewable Energy Companies in China and EU Member States: Conflicting or Cooperative Industrial Policies?	PERSPECTIVES ON GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						photovoltaic; conflicting; cooperative; industrial policies		This research examines the photovoltaic (PV) industry, which is the fastest growing source of renewable energy, as an example in order to illustrate the development history, the status of cooperation and conflict between EU and China, and to explain the reasons behind the phenomenon. The photovoltaic industry both in China and EU experienced a period of rapid growth before the international financial crisis, driven by the explosion of the PV installation capacity and pushed by supporting policies for solar energy in EU member states and other developed countries. After the international financial crisis and Europe's sovereign-debt crisis, because of the cut off of subsidies for solar energy in EU member states, the supply and demand relationship in the PV market was reversed. There was a serious excess capacity throughout the world and a subsequent trade war between EU and China in 2012. China and the EU have different comparative advantages. The EU is good at PV technology, producing the equipment used in PV factories and has management experience relating to the running of PV electricity systems, while China is good at manufacturing PV modules at low cost due to its innovative manufacturing in the global value chain. If the China and the EU combine these benefits, they can achieve a win-win game: China could produce renewable products more efficiently and with low environmental pollution and it could improve its management of PV electricity systems; at the same time, the EU could get low prices and high quality PV modules and reach its renewable energy targets more easily.

It involves two European and Asian multinational tires manufacturer for OTR, Off the Road, or "off road" and a problem of price competition. It shows how an initial intelligence effort is led astray. Instead the solution is a combination of approaches, better known as Competitive Intelligence. It is built on the external vision of the company craft, the use of all information sources characteristics of an intelligence field dedicated to the business world. It is not a new discipline but a transdisciplinary approach for information exploitation which is using elements from financial analysis, SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) matrixes, and value chain analysis. In the above case, the company Eurotires used mostly the following sources: internet, scientific and patent databases; public administrative sources; customers interviews, industrial experts (manufacturing and distribution), and marketing analysis.

J	Miravitlles, P; Guitart-Tarres, L; Nunez-Carballosa, A				Miravitlles, Paloma; Guitart-Tarres, Laura; Nunez-Carballosa, Ana			Competitiveness of Spanish foreign subsidiaries	COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW			English	Article						Multinational corporations; International value chain; Subsidiaries		Purpose - The purpose of this study was to approach issues such as what type of value chain activities are carried on by the subsidiaries of multinationals located in Spain, where and how their resources and capabilities are generated and how these are transferred within the multinational. Creating resources and capabilities within a subsidiary of a multinational company enables it to gain competitiveness and therefore greater power of decision within the corporation. Design/methodology/approach - This research conducts a descriptive analysis of the value chain in Spanish subsidiaries. A population of 1,072 firms has been identified. To gather primary data, a questionnaire was designed based on international value chain and resources and capabilities literature. Findings - Analysis of the data gathered from 125 subsidiaries has enabled researchers to map out the profile of the value chain in these companies. The results indicate that the principal source of resources and capabilities is the subsidiary itself. Moreover, the experience built up over time is basic to the creation of skills in all the activities in the value chain. Practical implications - This is a matter of the subsidiaries identifying new opportunities to attain a new position or broaden their existing one. Social implications - Subsidiaries should benefit from favourable local policies to help them develop and strengthen their capabilities to obtain major international competitiveness. Originality/value - Although numerous studies assess the country's foreign direct investment flows, works concentrating on the presence of foreign capital in Spain are scarce. The growing interest in the international literature on the subsidiary as a unit of analysis makes this study interesting.

J	Olomola, AS				Olomola, Aderibigbe S.			Determinants of Agro-Dealers' Participation in the Loan Market in Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						agro-dealers; business loan; demand; policy; Nigeria		Agro-dealership financing deserves policy attention if agro-dealers are to contribute to the success of the ongoing agricultural transformation in Nigeria. Thus, this study seeks to (i) examine the issues influencing the decisions of agro-dealers to participate in the loan market, (ii) analyze the demand for business loan by the agro-dealers and (iii) articulate policy measures for sustainable financing of agro-input business enterprises in Nigeria. The study employed primary data collected through structured questionnaires from 300 agro-dealers and used a Tobit type-II model for the analysis. The results show that interest rate, debt, value of asset, membership of trading association and source of credit are major determinants of loan demand. Agro-dealers need to organize themselves into input trading associations to enhance their creditworthiness and unleash the inherent social capital and information advantages for improved agro-dealership financing. Moreover, diversification of product coverage by agro-dealers and a value-chain approach that links internal financing in the form of trade credit within the agro-input sector with external financing from the commercial banks are strongly recommended.

SUPERMARKETS AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE CHAIN FOR POTATO IN PERU	REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE LA PAPA			Spanish	Article						Marketing channels; wholesale market; varieties	LATIN-AMERICA; RATES	While food supply and demand have expanded rapidly in recent decades in Peru, the marketing system is taking time to adapt to these changes. The bulk of all fresh fruits and vegetables entering Lima are still distributed through traditional marketing channels. However, in recent years, supermarket chains are expanding not only in Lima but also in major regional cities. Taking supermarket procurement of potatoes in Lima as an example, this study analyzes how food marketing practices are evolving in Peru. The study found that supermarkets have shifted their sourcing away from the traditional daily purchases in the central wholesale market subject to prevailing prices for the quality of tubers available for sale, closed and coordinated channels with specialized traders to ensure product quality and continuous supply.

Replacement Of Reserves Zinc Producers In The Russian Federation Based On The Recycling Of Technogenic Raw Materials	EKONOMIKA REGIONA-ECONOMY OF REGION			Russian	Article						mineral resources; technogenic raw materials value chain; technological development; zinc		In the article, the key stage of the value chain in the zinc industry of the Russian Federation is considered. The study aims to examine the impact of technological change on the development of value chains in the mining and metallurgical complex in the Urals region. The relevance of the assessment of the impact of technological change on the development of value chains in the processing of primary and technogenic raw materials in terms of the Ural Mining and Metallurgical Complex is grounded. The methodological scheme of analysis of value chains and the impact on them of new technologies are developed in the study. It is shown that the analysis of value chains should be carried out, using as an analytical tool value added as well as a heuristic tool study of the value chain. Analysis of the value chain in the production of primary zinc and technogenic raw materials made in accordance with the proposed approach. An assessment of the value added in the production of zinc from primary raw materials held in the article. The gross volume and dynamics of revenue, net income and the cost of segments of the value chain in zinc production are analyzed. The leading role of the metallurgical segment in the value chain of the zinc industry is established. Share indexes of the metallurgical segment as a control link of the value chain in the structure of the consolidated revenue, profit, cost considered in the dynamics, the dynamics of change in the total expenditure on scientific and technological development and R & D expenditure are investigated. The conclusion about essential influence of new technologies on the change of value chains in terms of zinc production is confirmed.	[Tatarkin, A.

Metrics for the sustainability value of steel	MATERIAUX & TECHNIQUES			English	Article						Steel; Social LCA; LCA; sustainability; inclusive business; environmental footprint		The European Commission's Europe 2020 strategy is about delivering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The steel industry is striving to adapt to this new business model. The first part of this article will demonstrate how the steel industry can address the environmental constraints of the future, and explain the methodological challenges that tools such as Life Cycle Assessment are facing in developing reliable indicators. The second part will touch on the social dimension of sustainability that is often neglected in the debate because it is difficult to demonstrate its contribution in a company value chain. Two approaches will be presented. The first one derives from the well-being indicators proposed by the OECD and the second one is on the growth of an inclusive business model that targets low-income populations. Finally, the article concludes by explaining the ambition of the Sovamat initiative, which seeks to identify the role of structural materials in society and to analyse the sustainable value of materials.

J	Wasicek, A				Wasicek, Armin			Protection of Intellectual Property Rights in Automotive Control Units	SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PASSENGER CARS-ELECTRONIC AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article								Intellectual property rights and their protection is a cornerstone of the automotive value chain. The automotive industry is composed by a meshwork of tightly integrated organizations that cooperate and compete in a hierarchical marketplace. Trading know-how and other virtual assets between participants is an essential part of this business. Thereby, software as a medium to transport ideas, innovations, and technologies plays a particular role. Protection of virtual goods and their associated rights is a current issue whose solution will determine how business will be done in the future automotive market. Automotive experts and researchers agree that ICT security technologies are a vital part to implement such a market. In this paper we examine the software life cycle of an automotive Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and discuss potential threats and countermeasures for each stage. In particular, we will look at the following threats: (1) development (leakage of know-how through insiders or industrial espionage), (2) production (leakage through split inventor/producer companies, (3) deployment and service (manipulation of ECUs), and (4) aftersales (combating counterfeit ECUs and spare parts). Next, we link our findings to the AUTOSAR methodology and life cycle model. Thus, we assess the state-of-the-art in automotive software development against the anticipated threats and countermeasures. As a result, we are able to propose improvements for the secure development and maintenance of software for automotive ECUs. Moreover, we are able to forecast the prospects of security technologies to protect automotive software.

J	Ekmann, J				Ekmann, James			Climate impacts on coal, from resource assessments through to environmental remediation	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							LEVEL	This paper discusses the coal cycle from exploration through mining to end uses and environmental remediation, primarily from the perspective of elements in the cycle that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climatic change. The differences between resource estimates are noted. Coal transport by rail, barge, and ocean-going vessels are compared. The major end-use technologies are mentioned in the context of the coal value chain. Water availability is identified as a major uncertainty that could be further complicated by climate change. The major flows that are produced by down-stream cleanup of environmental emissions are discussed in terms of the movement of bulk solids. Typical impacts of temperature change, changes in precipitation, sea level rise, and decrease in sea ice in this cycle are summarized. Finally, while noting the negative impacts of climate changes in the Arctic, the opportunities that may arise from these are also discussed.

It also applies the concept of total quality management, which includes learner satisfaction levels, teaching service levels, and learner response potential, to develop value-chain instruction system design (VCISD). The purpose of the study is to raise the quality of education by reconstructing the content and procedures of teaching. To determine if the proposed instruction system design is superior to traditional methods, this study uses empirical research to validate the effectiveness of VCISD. Results show that VCISD had positive effects on students' learning outcomes in terms of listening comprehension and reading comprehension. Students also attained higher satisfaction levels in terms of the use of teaching material/teaching aids in class, the depth of teaching content, the breadth of teaching content, the liveliness of teaching content, and the coherence and continuity of teaching content.

J	Ariyawardana, A; Collins, R				Ariyawardana, Anoma; Collins, Ray			Balancing industry needs against global competitiveness: a challenge for the Australian vegetable industry	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE			English	Article						competitiveness; food policy; vegetable industry; value chain; Australia		The Australian vegetable industry is a significant contributor to the national economy and regional development, generating employment opportunities both on-farm and along the farm-to-market chain. However, the high cost structure of the industry has negatively affected its competitiveness and production is declining, resulting in the relocation of some processing facilities to other countries and increasing imports. These outcomes threaten the future viability of the industry and impact on food-safety-conscious consumers in Australia. Thus, the aim of this paper is to review policy issues along the producer to consumer chain and discuss how key stakeholders could be affected by alternative policy options. The current context of the vegetable industry shows that Australia faces a challenge to find appropriate policy solutions to achieve global competitiveness and secure the interests of its stakeholders while at the same time adopting a market-based policy approach to its food industry.

J	Diamond, A				Diamond, Adam			Treadmill Acceleration and Deceleration: Conflicting Dynamics Within the Organic Milk Commodity Chain	ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						treadmill of production; organic dairy; commodity chains; geography of food distribution; organic agriculture	DAIRY; AGRICULTURE	An analysis of how the organic dairy commodity chain in the Northeast United States is structured uncovers significant power asymmetries and conflicting tendencies regarding the treadmill of production in organic dairy farming, distribution, and marketing, thus calling into the question the capacity of the state to simultaneously promote markets and transform agriculture in the direction of ecological sustainability. While organic certification has contributed to highly centralized business structures and more advanced processing technology at the distribution and marketing levels, it has also fostered significant changes in farming practices that represent a shift away from intensification and industrialization of agriculture. The standards governing organic dairy production require a slowing down of bovine metabolism and an overall reduction in material throughput, even as the economic system flowing from this regulatory regime has led to changes in milk processing, distribution, and economic control that constitute an acceleration of the treadmill of production.

J	Popp, H; El Fasskaoui, B				Popp, Herbert; El Fasskaoui, Brahim			SOME OBSERVATIONS ON TOURISM DEVELOPMENTS IN A PERIPHERAL REGION AND THE VALIDITY OF GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN THEORY. THE ANTI-ATLAS MOUNTAINS IN MOROCCO	ERDKUNDE			English	Article						Tourism; cultural geography; thematic cartography; global value chain theory; Morocco; Anti-Atlas		This paper has two different yet complementary aims. The first section, based on comprehensive empirical analysis and descriptive research, portrays a region that has yet to be much affected by tourism in terms of what can be observed so far and its potential. This research, which is contained in a detailed tourist map of the western Anti-Atlas (included in this contribution), is an attempt to systematically collect information on the region that is relevant for tourism. The cartography itself was not based on an explicit theory; instead, it is the synthesis of many years of experience visiting the area. The map is designed to provide assistance to tourists travelling to the Anti-Atlas, i.e., it is intended for practical purposes. In the second part of this contribution, some of the results from the empirical research are examined in terms of their correspondence with global value chain theory, and the validity of theoretical hypotheses is tested against the empirical results. In the first part of the paper, the western Anti-Atlas is introduced as a region with considerable tourism potential that has yet to see much development. The region's features that are relevant for cultural and heritage tourism (natural and cultural heritage sites) are described and mapped on the basis of the authors' own research and visits. Transport infrastructure and accommodation are also incorporated fully into the map, again based on the authors' own visits and interviews with local actors. The reasons that tourism has seen little development are presented, and it is observed that the international visitors encountered in the region differ from the classical type of package tourist in many ways. Thereafter, the validity of global value chain theory is assessed in the region. Recent theoretical approaches have demonstrated that international tourism even in peripheral regions of so-called "developing countries" follows the principles of global value chains. These state that travel operators in Europe, North America, Japan and Australia dominate and control tourism, and that local actors in the destination country are unable to break out of this grip with alternative strategies. This paper takes as its starting point the observation that the dependency observed and empirically confirmed elsewhere in fact hardly exists in the Anti-Atlas, and that other factors are at work. The results of our empirical research are used to test the validity of global value chain theory (and to refute its global validity). Finally, the region is characterised as a tourism destination in which global value chains have apparently been broken, with tourists booking tourism products directly with (accommodation) providers in the region.

Systems Informatics and Analysis of Biomass Feedstock Production	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Biomass feedstock; bioenergy; systems analysis; modelling; informatics; decision support		Sustainable biomass feedstock production is critical for the success of a regional bioenergy system. Low energy and mass densities, seasonal availability, distributed supply, and lack of an established value chain for the feedstock create unique challenges that require an integrated systems approach. We have, therefore, developed a Concurrent Science, Engineering and Technology (ConSEnT) platform integrating informatics, modelling and analysis, as well as decision support for biomass feedstock production. An optimization model (BioFeed) and an agent-based model, which are supported by an informatics database and made accessible through a web-based decision support system, have been developed. This article summarizes the recent advances in this subject area by our research team.	[Shastri, Y. N.] Univ Illinois, Enemy Biosci Inst, Champaign, IL USA; [Hansen, A. C.; Rodriguez, L. F.; Ting, K.

This research identifies several significant findings. First, the study proves the technology-push, demand-pull and competitive pressure as a product orientation of NCP development. Second, explorative and exploitative learning and vertical collaboration are of importance and positively influence the proficiency of product development process to increase NCP performance. Third, changes of the proposed relationships in this study are contingent upon the corporate capability. Compared to firms with lower capability, firms with higher capability tend to have technology-push and demand-pull as key product orientation of NCP development as well as strengthen the vertical collaboration of NCP development.

J	Volgger, M; Pechlaner, H; Pichler, S				Volgger, Michael; Pechlaner, Harald; Pichler, Sabine			Do Destinations as Cooperation Units lose their Importance? Interdependencies between local and supra-local Cooperation	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR TOURISMUSWISSENSCHAFT			German	Article						local cooperation; supra-local cooperation; destination governance; marketing consortia; special interest groups		Recently, the cooperative landscape among South Tyrolean hoteliers has been characterized by an increase of supra-local cooperation in inter-destinational marketing consortia. In contrast, local cooperation within destinations is undergoing notably less good times. The present exploratory qualitative study attempts to shed light on the interactions between these two types of interorganizational cooperation among hoteliers. In part, the results suggest a slightly diminishing importance of small-scaled tourist destinations as units of cooperation: Due to changing market and supply conditions, complementary forms of cooperation such as marketing consortia seem to gain importance. They appear to be a means for hoteliers to (re) gain control over the value chain and widen the geographical sphere of activity by establishing inter-destinational ties.

J	Valbuena, NIL				Leon Valbuena, Noelia Isabel			The Sales Force as a Determinant in Business Competitiveness	REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES			Spanish	Article						Sales force; business competitiveness; value chain; objectives; strategy		The objective of this article is to describe how the sales force influences a business organization, both inside and out, in achieving competitiveness. To accomplish this, the work of the sales force is connected to the value chain, and this significant link in the chain is studied. The methodology is documentary or bibliographical. The study is based on the supposition that the sales force is in charge of interrelating the internal and external environments of the organization, producing the necessary income for the beginning and end of the productive cycle through the performance of various activities. Conclusions are that to achieve the business objectives and competitiveness, it is vital to count on an excellent sales force. This sales force should be representative of a factor of change and differentiation in the organizations that moves toward the achievement and permanence of a competitive business.

J	Clifton, GT; Rose, JM				Clifton, Geoffrey T.; Rose, John M.			A simulation of the simple Mohring model to predict patronage and value of resources consumed for enhanced bus services	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Passenger value chain; Value of resources consumed; Mohring; Mixed Multinomial Logit		Choosing between the competing approaches to providing enhanced bus services requires the ability to predict the effects on patronage and overall benefits to society in terms of Value of Resources Consumed (VRC) of any proposed change. One common approach uses the Mohring model of 1972 and its successors to optimise one or more aspects of the supply of transit services given various level of demand. This paper simulates the operation of a simple circular bus route using the equations of a basic Mohring type model and a Decision Support System (DSS) to endogenise demand under the assumption that there is a fixed demand for travel but commuters can choose between the bus and private vehicle. The selected approach recognises that demand for a particular mode of travel is predicated on the speed of the vehicle in service which is itself determined by the demand for that vehicle (in this model or boarding and alighting time) rather than being determined exogenously. This creates an iterative feedback mechanism whereby changes to the attributes of the bus and car alter mode choice and the speed in service of the bus which, in turn, alters mode choice. The simulation is used to predict changes to patronage and VRC under scenarios regarding changes to the transport network (in terms of fares and running costs, frequency and spacing of bus stops) using parameters from both a Multinomial Logit (MNL) and a Mixed Multinomial Logit (MMNL). The results demonstrate that there are large differences in the size and, in some cases, direction of predicted changes to patronage, VRC and revenue, depending on whether the parameters of the MNL or MMNL model are used.

J	Conway, FJ				Conway, Frederick J.			Firewood Certification in Chile: Equity in an Innovative Form of Alternative Trade	HUMAN ORGANIZATION			English	Article						equity; alternative trade; forest certification; fuelwood; Chile	FAIR TRADE; FOREST; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; PROGRAM; MARKET	The Chilean National System for Firewood Certification (SNCL) has extended the model of forest certification to firewood, the principal fuel of the region. Firewood is the main product of Chile's deteriorating native forests and the primary cause of air pollution in the cities where it is used. The SNCL seeks both to improve these conditions and to increase equity for producers and consumers by reforming their relations with dealers in the informal firewood market. The SNCL is an experiment in broadening the application of forest certification in terms of scale, product, and the economic power of the actors, since firewood is an everyday necessity for all socioeconomic classes. This paper examines equity issues in firewood certification in Chile in the light of other forest certification programs. Mainstreaming, an emphasis on increasing the volume of certified wood sold rather than on the inclusion of small-scale actors, and formalization of the market have shifted governance of the firewood commodity chain toward greater power for larger producers and retailers and, as it turns out, the state. This raises questions of equity for intermediaries and consumers as well as producers, as all are relatively weak actors in the market.

The model developed by the Institute for Ecological Economy Research is the first to quantify generated effects on value added and employment on a local, regional and countrywide scale. Net value added is calculated as the sum of three components: tax revenues, company profits and wages, which are generated by the involved agents along the value chains of the examined 29 technologies. A comparison of value added and employment effects generated by the wind energy sector between the German federal states of Baden-Wurttemberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg reveals their specific competitive advantages in the value chain. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the wind energy sector can create value added and employment in various ways. Regional policies can help exploit the competitive advantages of the federal states but also aim to diversify local industries to participate and compete in multiple steps of the value chain.

Participants from different communities and organisations convened to develop an open and challenging framework for discussion. Design/methodology/approach - The two-day, off-site intervention focused on what it means to create sustainability for the business in the long term, with a particular emphasis on the responsibilities faced by the leaders and the organisation's value chain. The workshop was designed around the principles of sensitizing, re-visioning and transforming. Findings - The intervention supported participants to discuss and engage with sustainability and allowed them to increase their understanding and vision, at both a personal and organisational level. Success factors included developing a solid contract between the consultant and client, the role of trust, sufficient time, open but goal-directed facilitation skills, location congruence and being away from usual routines. Originality/value - Management development interventions for sustainability need to take leaders away from their usual settings and relocate to a different place where they can challenge their current cognitions, values and beliefs. Human resource/Learning and development specialists need to continue to support their managers to make sense of the complex yet critical issues of sustainability.

J	Dasgupta, M; Atmanand,				Dasgupta, Meeta; Atmanand			Efficiency in Indian electricity distribution through technological innovation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technological innovation; power distribution; aggregate technical and commercial losses; value chain; distribution network; customer services		Seeing the increasing importance of energy resources for the development of any economy, it becomes essential to create a sustainable base for the resources throughout the energy value chain. The commercial viability and customer responsiveness of the power distribution sector is the key to setting right the other two segments of generation and transmission. It, therefore, becomes imperative for nations to introduce technological innovations in the power distribution sector and establish infrastructure to support them. This paper explores the technological innovations done by two power distribution firms in India and maps the innovations on the distribution value chain to identify the gap and scope for future improvement in the sector. The gap identified can set the stage for further improvement/innovation in the power distribution sector. It also identifies the value created by different innovations.

J	Kraak, A				Kraak, Andre			Cross-sectoral state co-ordination, skill regimes and economic development: lessons for South Africa from Finland, Ireland and Malaysia	TRANSFORMATION-CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article								This article focuses on two inter-related prerequisites for 'developmental states' relatively ignored in other analyses - attaining high levels of cross-departmental co-ordination and ramping up human capital formation. The article also argues that most developmental states attain economic success because they move beyond narrow orthodox macro-economic stabilisation strategies to a more mature basket of interrelated micro-economic policies (such as industrial, innovation and skills policies) which seek to move the national economy up the value chain continuously towards higher value-added manufacturing and business services. This latter factor requires high levels of horizontal co-ordination between complementary policy elements such as education and training, industrial development, science and technological innovation, employment and economic growth. This argument is illustrated via a comparative analysis of the development trajectories of Finland, Ireland and Malaysia over the past three decades. These case studies are raised not as exemplars to be slavishly emulated by South Africa, but as cases which raise interesting comparisons, particularly around the role of horizontal co-ordination and skill formation. They differ amongst themselves with regard to the relative strengths of the manufacturing and financial sectors, the extent of value addition, export orientation, and human capital formation. The conclusion briefly touches on the inability of South Africa to learn from these development trajectories and meet these critical preconditions for success.

B	Piroozfar, P		Piroozfar, PAE; Piller, FT		Piroozfar, Poorang			Advancements of mass customisation in service and manufacturing industries: lessons for the built environment	MASS CUSTOMISATION AND PERSONALISATION IN ARCHITECTURE AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Book Chapter							CO-CREATION; INNOVATION; DESIGN; MODEL; USERS; PERSPECTIVE; TECHNOLOGY; DEFINITION; TOOLKITS; STRATEGY	Mass customisation is a well-known strategy in manufacturing and service industries but still has to be investigated in the built environment, architecture and construction with reference to the specifics of those disciplines. The two mainstreams - the manufacture/service industries and the building industry are fundamentally different in terms of the final product, the production process, the cash flow and the value chain amongst many other aspects. Building upon the existing literature of mass customisation in the pioneering industries, this chapter investigates those achievements with an aim to facilitate their transfer and employment in the construction industry. It draws a comparative analysis between the two sectors to point out similarities and differences. This helps show the way forward if any attempt towards mass customisation and personalisation is to be successfully made in the building industry. It subsequently outlines the feasibilities and obstacles in the way of application of those strategies in the built environment. Finally the chapter concludes with some practical guidelines for successful employment of customisation and personalisation strategies in the built environment in the future.

But as for must business, the tools may be important, but the vision and the strategy to use these tools are much more important. Therefore the chapter discusses e-Government and e-Procurement in their strategic contexts, in which intelligence (contextual integrated information) is a key factor to survive. The reason is because the government is a Complex Adaptive System (CAS). Without intelligence and the agility of its structure and processes, the government will not survive, or at least it will be less efficient and effective in developing strategies and in executing these strategies. The game theory discussion will show that the flexibility and agility of the e-Procurement system (together with a good strategy) are key factors for a successful system; otherwise e-Procurement is more of weakness in the government's value chain of procurement of goods and services. In the last part of the discussion on Cloud Computing and e-Procurement, the author argues that ERP systems (so called best practices) are not well adapted to other contexts than the simple context of the Cynefin Framework. Service Oriented Architecture solutions can provide better (adapted) solutions for e-Procurement. Cloud Computing in combination with SOA may be the next generation solution.

It covers economic concepts and methods relevant to the field. The focus is on mass communication and media economics, however featured concepts such as network effects and issues of regulation are also relevant for interpersonal communication. Furthermore it discusses concentration, internationalization, and convergence as three fundamental developments in media systems that tend to blur clear cut distinctions between media technologies and areas of research.

J	Walwyn, D				Walwyn, David			Patents and profits: A disparity of manufacturing margins in the tenofovir value chain	AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH			English	Article						tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; manufacturing margin; profit; generic; originator	IMPROVEMENTS	Registered in 2001, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has quickly become a mainstay of first line regimens for the treatment of HIV. Initially only available in developed countries at a cost of US$5 000 per person per year (ppy), Gilead's Access Programme (GAP) has extended the use of the product to 2.4 million patients in low and middle income countries. The programme has two components: distribution of the branded product at reduced prices and licensing partnerships with generic manufacturers. The licensing partnerships now supply 75% of the market by volume, at a treatment cost of US$57 ppy (1% of the branded cost). From Gilead's perspective, GAP must be considered a huge success. It has enabled the company to maintain high prices in developed countries whilst reducing its input costs and deflecting criticism of its failure to provide essential medicines for the poor, hence risking the possibility of compulsory licensing. Over the period 2001 to 2011, TDF in its various forms has generated for Gilead more than US$31 billion revenue at a gross margin of 80%, equivalent to a gross profit of US$25 billion. Analysis of the TDF value chain, from preparation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to sale of the formulated product, shows that manufacturing margins are highly skewed in favour of the originator, with the latter's profit being US$3.2 billion vs. US$4 million for API manufacturers and US$39 million for formulators (2011).

J	Kilian, B; Jimenez, GA				Kilian, Bernard; Andre Jimenez, Gustavo			Dole's carbon-neutral fruits - Teaching note	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Carbon Neutral; Fruits; Dole; Strategy		These teaching notes correspond to the Dole Carbon Neutral Fruits' case. Dole faces the issue of whether and how to begin producing carbon neutral bananas and pineapples. The teaching notes provide a short synopsis of the case, followed by suggestions of how to use the case, teaching objectives and finally, assignment questions. The assignment questions focus on strategic issues, so an overall look at the entire industry and market is presented and discussed. This discussion is followed by a closer look at the tropical fruits value chain, since carbon emissions along the value chain are distributed very unevenly, leading to disproportionate responsibilities in the carbon neutral strategy. To conclude the analysis, the financial performance of the company is reviewed with the objective to evaluate the financial implications of the different alternatives. The teaching notes finish with a short summary of the company's decision. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, WB; Cui, KX				Sun, Wenbin; Cui, Kexiu			Value chain capability, value strategies and firm default risk	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING			English	Article						value chain capability; value strategies; R&D; advertising; default risk		Firm stakeholders are paying more attention to the firm risks rather than merely focusing on returns. Among those risks, a firm's ability to repay its debt increasingly becomes a yardstick to evaluate a firm and predict the security level of returning its borrowings. This situation is directly related to a firm's default risk. The current article links the firm's value strategies and capabilities to firm default risk reduction. Specifically, this article conceptualizes and operationalizes a new firm capability, value chain capability, and examines how this capability and two firm value strategies, R&D and advertising, reduce the firm's default risk. Meanwhile, the authors formulate the value chain capability's moderating effects on the relationships between the two value strategies and firm default risk. The findings suggest that value chain capability and advertising help the firm reduce default risk. R&D will have the same effect only when a firm has high value chain capability.

Human Capital valuation and return of investment on corporate education	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intangible asset; Human Capital; KVA; Fuzzy logic; Vision-based process		This paper presents the Attitude, Skills, Knowledge, and Experience-Knowledge Value Added (ASKE-KVA) methodology developed from the designed Individual Technical Competence (ITC) of a value chain to assess changes in the Human Capital of a company. It is based on the Knowledge Value Added (KVA) method, which proposes the use of a proxy variable for measuring the flow of knowledge used in a key Process. This variable creates a relationship between the company's financial results and the resources used in each of the business processes. The KVA method uses an indicator that measures the result of knowledge per unit (K mu), which transforms costs and investments in the same unit. The ASKE-KVA methodology expands the previous concept, using fuzzy logic to measure the flow of knowledge associated with each ITC and, therefore, making it possible to obtain the return on investment of a particular business process.

J	Kudrin, A				Kudrin, Alex			Business models and opportunities for cancer vaccine developers	HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS			English	Article						cancer vaccines; business model; oncology market; federated model; emerging markets	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; THERAPY	Despite of growing oncology pipeline, cancer vaccines contribute only to a minor share of total oncology-attributed revenues. This is mainly because of a limited number of approved products and limited sales from products approved under compassionate or via early access entry in smaller and less developed markets. However revenue contribution from these products is extremely limited and it remains to be established whether developers are breaking even or achieving profitability with existing sales. Cancer vaccine field is well recognized for high development costs and risks, low historical rates of investment return and high probability of failures arising in ventures, partnerships and alliances. The cost of reimbursement for new oncology agents is not universally acceptable to payers limiting the potential for a global expansion, market access and reducing probability of commercial success. In addition, the innovation in cancer immunotherapy is currently focused in small and mid-size biotech companies and academic institutions struggling for investment. Existing R&D innovation models are deemed unsustainable in current "value-for-money" oriented healthcare environment. New business models should be much more open to collaborative, networked and federated styles, which could help to outreach global, markets and increase cost-efficiencies across an entire value chain. Lessons learned from some developing countries and especially from South Korea illustrate that further growth of cancer vaccine industry will depends not only on new business models but also will heavily rely on regional support and initiatives from different bodies, such as governments, payers and regulatory bodies.				koudrine@hotmail.com					Adams CP, 2010, HEALTH ECON, V19, P130, DOI 10.1002/hec.1454; Adams CP, 2006, HEALTH AFFAIR, V25, P420, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.25.2.420; [Anonymous], 2011, MARK PROD FOR TARG C, P5; [Anonymous], 2012, DENDR CORP PHARMAVIT, P1; Cancer therapy China, 2009, GEN THER GEND; Chung S, 2005, WORLD BANK WORKSH, P3; Datamonitor, 2009, STAK OP GEN THER GEN, P10; Datamonitor, 2009, PIP INS THER CANC VA, P1; Datamonitor, 2011, ONC MARK ACC CHIN MA, P2; Datamonitor, 2008, STAK OP BLADD CANC N, P5; DiMasi JA, 2010, CLIN PHARMACOL THER, V87, P272, DOI 10.1038/clpt.2009.295; Epeius Biotechnologies, 2009, REX G EP BIOT; Ernst & Young, 2011, BORD GLOB BIOT REP, P4; Faigen N, 2012, PERVASIS ACQUISITION; Gordon EM, 2010, INT J ONCOL, V36, P1341, DOI 10.3892/ijo_00000619; Insights B, 2011, CANC MARK OUTL 2016, P1; KFDA, 2008, REC TRENDS KOR CAS D; Landsdell M, 2010, BUSINESS INSIGHTS, P4; McKinsey & Company, 2010, INV REINV MCKINSEY P; Muller S, 2010, IDRUGS, V13, P175; Pammolli F, 2011, NAT REV DRUG DISCOV, V10, P428, DOI 10.1038/nrd3405; PharmaLive, 2011, ONC MARK SOARS CHIN; PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009, PHARM 2020 CHALL BUS; PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2008, PHARM 2020 VIRT R D; Rodriguez PC, 2010, MEDICC REV, V12, P17, DOI 10.37757/MR2010.V12.N1.4; Schmid EF, 2004, DRUG DISCOV TODAY, V9, P18, DOI 10.1016/S1359-6446(04)02951-4; Shirvill J, 2010, BUSINESS INSIGHTS, P5; Sievert KD, 2009, WORLD J UROL, V27, P295, DOI 10.1007/s00345-009-0395-z; World Bank, 2006, KOR KNOWL EC EV PROC, P2	29	2	3	1	23	LANDES BIOSCIENCE	AUSTIN	1806 RIO GRANDE ST, AUSTIN, TX 78702 USA	2164-5515			HUM VACC IMMUNOTHER	Human Vaccines Immunother.

Technology roadmapping, an alternative for designing agricultural research and its application on the carrot chain	HORTICULTURA BRASILEIRA			Portuguese	Article						Daucus carota; technological forecasting; market; innovation	FRAMEWORK	Technology roadmapping, an alternative for designing agricultural research and its application on the carrot chain This study aimed to present the application of Technology Roadmapping (TRM) method for the definition of the carrot research program at Embrapa Hortalicas in the next 15 years. The carrot production chain was chosen because this vegetable crop is one of the most important in Brazil. Moreover, the related projects from Embrapa Hortalicas have had significant impacts on the vegetable sector and the team was motivated to conduct prospective studies for identifying real and potential demands to support the projects planning related to this species. The steps of the TRM application were as follow: (1) to define the scope of the prospective study; (2) to understand the context of the carrot value chain in order to facilitate the process of TRM adaptation; (3) to establish the conceptual model of the roadmapping based on the basic graphic representation, with four layers: market, business, research areas and resources (physical, financial, human and expertise); (4) to collect data from primary and secondary sources, such as growers, wholesalers, seed companies, supermarkets, processors, consumers, and researchers, in order to support market and business layers; and (5) to carry out a workshop with external partners and collaborators, and subsequent workshops with the thematic groups to elaborate the roadmapping. The application of TRM from the managerial perspective allowed a robust data collection plan of the current status of the carrot production chain in Brazil and a clear action-plan of research activities aiming to reach the prioritized demands in this chain. Furthermore, it allowed the identification of the human and material resources needed to fulfill the research actions in a time perspective. In the scientific dimensions, the method showed significant degree of flexibility, therefore being recommended to be extended to other vegetable chains and to other agribusiness sectors.

The role of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) in the attainment of household food security in Kenya: A policy and organizational review	FOOD SECURITY			English	Article						Public research; Government; Partnerships; Markets; Gender		The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) is a government organization mandated to conduct research into, among others, crop and livestock production and marketing. In 2009, it launched a new strategic plan for the period 2009-2014, together with its implementation framework. This strategic plan aims to position KARI as a facilitator of growth in the agricultural sector in order to enable an average growth rate of 7 % per year over the next 5 years, as stipulated in the Kenya Vision 2030 policy. This paper reviews KARI's new strategic plan within the context of recent policy reforms at national, regional and global levels. It specifically examines the strategy in the context of Vision 2030, the Kenya Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS), the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), and the Millennium Development Goals. The paper then discusses KARI's newly adopted Agricultural Product Value Chain (APVC) approach, which is expected to position KARI strategically as a key player within the National Agricultural Research System (NARS). It also highlights progress in the implementation of the new strategic plan and APVC approach with specific emphasis on partnerships, markets and gender as key focus areas and the implications of these on food security in Kenya.

During the past two decades, several social entrepreneurs/developmental agencies have successfully carried out pro-poor value chain interventions (PVCIs) in a wide range of sub-sectors. The article examines the strategies deployed in six such PVCIs, culminating in the development of a typology of strategies. The typology includes strategies for working with existing value chains (reviving, reconstructing, leveraging) as well as for creating new value chains (linking distant consumers and marginal producers through fair-trade channels, creating networks of decentralised value chains). The typology is suggestive of what works best under different situations. Also included is a discussion on building appropriate social capital for PVCIs, which is critical for the success and sustainability of such interventions.

J	BeVier, G				BeVier, G.			Global Food Systems: Feeding the World	REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS			English	Article								The global food system could be defined as the activities involved in producing, processing and distributing food to feed the world; it links national and local food systems on a global scale through trade, technology, knowledge sharing, and labor and capital exchange. For over 10 000 years, it has evolved from the primitive utilization of vegetative plants and livestock domestication to the large scale, precision farming operations of industrialized agriculture currently in operation. Although important innovations have scaled this system to cover an exponentially increasing population and to reduce hunger and malnutrition, participation in, access to, and benefits of today's global food system remain elusive to the 80% of the world earning <$10 per day. It is indeed shocking to consider that over one billion people are food-insecure and will go to bed hungry every night in 2011. This is equivalent to the population of the United States, the European Union, and Canada combined. Despite increasing yields, the global food system has failed to make the world food secure, a state characterized by food availability, food accessibility, food utilization, and food stability. The United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization and other groups that track the points along the food value chain, note that we produce enough food on a global level to feed everyone; the failure lies in access and distribution. All lives should have equal value and in some manner, we should all feel accountable to rectify this tragic inequity amongst humanity. Understanding the global food system, how to improve upon it, and how best to prepare the human resource capacity to provide services within it, will require a background review of some of the key drivers for change.

Commodity specific origins, destinations, and routes are typically estimated from four-step models or commodity flow models. At a sub-regional level, both of these families of models are built on important assumptions driven by the limited availability of data. This study was motivated by a desire to determine whether efforts to gather corridor-level freight movement data will bring significant new insights over current approaches to freight transportation modeling. Through a case study of Washington State's potato and value added potato products industry, we show that significant insight can be gained by collecting commodity-specific truck trip generation and destination data: the approach allows product specific truck trips to be estimated for each roadway link. When considering a network change, the number of affected trips can be identified, and their re-route distance quantified.

J	Roman, M; Hoffmaister, JP				Roman, Mikael; Hoffmaister, Juan P.			Climate and development: the potential for climate co-benefits in the Mozambican rice sector	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Mozambique; SD-PAM; rice production; mitigation; side effects; context; value chain; capacity building		This article discusses the opportunities and pitfalls of linking a future Sustainable Development Policies and Measures (SD-PAM) mechanism to Mozambican rice policies. It concludes that there are various ways in which the ambition to increase the production of rice can also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, the analysis suggests that an SD-PAM mechanism may be instrumental in supporting this type of co-benefits. This implies that the pursuit of development policies as a precursor for climate mitigation is valid also for the agricultural sector and, similarly, least developed countries (LDCs) may have a role to play. Three traits of the LDC setting will influence the design of a future SD-PAM mechanism. One is the way contextual factors influence individual policy programmes. Another is the need for capacity building in its broader sense, which then emerges as another leverage mechanism in addition to funding, credits and technology transfer. Finally, it requires the recognition that GHG mitigation in LDCs is not about reducing emissions in an absolute sense but, rather, a question of changing development paths and thereby avoiding future GHG emissions.

J	Weijermars, R				Weijermars, Ruud			Regulatory reform options to revitalize the US natural gas value chain	UTILITIES POLICY			English	Article						Natural gas; Regulatory reform; Rate cases; Regulation reform		The key question addressed here is whether US utilities can sustain their current natural gas deliveries, and fund growth, as strategically required for the clean energy transition. A case is made here for adjusting regulatory policy, as past and current policies have led to a steady profit decline for mid- and downstream US energy companies. Capital markets have rated several major energy companies as 'junk bonds', which means default risk is substantial from an investor perspective. Arguably, overly tight price regulation and declining credit ratings have pushed the industry into a decade-long downward business cycle, which started even before the Great Recession provided additional challenges. Recommendations are formulated for improving the US energy regulation of the mid and downstream natural gas segments in order to revitalize these key pillars of the energy transition program. Insights developed here based on the regulatory development and business performance of energy utilities in the US may provide a useful reference for liberalized and liberalizing energy markets elsewhere in the world.

J	De Blasi, G; De Boni, A; Roma, R; Trevisan, G				De Blasi, Giuseppe; De Boni, Annalisa; Roma, Rocco; Trevisan, Giovanna			The Social Capital for Adriatic small pelagic fish value-enhancing: a network analysis	NEW MEDIT			English	Article						Small pelagic fish supply chain; Social network analysis; Value system		Fishing effort reduction forced by the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) designed to achieve sustainable stock levels has caused a fall-off in the incomes of fishermen and coastal communities. These events are particularly dramatic for the small pelagic fish market, which is characterized by low prices, a low level of consumption and poor market penetration. This paper evaluates the value of the social capital network as substance of relationships among the Adriatic small pelagic fish (Engraulis encrasicolus anchovies, Sardina pilchardus sardines and Scomber scombrus mackerel) supply chain actors; starting from the definition of each marketplace role and commercial flows, the paper defines the supply chain value-system and the possibility to enhance the fishery's share value, according to increasing relationships. Applied approach of the value chain to different supply chains of the Adriatic fishery system made it possible to estimate value distribution among the phases of the chain and to understand the fishery firms competitive position. Critical aspects causing fishing firms low profitability were detected and analyzed through the Social Network Analysis (SNA). Five local small pelagic fishery systems (Manfredonia, Molfetta, Ancona, Martinsicuro and Chioggia) were studied. For each of them, small pelagic fish supply chains were defined with particular reference to the role of local fish marketplaces and operators involved. Analysis of production areas revealed profound differences both in structural aspects (fleet composition, vessels, type and structure of local fish markets, fish ranges and prices) and in the business relations and management of supply chain dealers.

To date, there is not a single commonly accepted definition for it, although managing the triple bottom line economic, environmental and social aspects is gaining traction. Companies see different types of value in embracing sustainability, from reducing costs to enhancing their brand reputation and fostering product innovation. This chapter describes the multiple meanings of corporate sustainability, introduces the drivers of sustainability, explains how key historical events have shaped it and reviews the typical path that companies have taken to incorporate sustainability into their business agenda. It also provides a description of the value proposition that motivates companies to embrace it and challenges in achieving that value.

The authors employ the twin lenses of organizational innovation and elements of institutional theory. The research validates some institutional actors and most firm characteristics as important determinants. The relative weaknesses of the institutional actors provide evidence of structural isolation in the SME environment that is inhibiting information flow from intermediaries like government support agencies and vendors. The authors recommend a proactive role on the part of technology and enterprise intermediaries to design SME-appropriate solutions.

J	Garcia-Olaverri, C; Huerta, E				Garcia-Olaverri, Carmen; Huerta, Emilio			Why do some companies adopt advanced management systems? The Spanish case	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Spain; Industry competitiveness; Human resource management; Internal organization; Workplace transformation; Human resource policies	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; WORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the organisational innovation effort that is being carried out by Spanish industrial companies through the implementation of advanced management systems. Design/methodology/approach - Taking into account the results of two surveys conducted with Spanish companies (in 1996 and 2007), the authors study the implementation of innovative practices in the organisation of work and describe different typologies of companies, in agreement with how widespread these practices are. In addition, the authors study the determining factors that drive companies to use well-developed management systems. In order to carry out these analyses use is made of two statistical techniques: cluster analysis and estimation of discrete choice models. Findings - The study of the company typology reveals that there are industrial companies in Spain competing with three different profiles which are described in the paper. There are differences in some human resource management aspects. The greatest differences are seen in the way the information is shared. The results obtained through the estimation of discrete choice models determine that the main factors that explain the implementation of developed management systems in Spanish companies are: market competition; the development of positioning strategies; the existence of a participatory attitude in management; and the participation in networks along the value chain. Practical implications - After acknowledging the variety of business typologies, the management recommendations suggested in this paper insist on making coordinated progress in decision making on strategies, resources, internal organisation of companies and human resources management policies. Originality/value - This is the first comprehensive survey about how widespread organisational innovative practices are in Spanish industrial companies.

However a vast number of characteristics of these implementations exist, each one suitable for a number of purposes. The aim of this chapter is to extract a taxonomy of these characteristics found in modern Service Discovery systems and produce a categorization of existing implementations in a grouped and comparative way, based on these features. Furthermore, the mapping of these characteristics to the Cloud business model is produced, in order to assist in selecting the suitable solutions for each provider based on his/her location in the value chain or identify gaps in the existing implementations.

J	Lee, MS				Lee, Meng-Shiunn			An analysis of the critical factors that affect the competitive advantages and developmental strategies of leisure farms in Taiwan	AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA			English	Article						leisure farms; competitive advantages; critical factors; developmental strategies	SUCCESS FACTORS; MANAGEMENT	Leisure farms in Taiwan are currently undergoing a fast development. The utilization of distinctive strategies to create successful operational competitiveness is becoming the guiding policy of enterprises for their future development. This study adopts the value chain perspective to develop criteria for different dimensions and to develop a strategic hierarchical structure by using the fuzzy Delphi method. Through the FANP (Fuzzy Analytic Network Process) method, this study discovers the critical factors influencing the competitive advantages of leisure farms in Taiwan: (1) the uniqueness of the landscape and ecological resources, (2) the richness of agricultural resources, (3) the attractiveness of the landscape and ecological resources, (4) service quality, (5) the convenience of the accommodation, (6) the provision of education and guiding services, and the like. Finally, according to the research results of the study, the authors make suggestions on the corresponding developmental strategies of leisure farms, including (1) creating the characteristics of a leisure farm through the development and utilization of the farm's internal and surrounding environmental resources and (2) perceiving the tourists' needs and improving the service quality. With the suggestions made and the reference data concluded in this study, the authors expect to enhance effectively the current competitive advantages of leisure farms.

J	Louw-Potgieter, J				Louw-Potgieter, Joha			Evaluating human resource interventions	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Orientation: Programme evaluation is a transdiscipline, which examines whether a programme has merit or not. A programme is a coherent set of activities aimed at bringing about a change in people or their circumstances. Research purpose: The purpose of this special edition is to introduce readers to the evaluation of human resource (HR) programmes. Motivation for the study: There are few comprehensive evaluations of HR programmes despite many publications on functional efficiency measures of HR (i.e. measures of cost, time, quantity, error and quality). Research design, approach and method: This article provides a value chain for HR activities and introduces the reader to programme theory-driven evaluation. Main findings: In summarising all of the contributions in this edition, one of the main findings was the lack of programme evaluation experience within HR functions and the difficulty this posed for the evaluators. Practical/managerial implications: This introductory article presents answers to two simple questions: What does HR do? and, What is programme evaluation? These answers will enable practitioners to understand what programme evaluators mean when we say that programme evaluation seeks to determine the merit of a programme. Contribution/value-add: The main contribution of this introductory article is to set the scene for the HR evaluations that follow. It alerts the reader to the rich theory contribution in HR literature and how to apply this in a theory-driven evaluation.

J	Maina, SW; Gowland-Mwangi, J; Boselie, D				Maina, Stephen Wambugu; Gowland-Mwangi, John; Boselie, Dave			COST AND BENEFITS OF RUNNING A TEA-BASED FARMER FIELD SCHOOL IN KENYA	PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY			English	Article						benefits; cost; farmer field schools; good agricultural practices; Kenya Tea Development Agency		The Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA), through its extension workers, has been educating tea producers on good agricultural practices using Farmer Field Schools (FFS). Information on training cost and benefits of running a tea-based FFS in Kenya were not readily available. Such information would enable tea stakeholders to develop a strategy for up-scaling FFS. This study sought to determine and describe the cost and benefits of running a tea-based FFS among small-scale farmers in the Rift Valley. The study used a Cross-Sectional research design to collect data from 514 small-scale tea growers drawn randomly from KTDA factories. A questionnaire with a reliability coefficient of 0.92 alpha was used after validation by extension experts. Face-to-Face interviews and a stakeholders' workshop were used for triangulation purposes. Data were analyzed qualitatively and reported using descriptive statistics. The results indicated that training a farmer in a tea-based FFS in a year costs Ksh 6,076/= (US$ 71). The training gave farmers skills to improve their tea husbandry, yields, level of empowerment and leadership skills. The researchers concluded that training tea farmers in FFSs was cheap, sustainable and effective in changing their behavior. Stakeholders in the tea-value chain should increase funding and use of FFS in training tea farmers.

J	Rios-Nunez, SM; Coq-Huelva, D				Rios-Nunez, Sandra M.; Coq-Huelva, Daniel			The Dairy Value Chain in Chile Since the Strategic State Intervention	CUADERNOS DE DESARROLLO RURAL			Spanish	Article						Agro-export model; internal market; dairy; dairy agri-food industry; Chile	TRANSFORMATION; QUALITY; TRADE	This article makes a historical analysis of the dairy value chain operation in Chile between 1975 and zoos. It uses information from different data sources, studies and reports on that period. Its aim is to demonstrate that the generation of a competitive sector, open to international competition, and even exporting, is not the result of the actions of free-market forces but the result of public policy, in a way that is both flexible and persistent in time. The methodology used is based on an analysis of the transformation of the dairy value chain production structure in Chile using the available economic data sources for the period mentioned above and applying the analytical categories of agri-food theory. The main results of this investigation show that the survival of milk production in Chile is due to the combination of a series of agronomic facts -such as the obstacles to the productive reconversion of a portion of the south of the country - and a set of policy decisions that went from originally dogmatic ideas to much more pragmatic and flexible approaches.

Design/methodology/approach - The research model includes client encouragement, agency creativity, campaign creativity, and perceived performance. The study involved conducting a questionnaire survey in 150 publicly-traded companies in South Korea. Findings - The results show that client learning from agency services is the result of the creative process of the agency and the creativity of the service outcome itself. Client learning from marketing services also varied depending on different performance ratings. Originality/value - The study elucidates client learning as the central process of value co-creation in the brand value chain. It produces several unique findings and managerial takeaways for building up better co-creation environments in the context of business-to-business services.

The presented approach uses the modified Value Chain Model (VCM) in order to describe the refinement procedure of the problem domain knowledge. The major components of the modified VCM (domain knowledge) are management functions and information flows related by a control loop to the processes in the problem domain. The formal description of the information transformations of a particular management function is defined as an elementary management cycle. The modified VCM-based framework for the refinement of study program content is developed and discussed.

These are showing promises of a renewed period of innovative thinking in e-business strategies with new enterprise paradigms and different Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. In this chapter, the authors consider and investigate how dynamic e-business strategies, as the next evolutionary generation of e-business, can be realized through newly diverse enterprise structures supported by ERP, ERPII and so-called "ERPIII" solutions relying on the virtual value chain concept. Exploratory inductive multi-case studies in manufacturing and printing industries have been conducted. Additionally, it proposes a conceptual framework to discuss the adoption and governance of ERP systems within the context of three enterprise forms for enabling dynamic and collaborative e-business strategies, and particularly demonstrate how an enterprise can dynamically migrate from its current position to the patterns it desires to occupy in the future - a migration that must and will include dynamic e-business as a core competency, but that also relies heavily on ERP-based backbone and other robust technological platform and applications.

J	Berman, D				Berman, Danielle			When Global Value Chains are Not Global: Case Studies from the Russian Fast-Food Industry	COMPETITION & CHANGE			English	Article						Global value chains; upgrading; agricultural development; fast food; Russia	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; GOVERNANCE; INSTITUTIONS; SUPERMARKETS; LINKAGES; REVOLUTION; EMERGENCE; STANDARDS; CLUSTERS; IMPACT	While the global value chain (GVC) literature tends to analyze trade networks and supply chains that are global in the literal sense, I argue that domestically-bound chains led by global firms provide important cases for study through this analytical lens. Importantly, insights regarding the relationship between chain governance and opportunities for upgrading have significant implications for many developing markets even when foreign lead buyers are not fostering export-oriented production. In-depth interviews with representatives from foreign fast-food corporations and their domestic suppliers in Russia provide empirical evidence to support modifications to current theories to better account for how domestic contexts impinge on chain governance and the balance of inter-firm power. I identify factors that provide leverage for domestic actors in these supply chains: regulatory uncertainty, emerging domestic product markets, and the competing interests of foreign firms.

Citizen relationship management (CzRM) is derived from the commercial concept customer relationship management (CRM). In this paper, the value chain model of CzRM is proposed, which combines a set of functionalities obtained from CRM and good governance literature. This model is a framework for understanding current situation of CzRM and opportunities for improvement which enables governments to become more citizens centric. Finally, the results of implementing the proposed model in an Iranian governmental organization are presented as an empirical study.

The first experience is characterized by a social and productive segmentation which is caused by the absence of cooperation between local actors. On the other hand, the second experience is related to the action of an integrated firm that develops industrial governance mechanisms to join in a global value chain. The empirical findings of this investigation are based on 18 interviews to producers and 28 interviews to workers from the footwear industry in Leon.

Most important they need to rethink all the relationships actually in place with all the other factors in the publishing value chain and then radically reinvent their role in the quickly changing digital and ebook businesses. It is clear that now most of the changes are driven by the big three Google, Amazon, Apple and the publishers are following. However, especially in Europe the publishers have different approaches based on a brief review of selected key papers presented from different countries and sectors of the digital publishing industry.

J	Lee, HJ				Lee, Hong Joo			Analysis of Business Attributes in Information Technology Environments	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Business Attributes; Information Technology; Value Chain; Business System		Information technology is changing the business value chain and business systems. This situation is due to the business value chain and the value creation factors in business. Technology companies and researchers are developing new businesses, but many companies and researchers cannot find successful ways to analyze and develop a business in a specific way. In this paper, the following will be explored. First, the value creation motive in business is analyzed through a literary review. Second, business attributes are analyzed while considering the value creation motive and business factors in management. Finally, the business attributes of information technology are studied through a review of previous research that has been conducted on this topic.

The attitude of medical personnel (employees) at all levels of health care delivery to patients and the bureaucracy associated with the workings of public health institutions is inimical to quality health delivery. This paper investigates how Total Quality Management (TQM) - a value-chain model can help identify the paint of breakages in the chain resulting in poor quality of health and also to-determine the dominant factors in TQM implementation.

Biobutanol: Profile of an advanced biofuel and its path to market	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article						biobutanol; biofuels; Butamax; isobutanol		As global energy demand increases, demand for alternative energy sources will follow. Biofuels provide economically viable and environmentally preferred solutions to world energy needs. Biobutanol offers the most advanced and near-term solution for decreasing dependence on fossil fuels while meeting energy mandates and investment challenges. Biobutanol is a biologically produced four-carbon alcohol made from a variety of feedstocks. It also has added benefits compared to ethanol. In the transportation fuels market, biobutanol overcomes vehicle and infrastructure constraints that currently exist with ethanol, and allows ethanol producers to transition to a higher value product while leveraging existing investments. In addition, biobutanol adds value across the entire transportation fuels value chain, from feedstock suppliers to end consumers. Butamax (TM) Advanced Biofuels LLC is a leading producer and developer of biobutanol technology. With over 150 team members around the world and research facilities on four continents, Butamax has the expertise and global presence to provide energy solutions to a wide variety of markets. Butamax's proprietary technology package will be licensed to ethanol facilities worldwide and allows them to retrofit or expand their assets to produce biobutanol as a new product.

S	Bieger, T; Wittmer, A		Wittmer, A; Bieger, T; Muller, R		Bieger, Thomas; Wittmer, Andreas			From the Aviation Value Chain to the Aviation System	AVIATION SYSTEMS: MANAGEMENT OF THE INTEGRATED AVIATION VALUE CHAIN	Springer Texts in Business and Economics		English	Article; Book Chapter								The aviation value chain consists of sub-industries, most importantly, aircraft manufacturers, leasing companies, airports, ground services, technical support, reservation systems, and airlines. Within this value chain there are pull and push effects at work. For example, technical push effects from aircraft manufactures or demand pull effects in form of customer requirements. Because of these interdependencies, but also due to the interrelations of the whole aviation value system with its different environmental spheres (like demand, economic environment, technical environment, and natural environment) the aviation sector ideally can be modelled with a system approach. The profitability of the different sub-industries varies and depends largely on entry barriers. Therefore, reservation system, airports and leasing companies are more profitable.

Biological Nitrogen Fixation and Socioeconomic Factors for Legume Production in Sub-Saharan Africa	SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, VOL 2			English	Article; Book Chapter						Low soil fertility; N-2 fixation; Inoculants; Soybean; Adoption drivers; Sub-Saharan Africa	BEAN PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; GLYCINE-MAX-L; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; RHIZOBIAL INOCULATION; INDIGENOUS RHIZOBIA; SOYBEAN CULTIVARS; MOIST SAVANNA; N-2 FIXATION; SOIL-WATER; NODULATION	Low crop productivity is a general problem facing most farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). These low yields are pronounced in grain legumes and are often associated with declining soil fertility and reduced N-2-fixation due to biological and environmental factors. Unfortunately, the majority of African small farmers are now unable to afford the high mineral fertilizer prices. More than 75% of the fertilizers used in Africa are imported, putting pressure on foreign exchange. Low cost and sustainable technical solutions compatible with the socioeconomic conditions of small farmers are needed to solve soil fertility problems. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), a key source of N for farmers using little or no fertilizer, constitutes one of the potential solutions and plays a key role in sustainable grain legumes (e.g., soybean) production. Given the high cost of fertilizer in Africa and the limited market infrastructure for farm inputs, current research and extension efforts have been directed to integrated nutrient management, in which legumes play a crucial role. Inoculation with compatible and appropriate rhizobia may be necessary where a low population of native rhizobial strains predominates and is one of the solutions which grain legume farmers can use to optimize yields. It is critical for sustained yield in farmlands deficient in native rhizobia and where N supply limits production. Research on use of Rhizobium inoculants for production of grain legumes showed it is a cheaper and usually more effective agronomic practice for ensuring adequate N nutrition of legumes, compared with the application of N fertilizer. Here, we review past and on-going interventions in Rhizobium inoculation (with special reference to soybean) in the farming systems of SSA with a view to understanding the best way to effectively advise on future investments to enhance production and adoption of BNF and inoculant technologies in SSA. The major findings are: (1) complete absence of or very weak institutions, policy and budgetary support for biotechnology research and lack of its integration into wider agricultural and overall development objectives in SSA, (2) limited knowledge of inoculation responses of both promiscuous and specifically nodulating soybean varieties as well as the other factors that inhibit BNF, hence a weak basis for decision making on biotechnology issues in SSA, (3) limited capacity and lack of sustainable investment, (4) poorly developed marketing channels and infrastructure, and limited involvement of the private sector in the distribution of inoculants, and (5) limited farmer awareness about and access to (much more than price) inoculants. The lessons learned include the need: (1) to increase investment in Rhizobium inoculation technology development, and strengthen policy and institutional support, (2) for public private partnership in the development, deployment and dissemination of BNF technologies, (3) to develop effective BNF dissemination strategies (including participatory approach) to reach farmers, (4) for greater emphasis on capacity building along the BNF value chain, and (5) for partnership between universities in SSA and those in the North on BNF research.

J	Hansen, MW; Petersen, B; Wad, P				Hansen, Michael W.; Petersen, Bent; Wad, Peter			Change of Subsidiary Mandates in Emerging Markets: The Case of Danish MNCs in India	TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW			English	Article						Subsidiary mandate; Danish MNCs; emerging markets; institutional context; India		In recent years, the activities of Danish MNCs in India have expanded dramatically. Previously dormant subsidiaries have been transformed into integral components in the global strategies of Danish MNCs, either as crucial cash cows catering to the rapidly growing Indian markets, or as platforms for sourcing of increasingly advanced value chain activities. This paper aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between changes in the Indian business environment and mandate trajectories of Danish subsidiaries in India. A review of the literature on subsidiary mandates reveals that it largely fails to conceptualize how the specificities of emerging market business environments affect subsidiary mandate evolution. The paper develops a theoretical model for business environment change influence on subsidiary mandates, and demonstrates how the model can capture much of recent years dramatic mandate change of Danish subsidiaries in India.

J	Hoogendoorn, S; Westerman, M; Hoogendoorn-Lanser, S				Hoogendoorn, Serge; Westerman, Marcel; Hoogendoorn-Lanser, Sascha			Future Scenarios for Traffic Information and Management	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								The limited coordination between public and private actors in the fields of traffic information and management has led to reduced efficiency and sometimes undesirable situations. The main objective of the Strategic Council for Traffic Information and Traffic Management installed by the Dutch Ministry of Transportation is to develop a joint strategy for the development and the organization of traffic information and traffic management by public authorities and private parties. This strategy will outline future developments and related actions, as well as the organization and roles of the relevant actors for traffic management and information activities. To satisfy these requirements, a proposed scenario-based approach entails sketching different scenarios to describe the situations in 2015, 2020, and 2028 for public and private stakeholders involved in traffic management and traffic information. The approach to determine these scenarios, the scenarios themselves, and their implications are described. The developed scenarios were built around the dimension of freedom of choice of the traveler. After extreme scenarios were identified, possible scenarios were sketched and were linked to instruments and to multiple objectives. On the basis of the scenarios, no-regret activities (those beneficial regardless of scenario) were identified as part of the robust strategy forming essential elements for all possible scenarios. These no-regret activities reflect an important outcome of the project; they entail setting up the value chain of traffic information, setting up a data warehouse to share all relevant data (including the functional and technical standards), and preparing for integrated network management and cooperative systems.

It makes an analysis of labor relations and production of craftswomen cooperatives and their networks of relationships rooted in socioeconomic and institutional relations. It analyses the government policies and the inclusion of the craftswomen and their products in the capitalism market and the value chain of crafts. The introduction of the entrepreneurial vision, the importance of adapting the product to market and the cooperative as a way (company) to achieve competitiveness are issues highlighted. To what extent these changes alter the identity of the handicraft work? How the craftswomen, producing handicrafts to live in informal and precarious situation, face the challenge of becoming entrepreneurs through cooperative action?

Unlike the enterprise's information systems, the IT application is an inter-organizational case, which has a larger application scope and higher integrated level, meaning that a systematic implementation reference is needed. In this research, we study changes in business models and e-logistics implementation for a global electronics manufacturing enterprise by means of a case study. Based on its business strategy and the rationalization process, the case company was able to implement its e-logistics within a short period of time. After its application, the company's performance demonstrated improvements in logistics visibility, the time-to-customer, material inventory and error rate. However, some performance indices, such as the finished-good inventory, were not achieved because of the incomplete e-logistics scope. Based on this evidence, we summarize the company's experience, compare the evidence with some theoretical models, and make suggestions for the development of an e-logistics system. Significance: This case study provides a reference case for the implementation of an e-logistics system for a global manufacturing enterprise which stays in the 1-tier of industry value-chain.

J	Ming, LT				Ming, Lam Tak			Value Chain Flexibility with RFID: A Case Study of the Octopus Card	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic Information Systems; Value Chain Flexibility; RFID Technology; Electronic Payment	FRAMEWORK	Octopus cards are an electronic payment system based on a wireless RFID technology developed in Hong Kong. Users simply hold their contactless smartcards over an electronic reader, and the payment is deducted from the card automatically. If users link their cards to their credit card to upload money, there is no cash transaction involved. Launched in 1997, Octopus cards are the world's most widely accepted contactless RFID electronic payment system. The system generates value for customers, service providers, and societies. This article makes a theoretical and applied contribution to our understanding of strategic information systems. It adopts and modifies Porter's value chain and develops value-chain flexibility as a theoretical framework to analyze the Octopus card system. The fast and dramatic changes in customer needs, business competition, and technological innovation are creating an urgent need for flexibility throughout the whole value chain. By looking at order fulfillment as a process, the shop outlet-either online or offline-is only part of the entire flow from customer enquiry to customer receipt. It is clear that no single idea could significantly reduce customer lead time. Only a total effort from organizations to increase flexibility and eliminate bottlenecks can make the kind of difference needed to compete ( Day, 1994; Blackburn, 1991; Yusuf, Sarhadi, & Gunasekran, 1999). Therefore, value chain flexibility must be broadly defined, and it should be applied in the service industry. In other words, organizations should be able to deal with the uncertainty along the value chain to meet customer demands. This framework analyzes how the Octopus card system creates value and, in doing so, identifies key implications for customers, service providers, and society	[Ming, Lam Tak] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China		Ming, LT (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.	mslam@polyu.edu.hk					Blackburn JD, 1991, TIME BASED COMPETITI; Chau P.

Learning Alliances in Sawah Rice Technology Development and Dissemination in Nigeria and Ghana	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION			English	Article						Learning Alliances; Sawah Rice Technology; farmers; Nigeria; Ghana	WEST-AFRICA	Millions of dollars are spent each year on research and development initiative on rice in order to improve the livelihood of farmers and other stakeholders in the rice value chain, however little has been the impact. Major reasons for this failure include the limited collective learning that occurs between various stakeholders and the neglect of building a multi-stakeholder innovation systems for rice in West Africa. This has made research results less relevant and the impact making farmers worse off. This paper describes how Sawah rice production technology has evolved through learning alliances that involves social learning and innovation systems and brings Japanese institutions, research institutes, Ministry of Agriculture, extension agencies, farmers groups, Millennium Village, marketers, and universities in Nigeria and Ghana together on a platform with clear objectives, shared responsibilities, cost and benefits, output as inputs, differentiated learning mechanisms, long term and trust-based relationships. The process is increasingly leading to increased learning and effectiveness in rural entrepreneurial development and improved livelihoods.

J	Oyson, MJ				Oyson, Manuel			Internationalisation of value chain activities of small firms: An international value chain approach	SMALL ENTERPRISE RESEARCH			English	Article						international entrepreneurship; internationalisation; small firms; value chain	PROCESS MODEL; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; KNOWLEDGE; LIABILITY; ENTRY; EXPANSION; FRAMEWORK; BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; VENTURES	Small firms are increasingly engaging with international markets, often with great speed and close to firm inception. Yet, our current understanding of small firm internationalisation processes remains limited. This paper proposes an international value chain approach (IVCA) to international entrepreneurship, focusing on dimensions of internationalised value chain activities, internationalisation age and speed, choice of markets, and geographic scope of internationalisation. Used in studying the internationalisation of value chain activities of eight small New Zealand firms, the IVCA allows firm internationalisation to be explored in greater depth and from multiple dimensions, opening new insights into the internationalisation processes of small firms.

J	Singh, S; Singla, N				Singh, Sukhpal; Singla, Naresh			Fresh Food Supermarkets in India: An Analysis of their Inclusiveness and Impact on Primary Producers	MILLENNIAL ASIA			English	Article						Fresh Food Supermarkets; Corporate Agribusiness; Inclusiveness; Primary Producers		Linking primary producers with modern markets through corporate agribusiness, especially food supermarkets, is being seen as one of the ways to improve rural livelihoods. But, given smallholder dominance of farming in India, it is important to consider the implications of corporate linkage for smaller links involved/proposed to be involved in the chains i.e. primary producers, so that the process is not exclusionary in nature, and becomes a win- win situation for most of the participants in the supply/value chain. Gujarat is one of the Indian states which have seen significant food retail chain presence and penetration in the last few years in fruit and vegetable procurement and retailing. This paper analyses the functioning of two fresh food (fruit and vegetable) supermarket retail chains (Reliance Retail's Reliance Fresh and Aditya Birla's More) in Gujarat with special focus on implications for small producers. The paper situates the food supermarket retail phenomenon in the Indian context and profiles the operations of major players in fruit and vegetable sector and analyses their primary producer interface with a field study of two major vegetable crops procured by the retail chains each. It examines the inclusiveness of the retail chain operations and its impact on farmer incomes. The paper also attempts inferences about the competitiveness of food supermarkets and the mechanisms to promote inclusiveness and significant farmer benefits from emerging supermarket retail operations in terms of both policy and practice, based on the case study.

In order to effectively choose and deploy some typical security policies in a contents sharing scenario, we introduced game theory to analysis the mutual influence of adoptions of trusted computing enabling enhanced security policies on benefits of two stakeholders, which are DRM Providers and contents Sharer who is a category of consumers. A dynamic and mixed game and its algorithm were proposed, where Sharer's strategies were whether to employ the trusted computing enabling devices and related components or not, as well as Providers' strategies included entirely general security, entirely enhanced security and dynamic security policies. We concluded from both game-theoretic analyses and Swarm simulation experiments that the number of acquired sharable digital rights and security cost have a direct effect on Sharer's choices of the enhanced security policy, and also their different basic sharing modes including partial, modest and extensive sharing, further influence the choice of Providers. Besides, with respect to the mixed sharing mode far more similar to a real contents sharing scenario, Dynamic security strategy is superior to the entirely enhanced security in the context of limited sharable rights and higher security costs, but with the acquisition of much more rights and the decrease of enhanced security overhead, the latter strategy would be optimal and stable as a Nash Equilibrium for stakeholders, in combination with the exploitation of effective business models of contents industry.

More importantly, the January crisis has reinforced the concept that energy security goes beyond existing conceptions of access to upstream supply balanced by consumer demand. Up to now, the track record along the European energy value chain has prioritised short-term macro-solutions over longer term, step by step confidence building micro approaches. What becomes of energy trade in Europe may depend upon a fundamental re-thinking of energy based both on the understanding of the good as a purely economic commodity and on our institutional ability to coordinate the energy trade as a collective across a vast landscape of divergent economic and political interests. Subsequently, this article seeks to identify the sources of inaccurate structural interpretations of the policy environment, the unintended consequences derived from sub-optimal policy choices and to present workable solutions to existing risks to the stability of EU/Russia energy trade.

To facilitate this crucial integration, the global standardization organization GS1 is currently developing a range of service specifications. Yet, the services specified so far do not enable event-based interaction schemes and do not leverage the detection of distributed complex events. In this paper we propose to fill this gap by means of a peer-to-peer based broker network that can realize event-based interaction on top of existing specifications. For this infrastructure we present a new method to improve in-network processing. As shown by our experiments, our method significantly reduces overall system load by exploiting a priori knowledge about the observed processes.

J	Lorde, T; Alleyne, A; Francis, B				Lorde, Troy; Alleyne, Antonio; Francis, Brian			An Assessment of Barbados' Competitiveness within the EU Market 1992-2006	GLOBAL ECONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article						Barbados; competitiveness; EPA; EU; revealed comparative advantage	COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE; COUNTRIES	This paper assesses Barbados' competitiveness within the EU market in light of its recent signing of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU in 2008. Using SITC data from 1992-2006, indices of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) were calculated. We found that Barbados possesses comparative advantages in Live Animals; Raw Sugars, Beet and Cane; and Spirits. However, policies such as the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), stringent sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, onerous rules of origin and non-tariff barriers including technical barriers to trade, threaten to undermine these advantages. These developments strongly suggest that Barbados must move agriculture up the value chain and increase value-added, as well as integrate it more fully with other sectors of its economy. Greater attention must be focused on countries in the EU other than the UK, if full advantage is to be taken of the EPA, as the UK market is already mature. There is evidence that export opportunities to these countries exist in other commodity groups (Fuels, Lubricants, etc.; Animal, Vegetable Oils Fats, Wax; Chemicals, Related Products; Manufactured Goods). When these issues are placed within the context of Barbados' history of weak capacity to take advantage of the market access opportunities available from their trading arrangements, the overarching challenge for Barbados is one of effective market access. This will require, among other things, a capable export promotion agency. The export of non-traditional commodities should be promoted, and greater support, perhaps in the form of incentives, should be provided to large firms that are not yet exporters to encourage them to look beyond the domestic market.

Insights from the coffee sector in Nicaragua	MARKETS, MARKETING AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: WHERE WE STAND AND WHERE WE ARE HEADING			English	Article; Book Chapter						coffee; cooperative; governance; income share; information; Nicaragua; Organic-Fair Trade; smallholders; value chain analysis	FAIR TRADE; GOVERNANCE; CHAINS	Although certification schemes are widely applied and promoted in coffee value chains, research seldomly addresses the added value of certification by different chain actors and the relative benefits of producers. Based on the value chain concept, we selected several conventional and Organic-Fair Trade value chains and investigated prices, income shares, information flows and governance structures. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected from small-scale coffee producers in Nicaragua as well as from their cooperatives, exporters, importers and roasters. Results show that the structure of the value chain and conventional coffee prices have a major influence on the benefits for certified farmers. The share of producers' price on the final retail price is substantially lower in certified than in conventional chains. Differences in final farm income, transparency and information flows also depend on the cooperative's structure and management. Using certification to add value is not benefiting producers as expected due to information asymmetry, governance issues in cooperatives and long chain structures in consuming countries causing high transaction costs. In order to improve farmer's livelihoods in Nicaragua, policy measures should rather address business knowledge of producers and cooperatives as well as access to credits and extension in order to increase productivity of the coffee production.

New capabilities and new tools are emerging. The observations drawn from experiments allow categorizing them. We then propose an approach that could help companies to start activities inside these new environments of collaborative work. The cross fertilizing insights between the virtual and the real world are shown and introduced as the bridge. The 3D economy process is based on shorter cycles of decision making processes. The 'bridge model' integrates the added value chain and goes beyond it with the creation of outlying clustered values. The bridge mechanism shows a spectrum from low potential to high potential areas - of fulfillments. A company strategy may explain a positioning on one or the other limits of the spectrum.

J	Dev, NK; Swami, S; Caprihan, R				Dev, Navin K.; Swami, Sanjeev; Caprihan, Rahul			A discrete dynamic programming approach towards optimal outsourcing policy in supply chain management	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Supply chain management; Outsourcing; Decision making; Production management; Productive capacity		Purpose - As global markets become more customer oriented, rapid response rates are now often among the most important metrics in business. To achieve the required agility, many companies are forced to take decisions of whether to vertically integrate a value chain or to outsource some of its operations. The purpose of this paper is to develop a sequential decision modeling process to enable determination of optimal outsourcing policy decisions with respect to the variables such as warehouse inventory, in-house manufacturing capacity and the ordering cost to the outsource supplier. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a discrete dynamic programming-based modeling framework is developed for analyzing outsourcing policies for supply chain management problems. Specifically, the assumed situation entails a dynamic decision between in-house production vis-a-vis outsourcing, which is contingent upon several factors such as demand during the period under consideration, available inventory, available production capacity of the firm, ordering cost to the outsourced supplier and the fixed capital cost of machine capacity enhancement. Findings - The framework enables the determination of a time-based outsourcing policy, which is a prescription regarding: the optimum quantities to be produced in-house vs those to be outsourced, and the level of capacity to be set in each period.

J	Harris, DL; Twomey, DF				Harris, Drew; Twomey, Daniel			The enterprise perspective: a new mind-set for competitiveness and sustainability	COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW			English	Article						Sustainable development; Corporate social responsibility; Enterprise economics; Competitive strategy		Purpose - The purposr of this paper is to introduce a new perspective on the organization's role, purpose, and relationships, both within and among organizations, that holds the promise of more ecologically sustainable and economically competitive business practices. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyzes critiques of the current corporate perspective of organizations and builds upon Roome's framework for sustainable management to articulate a new model for organizational relationships that engage value-chain members in an enterprise-based competitiveness model. The paper offers examples to illustrate the potential of the new model. Findings - The new model requires a shift in the mind-set of executives and major shareholders, but that shift holds the theoretical potential to improve long-term competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Practical implications - The enterprise perspective model (EPM) holds the promise of improving competitive strength for firms and reducing negative environmental impacts from their operations. Executives who have embraced this model also find renewed energy and sense of purpose in their work. Originality/value - This paper introduces the EPM and provides a framework for thinking about the assumptions and practices that need to change to move from the corporation perspective model to the EPM. The paper raises important research questions about implementing the EPM.

Often there is a price differential based on the suitability of a variety for use in a defined end product or quality. This provides a need for the ability to accurately identify varieties right through the value chain and for the ability to breed for quality to provide a competitive advantage. In this chapter the different methods for variety identification will be discussed, as will research into the genetic basis of quality which provides molecular markers that can be used to assist in breeding for quality.

J	Hurst, JL; Niehm, LS; Park, S				Hurst, Jessica L.; Niehm, Linda S.; Park, Sunhee			Conversion Intentions of Fashion Marketing Interns: The Impact of Work-related Attitudes and Behaviors	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL FASHION MARKETING			English	Article						Fashion marketing internships; Supervisory support; Job satisfaction; Psychological contracts; Affective organizational commitment	ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT; PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS; ROLE STRESS; ANTECEDENTS; CONSEQUENCES; METAANALYSIS; SOCIALIZATION; SUPERVISOR; TURNOVER	Fashion marketing/retailing is a major employment sector and driver of economic activity on a global level. Michael Porter's (1985) popular value chain perspective demonstrates the importance of marketing and retail sales among a set of primary value creating activities for firms of all types. The value chain perspective also illuminates the importance of human resources as a support activity necessary to create value and assure the success of the firm. This research addresses the potential value for fashion marketing/retailing firms that may be achieved through employee development practices such as offering pre-professional internships. We focus on college students' perceptions of fashion marketing/retail-related internships d the factors that cause interns to accept a job offer upon internship completion. This study specifically examines relationships between internship experiential components of psychological contracts, supervisory support, affective organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Unlike other industry sectors, retailing is not limited to a specific region and thus provides job opportunities for fashion and retail degree graduates on a nearly global scale. ("Future Employment in Retail." 2009) In fashion maketing/retailing, there continues to be a high level of job attractiveness on the part of students, yet an observed disconnect exists between student career goals, expectations, and resulting job satisfaction. In reality, there is a much larger scope of opportunity in fashion related retail than just positions on the sales floor. Students must therefore obtain exposure through their courses and other types of learning, such as internships and practicum experiences, to realize the diversity of job opportunities in fashion marketing/retailing including sales, buying, logistics, product development, merchandising, finance, human resources, and more ("Get Tailor-Made Training.." 2006). Additionally, many positions in fashion retailing are increasingly becoming cross-functional, suggesting that students need to have a complete understanding of the contemporary marketplace and be exposed to a variety of job settings and experiences ("Retail Rewards" 2006). This research is framed by psychological contract theory (Rousseau 2000) and organizational commitment theory (Van Maanen 1975). Psychological contract theory combines employer-based beliefs (i.e. employer obligations) with individual-based beliefs (i.e. employee obligations) regarding the nature of an agreement and the relationship between that individual and his/her employer. Combining perceptions of employer-based obligations with employee obligations allows for an ideal assessment of specific idiosyncratic information that is meaningful and unique to each individual, as well as the firm (Robinson, Kraatz and Rousseau 1994). Organizational socialization theory explains how newcomers learn the culture and values of new job settings (Van Maanen 1975). The theory also explicates how newcomers must develop the necessary work skills and adjust to the work environment (Feldman 1976). An on-line, self-administered, survey questionnaire was used to collect data in this study. The final sample consisted of 229 college students who completed a fashion merchandising, fashion marketing, fashion design, or retail-related internship. Following verification of the reliability of the measurement items, path analysis was conducted. A proposed path model of internship conversion was estimated using AMOS 5.0 statistical software. A modified final model showed that six paths were statistically significant and had positive path coefficients, as hypothesized. Hypothesis H1a stated that interns' supervisory support will have a positive effect on psychological contract expectations of employer obligations. Path analysis results of the final model revealed full support for this hypothesized relationship. Positive and significant results were also found for hypotheses H2a and H2b, indicating that when interns feel that their internship employer fulfills the expected obligations they are more satisfied with their job and will remain with their internship company because they want to stay. Hypothesis 3a proposed that interns' job satisfaction would have a positive effect on affective organizational commitment. This hypothesis was supported suggesting that interns' satisfaction with the job/work itself significantly contributes to their strong sense of attachment with the organization because their internship has proven to be a satisfying experience. Positive and significant results were also found for hypothesis H3b, indicating that job satisfaction can directly influence interns' intent to accept an offer for full-time employment upon graduation. Finally, in hypothesis H4, positive and significant results were found, implying that interns' desire to remain with the company because they feel a sense of attachment and belonging to the organization (affective organizational commitment) plays a significant role in their decision to ultimately accept a job offer from their internship company upon graduation. Findings of the current study are particularly relevant to fashion marketing companies as they develop and structure internship programs in an attempt to increase the number of interns who accept an offer. For fashion marketing firms, since our results indicate that affective organizational commitment and job satisfaction are direct predictors of conversion intentions, some strategies that could provide augmentation of internship conversion and maximize the possibility of a successful internship program include: 1) Treat interns as a part of the organizational team and invite them to staff meetings, 2) Involve interns in project planning and ask for their ideas or suggestions, 3) Hold interns accountable for projects and deadlines, 4) Assign projects that are challenging, yet accomplishable, 5) Assign a supervisor or mentor to each intern to provide the necessary guidance, training, and feedback, and 6) Establish a process for permanent hire considerations and share that information with interns.

J	Posayanant, S; Chareonngam, C				Posayanant, Suchanya; Chareonngam, Chotchai			Prototype KPIs for rural infrastructure development The practice of sub-district local governments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Local government; Quality indicators; Performance management; Critical success factors; Value chain; Thailand		Purpose - It is difficult to manage and measure the effectiveness of infrastructure development efforts of the sub-district local governments called Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs), the lowest level of local governments in Thailand. This paper aims to develop and demonstrate the applicability of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on the integration of balanced scorecard (BSC) and value chain approaches. Design/methodology/approach - The processes of designing KPIs are described with emphasis of how to apply a value chain model into designing BSC's KPIs. Expert focus groups and case studies from various parts of Thailand were conducted to give an insight into the adaptation of the performance measures in infrastructure development of TAOs. Findings - The application of a value chain model is critical for the design of practical BSC's KPIs because they can be conveniently embedded into existing practices. The case studies of prototype KPIs demonstrate the performance measurement of infrastructure development, which associates executive and operational views with the hierarchy of scorecards. Practical implications - The prototype KPIs illustrate a quantifiable measure that the councils and staffs can use to communicate infrastructure development performance for target setting and accomplishment. Originality/value - This paper addresses the key issue of how to design KPIs based on the balanced scorecard and value chain model. The integration of a value chain framework reflects the delivery process of infrastructure development.

I discuss the sources in the literature that guided my teaching and research, the theories and key concepts that helped me in finding new ways to approach marketing and market problems and I share the highlights of my field experience in developing countries with the reader to illustrate the development in my thinking in this field. The conclusion is that it is unlikely that a single approach can deal with all problems, but researchers should rather choose a context dependent perspective in their analysis. I end this essay with the recommendation to pay more attention to the roles and functions of entrepreneurs and institutions as key forces that shape markets. I propose to broaden the scope of performance measurement by covering a broader part of the sustainability concept rather than using financial performance only.

J	Goodrum, A				Goodrum, Alison			True Brits? Authoring National Identity in Anglo-Japanese Fashion Exports	FASHION THEORY-THE JOURNAL OF DRESS BODY & CULTURE			English	Article						backstage performance; bricolage; Britishness; fashion exports; geographical imagination; Mulberry; national identity; Paul Smith		This article employs the cases of two luxury fashion retailers, Mulberry and Paul Smith, to examine the export of British goods and British identities to Japan. Anglo-Japanese trade cannot only be rationalized in economic terms. Rather, the article argues for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interrelationships between the economic, cultural, and symbolic within these transactions and the ways that contested representations of Britishness are inscribed across them. It is asserted that these complex relationships are evident throughout the length and breadth of the fashion commodity chain, with constructions of Britishness being inscribed at manifold points along it. As such, the article reveals that Anglo-British exports-and the visions of Britishness bound up in them-are the sum of many parts and players, and that these players inhabit the under-researched "backstage" regions of the fashion system beyond the marketing discourses, which have tended to constitute the prime subject of previous studies.

J	Ramioul, M; Huws, U				Ramioul, Monique; Huws, Ursula			THE SNOWBALL EFFECT: GLOBAL SOURCING AS AN ACCELERATOR OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION	JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH			English	Article							VALUE CHAINS	Drawing on case studies of the strategies of global providers of outsourced business services, this article argues that the concept of offshore outsourcing is no longer adequate to describe the current restructuring of global value chains. Practices of global sourcing, moving up the value chain, following the customer, and following the sun have led to a process whereby a new breed of multinational business-services supplier, growing rapidly through transfers of personnel, acquisitions, and mergers, is both a result of past outsourcing and relocation and a driver of further globalization of information technology (IT) and business-service employment. The implications are far-reaching for both employment and regional development.

J	Reginato, JM				Reginato, Justin			EVALUATING PROJECT ROBUSTNESS THROUGH THE LENS OF THE BUSINESS MODEL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Business models; very large projects; project management		The success of large-scale innovative projects is increasingly a function of the marriage of multiple complex technologies and the ability to articulate and capture economic benefits. For corporations, the decision to pursue particular projects often hinges on the creation of, or the ability to appropriate, requisite technologies in a manner that will allow for an adequate return on investment for project shareholders. The business model is a tool that can be used to help determine whether or not a project has the necessary components for successful completion. A business model articulates a business venture's value proposition, market segment, cost and profit structure, value chain, value network, and competitive strategy. While business models are commonly used at the corporate level, they can also be applied to projects in order to convey how the potential of multiple converging technological inputs lead to the creation of sustainable economic value outputs, often in the face of technical and market uncertainty. Empirical observations from the biopharmaceutical and aerospace industries reveal that projects with incomplete business models face considerable complications, while projects with complete business models face less difficulty with respect to execution. As such, companies can use business models as a tool for making project go/no go decisions whereby only projects with complete business models are allowed to progress through the development process.

J	Aarseth, W; Sorhaug, HC				Aarseth, Wenche; Sorhaug, Hans Christian			Improving business performance in multi-company projects through 'cooperative power': presentation of a collaborative tool model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business strategy; business performance management; strategic alliances; project management; stakeholder performance; stakeholder relationship; collaboration; partnerships		Increasing global competition drives most industries to search for competitive advantages and continuous process improvement. Through a three-year research project we found that the competitive advantage of multi-company projects lies in the ability to make a shift from the competitiveness and performance of the autonomous firm to the competitiveness and performance of the value chain of firms. Nearly all important indicators and measurements of profit and efficiency were linked to the performance of the firm and the traditional business worldview strongly emphasises competitive power. There is little mention of the flip side of the coin, which is cooperative power. The purpose of this paper is to improve business performance in projects by understanding the concept 'cooperative power' and what conditions influence projects organisational problems. As we found no literature on how to practically implement cooperative power, we developed a practical model which companies can use in projects in the future to improve performance. The empirical results are based on an extensive literature study, interviews, project presentations and focus group work in 14 companies.

The Community Context of Evolving Industry Architecture	JOURNAL OF MARKETING CHANNELS			English	Article						community ecology; food sector; industry architecture; Ireland; United Kingdom; wholesaling		The transformation of industries and industry architectures is approached through a community evolution analysis of two closely related value chains. A longitudinal multilevel data set on the consumer food value chains in Britain and Ireland is analyzed. The analysis highlights the central role of coevolution between members of the value-chain communities, including the related institutional context. Commensalism is explored through its constituent processes of competition and cooperation. Both are seen to act powerfully in shaping change and transformation. The divergence between the two value chains studied bears out the basic evolutionary premise that evolution is constructed, not determined by generic processes.

J	Rivera, WM				Rivera, William M.			Production and Beyond: A Defining Moment for Public Sector Extension	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION			English	Article								Two imperatives form the basis of the present paper. The first is the market-driven imperative, vital to production and value-chain development. The second is the knowledge imperative, central to the advancement of human capacity and institutional development. In view of these two imperatives, this paper argues for overhaul in extension toward a market orientation and for greater public investment in human resource development for modernizing the agricultural extension workforce. Part one of the paper reviews the rationale for market-driven extension and compares two key market-driven strategies. Part two proposes changes and new investment in post-secondary agricultural education and training, and calls for the establishment of a network of post-secondary agricultural education and training institutions. A post-secondary educational network is seen as essential to better prepare the agricultural extension workforce to face challenges in production and marketing and beyond with respect to alternative programs such as agriculturally related urban, environmental, energy, and rural development priorities.

Aligning Performance: The End of Personnel and the Beginning of Guided Skilled Performance	MANAGEMENT REVUE			English	Article						SHRM; cognitive neuroscience; performance management	CONTEXTUAL FACTORS; GOAL; RESOURCES; COMPETENCE; MODEL	For almost twenty years researchers have predicted the end of personnel as HRM practices increasingly became a line management function. However, while useful for describing shifts in human resource responsibilities, this practice-based view obscures the fundamental strategic reason for this shift - executive demands for effective means to manage performance. This paper contributes a new approach for HRM that may better predict which current practices will be most successful and suggests the characteristics of new practices that may be developed using an example of goalsetting and performance appraisal. The theory includes a model of human performance based on recent advances in cognitive neuroscience that suggests HRM may fulfill a strategic role by reestablishing its core competence as specialists in industrial psychology who create systems for guiding skilled performance. We conclude by proposing a measure that assesses the link between performance and customer perceived value across the value chain, thereby demonstrating the return on investment in human resources.

J	Paloviita, A; Jarvi, P				Paloviita, Ari; Jarvi, Pentti			Environmental value chain management of laundry detergents in the use phase	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES			English	Article						Consumption; environmental impacts; Finnish households; overdosing; value chain management		Environmental value chain management is concerned with the environmental aspects of products and services along the whole value chain, from raw material and energy acquisition to waste management. The use phase in the value chain remains an understudied subject, despite considerable consumption-related environmental impacts. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the use phase of laundry detergents in households. Our empirical data consist of interviews in the laundry rooms of 299 Finnish households. Consumers' environmental awareness, use of dosage measuring devices and actual doses of laundry detergents are studied in the empirical part of the study. The results show that consumers do not perceive households as significant polluters, the measuring devices they use are diverse and the number of 'heavy users' is high in all detergent brands. It is concluded that in the consumption of laundry detergents, consumers do not perceive environmental issues as specific value criteria in relation to the use of laundry detergents. Manufacturers, marketers and other actors in the value chain of laundry detergents could contribute to alleviating the harmful environmental impacts of the use phase by more effective consumer education and better product design. For consumers, it might be beneficial to adopt eco-efficiency thinking in their daily consumption.

We combine insights from two perspectives, the global commodity chain approach and the new regionalism. The focus on both institutional setting and interfirm relationships is essential in regions undergoing rapid change. In the article we also use Burt's concept of structural holes and the idea of a competence-difficulty gap to examine the nature of relationships within networks of firms, arguing that global integration can be viewed as a bridging process. The evidence comes from surveys and fieldwork conducted between 1997 and 2004, providing a longitudinal analysis of the same firms. Among other findings, we show that the difficulty of doing business locally may make relationships more stable. With respect to industrial structure, international subcontracting and joint-venture arrangements enable technological modernization in assembly and parts of preassembly, but also result in the demise of high-value added competences.

J	Velkar, A				Velkar, Aashish			Caveat emptor: Abolishing public measurements, standardizing quantities, and enhancing market transparency in the London coal trade c1830	ENTERPRISE & SOCIETY			English	Article							PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH; LIMITATION; INDUSTRY; POWER; VEND; COST	This article evaluates efforts to standardize quantities in the London coal trade c1830, and traces the end of the public measurement system first introduced in the fourteenth century. Increasing traffic in coal, reduction of taxes on the commodity, inefficient public meters, etc., contributed to the demise of public measurements. This outcome was the result of extensive negotiations between merchants, the various levels of state bureaucracy, and the parliament. Switching measurement standards was difficult, if not costly, to coordinate. Abolishing public measurements and switching from volume to weight measurements was part of the efforts to strengthen governance along the commodity chain, secure property rights by making quantities predictable and alter a mechanism that powerful merchants considered had become inappropriate.

J	Nadkarni, S				Nadkarni, Sanjay			DEFINING THE ICT4D PLUS PRO-POOR TOURISM CONVERGENCE SPACE: SYNERGIES FOR NATURAL ALLIES IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON POVERTY	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						pro-poor tourism; information & communication technology; development; sustainability		This paper brings into focus the convergence space between information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) and pro-poor tourism (PPT). On the basis of a literature review on each of these vectors, the synergies that can be derived and channeled into development interventions in economically disadvantaged geographies with 'tourismisable' assets are discussed. The need for a structured research agenda to inform such interventions in this convergence space is emphasized. A conceptual framework encompassing the principal constituents of the e-tourism value chain within this space is proposed and critical success factors are identified. From the perspective of sustainability, stakeholder responsibilities across the value chain are examined and a case for nurturing entrepreneurship in grassroots tourism entities is made. Compatibility of the proposed framework with dominant constructs in development theory is discussed.

J	Assimakopoulos, D; Yan, J				Assimakopoulos, D.; Yan, Jie			An innovative model of a computer-mediated professional community: China Software Developer Net	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business model; computer-mediated; customer integration; organisation model; virtual community	KNOWLEDGE; BUSINESS; NETWORKS	The emergence of computer-mediated communities rises from people's needs to gather and participate in informal public spaces in everyday life and their primordial wish to look for a sense of 'community'. Internet service providers set up privately owned platforms in the internet and people join in voluntarily for sharing information about the specific topics of their common interest. Using a case study approach, we present in this paper the organisation and business model of China Software Developer Net, one of the most successful virtual professional communities in China, with more than one million members in early 2006. We discuss how the community platform was designed to build up a dynamic communication environment facilitating information sharing and enhancing community cohesion. In particular, we highlight the underlying business model showing how the community service operator makes use of the CSDN virtual community to build up a diversified business portfolio, making this virtual community the core component of its value chain and generating sustainable revenues from multiple sources.

Compared to plain areas an unequal evolution due to different potentials in production and changing demands of society can be observed. Traditionally dairy production was the most important sector of agriculture in most mountainous areas. As a result of environmental changes and the along going trends towards different sectors of production the question arises, which should be the future characteristics of the value chain in dairy production. The net product of the dairy production is not very rewarding. Public-opinion polls are showing a clear preference for a producing and competitive agriculture. The section of production as such is of lower relevance. The following two major lines of impact for the milk value chain based on the development potentials can be deflected: Processing regions realizing high net products with specialities of high quality and delivery regions with relatively low disadvantages in dairy costs thanks to a high milk density.

We attempt to isolate and compare the unit remuneration of workers relative to unit value added at the lowest tier of the chain as a measure of income share. These income shares are not adequate to move home-based workers above the poverty line.

J	McKenzie, B; Merrilees, B				McKenzie, Brent; Merrilees, Bill			Retail value chains: extension and development into transition economies Stockmann in Estonia and Latvia	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Retail management; Value chain; Qualitative research; Estonia; Latvia	PERCEPTIONS; QUALITY; INTERNATIONALIZATION; SATISFACTION; MODEL; FIRM	Purpose - In the area of international retail expansion the most challenging issues that firms struggle with are: which countries to expand to; which order to do it and what are the retail drivers that can be readily exported to the new market versus which have to be market specific? The purpose of this paper is to look at one specific retailer and review how they have addressed these questions. Design/methodology/approach - The approach used is based around a case study of the expansion of the Stockmann department store into Estonia and Latvia. Using the findings of empirical research, qualitative and quantitative, the research shows how Stockmann has both built upon and exported its original home strengths while also focusing on which drivers had to be tailored to the local marketplace. Findings - The case study found that there are some differences between the performances of Stockmann across the two Baltic countries, but the level of performance is quite high in most areas of retail operations. This supports the position that a multinational can successfully expand in diverse markets. In other words, although there are minor issues, on balance the regional versus country specific issues have been substantially resolved. Even national issues like skilled labour shortages and developing good practices for handling returns have been resolved at a medium level. Areas for improvement were in pricing and handling merchandise returns. Research limitations/implications - The findings are limited to one case study, of one retailer, and the fact that the study was over a defined period. This is a general limitation of case studies, but the use of multiple research methods, and methodologies helped to strengthen the research findings and interpretations. Practical implications - This study has presented the retail value chain as a model consisting of three main drivers: service; retail operations and country of origin aspects. The three constructs were found to be valid representations, enabling an assessment of a retailer's performance in multiple countries. The lessons drawn indicate that a business model used in the home country can be a powerful integrating and controlling tool for managing the multinational expansion, but that there is also a need to include consumer perceptions and evaluations of retailer performance. These operational measures continue to represent one of the best sources of data in understanding a retailer's performance, in both developed and converging countries such as Estonia and Latvia. Originality/value - This paper presents a useful case study of a retailer that has expanded from its home base into a number of countries, all of which fall into the category of transition economies, and adds to the literature covering expansion into transition economies, which is a little known field in Baltic journal of Management terms of the expansion of one's value chain or value proposition	[McKenzie, Brent] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Merrilees, Bill] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia		McKenzie, B (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.	bmckenzi@uoguelph.ca					ALEXANDER N, 2004, INT MARKET REV, V17, P334; Alexander N., 1990, INT MARKET REV, V7; Arnold S., 2002, INT J RETAIL DISTRIB, V30, P562, DOI DOI 10.1108/09590550210449412; Berman B., 2001, RETAIL MANAGEMENT ST; BOYM S, 1994, MYTHOLOGIES EVERYDAY; BRUNING ER, 1997, INT MARKET REV, V14, P59; Buckley PJ, 1998, J INT BUS STUD, V29, P21, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490023; Burt S., 2002, INT REV RETAIL DISTR, V12, P191; CARDOZO RN, 1965, J MARKETING RES, V2, P244, DOI 10.2307/3150182; Caruana A., 2002, EUR J MARKETING, V36, P811, DOI DOI 10.1108/03090560210430818; Coe NM, 2004, ENVIRON PLANN A, V36, P1571, DOI 10.1068/a36241; Cronbach LJ, 1951, PSYCHOMETRIKA, V16, P297; Currah Andrew, 2003, INT REV RETAIL DISTR, V13, P221, DOI DOI 10.1080/0959396032000101336; Dawson J, 2001, BRIT J MANAGE, V12, P253, DOI 10.1111/1467-8551.00209; Dawson J., 2003, INT RETAILING ASIA, P189; Dawson J.

J	Morgado, A				Morgado, Andre			Logoplaste: innovation in the global market From packaging to solution	MANAGEMENT DECISION			English	Article						Innovation; International marketing; Plastics; Packaging; Portugal		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a case that looks at how an innovative plastics packaging company in Portugal integrates itself into the value chain of company clients. The pedagogical objectives are: to present a success case in technological, processes and business innovation; to present a success case in business strategy, based on the build-up of partnerships; and to construct a platform for discussion of a first mover strategy, and precautions to be taken in its pursuit. Design/methodology/approach - A range of evidence, including primary and secondary data, was used in the writing of this case, namely: direct observation, interviewing, press releases and press cuttings, annual reports, customer records and organization charts. Findings - Logoplaste has gained a leadership position and has successfully managed to achieve a relevant position in the international landscape by seeking a vertical integration of its activities, in order to obtain a better value proposal for its clients, which, at the same time, allows it to capture a part of that value for itself. This practice has permitted this company not only to grow overseas but also to reveal a customer loyalty performance of 100 per cent. These results are deeply connected with their innovative value proposal, e.g. product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation and business model innovation. Originality/value - This study provides insights into the nature of a company, which has successfully developed its activity based on a strong investment in innovation since its genesis. Logoplaste's strategy can be considered distinctive as it combines and integrates the following strategic vectors: integration of the client's logistical and value chains, based on a process of partnership developments; investing in R&D of packaging engineering, with the offer of an, "vend-to-end" solution; and production process based on a "wall-to-wall" model.

J	Richardson, AJ				Richardson, Alan J.			Organizational Founding, Strategic Renewal, and the Role of Accounting: Management Accounting Concepts in the Formation of the "Penny Post''	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						strategic renewal; Penny Post; Rowland Hill; post office reform		Organizational strategies, processes, and procedures may become institutionalized during the early history of an organization, leading to dysfunctional rigidities when the environment changes. The postal system worldwide is under significant pressure to change its business model, including rescinding the provision of universal service and uniform pricing, as the posts are privatized and opened to competition. Cost accounting has become a key mechanism to achieve reform in the postal system. But is the introduction of a cost-based logic new to the design of post office reforms? Were the core policies of the post office originally developed without reference to cost? This paper analyzes the key document in the creation of the current postal business model: Rowland Hill's (1837) "Post Office Reform: Its Importance and Practicability.'' The pamphlet shows a basic understanding of economic concepts including the elasticity of demand and opportunity costs as well as implementing practical accounting techniques that we now call value chain analysis, cost behavior analysis, activity-based costing and activity-based management, and target costing. This paper provides an analysis of Hill's logic from the perspective of current management accounting techniques and terminology. It illustrates the use of management accounting in the reformation of social institutions and provides a rare example of the early decision-making use of management accounting concepts.

The arrangement of proper process's path that reflect strategic aim and eliminating not value added processes is the problem of many companies to achieve high level of efficiency. The increasing product value and enterprise efficiency is sought-after strategy in the rapid changed and competitive market environment through lack of satisfying profit rate and sale/income volume. But enterprises may bear excess expenditures that are inappropriate to created value and in this way to lower efficiency of capital and assets. In the paper are shown results of study of controlling effectiveness as a tool which allow integrate improving company's efficiency and product value at the target market. The company has to integrate shaping his processes and resources to achieve high efficiency at the determined product value. The calculation of key company indicators and pointing their determined value are not enough in a lot of enterprise cases. There is necessary active support of processes management in supply chains. But in many enterprises controlling of efficiency is made by accounting or financial controlling departments which aren't using methods and tools to actively shaping processes and assets.

J	Collins, J				Collins, Jane			The rise of a global garment industry and the Reimagination of worker solidarity	CRITIQUE OF ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						apparel industry; commodities; community unionism; moral economy; Taylorism		In 1996, Bill Roseberry published an article in American Anthropologist entitled 'The Rise of Yuppie Coffees and the Reimagination of Class in the United States'. In it, he explored the connections that linked the rise of specialty coffees marketed at Zabars and Starbucks to new class configurations of consumerism in the US and to new production arrangements in the coffee-producing countries. The article seeks to apply this approach to the analysis of another commodity chain: that of apparel. It explains how recent changes in the global apparel industry are shaped by power and experienced by workers and consumers. It seeks to bridge the divide between industrialized and developing nations by showing the commonalities (as well as differences) experienced by the industry's workers in the US and abroad. And it shows how global production patterns have given rise to global resistance strategies, as workers forge bonds with social movements outside of the factory and develop transnational alliances. In the spirit of Roseberry's work, this account seeks to meld cultural analysis with political economy, and to attend to historical contingency, without losing sight of corporate and state power.

This article reports on the meeting highlights. Deep-water exploration has become increasingly important over the last three decades. For the deep-water environment to be economically viable, these accumulations need to be both volumetrically significant and capable of maintaining high production rates. Largely independent of the rise in crude oil price, there has been an increasing number of economically viable deep-water discoveries, where the resource base now exceeds 100 billion bbl oil equivalent. A significant percentage of this resource is heavy oil, with heavy oil dominating the resource base in such settings as offshore Mexico and Brazil. Economic success in both exploration and commercialization requires integration across disciplines as well as across the value chain, integrating the upstream, midstream, and downstream operations. Basin models were commonly used as the integration tool for exploration programs.

J	Singh, NP				Singh, N. P.			ERP Implementation Based on ASP Model	GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article								In this article the author reviewes ASP ERPs, ERP implementations based on the ASP model during 2000-05 with respect to generations, categories and types of ASPs, pricing models and trend analysis. Based on a critical analysis of facts, it has been seen that ASP implementations are very specific to the user industry, to the region, to the features of the ERP product, to the needs of the organization and to the criticality of the application to the organization. The author tested these hypotheses based on case analysis. Further he studied pricing models and cost of implementation in the long run. It was seen that implementation strategies do not effect the cost of implementation since the value chain is long and each chain has its own structure. In fact, it is specific to an organization and vendors.	[Singh, N.

The main motivation is the lack of repeatable measurable methods and techniques for extracting business process decomposition. Design/methodology/approach - A step-by-step methodology for extracting business process models is provided. This methodology is called "the V methodology" because of its approach to break down the enterprise through a functional hierarchy and then collecting it up again via its process decomposition. Porter's value chain model is noticed as a powerful tool to complete the roadmap. The paper is designed using sections: benefits and necessities of having such a methodology, terminology, the V methodology, learned lessons and further work. Findings - Success stories using the V methodology expressing its impact on quality business process models are mentioned. Experts find it useful to gain unified process models as well as helping them to discover gaps, bottlenecks and redundancies amongst business processes. Research limitations/implications - It is too hard to receive reliable information about previous experiences from the working companies in the area. Practical implications - The main implications found when using the V methodology are: practiced analysts feel it dangerous to their position, younger analysts use it as the only source of modeling and people find it difficult to apply Porter's model in practice. Originality/value - Almost all of the previous papers refer to modeling notations when using the term "methodology". This paper instead describes the process of business process modeling. Another original value of the paper would be using Porter's model to classify the processes within their right process groups.

J	Foster, T				Foster, Tim			Into the depths of the I-E-I framework: using the internet to create value in supply-chain relationships	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						internet; intranets; extranets; worldwide web; value chain	WEB SITES; BUSINESS; COMMUNICATION; INTRANETS; EXTRANETS; COMPANIES; DESIGN; MODEL	Purpose - The paper seeks to provide a better understanding of how industrial (B2B) organizations use their web sites as a marketing communication tool to create value through their supply (value) chain relationships. Design/methodology/approach - A review of previous studies on B2B web sites results in the development of the "I-E-I (internet-extranet-intranet) framework", with three research questions focusing on how each of the three levels of the I-E-I framework can be described. Via these research questions the framework is tested empirically over a ten-month period in an industrial (B2B) web site setting. A qualitative, case study approach is used utilizing multiple sources of evidence. Findings - It was found that in order to make online (communication) efforts more effective throughout the value chain, an inside-out communication strategy is needed by the organization. Each level seems to have primary versus secondary stakeholders in terms of the access to and interaction with the web site level in which they are interacting. Overall, it was found that the deeper one went into the I-E-I framework, the more value that was created and that such value was both provided to and received from both the organization and the stakeholder. Originality/value - The I-E-I framework developed in this study introduces a framework that can be tested empirically, discussed and debated in other settings and provide a springboard for more in-depth studies on value creation in B2B web sites for both scholars and practitioners.

Transforming the Government Value Chain: Emerging Business Models and Enabling Technologies	TRENDS IN SUPPLY CHAIN DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT: TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODOLOGIES	Springer Series in Advanced Manufacturing		English	Article; Book Chapter							GOVERNANCE	The aim of this chapter is to present a structured study of the e-government phenomenon by implementing a holistic research approach which starts by identifying and declaring the importance of strategic issues such as vision and mission statements, followed by the determination of the e-government strategic value chain and the presentation of traditional e-business models and their application in the e-government context. Next, a detailed examination of the available information and communication technologies (ICT) frameworks to support the government supply chain, as found in the literature, is executed and an IT framework is proposed followed by a series of discussions related to the most important technology oriented issues that are found in the literature. Finally, based on an extended literature review of e-government projects around the globe, a series of selected case studies categorized by stage of government transformation is presented.

J	Tuomi, K				Tuomi, Krista			Organisational shifts in the feature film industry: implications for South Africa	TRANSFORMATION-CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article								The last few years have proved turbulent for the international film industry. A wave of merger and acquisition activity has allowed the large entertainment companies to exert influence over the film value chain and raise entry barriers. At the same time there has been an organisational shift away from hierarchical production to a looser network structure wherein companies act as financing and distribution hubs, mobilising resources from outside. Although this has meant greater flexibility and lower overheads, it has also made assembling resources more problematic. These trends have important implications for South Africa, both threatening and opening up opportunities for the local film industry. This article looks at the current status and structure of the sector in an attempt to determine the implications of the international trends. It suggests that in this new arena, competitiveness is increasingly reliant on ease of contracting; audience development and effective distribution. As such, it reviews ways in which both the public and the private sector can help develop the responsiveness necessary for long-term growth.

J	Macfarlane, AS				Macfarlane, AS			Establishing a new metric for mineral resource management	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article								Mineral resource management (MRM) practice has developed in South Africa over the course of the last ten years, with the purpose of integrating previously isolated technical functions into a value chain aligned, process organization, responsible for mine planning and optimization. The implementation of MRM within various companies has met with varying degrees of success, often resulting in incremental improvements in the planning process and, conversely, often becoming the scapegoat for poor delivery on plans and projects. The reason for this has been, amongst others, a lack of a suitable metric to define the success rate of MRM in the business at hand, in terms of its contribution to the bottom fine. This paper is the result of extensive research by the author into this subject, which has resulted in the conclusion that economic value added is an appropriate measure that will lead to real optimization and value creation in mining companies, if applied within a new, holistic model.

The study reveals some important indications for future EU organisation and coordination of e-Government research activities. The study outlined the fact that the organisation of EU e-Government research should be better linked along the value chain of research (between basic/theoretical, applied, development and review research). The results of the study also indicate that links between eGovernment research and policy should be made more explicit. E-Government research innovations are positioned in a political environment, where research results could bring innovative eGovernment implementation which would support public value as its ultimate goal, through increased efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, the results of the study highlight a number of organisational research challenges such as: the need for more cooperation, collaboration and networking between stakeholders; the opportunity to build synergies in research across public sectors in a truly interdisciplinary way and between different public stakeholders (i.e. along with e-Health, e-Learning, etc.) and the private sector.

Meanwhile, their differences are compared. Design/methodology/approach - In the research, the EM strategies adopted by enterprises in free markets from the value-chain perspective are discussed first. Then, in-depth interviews with enterprises in controlled markets are followed. Findings - The effect on corporations' marketing effectiveness is rather limited because fewer competitors resulted in little competition and more monopolization in a controlled market. Also, the buyer focuses on product quality without a high awareness of the concept of cost. Practical implications - The results indicate that there are differences in EM strategies adopted by enterprises in free and controlled markets from the value-chain perspective. Originality/value - Faced with the expanding internationalized markets, companies must carefully consider the operational modes and strategies of EMs.	[Fu, Hsin-Pin; Chang, Tien-Hsiang; Lee, Wan-I] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lu, Cheng-Chin] Ind Dev Bur, Minist Econ Affairs, Taipei, Taiwan		Fu, HP (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

They consist of the patient and wearable ECG sensor, network service, healthcare service, emergency service, and PKI service providers. To enhance the security level control for the patient's medical privacy, individual private and public keys should be stored on smart cards. All the patient and service providers in the proposed security control architecture should have suitable secure private and public keys to access medical data and diagnosis results with RFID/GPS tracking information for emergency service. By enforcing the requirements of necessary keys among the patient and service providers, the patient's ECG data can be protected and effectively controlled over the open medical directory service. Consequently, the proposed architecture for ubiquitous RFID healthcare system using the smart card terminal is appropriate to build up medical privacy policies in future ubiquitous sensor networking and home networking environments. In addition, we have analyzed an economic value-chain model based on the proposed architecture consisting of RFID, GPS, PDA, ECG sensor, and smart card systems in large-scale wireless sensor networks and have also derived customer needs in the proposed service architecture using the value-chain model. Therefore, we also conclude that the business and technology issues for the service providers should exist in the networks.

S	Wright, R		Choi, JJ; Click, RW		Wright, Roxana			SUCCESSFUL ADAPTATION STRATEGIES OF MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE	VALUE CREATION IN MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE	International Finance Review		English	Article; Book Chapter								The paper explores strategies of adaptation to the environment as employed by multinational corporations in Central and Eastern Europe. Organizations are treated as adaptive systems that have to match the complexity of their environments. The justification of the research lies in the complex nature of the market institutions emerging from transition that emphasizes the need for new managerial frameworks. Adaptive approaches such as vertical integration and/or value-chain development, leveraging autonomy and integration, local knowledge acquisition, and embedding in the social and political environment are explored in their relationship to success in the region.

The (ER)-R-2 project will help operators to better exploit their investments on infrastructures and terminals and ensure that the infrastructure will be flexible and reconfigurable to accommodate evolving standards, applications and the end-user needs. (ER)-R-2 is seen by many actors of the wireless industry as a core technology to enable the full potential of beyond 3G systems. It has the potential to revolutionize wireless just as the PC revolutionized computing. This paper presents the (ER)-R-2 research project, its architectural framework and approach, the main fields of investigations across the different technical workpackages in 2005, as well as the (ER)-R-2 Phase 2 project proposal ambitions (2006-2007).

J	Becchetti, L; Trovato, G				Becchetti, Leonardo; Trovato, Giovanni			The Determinants of Child Labour: The Role of Primary Product Specialization	LABOUR-ENGLAND			English	Article								The paper tests predictions of a traditional intra-household bargaining model which, under reasonable assumptions, shows that lack of bargaining power in the value chain significantly reduces the capacity for obtaining benefits from increased product demand arising from trade liberalization and therefore is positively associated with child labour. Cross-sectional and panel negative binomial estimates in a sample of emerging countries support this hypothesis. They show that proxies of domestic workers' bargaining power in the international division of labour (such as the share of primary product exports) are significantly related to child labour, net of the effect of traditional controls such as parental income, quality of education, international aid, and trade liberalization. The positive impact of the share of primary product exports on child labour outlines a potential paradox. The paradox suggests that trade liberalization does not always have straightforward positive effects on social indicators and that its short-run effects on income distribution and distribution of skills and market power across countries need to be carefully evaluated.

Its tremendous growth is a result of the convergence of many factors, including the pervasive increase in bandwidth to users, general affordability of multimedia-ready devices throughout the digital media value chain (creation, management, and distribution), growing ease and affordability of creating digital media content, and growing expectation of the value of digital media in enhancing traditional unstructured and structured information. However, while digital media content is being created and distributed at far greater amounts than ever before, significant technical challenges remain for realizing its full business potential. This paper examines some of the research challenges for industry towards harnessing the full value of digital media.

J	Wingren, T				Wingren, Tom			In search of value-creating activities: an empirical study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						activity-based costing; value chain analysis; management accounting; value-creating activities		The Value Chain (VC) method (Porter, 1985) was introduced approximately 20 years ago, yet even today there is only a limited amount of studies with empirical data. Today, in turbulent and unpredictable business conditions, it is essential for companies to recognise their value-creating activities and drivers for those. This paper examines value creation in view of the activities' effect on the profitability of the company. With the presented method, it is possible to divide the case organisation's most important value-creating activities into two clusters. The first cluster includes activities, which have only negative effects on the company's profitability, while the other activity cluster has only positive effects. The drivers for positive or negative value creation (profitability) are discussed together with the practical suggestions at the end of this paper.

J	Sim, NCS				Sim, NCS			International production sharing and economic development: moving up the value-chain for a small-open economy	APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS			English	Article								This study theoretically examines the factors required by a small-open economy to move up the value-chain. To carry out the study, a framework of production sharing involving a large developed country and a less developed small-open economy is used. Service bundles are modelled as inputs for coordinating the manufacturing activities located across the countries. It is found that the small-open economy can move up the value-chain when the size of its skilled labour force increases and the production cost of its service bundles decreases.

The information technology infrastructure (ITI) necessary to achieve these productivity improvements will come in the form of data integrated from multiple source systems throughout the mining value chain. Two pure approaches are available: supplier-controlled or operations controlled data structures; each strategy has its own advantages and disadvantages. Case studies involving the South African mining industry are used to demonstrate the advantages of using hybrid-controlled data structures. Depending on the level of operational control, new skills are also necessary to be learnt by mining professionals including: information engineering; creating consistent and quality data; and process improvement techniques that use the integrated data for improving the operation.

J	Milford, B				Milford, B			Improving the economic competitiveness of the Australian Sugar Industry	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL			English	Article								The Australian Sugar Industry is at present weathering a difficult period. Floods, drought, pests and diseases have reduced production and incomes are affected by low world sugar prices. The industry is putting in place initiatives to reduce costs and spread its range of products. At farm level, initiatives that are being taken up or considered are expansion of farm scale, new techniques for transfer of best practice and new farming systems involving controlled traffic, soy bean fallows and higher density planting. At the grower/miller interface, best practice harvesting can reduce loss, and harvest scheduling can increase sugar content by taking cane from throughout each region at the most appropriate time. Longer hours of harvest would improve capital utilisation. Although there is considerable activity in seeking opportunities in value adding, these appear limited. Ethanol is seen as the most likely diversification but its development will depend on government mandate. Other value adding proposals are discussed. The paper examines some of the constraints to these innovations and concludes that further development of a value chain approach win be beneficial in improving the Australian industry's competitiveness. Current approaches to adoption of the above ideas are discussed.

J	Stringer, CA				Stringer, CA			Rescaling the region: the integration of Hawkes Bay food and forestry industries into East Asia	AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER			English	Article						Hawkes Bay; commodity chains; East Asian food import complex; forestry complex; agro-food; horticultural complex	COMMODITY; CHAINS; TRADE	This paper explores the changing relationship of a region (Hawkes Bay, New Zealand), its industries and enterprises to Asia-Pacific industrial complexes. Land-based industries in Hawkes Bay provide examples of new connections and local adaptations of production to emerging agro-food and forestry complexes, centred upon East Asia. Integration into these complexes, which has only been possible in the context of the gradual relaxation of regulatory regimes that has occurred over the past two decades, has facilitated access to new markets. In some cases, integration is an outcome of East Asian ownership of New Zealand-based nodes along the commodity chain. In others, it is an outcome of New Zealand actors producing to meet 'site of consumption' demand. The paper concludes that new dynamics in the spheres of trade, production and investment are instituted by and feed into new geographic links and interactions, referred to in the paper as a rescaling of the region.

J	McCormick, D				McCormick, D			Value chains and the business system: Applying a simplified model to Kenya's garment industry	IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES			English	Article								Garment firms are typical of the poor state of Kenyan industry. Production has declined and, with it, employment. New investment is minimal, so firms are producing inefficiently using outdated equipment. Many larger firms have closed, while small and micro enterprises have proliferated. Only the tiny minority of enterprises that is capable of producing for export seems to be doing well. Why should this be so? And what can be done about it? To answer these questions, this article develops and applies a simple model that incorporates two theoretical perspectives: value-chain analysis and the business systems approach. The value-chain approach first enabled us to describe several distinct garment chains with production facilities in Kenya. It also highlighted the differences between these chains and enabled us to distinguish issues affecting each of the stages within a given chain. We found, for example, that production issues dominate the main export chain because their other functions - design, supply, and distribution - take place outside of Kenya. The business-system perspective supplemented and complemented the value-chain analysis by pinpointing the institutional causes of many of the problems facing the industry. Not surprisingly, given its continued dominance of the economy, the state is held responsible for many of the industry's difficulties. Also important are the technology system, the labour system, and firm-level institutions in the textile industry Since the study is ongoing and, therefore, incomplete, the analysis was able to identify only a few areas that are ready for immediate policy intervention; others will require further investigation.

The former includes facilitation of horizontal and virtual business organizations, and shortened value chain while the latter is about the change in means of communications. These changes provide a good opportunity for those in the construction industry to meet clients' demands for consistency in quality, standardized process management and effective control of time and other resources.

J	Gangakhedkar, K; Kevlani, S; Bist, G				Gangakhedkar, K; Kevlani, S; Bist, G			Business models for electronic commerce	IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The advent of electronic commerce has posed a challenge for traditional businesses with "disintermediation" of the,value chain. The intermediaries in the classical "brick and mortar" economy have been substituted by what are called as the "Infomediaries". However Infomediaries are not the only business models that have sprung up with the boom of electronic business. In just three or four short years, e-commerce has evolved at lightning speed through a succession of persuasive business models and approaches. There are many new business models that are being developed along with the traditional business models. This paper attempts to analyse various business models on the basis of business processes like Brokerage, Advertising, Merchant, Manufacturer etc, Some of these models are similar to the physical business models but the medium of transaction has now changed to electronic medium e.g: Manufacturer, Advertising. However the analyses is limited by the absence of any clear-cut Taxonomy for categorizing the Business Models for electronic commerce.

J	Jung, KH				Jung, KH			Foreign direct investment and corporate restructuring in East Asia	PACIFIC REVIEW			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Conference on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, After the Miracle - The Future of East Asian Dynamism and Pacific Economic Order	OCT 30-31, 1997	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA	Inst East & West Studies, Yonsei Univ, Inst Global Econ		foreign direct investment; East Asia; corporate strategy; chaebol; Asian tigers		One trend in East Asia has been an emergence of East Asian countries, most notably newly industrializing countries often called first-tier tigers, as sources of FDI in the region. In ten developing economies in East Asia, four first-tier tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea) together emerged as almost equally important as Japan or the United States as sources of FDI in the 1990s. Active overseas investment by East Asian firms could give an impression that these firms have gained competitive advantages comparable to more established multinational corporations from the United States, Europe or Japan. FDI by East Asian firms in neighboring countries can be described as 'border investment', meaning extension of their domestic business strategy to the familiar business environment nearby. The border investment does not require firms to possess so-called monopolistic or competitive advantages to overcome the cost of foreignness, because the business environment is not so foreign to investing firms. By investing in neighboring countries, NIE-based firms do not fundamentally change their business structure which is providing low-cost assembly operations to the global value chain controlled by Western and Japanese corporations. At the same time, FDI by East Asian firms is dictated by domestic economic conditions of NIEs, namely increased production costs at home. Driven-out FDP by East Asian firms may simply buy some time for them to prolong their activity until lesser developed countries learn to compete directly with them. Thus border investment by East Asian firms does not solve a fundamental issue of their management, that is developing core competence to survive in global industries. It is argued that East Asian firms are faced with some structural and institutional barriers in making necessary corporate restructuring and emerging as worthwhile competitors. Family business nature of East Asian firms makes it difficult for them to develop into modern enterprises. Given the current portfolio of business and organizational structure, East Asian firms are vulnerable to external shocks and do not provide a sound and efficient corporate structure to the region. In addition, economic integration based on private initiatives as witnessed in East Asia can be vulnerable to international political and economic instabilities. The current economic crisis in East Asia is revealing these fundamental weaknesses of East Asian firms.

They need to be managed holistically as processes, rather than through co-ordination of separate activities within disconnected functions. Intranets can mean anything from a single internal web site to a strategy for all internal IT systems. It is asserted that both corporate intranets and business processes should be systems engineered; the former to provide navigation of business processes, the latter to take account of the market value chain. This synergy should help the end user achieve extraordinary productivity improvement for the company.

J	Stalk, G; Pecaut, DK; Burnett, B				Stalk, G; Pecaut, DK; Burnett, B			Breaking compromises, breakaway growth	HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article								Many companies today are searching for growth. But how and where should they look? Breaking compromises can be a powerful organizing principle. Even in the most mature businesses, compromise breakers have emerged from the pack to achieve breakaway growth - far outpacing the rest of their industry, Examples include Chrysler Corporation, Contadina, CarMax, and the Charles Schwab Corporation. Compromises are concessions customers are forced to make. Unlike trade-offs, which are the legitimate choices customers make between different product or service offerings, compromises are imposed. For instance, in choosing a hotel, a customer can trade off luxury for economy. But the entire hotel industry makes customers compromise by not permitting early check-in. Trade-offs are very visible, bm most compromises are hidden. Compromises mean it's the industry's way or no way. Often, customers assume the industry must be right; they accept compromises as the way the business works. That is why traditional market research rarely uncovers compromise-breaking opportunities. The authors propose a number of alternative approaches to finding the compromises hidden in any business. One approach is to look for the compensatory behaviors customers engage in because using the product or service as intended would not fully meet their needs, Other approaches include paying attention to performance anomalies and looking for diseconomies in the industry's value chain. If managers think like customers, the authors say, they will be able to find and exploit compromises for faster growth and improved profitability.

J	DURAND, T				DURAND, T			ECONOMY OF SCOPE, ADDED VALUE CHAIN AND COST DYNAMICS - A TENTATIVE OPTIMIZATION MODEL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article								The added value chain model shows how products flow through successive design, manufacturing and distribution activities: the added value steps [ 1 ]. In firms with related product strategies some of these added value steps may be shared across various product lines [2]. Others may be specific to one product line. The economy of scope concept describes how a firm may enjoy synergies among its products sharing expertise and experience accumulated on cross-sectional activities. Although the economy of scope concept has been widely developed over the years, more has to be done to provide an explicit model of the phenomenon. This paper first presents an illustration of the concept of 'shared activity'. It stresses that activities embody the real technological core of a firm. An organization's expertise, its real accumulated experience, are embedded in its various cross-sectional activities where competitive advantages are built and defended. The paper then develops an optimization model that evaluates the impact on cost of activities shared among product lines. It builds upon the added value chain model. It further assumes a cost/production relationhship which may or may not be that given by the experience curve, i.e. cost decreases as a function of the accumulated volume of production. The model leads to selecting out the products that bring a global negative financial contribution to the firm. However, it shows that some money-losing product lines should be kept alive since the decrease in cost they generate on related products through shared activities actually increases the margins of these related products. The direct loss on the one side is then more than balanced by the indirect economy on the other side. The optimization model is presented both under monopoly and pure competition conditions. It leads to the well-known 'bang-bang' solutions: either stopping the product line totally or keeping the output at maximum sellable volumes. However, the test for keeping a product alive or not is no longer a simple cost/price comparison. The model shows that the test should be modified to include a 'shared cost' that explicitly takes into account the 'shared economy' that each product will induce on related products. Under simple assumptions, analytical expressions for both the shared cost and the shared economy are provided. The model presented thus explicitly shows why in related product situations the economy of scope concept may suggest the advantage of keeping some products that at first may be regarded as money losers.

Value management is a philosophy and organised procedure which aims to optimise utility and quality while minimising cost. Value management skills use multi-disciplinary, team-oriented, structured functional analysis procedures. Cost management skills should use a combination of multi-disciplinary, team oriented, structured cost reduction and the mono-professional skills of the quantity surveyor. The paper concludes that: there is a fundamental difference between value and cost management procedures; each has its place in the economic management of the building process; the "40-Hour Workshop", common in the USA, is closely related to the UK practice of cost management; commercial pressures within the UK construction industry are likely to favour integrated cost management procedures. Finally, the paper indicates that the next stage of the methodological development is to utilise the concept of the client value chain from strategic management literature to provide a linkage with the client value system, markets served, client 'needs' to be met and the contribution that built assets and property portfolios make to the client's corporate strategy.

AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Cages; Ponds; Smallholder; Tilapia; Value chain	VALUE-CHAIN; FISH CONSUMPTION; IMPACTS	Fish is a key source of income, food, and nutrition in Zambia, although unlike in the past, capture fisheries no longer meet the national demand for fish. Supply shortfalls created an opportunity to develop the aquaculture sector in Zambia, which is now one of the largest producers of farmed fish (Tilapia spp.) on the continent. In its present form, the aquaculture sector exhibits a dichotomy. It comprises, on the one hand, a smallholder sector that mainly produces for and supplies within local markets, and on the other hand, a burgeoning larger-scale commercial sector consisting of a small number of pioneering lead firms who are (re)shaping how the value chain supplies domestic, mainly urban, markets. A notable challenge confronting the development of the aquaculture value chain in Zambia is ensuring that the larger-scale commercial sector can continue to grow and generate economic benefits for the country, while simultaneously safeguarding inclusive and sustainable growth of smallholder production systems. An in-depth, mixed-methods aquaculture value chain study was carried out in Zambia in 2017 that aimed at providing relevant stakeholders with pertinent information on the value chain's contribution to economic growth and its inclusiveness, as well as its social and environmental sustainability aspects. In this article, we present some key findings from the study to shed light on how the sustainability of smallholder production systems could be enhanced while preserving the growth trend of larger producers in an inclusive way. The study found that the value chain is contributing positively towards economic growth in the country. Smallholder farmers classified as "semi-subsistence" and "commercial" face several albeit somewhat different constraints to production, thus influencing their "sustainability" status. Semi-subsistence smallholders achieve positive (yet negligible) profit margins, and their production system is not environmentally sustainable and the value chain that supports them performs sub-optimally on several social markers. The "commercial" smallholder system is more economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The study juxtaposes these findings with those from the analysis of larger pond and cage-based systems to point to a set of key options Government, research, and development organisations could consider to support smallholder farmers and enhance the sustainability of the semi-subsistence smallholder production system in particular, without overlooking the whole system.

Pond aquaculture, traditionally extensive and with limited external inputs, has been transforming over the same period. Farm profitability was wide-ranging, between -12.00 and 46.00 Ghanaian cedi (GHC) per square meter (m(2)), with an average of GHC 8.82/m(2) for farmers active in 2019. Despite wide variability in production and profits, the majority of farmers experienced positive profits-on average, GHC 3.24 per kilogram of tilapia produced, or a 27% profit margin. Farmers who adopted good aquaculture practices and intensified their production have high productivity and positive profits. Nonetheless, the cost to produce 1 kg of tilapia in Ghana (roughly US$1.51 on average) was much higher than in other major tilapia-producing countries (averaging roughly US$0.78 to 1.29). COVID crisis further affected fish farmers: 54% experienced difficulties in accessing inputs, 56% experienced difficulties selling their fish, and farmgate fish prices went down in April-August, although slowly bounced back by end of 2020. Improving the competitiveness and resilience of Ghanaian tilapia sector will require improved seed, increased adoption of good management practices, lower-cost quality feed, and enabling policies and regulations.

To effectively deploy these approaches, new tools are required to better understand and quantify the degree of preference differences among alternative trait changes competing for measurement and selection effort. The purpose of this study was to present a method of quantifying preferences and developing typologies according to breeding priorities by applying an online trait preference survey approach to cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). This paper presents a conjoint analysis based on Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives (PAPRIKA) to help guide breeding programs in understanding trait preferences across value chain roles and social contexts and set breeding priorities that represent diverse interests. Trait preferences were assessed using a comprehensive survey and analysis package incorporating a core adaptive conjoint method (1000minds, 2020). Trait selection was based on a trade-off of 11 cassava traits carried out with 792 cassava value chain actors in four geopolitical regions in Nigeria. Principal component and cluster analyses revealed three clusters (typologies) of respondents according to their trait preferences. The results demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology that innovates on previous trait preference approaches to address the expanding needs of plant breeding programs within smallholder contexts.

Consequently, there is a wide interest in recycling opportunities. To identify these opportunities, it is key to understand bottlenecks and drivers in recycling value chains. Hence, we analyzed existing recyclability frameworks and related recycling literature, revealing 113 factors that determine the success of recycling minor metals. These factors were linked to the stages of the recycling value chain, i.e. manufacturing, use phase, waste collection, preprocessing, metallurgical recovery and secondary marketing. Based on the insights from the literature analysis, we propose a novel recyclability assessment framework. The framework indicates how properties of products, recycling technologies and society determine recyclability. The framework is suitable for assessing the recyclability of minor metals during the recycling technology development process. Therefore, it includes indicators that can be quantified easily, as demonstrated in three case studies. As such, it can be a useful tool to guide policy makers and technology developers towards closing material loops.

Livestock feed resources in the West African Sahel	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access							CLIMATE-CHANGE; COWPEA; SUSTAINABILITY; AGRICULTURE; NUTRITION; SELECTION; SYSTEMS; BROWSE; GENDER; SHRUBS	Limited supply of quality feed is the most important factor limiting livestock productivity in many sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Having a systematic inventory of available feed resources, identifying main challenges and potentials for improvement is the first step towards designing development strategies to improve feed quality and quantity. The objective of this study was to review the available feed resources and their quality in West African Sahel across different agro-ecological zones and to identify the research gaps and strategies to improve feed resource availability. The West African Sahelian zone is home to 135 million people who herd 173 million head of ruminant livestock. The main feed resources for grazing ruminants are pastures and crop residues; commercially formulated feeds are increasingly being used in poultry and pig production, particularly in peri-urban areas. Feed resources for livestock are diverse and vary markedly across agro-ecological zones in the West African Sahel and across seasons in terms of type, quantity, and quality. Given that crop residues are among the most important feed resources, there is need to invest in promoting adoption of proven methods for improving their quality and preserving it. Given poorly developed feed markets in the Sahelian rural areas and cities, strengthening the feed value chain is critical for improving the feed resource base in West Africa. Additional critically important needs are to increase awareness about the importance of feed quality, to create quality-based feed marketing systems, and to appreciate and enhance women's roles in feed production.

J	Cabernard, L; Pfister, S; Oberschelp, C; Hellweg, S				Cabernard, Livia; Pfister, Stephan; Oberschelp, Christopher; Hellweg, Stefanie			Growing environmental footprint of plastics driven by coal combustion	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article; Early Access							GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; DATABASE; WASTE; MICROPLASTICS; BENEFITS; CARBON; TRADE; POWER	Despite concerns about plastics in the environment, not enough attention is paid to the impacts of the various stages of the plastics value chain globally. This study finds that most environmental and socioeconomic impacts from plastics are due to their growing production in coal-based economies. Research on the environmental impacts from the global value chain of plastics has typically focused on the disposal phase, considered most harmful to the environment and human health. However, the production of plastics is also responsible for substantial environmental, health and socioeconomic impacts. We show that the carbon and particulate-matter-related health footprint of plastics has doubled since 1995, due mainly to growth in plastics production in coal-based economies. Coal-based emissions have quadrupled since 1995, causing almost half of the plastics-related carbon and particulate-matter-related health footprint in 2015. Plastics-related carbon footprints of China's transportation, Indonesia's electronics industry and India's construction sector have increased more than 50-fold since 1995. In 2015, plastics caused 4.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, 6% of global coal electricity is used for plastics production. The European Union and the United States have increasingly consumed plastics produced in coal-based economies. In 2015, 85% of the workforce required for plastics consumed by the European Union and the United States was employed abroad, but 80% of the related value added was generated domestically. As high-income regions have outsourced the energy-intensive steps of plastics production to coal-based economies, renewable energy investments throughout the plastics value chain are critical for sustainable production and consumption of plastics.

J	Breiling, M				Breiling, Meinhard			Global rural value chains and the role of natural disasters in their transformation	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Rural value chains; Values at risk; Disaster risk management; Climate adaptation; Business innovation; Business resilience; Agriculture; Tourism; Eco-system services		Global rural value chains relate to business activities in non-central locations all over the world. They contain almost all global agricultural production, a major part of global tourism, and minor shares of industry and other services than tourism. Their generated value is more dependent on climate and extreme weather events than what is the case with urban value chains. Concepts of disaster vulnerability and disaster resilience to rural value chains are presented and followed by a system view on global rural value according to four income groups of countries. A different meaning of disasters becomes perceivable for each income group. We come up with four cases of successful in some aspects controversial alterations of global rural value chains: palm oil value chain in ASEAN, the sixth industry in Japan, rural tourism in Asia, and winter tourism in Austria and analyze the impacts of natural disasters in case studies. The business disturbances are manifold, complex, and not entirely adverse. The value at risk in a given location widely depends on the susceptibility of people and environment to a natural disaster, the costs to repair, and possibilities to innovate. Along with economic growth, disasters accelerate transformations in rural value chains and the strive to become more global while contracting in their local extensions.

J	Gammelgaard, J; Haakonsson, S; Just, SN				Gammelgaard, Johanna; Haakonsson, Stine; Just, Sine Norholm			Linking Malawi's agricultural sector to global value chains: The case for community governance	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS POLICY			English	Article						global value chain; land grabbing; industrial policy; Malawi; community governance; livelihood upgrading	PRODUCTION NETWORKS; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; LABOR; SCALE; TRADE	The ambition of integrating national economies into global value chains (GVCs) has become a staple of agricultural and industrial policies of the world's least-developed countries. Working with Malawi as a representative case of such national policies of value chains for development (VCDs), we investigate how the national ambition of GVC integration is experienced at the level of local communities. The analytical juxtaposition of policy documents and community experiences demonstrates an unmet need for GVC governance that mitigates the potential negative impact that large-scale production for global markets may have on local livelihoods and facilitates local communities' bottom-up participation in GVCs. On this basis, we introduce the concept of community governance as a supplement to the notions of private and public governance. We argue that the community level must be included in the GVC governance mix in order to ensure livelihood upgrading of all stakeholders. Further, we suggest that moving beyond economic and social upgrading of direct participants will release the potential of the GVC approach to promote inclusive development based on principles of empowerment and self-determination. Introducing community governance in theory and practice, we conclude, is key to the success of VCDs.

J	Godbless, EE				Godbless, Eromafuru Edward			Moral Leadership, Shared Values, Employee Engagement, and Staff Job Performance in the University Value Chain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP			English	Article						Moral leadership; Job Performance; University Value chain; Employee Engagement; Shared Value	ETHICAL LEADERSHIP; AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP; JUSTICE PERCEPTIONS; UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR; MEDIATING ROLE; TRUST	Myriad of discourses pouring from university podiums and social platforms have been inundated with administrative and governance matters majorly. Not much has been echoed about morality concerns in Nigerian tertiary institutions. Besides, history is replete with quite a handful of literature in this area. However, none of the prior studies has developed such a robust construct on the subject so as to capture the multiple simultaneous essences of shared values and employee engagement in moral leadership-staff Job performance link. The study involved a population of 3257 academic and non-academic staff from which a sample size of 327 was determined through simple random sampling. Drawing on stakeholder and social exchange theories and using regression model and structural equation modelling as analytical bases, results have vilified strong evidence of positive mediating effect of shared values and job engagement in moral leadership-staff job performance relationship except a unit construct (authentic leadership) that exhibited negative association. Finding has further foreclosed that staff's overall job performance will improve with panoptic constructs of moral leadership whereas fragmented approach will only lead to sub-optimal performance. Study proposes an inclusive framework connecting the modified constructs of moral leadership, shared values, employee engagement, and job performance of universities' staff. It is stressed that university leadership obsessed with integrity found on strong ethical fibber will earn staff's trust and confidence and sustain university's reputation for enduring leadership that is value laden.

Impacts of COVID-19 on the value chain of the hake small scale fishery in northern Peru	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Pandemic; Governance; Autonomous responses; Behaviour		All aspects of fish supply chains have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with jobs, income and food security at risk. In Peru, small scale fisheries are fundamental for food security, contributing to about 2/3 of all fish consumed nationally. One of the most important resources which is more affordable for local and regional consumption is hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus). This study is a first attempt to describe the small-scale hake fishery value chain and to quantify the impact of COVID-19 from March to August 2020 in two fishing communities in northern Peru. The levels of fishing and primary buying were the most affected, and we estimate that 23,000 fishing trips were not conducted, 1680 t of hake was not landed (83% decrease), and 620 jobs were negatively impacted during this period. The gross income of vessel owners and primary buyers decreased by $US 913,000. Marked differences were observed in the way each community responded to the pandemic and in their resilience to cope with COVID-19, despite being located less than 10 km away. In El N similar to uro, which relied more heavily on the international market for hake trade, the value chain was affected for longer, while in Los ' Organos which supplied national markets, the chain was restored after an initial period of adjustment. Our study suggests that government efforts should focus on facilitating a formalisation process in all levels of the chain, develop indicators to monitor the resumption of activities and the inclusion of a value chain approach to smallscale fisheries management.

As with other sectors of the economy, agriculture should also contribute to meeting countries' emission reduction targets. Transformation of agriculture to low-carbon food systems requires much larger investments in low emission development options from global climate finance, domestic budgets, and the private sector. Innovative financing mechanisms and instruments that integrate climate finance, agriculture development budgets, and private sector investment can improve and increase farmers' and other value chain actors' access to finance while delivering environmental, economic, and social benefits. Investment cases assessed in this study provide rich information to design and implement mitigation options in agriculture through unlocking additional sources of public and private capital, strengthening the links between financial institutions, farmers, and agribusiness, and coordination of actions across multiple stakeholders. These investment cases expand support for existing agricultural best practices, integrate forestry and agricultural actions to avoid land-use change, and support the transition to market-based solutions.

J	Oliveira, L; Fleury, A; Fleury, MT				Oliveira, Luis; Fleury, Afonso; Fleury, Maria Tereza			Digital power: Value chain upgrading in an age of digitization	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						Digitization; Digitalization; Global value chains; Power relationships	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; PRODUCTION NETWORKS; CAPTURING VALUE; VALUE CREATION; INNOVATION; TECHNOLOGY; IMPACT; STRATEGY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP	We investigate whether and how digitization may affect the power relationships that constrain the upgrading of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in global value chains (GVCs). Combining GVC literature and Resource Dependency Theory, we examine the three features that shift upgrading constraints: asset-specificity, market disintermediation, and innovation sources. The outcomes of a multiple case study encompassing Bra-zilian firms intentionally sampled from the Digital Games Industry refine our propositions, leading to the concept of digital power as the potential difference in the power imbalance that a supplier may experience in relation to lead firms when performing similar functions in value chains with different digitization degrees. We contribute to International Business literature regarding the relatively unaddressed effects of digital technologies on power relationships in value chains, and deepen the extant understanding of value chain upgrading as a phenomenon. For practitioners, our results inform ways of benefiting from digital industries.

J	Yebenes, JR; Zorrilla, M				Yebenes, J. R.; Zorrilla, M.			A Data Governance Framework for Industry 4.0	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Data governance; Monitoring; Real-time systems; Industrial Internet of Things; IEEE transactions; Data models; Big Data; Data governance; Data-Centric architecture; Industry 4; 0; Big Data; Real Time		The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, represents a new stage of evolution in the organization, management and control of the value chain throughout the product or service life cycle. This digitization of the industrial environment is characterized by the connection of Information Technologies (IT) and Operations Technologies (OT) through cyber-physical systems and the Industrial IoT (IIoT). One of the main consequences of this integration is the increasing amount and variety of data generated in real time from different sources. In this environment of intensive generation of actionable information, data becomes a critical asset for Industry 4.0, at all stages of the value chain. However, in order to data become a competitive advantage for the company, it must be managed and governed like any other strategic asset, and therefore it is necessary to rely on a Data Governance system. Industry 4.0 requires a reformulation of governance since the data is a key element and the backbone of the processes of the organization. This paper proposes a Reference Framework for the implementation of Data Governance Systems for Industry 4.0. Previously, it contextualizes data governance for Industry 4.0 environments and identifies the requirements that this framework must address, which are conditioned by the specific features of Industry 4.0, among others, the intensive use of big data, cloud and edge computing, artificial intelligence and current regulations.

Part of the problem is that research and practice in CGIAR and among its national breeding program partners tend to treat the private sector as a vehicle for seed delivery, rather than as commercial businesses facing a range of unique constraints and threats. This paper adopts a value chain framework to examine these relationships and pathways for improved varietal adoption/turnover outcomes in three cases: hybrid maize, farmed fish, and rice. In the first two cases, weak incentives and high risks left seed companies reluctant to invest in the marketing and quality assurance efforts needed to realize near-term impacts at scale from breeding investments. In the third case, seed companies played an insignificant role: grain traders supplied certified seed to smallholders, potentially prioritizing consumers' quality preferences over climate-resilience and stress-tolerance traits for farmers. The findings raise important questions about the role of CGIAR and national breeding programs; specifically, how these programs can effectively support the private sector to deliver impact at greater scale, how consumer preferences are captured in trait prioritization within breeding programs, and what types of incentive mechanisms can be changed within breeding programs to advance a genuine shift towards 'demand-oriented' plant breeding.

J	Betzler, D; Leuschen, L				Betzler, Diana; Leuschen, Lara			Digitised value chains in the creative industries: Is there a convergence of Swiss film and game production?	CREATIVE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						Creative industries; digitalisation; film; game; media convergence; value chain research		Digitalisation transforms creative value chains significantly. For the film and game production, experts assume that this process comes along with an increasing convergence. This article aims to identify and discuss possible convergences along the digitised value chains of the film and game industries. Based on a structured comparative analysis of the Swiss film and game industries, we explore framework conditions and stages of value creation. Taking into account a comprehensive desk research on the impact of digitalisation on the value creation in creative industries and interviews with Swiss industry experts, we found out that despite different production styles and cultures, the Swiss game and film industries show signs of convergence like, e.g. in the animation of content. However, one of the main challenges when it comes to film and game cooperations, remains to develop genuinely transmedial products and content that is specific to convergences and technologies used (e.g. Virtual Reality).

Three predictions follow: (i) a higher share of foreign value added in exports reduce the responsiveness of export volumes to exchange rate changes, (ii) a greater share of exports that returns as imports also reduce the responsiveness of export volumes and (iii) a higher share of inputs that are further re-exported increase the responsiveness of exports to the trading partner's nominal effective exchange rate. Using a large origin-sector-destination level panel data set covering the period 1995-2009 and around 85% of world GDP, we find strong empirical support for these predictions.

AQUACULTURE REPORTS			English	Article						Pangasius; Aquaculture; Sustainability; Certification; Bangladesh	MARKET INTEGRATION; SUSTAINABILITY; FISH; FRAMEWORK; LEVEL	Globally, Bangladesh is the fifth largest aquaculture producer, with pangasius (Pangasianodon hypopthalamus) contributing 18 % of the total aquaculture production. This production is characterized by unregulated farming practices, domestic trade without value addition, product development, or export. In this paper, the Sustain ability Assessment of Food and Agriculture (SAFA) framework of the FAO was used to assess the competency of Bangladeshi pangasius farmers by comparing their practices with the indicators of farming practices prescribed by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC). A survey of 150 farmers was undertaken that investigated the SAFA dimensions of good governance, environmental integrity, production and economics, and social well-being. Of 57 indicators, only 35 % were met at the best/good level, most of which occurred in the production and economic (47 %) and environmental dimension (40 %) and the least in the social dimension (29 %). Therefore, improvement of farming practices in all of the SAFA dimensions is required, with social and environmental dimensions demanding the most attention. Aquaculture certification for Bangladeshi pangasius farmers also requires improvements in legal frameworks and the involvement of value chain actors. Under a research and development initiative, one method to improve compliance is to develop a best practices approach for cluster agribusiness cooperation in farmer groups that have to be contractually bound to processing plants. This can spread and make sale at the potential international whitefish market.

This assessment tests the no agricultural waste concept, an agricultural system where all residues are utilized within a value chain, to elucidate whether the concept does indeed improve environmental performance across various regions, and if so, explores how various biorefinery concepts might be organized into various value chains to attain environmental benefits. In order to valorize this, the study illustrates how to do a step-wise assessment in order to design biorefinery set-ups based on their feedstock compatibility and region of implementation. The results show that no agricultural waste systems do not always result in environmental benefits, especially when environmental impacts are measured via a holistic interpretation of environmental damages, namely monetizing environmental damages. Furthermore, disagreement is shown when comparing environmental impacts interpreted via a single impact category, here global warming potential (GWP) and monetized environmental damages (MED). The performance of the various biorefineries was highly affected by the degree of decarbonization present in the energy grid of each region. While energy intensive biorefineries are able to provide benefit in terms of global warming savings, tradeoffs are observed where impacts are shifted to other areas of environmental impact. Despite these tradeoffs, across multiple regions, there is great potential for large-scale implementation of biorefineries as a tool for ameliorating environmental damages.

Here we explore how the traditional-to-modern transition is affecting food loss and waste (FLW) using an empirical case study from Thailand. Despite the consolidation of modern retailing in the 1990s, traditional market channels and smallholder agriculture have remained operational and widespread across the country. We identified related factors affecting FLW and food quality requirements by combining stakeholder focus groups and semi-structured interviews with quantitative measurements along the value chain for Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa, subsp. pekinensis). Quality requirements were often accompanied by FLW generation and propagated upstream the value chain. At the field level, factors affecting both FLW and food quality included weather events, pests and diseases, and low prices at the farm gate. However, products that did not meet supermarket requirements could still find a market channel in traditional, wholesale markets. In both pathways, a head of cabbage lost 44 to 66% of its wet weight before reaching the consumer, as stakeholders trimmed the outer leaves at each node of the value chain. Stakeholders associated with modern retailers produced on average significantly more waste from trimming (42%) than other stakeholders that are less tied to cosmetic standards (18-24%). We conclude that, alongside technological advances in the modernization of food value chains, preserving pathways for non-compliant products is key to preventing FLW if cosmetic standards prevail.

J	Paliokaite, A; Jasinskaite, E; Tiits, M				Paliokaite, Agne; Jasinskaite, Elibieta; Tiits, Marek			Global Value Chain Upgrading and Business-academia Collaborations: Case Studies of Successful Innovators	TRIPLE HELIX			English	Article						Business-academia collaboration; Central and Eastern Europe; Global value chains; Innovation policy; Upgrading		The article links upgrading in the global value chains with the triple helix concept by focusing on business-academia collaborations that played a part in firms' capacity to upgrade. Both are crucial for Central Eastern European countries, which face the need to restructure their economies and escape the "middle income trap". The article asks the following research question: how can public policy encourage business-academia collaboration or other types of activities that contribute to firm upgrading? Data on four different case studies in Lithuania is analysed to answer this question. Results indicate that building endogenous technological capacity through a variety of business-university collaboration types is needed to attract higher-value foreign direct investment and facilitate intersectoral and functional global value chain upgrading. Furthermore, besides research and development, educating and training the labour force are likely to be even more poweful drivers for business-academia collaboration in Central and Eastern Europe.

Similar to liquefied natural gas (LNG), pure hydrogen is liquefied prior to transportation-particularly for transportation over long distances. Liquid nitrogen is widely used as a refrigerant in the precooling phase of the liquefaction; however, considering the scale of the predicted hydrogen energy network, alternative sources must be considered. LNG is a promising candidate because the cold energy obtained during the regasification process of LNG is conventionally released in seawater. In the present study, a simple integrated scheme is proposed, wherein LNG cold energy is used to facilitate hydrogen liquefaction by eliminating the precooling refrigeration cycle. The proposed integrated process was designed and analyzed using the well-known commercial simulator Aspen Hysys (R) v10. The design of the proposed process was optimized via the modified coordinate descent methodology. The results indicated that the overall refrigerant quantity was reduced by approximately 50%, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 40% in the specific energy consumption, i.e., it was reduced to 7.64 kWh/kg(LH2). The exergy efficiency of the proposed process was 42.25%, which is significantly higher than that reported for commercial plants (21%). The coefficient of performance of the proposed process was 40.2% higher than those of previously reported processes. The figure of merit of the proposed process was 0.422. The proposed process is expected to change the value chain dynamics of LNG and hydrogen liquefaction, promoting a shift toward a hydrogen economy.

J	Wang, YX; Wang, N				Wang, Yixuan; Wang, Nuo			Exploring the role of the fisheries sector in China's national economy: An input-output analysis	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Fisheries; Input-output; Economy; China	AQUACULTURE; INDUSTRY; IMPACTS	In China, fisheries include a combination of capture and aquaculture activities. In the context of China Fisheries and Aquaculture Statistics Yearbooks, the fisheries sector includes three economic sub-sectors: the fisheries primary sector (e.g., saltwater or freshwater, wild or farmed capture, and aquaculture), the fisheries secondary sector (e.g., aquatic processing, fisheries machine and tools manufacturing, fisheries feed, and construction), and the fisheries tertiary sector (e.g., fisheries products storage, transportation service, and leisure fishery). This study disaggregates these three fisheries sub-sectors as exogenous and investigates the role of the fisheries sectors in China from 2000 to 2018. Through an input-output (I-O) analysis, we quantify their socioeconomic impacts by determining the cross-sectoral linkage effects, the production-inducing effects, the supply-shortage effects, and the employment-inducing effects. Finally, these findings provide reliable information for policymakers to understand the fisheries value chain and to formulate fisheries regulations.

J	Yuan, XD; Li, XT				Yuan, Xiaodong; Li, Xiaotao			The evolution of the industrial value chain in China's high-speed rail driven by innovation policies: A patent analysis	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article						Innovation policy; Patent analysis; High-speed rail; Industrial value chain; Revealed technological advantage	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; DEMAND-PULL; TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION; COEVOLUTION; MANAGEMENT; EMERGENCE; INDICATOR; SUPPORT; PUSH	High-speed Rail (HSR) is one of the most technological breakthroughs in passenger transportation over the last decades. The rapid development of China's High-speed Rail (CRH) is astonishing. However, it seems to be a "black box" how China has achieved great success in the CRH industry for many organizations or scholars. The paper proposes a novel approach to identify the critical components of an industry value chain and then gains insight into why systemic policies can drive significant breakthroughs in the CRH industry. Our findings highlight that both large companies and universities have played a vital function in the process of technology innovation. Besides, the incentive policies induce many innovators to carry out competition and cooperation, which results in forming and perfecting the industrial value chain. Innovation policies facilitate the evolution of the industrial value chain though there is a time lag of incentive effect. In contrast, the perfect industry value chain contributes to achieving the success of technology innovation.

This study establishes a co-aggregation index to explore spatio-temporal changes of the co-agglomeration between manufacturing and producer services in 30 provinces of China from 2004 to 2019. Furthermore, we use spatial Durbin model to analyze the impact of industrial co-agglomeration on air pollution reduction. We find that (1) the co-agglomeration index varies remarkably at spatio-temporal scale; (2) high co-agglomeration index is mainly distributed in eastern and central China, while low co-agglomeration index is mainly located in the western region; (3) the co-agglomeration index presents a cluster pattern among provinces, with the cluster of high value in eastern China and the cluster of low value in western China; and (4) the co-agglomeration between manufacturing and producer services is proven effetely to reduce air pollution, which is accompanied with spatial spillover effect. We also provided policy implications in line with diverse industries, multi hierarchies, and different regions, promoting the coordination of manufacturing and producer services and improving air quality.

J	Klaassen, L; Stoll, C				Klaassen, Lena; Stoll, Christian			Harmonizing corporate carbon footprints	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								Current carbon accounting and reporting practices remain unsystematic and incomparable, particularly for emissions along the value chain (scope 3). Here the authors present a framework to harmonize scope 3 emissions by accounting for reporting inconsistency, boundary incompleteness, and activity exclusion. Global greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net-zero around mid-century to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. This decarbonization challenge has, inter alia, increased the political and societal pressure on companies to disclose their carbon footprints. As a response, numerous companies announced roadmaps to become carbon neutral or even negative. The first step on the journey towards carbon neutrality, however, is to quantify corporate emissions accurately. Current carbon accounting and reporting practices remain unsystematic and not comparable, particularly for emissions along the value chain (so-called scope 3). Here we present a framework to harmonize scope 3 emissions by accounting for reporting inconsistency, boundary incompleteness, and activity exclusion. In a case study of the tech sector, we find that corporate reports omit half of the total emissions. The framework we present may help companies, investors, and policy makers to identify and close the gaps in corporate carbon footprints.

The expansion of advanced liquid biofuels use can contribute to increase the sustainable bioenergy deployment while reducing GHG emissions in comparison to fossil fuels. In this study, the economic and environmental perfor-mance of a biorefinery involving biomass gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) liquid biofuels pro-duction associated to sugarcane value chain is explored through a multiobjective optimization approach. The biorefinery configurations investigated include different biomass combinations, and the possibility of integrating the thermochemical processes to a first-generation ethanol distillery or operating it as a stand-alone plant. Different biomass mix considering conventional sugarcane, energy-cane and eucalyptus are considered in the optimization strategy. A Design of Experiments with a second-order polynomial regression technique is used to fit a metamodel from detailed and high-fidelity spreadsheet-based process models. Internal Rate of Return and avoided GHG emissions per agricultural land occupation are used as objective functions. The Pareto-optimal curves show the best performance possibilities and allows to identify the most suitable biorefinery configura-tions. Results indicate there is an economic benefit from the integration between the thermochemical process and conventional first-generation ethanol mills. An increase in cane and eucalyptus processing capacities tends to improve the economic performance due to the gain of scale. A higher proportion of energy-cane processed leads to better environmental performance as it reduces both the GHG emissions and the demand for agricultural land. In contrast, a greater share of energy-cane present trade-offs on the economic performance in the integrated biorefinery caused by the higher energy demand and lower ethanol production, but a minor effect is observed on the stand-alone configuration.

Spain, and in particular Galicia, which is an eminently fishing region characterised by the consumption of large quantities of fish, both fresh and processed, must face the challenge of shifting its seafood productive fabric towards a circular economy. To achieve this objective, the first task is to demonstrate that circular economy principles allow to reduce the environmental impacts associated with seafood production. In this sense, this study proposes the environmental evaluation of the skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) value chain within a canning industry located in Galicia through the LCA methodology from an attributional perspective, including the valorisation processes for biowaste (edible and inedible by-products). Results indicate that the main crucial subsystems of the value chain are tuna fishing and the canning process, as it was expected considering other similar studies on seafood products. Moreover, this specific case study demonstrates that the multi-product strategy applied to the canning sector is environmentally viable. Thus, although the environmental impacts of the entire system are increased by including further valorisation operations, the environmental loads assigned to the main product (canned tuna) decrease compared to the one-product system by assigning environmental burdens to other value-added products (tuna pate, fishmeal, and fish oil).

J	Wang, XS; Wu, H; Li, L; Liu, L				Wang, Xiaosong; Wu, Huan; Li, Le; Liu, Lu			Uncertainty, GVC participation and the export of Chinese firms	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS			English	Article; Early Access						export; global value chain; heterogeneous firms; uncertainty	TRADE-POLICY UNCERTAINTY; INDUSTRY; IMPACT	Increasing uncertainty has hindered the development of international trade in recent years. Participating in the global value chain (GVC) has become one way for Chinese export firms to deal with uncertainty and reduce external risks. Based on trade theory with heterogeneous firms, this study constructs a theoretical framework encompassing uncertainty and GVC participation. We find that uncertainty inhibits the export of firms, but GVC participation can alleviate the negative impact of uncertainty, which is verified through empirical analysis. Additionally, mechanism analysis reveals that GVC participation plays a moderating role through product diversity, market diversity, cost-saving effects, and quality-improving effects. This study demonstrates that in the absence of serious adverse events, GVC is highly efficient. Accordingly, China should actively participate in the governance of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduce the external uncertainty faced by Chinese export firms, promote the return of an efficient GVC, and further ameliorate the negative impact of uncertainty.

J	Manogna, RL; Mishra, AK				Manogna, R. L.; Mishra, Aswini Kumar			Market efficiency and price risk management of agricultural commodity prices in India	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Economics; Risk analysis; Econometrics; Decision analysis; Market efficiency; Price risk management; Mandi markets; Price discovery; Agricultural commodity; Cointegration; Futures market; India; G13; G14; Q13	VOLATILITY SPILLOVERS; FUTURES MARKETS; TIME-SERIES; DISCOVERY; COINTEGRATION; INDEX	Purpose Market efficiency leads to transparent and fair price discovery of commodity markets, thus enhancing the value chain for competitive benefit. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the market efficiency of Indian agricultural commodities at spot, futures and mandi markets apart from exploring price risk management in these markets. Design/methodology/approach This study uses Johansen co-integration, vector error correction model and granger causality for analyzing market efficiency of the nine most liquid agricultural commodities across three markets, namely, spot, futures and mandi. All these nine commodities are traded on National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange. Findings The statistical results indicate price discovery exists in the mandi market and spot market leading to futures prices. Mandi price returns are seen to negatively influence futures returns in the case of cotton seed, guar seed and spot returns in the case of jeera, coriander and chana. For castor seed, the three markets are seen to have no long run relationship. The results of Granger causality reveal short run relationship between all the three markets in the case of soybean seed and coriander. In these commodities, prices in all three markets are capable of predicting the prices in the other markets. For the case of cottonseed, Rape Mustard seed, jeera, guar seed, the results indicate unidirectional causality between the mandi markets and the other two markets. Research limitations/implications These results shall facilitate policymakers to explore intervention through integrated agri-platform (IAP) in price discovery and market efficiency. Practical implications The results of this study are useful in understanding the price discovery of mandi markets and its role in the spot and futures market. Agricultural commodities price discovery depends upon the integration of all these three markets. Introduction of IAP as described in the paper shall facilitate price risk management apart from improving the efficiency of price discovery. Originality/value To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study considering mandi, spot and futures prices in the price discovery process in India. In addition, this study found the role of mandi markets in serving the economic function of price discovery and price risk management. Hence, suggests for policy intervention for Indian agricultural commodities to manage price risk.	[Manogna, R.

J	Hand, K; Murphy, R; MacLachlan, M; Carr, SC				Hand, Karen; Murphy, Rebecca; MacLachlan, Malcolm; Carr, Stuart Colin			Worlds Apart? - The Challenges of Aligning Brand Value for NGO's	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW ON PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT MARKETING			English	Article; Early Access						NGO; Brand; Purpose; Stakeholder Alignment; Moral Capital	VALUE CO-CREATION; VALUE CHAIN; NONPROFIT; LEGITIMACY; IDENTITY; ORGANIZATIONS; DYNAMICS; EQUITY; HEALTH; ETHICS	Brands are increasingly part of how international aid and development Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) operate, but there are challenges in aligning NGO brand value across diverse stakeholders. This research explores how key decision makers within one major NGO - Oxfam-construct the challenges of brand value alignment, using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis methodology. Three master-themes emerge demonstrating key tensions around aligning NGOs brand value: the difficulty of balancing competing stakeholder needs, the internal cultural conflict around branding, and the existential dilemma underlying the societal effectiveness of NGOs. This paper proposes that NGOs can better navigate these intra-brand tensions using Brand-as-Purpose as an organizing principle; framing shared identity, creating a dynamic container for stakeholder interests and cultivating Moral Capital strongly anchored in increasing recipient wellbeing. This paper is one of the first pieces of research which explores how NGOs make sense of aligning brand value in the context of complex stakeholder cultures and recipient sovereignty. Brand-as Purpose is put forward as an organizing principle to help balance three key tensions around brand value alignment. This paper proposes that Moral Capital anchored in recipient wellbeing underpins NGO brand value and societal legitimacy and needs to be paramount in how NGO's establish and legitimize their brands.

To address these challenges the UK Government and the construction industry have been promoting modular construction; a method that can improve efficiency and productivity in the construction sector via the prefabrication of volumetric elements or structural components of a building off-site and their assembly on-site. In this study we highlight that while modular construction can help deliver sustainability credentials in the entire construction value chain, at present the sector's activities are concentrated on using modular construction to improve resource efficiency upstream of the construction value chain, i.e. at the design, manufacture and construction. This appears to be divorced from the need to promote resource efficiency and productivity at the stages occurring downstream (i.e., disassembly and end-of-life management) of the construction value chain. Such divergence could hamper construction industry's efforts to reduce its environmental and economic impacts in the future, and points to the need of an integrated, holistic approach to improving the sustainability of the sector. To support our argument, we provide an overview of the current state of modular construction in the UK, and outline key obstacles in rolling out modular construction's mainstream use. We posit that modular construction presents an opportunity to integrate upstream with downstream construction practices and achieve sustainability in the entire construction sector, and suggest that the development of a digitally enabled modular construction, whereby smart technologies are combined with modular construction, could be instrumental in supporting this vision. A smart, modular construction regime can operationalise the collection and storage of components' lifecycle information, and help the sector build the capabilities needed to support the maintenance, recovery and reuse of modular components, and reduction of waste. For this to take precedence it is imperative to think of the 'end' right at the beginning of the design stage, and foster an improved collaboration between all stakeholders involved in the construction value chain.

Simultaneous production scheduling and transportation optimization from mines to port under uncertain material supply	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Mining complex; Stochastic simultaneous optimization; Mine-to-port transportation; Iron ore	MINING COMPLEXES; STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; LONG-TERM; SIMULATION	Industrial mining complexes can be optimized using simultaneous stochastic optimization (SSO), which manages the risks associated with meeting production targets while capitalizing on the synergies that exist between the various components of the related mineral value chain. This paper introduces an extension of past SSO approaches for the long-term, allowing to simultaneously optimize the schedule of the production and the mines-toport transportation of mining complexes under uncertain material supply. The inclusion of mine-to-port transportation scheduling facilitates the analysis of the mines-to-port equipment usage, while generating suitable mine production schedules. The proposed stochastic mathematical program formulation is applied to a two-mine, single-port iron ore mining complex. In doing so, it is shown that the related model is capable of producing optimal production schedules, minimizing deviations from products requirements, and delineating the yearly use of the mine-to-port transportation equipment.

The mobility restriction has disrupted all types of business; causing a devastating impact on countries' economies; and pushing millions of people into extreme poverty. Scientists have been assessing the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on various fronts but there is limited scholarship in the forestry sector. We navigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the forestry sector by taking Gandaki Province (21,974 km2) of Nepal as a case. Employing semi-structured interviews (n = 62) with all ten stakeholder groups, literature review and media analysis, our study revealed that the COVID-19 lockdown suspended all types of forestry and ecotourism businesses; obstructed research and monitoring activities; halted capacity development and extension services; impacted forest development work; and increased incidences of illegal logging and poaching and trafficking of wildlife. Because of the complete shutdown of businesses, the forestry sector of Gandaki province lost 9.6 million USD and 3.2 million man-days of employment during the lockdown period. The economic cost of the lockdown was 1.73 million USD for NTFPs traders, 1.26 million USD for ecotourism entrepreneurs, 0.55 million USD for the community forest user groups and 0.24 million USD for the smallholder or private forest owner. We suggested four post-COVID recovery pathways, including sustainable forest management, nature-based tourism, improvement of forest products value chain and community-based natural resource management to bounce back from the loss. As the current pandemic is most likely to derail the Sustainable Development Pathways of several countries, including Nepal and necessitates the need for an immediate response, the finding and recommendation of our study may inform decision-makers to reimage post-pandemic recovery and leverage sustainable development.

Upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG-Si) has already demonstrated to be a viable alternative to standard polysilicon in terms of cost and quality. This study presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of UMG obtained by the FerroSolar process. Moreover, it shows the environmental impacts of PV modules and electricity generation based on this material. For this, an exhaustive review of the life cycle inventory (LO) of PV value chain, from metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) down to electricity generation, has been carried out updating inputs for all processes. The Balance of System (BoS) has also been updated with current state of the art data for a fixed open ground large PV site (100 MWpk). Two different electricity mixes, with low and high carbon intensities, have been considered. The results reveal that for PV electricity generation using UMG-Si instead of polysilicon leads to an overall reduction of Climate change (CC) emissions of over 20%, along with an improvement of the Energy Payback Time (EPBT) of 25%, achieving significantly low values, 12 gCO(2eq)/kWh(e) and 0.52 years, respectively. Moreover, it is shown that UMG silicon feedstock is not the main contributor to the carbon and energy footprint of the produced electricity, leaving the first place to PV module manufacturing.

Factors influencing the level of vegetable value chain participation and implications on smallholder farmers in Swayimane KwaZulu-Natal	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Value chain; Smallholder farmers; Swayimane; Nehurdle model	MARKET PARTICIPATION; RICE FARMERS; DISTRICT; FERTILIZERS; COMMUNITY; FRAMEWORK; MODELS	ABSTR A C T Governments in less developed countries have identified the need to support smallholder farmers and intervene to alleviate poverty and positively contribute to household food security. In Africa, there has been a growing emphasis on value chain development so that smallholder farmers can benefit from participation in agricultural value chains. Smallholder farmers are however still faced with constraints that negatively influence their participation decisions and the level of participation in agricultural value chains. This study, therefore, inves-tigated the factors that influence the level of value chain participation and implications on smallholder farmers in KwaZulu-Natal, Swayimane area. Primary data was collected from farming households selected through a pur-posive sampling technique. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis and the nehurdle model. Results from the nehurdle model showed that the age of the respondent, marital status, farm income, household size, cooperative, market information, radio, extension officer, and formal education significantly influenced the participation decisions of smallholder farmers in agricultural value chains. The results further showed that off -farm income, marital status, cooperatives, access to credit, access to irrigation scheme, radio, extension officer, contact with non-government organizations, and formal education significantly influenced the level of value chain participation of the smallholder farmers. It can be concluded that the level of endowment in the physical, financial, and human resources influence participation. Further, the farmer's connectivity with the external world outside the village improves the outcomes and level of success. It is recommended that a market-led approach to farmer development be adopted to improve the commercial prospects of farmers whilst bolstering food security.	[Ndlovu, P. N.; Thamaga-Chitja, J.

A scientometric/bibliometric scoping literature review identifies a clear gap in the current research in studying prerequisites for customer value creation in emerging market contexts. Observing experiences of Daikin and Renault in the context of India, the purpose of this paper is to identify value creation strategic choices following which comprehensive customer value offerings in products and services can be successfully created by firms across the four facets of the framework in emerging markets. Value creation strategies include having a nuanced understanding of the latent contextual needs to offer localized high-quality products that embody distinct functional attributes that provide a functional value and being responsive to specific emotional needs and epistemic experiences of the target customers in product and service offerings to deliver a greater experiential value. Furthermore, the products should adopt a localized operational excellence strategy throughout the value chain to reduce costs for competitive price offerings in order to deliver superior cost value and develop brand image and equity strategy, thereby allowing for the provision of a greater symbolic value. Experiences of successful firms demonstrate the need for extensive local research into the emerging market followed by localization of production and development of a distribution network to be able to offer customized products at competitive prices whilst maintaining the brand value. We thus extend the customer value creation framework by introducing localization as a necessary condition for successful organizational performance in emerging markets.

Shifting demand to sustainable fishing practices in Darwin's Archipelago: a discrete choice experiment application for Galapagos' certified Yellow-fin tuna	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Ecolabel and Certification; Discrete Choice Experiment; Sustainable Fisheries; Artisanal Fisheries; Marine Protected Area; Tuna	WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; RED SPINY LOBSTER; ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES; MARINE RESERVE; ECOLOGICAL PARADIGM; SPATIAL MANAGEMENT; CONJOINT-ANALYSIS; FISHERIES; SEAFOOD; CERTIFICATION	In spite of several policies to promote fisheries management in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), in the past there has been a collapse or near collapse of the two most important fisheries: the sea cucumber and the lobster fishery respectively. Currently, there is particular concern for the Galapagos Sailfin Grouper (Mycteroperca olfax), a regionally endemic species showing signs of severe decline and targeted by the white-fin fishery, a multi-species coastal fishery of high market value. Within this context, the Galapagos National Park Directorate (GNPD) and local NGOs have designed a policy consistent in a product certification scheme aiming to shift fishing efforts from depleted coastal fisheries to healthier pelagic stocks, whilst supporting artisanal fisher's livelihoods. Using a discrete choice experiment and accompanying survey data, the goal of this research is to analyze the preferences and tradeoffs made by individuals across attributes when purchasing certified fish in the Galapagos. In particular, we account for pro-environmental attitudes within a WTP space model specification and estimate the expected price premiums that tourists would be willing to pay for yellowfin tuna in the area in light of specific characteristics of its local value chain. We find that tourists visiting the Galapagos hold pro environmental attitudes as measured by the New-ecological paradigm and that there is a considerable increase in consumer's utility from a certification scheme. Tourists care about the level of bycatch associated with their consumption, food safety, quality, and whether is locally sourced, and would be willing to pay for these attributes. This evidence, driven by location specific characteristics of consumers and tourists, supports the design of market-based mechanisms for sustainable yellow fin tuna fisheries in the Galapagos	[Tanner, Michael K.; Marin Jarrin, Jose R.] Charles Darwin Res Stn, Dept Marine Sci, Galapagos, Ecuador; [Olivares-Arenas, Marcelo] Univ Catolica Norte, Escuela Ciencias Empresariales, Antofagasta, Chile; [Tanner, Michael K.; Puebla, Luciana] Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Tanner, Michael K.] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Hamburg, Germany; [Puebla, Luciana] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling IMPRS, Hamburg, Germany; [Marin Jarrin, Jose R.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Fisheries Biol, Arcata, CA USA		Tanner, MK (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Res Stn, Dept Marine Sci, Galapagos, Ecuador.	michael.tanner@fcdarwin.org.ec		Tanner, Michael K./0000-0003-4094-9272	Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence StrategyGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC 2037, 390683824]	We thank researchers from the Fisheries project at the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park for their valuable comments and input; we also thank Dr. Andres Vallone and the Environmental Economics seminar at the University of Hamburg for helpful suggestions.

Among them, the GVC accounting method based on complex network theory is different from the mainstream economics in both research angle and content. In this paper, we build up global industrial value chain network (GIVCN) models based on World Input-Output Database, introduce the theoretical framework of Social Capital, and define the network-based indicators with economic meanings. Second, we follow the econometric framework to analyze the hypothesis and test whether it is true. Finally, we study how the three types of capital constituted by these indicators interact with each other, and discuss their impact on the social capital (economic development level, i.e., GDP). The results prove that the structural capital (industrial status) has a positive impact on the social capital; the relational capital (industrial correlation) has a positive impact on both social capital and structural capital; the cognitive capital (industrial structure) has a small impact on the social capital, structural capital, and relational capital.

J	Yalamov, T; Vutsova, A; Arabadjieva, M				Yalamov, Todor; Vutsova, Albena; Arabadjieva, Martina			Economic performance of agricultural enterprises in Bulgaria	BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						labor productivity; entrepreneurship; agriculture; concentration; Gini	COMMON HERITAGE; TRANSITION; DIVERGENCE	The paper provides new empirical evidence on entrepreneurship in agriculture, its early performance (in the second year of establishment), labor productivity, operating revenues, and assets on firm-level data of all companies in the sector. The firm level economic performance is analyzed against a more general background of the sector (production, exports and subsidies) in a longer time frame. Gini coefficients are calculated on various indicators (operating revenues and assets in 2010 to 2018, agricultural subsidies for 2017/2018 and 2018/2019) and units of analysis and they all suggest extremely high inequality in the sector, which is in contrast with previous studies suggesting improving of the situation. The new agricultural entrepreneurs are more effective (relative to the years after the start) as they have prior relevant management experience, easier access to finance and enter the market as value chain entrepreneurs. The paper has important policy implications that the government should redesign its policies, which facilitate the inequality in the sector.

This study aims provide a theoretical framework describing the stakeholder behaviours that arise in severely disrupted value chains, which give rise to inter-organisational initiatives that impact industry sustainability. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach is adopted, in which uncertainty theory and relational governance theory and structured interviews with 15 AVC stakeholders underpin the initial conceptual model. The framework is empirically validated via partial least squares structural equation modelling using data from an online survey of 185 AVC stakeholders based in India. Findings The findings reveal that buyer and supplier uncertainty created by the COVID-19 lockdowns gives rise to behaviours that encourage stakeholders to engage in relational governance initiatives. Progressive farmers and other AVC stakeholders welcome this improved information sharing, which encourages self-reliance that positively impacts agricultural productivity and sustainability. Practical implications The new framework offers farmers and other stakeholders in developing nations possibilities to sustain their AVCs even in dire circumstances. In India, this also requires an enabling ecosystem to enhance smallholders' marketing power and help them take advantage of recent agricultural reforms. Originality/value Research is scarce into the impact of buyer and seller behaviour during extreme supply chain disruptions. This study applies relational governance and uncertainty theories, leading to a proposed risk aversion theory.

Bootstrapping tourism post-COVID-19: A systems thinking approach	TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Bootstrapping; COVID-19; causal loop diagram; potential leverage point; systems thinking; tourism	SUSTAINABLE TOURISM; VALUE CHAIN; GOVERNANCE; COMMUNITY; COVID-19; IMPACTS; TRUST; SATISFACTION; CONSERVATION; DYNAMICS	The coronavirus pandemic has disturbed industries globally. Unlike agriculture and manufacturing, the services sector, particularly tourism, which primarily involves social activities requiring human interaction, is devastated. Against the backdrop of measures to contain the pandemic, travel behaviors have altered. Without an effective recovery plan, the effect of the pandemic on tourism may be felt over a prolonged period of time. With the objective of contributing to a better understanding of how tourism can recover, we use systems thinking to recommend interventions to help restart local tourism. Through causal loop diagrams, we argue that rebooting tourism is key to rebooting the economy.

J	Shi, XP; Cheong, TS; Zhou, MC				Shi, Xunpeng; Cheong, Tsun Se; Zhou, Michael			COVID-19 and Global Supply Chain Configuration: Economic and Emissions Impacts of Australia-China Trade Disruptions	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						COVID 19; supply chain; global value chain; economic integration; Australia; China	CO2 EMISSIONS; ENERGY	Economic shocks from COVID-19, coupled with ongoing US-China tensions, have raised debates around supply chain (or global value chain) organisation, with China at the centre of the storm. However, quantitative studies that consider the global and economy-wide impacts of rerouting supply chains are limited. This study examines the economic and emissions impacts of reorganising supply chains, using Australia-China trade as an example. It augments the Hypothetical Extraction Method by replacing traditional Input-Output analysis with a Computable General Equilibrium analysis. The estimation results demonstrate that in both exports and imports, a trade embargo between Australia and China - despite being compensated for by alternative supply chains-will cause gross domestic production losses and emissions increases for both countries and the world overall. Moreover, even though all other economies gain from the markets left by China, many of them incur overall gross domestic production losses and emission increases. The finding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and India may also suffer from an Australia-China trade embargo, despite a gain in trade volume, suggests that no country should add fuel to the fire. The results suggest that countries need to defend a rules-based trading regime and jointly address supply chain challenges.

The European 2020 strategy and ongoing environmental disasters indicate the ineffectiveness of the current HW sustainability practices. This paper introduces an artificial intelligence (AI) approach for calculating urban residual waste, based on its generation level. It reforms the current diverse and high discrepancy levels of HW residual for EU-countries and Ukraine. Adopting a k-means clustering method with a multi-criteria taxonomic development level index (TIDL), it produces uniform clusters with higher accuracy and manageability. Findings discover and remedy opaque managerial practices, enabling sustainable and environment-friendly development at national and regional levels for EU-countries. Results reveal an increased number of clusters in crisis, contributing to a methodological reference for environmental planning. In conclusion, this AI approach could have a European-wide impact on sustainable economic value-chain, converging toward an eco-friendly economy.

J	Siltaloppi, J; Jahi, M				Siltaloppi, Jaakko; Jahi, Markus			Toward a sustainable plastics value chain: Core conundrums and emerging solution mechanisms for a systemic transition	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Plastic; Sustainability; Sustainability-oriented innovation; Value chain; Qualitative research	BIO-BASED PLASTICS; BUSINESS MODELS; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; INNOVATION; PRODUCTS; GREEN; IMPACT	In recent years, various environmental issues associated with plastics have become well documented, spurring a growing volume of research on the barriers, drivers, and solutions related to the development and commercialization of sustainable-bio-based, biodegradable and circular-plastics. However, a systemic perspective that addresses the complex interdependencies across the value chain has so far been missing from the analysis. Based on a qualitative study covering the entire plastics value chain in Finland and Northern Europe, this paper addresses the research gap with two main findings. First, the paper identifies three core conundrums that describe the complex and interrelated nature of technological, operational, economic, and societal factors, which are inhibiting the transition to sustainable plastics at three critical junctures of the value chain. Second, the findings describe four solution mechanisms, which suggest that the value chain actors need to shift (i) from the supply of bulk materials to material solutions; (ii) from firm-centric material development to cross-tier collaboration; (iii) from price competition to competition on sustainability benefits; and (iv) from isolated technologies to infrastructure development. These findings extend our understanding of the systemic challenges for the transition to a sustainable plastics economy and shed new light on the ways in which companies can address the challenges for a system-wide impact.

J	Kliem, L; Sievers-Glotzbach, S				Kliem, Lea; Sievers-Glotzbach, Stefanie			Seeds of resilience: the contribution of commons-based plant breeding and seed production to the social-ecological resilience of the agricultural sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article; Early Access						Agroecosystems; commons; resilience; seeds; governance	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; NATURAL SYSTEMS; CROP PRODUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOD SECURITY; SUSTAINABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; AGROBIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPES; PRINCIPLES	Building resilience in food systems is a priority to meet societal challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. However, there has been little systematic research on the role of seed production in fostering agroecological resilience. The increasing commercialization and privatization in the conventional seed industry result in the development and use of only a small number of high-yielding varieties. To counter this trend, new organizational approaches and governance structures in plant breeding and seed production build upon common ownership and collective management. In this study, we analyse how commons-oriented seed production promotes agroecological resilience in comparison to conventional private-property-based seed production. We apply an indicator-based framework to analyse publications from breeding and seed-producing organizations in the German-speaking vegetable seed sector. We find that in comparison to conventional seed production, commons structures promote agroecological resilience in several respects. They foster diversity at the genetic, crop species, and landscape level, create redundancy in seed supply channels, and increase autonomy from external resource inputs and international markets. The governance structures of commons-based seed production contribute to agroecological resilience through a high degree of self-organization of farmers and breeders along the value chain, participatory breeding approaches, and greater access rights to seeds.

This paper sheds light on the role of Industry 4.0 technological capabilities in facilitating knowledge access from international linkages and improving firm productivity. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on organizational learning research, the present study argues that the relationship between GVC breadth, analyzed in respect to the geographical fragmentation of production facilities and productivity follows an inverted U-shaped pattern that can be explained by the interplay between external knowledge access and the coordination costs associated with GVC breadth. We test our predictions using a purpose-built survey that was carried out among a sample of 426 Spanish manufacturing firms. Findings Our results indicate that organizations adhering to a traditional manufacturing system are able to benefit from fewer transnational relationships (concretely 11 foreign facilities) in the search for productivity improvements. This can be largely attributed to the marginal value of the knowledge accessed and the costs of coordinating international counterparts' production and knowledge transfer. However, our study reveals that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies has the potential to broaden optimal GVC breadth, in terms of the number of linkages to interrelate with (concretely 131 foreign facilities) so as to obtain productivity gains while mitigating the complexities associated with coordination. Originality/value The study unveils that Industry 4.0 technologies enable management of broader GVC breadth, facilitating knowledge access and counteracting coordination costs from international counterparts.

J	Rasiah, R; Wong, SH				Rasiah, Rajah; Wong, Siu Hong			Industrial upgrading in the semiconductor industry in East Asia	INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Semiconductors; institutional change; technological upgrading; STI infrastructure; East Asia	PRODUCTION NETWORKS; PERSPECTIVE; SPACE; MODEL	This paper seeks to assess industrial upgrading in the semiconductor industry in East Asia. Research into 25 firms, and subsequently the entire value chain specialization of these firms, as well as the filing of patents in the United States at the aggregate country level show that special focus on technological upgrading is critical to attract or stimulate firms' participation in frontier R&D and wafer fabrication activities. Within these categories supportive R&D in assembly and test operations can be achieved in reasonably strong Science Technology and Innovation (STI) infrastructure in particular national locations endowed with strong basic infrastructure. Only in countries where frontier semiconductor research is carried out at universities and where a strong discipline-based incentive mechanism is around, have semiconductor firms established frontier R&D and frontier wafer fabrication activities, such as in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. China has embarked on upgrading to such activities since 2017 suggesting that it could follow the same path to maturity. Consequently, the evidence shows that semiconductor manufacturing is most sticky with the highest technological sophistication in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan where the upgrading incentives and the STI infrastructure have been the most incisive, while China shows a promising movement in that direction.

J	Hoang, V; Nguyen, A; Hubbard, C; Nguyen, KD				Hoang, Viet; Nguyen, An; Hubbard, Carmen; Nguyen, Khanh-Duy			Exploring the Governance and Fairness in the Milk Value Chain: A Case Study in Vietnam	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						milk; fairness; global value chain; governance; sustainability; Vietnam		Governance and fairness in the food value chain have gained considerable attention from both policymakers and scholars, especially in developing countries. This study analysed the milk value chain, exploring its governance and fairness, and assessed the regulatory interventions across the milk value chain in Vietnam using a qualitative framework and the global value chain governance model. The results show that Vietnam's milk production and dairy market have developed notably since the reforms. The value chain is structured according to three governance models, i.e., relational, captive, and hierarchy models. Vietnam's milk value chain has progressed through three building phases, expanding in breadth, and undergoing in-depth development, and the governance models have adjusted accordingly. However, Vietnamese dairy farms have been exposed to a low level of fairness across the supply chain. Although dairy farmers in the relational model may benefit from more power and fairness in the short term, farmers in the captive model may gain benefits and potential fairness in the long term. Vietnam has diverse regulatory interventions to enhance farmers' fairness and welfare, and the results are notable.

This can benefit both financial and sustainability performance of companies. To analyze industrial implementation of the concept, the prevalent unit of analysis on the firm level is currently the circular business model. Our investigation of nine Swedish biogas companies and one branch organization indicates a range of conceptual shortcomings that challenges this approach. Our comparative case analysis points towards circular ecosystems being a more appropriate concept to describe the high level of coordination between different stakeholders necessary to implement circular systems. This increases the suitability to analyze, plan, and communicate circular economy systems on an organizational level, especially if value chain integration is low. An ecosystem perspective can thus support innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of the circular economy.

This manuscript proposes and illustrates the implementation of a new methodological framework for DT policy planning in the case of Andalusia, the olive world leader region, but applicable to other regions and sectors, with two objectives: 1) to quantitatively determine the importance of the conditioning factors of DT in the olive sector in the short/medium term, by developing an AHP/SWOT/PESTLE model, and 2) to design public policies to strengthen the DT, taking advantage of the potentialities and alleviating the deficiencies, by carrying out a quantitative TOWS analysis. The knowledge of diverse groups of experts, i.e. stakeholders in the sector, has been used in all analyses due to the lack of reliable data and the complex nature of the issues analysed. The results show that the opportunities and strengths are more prominent than weaknesses and threats for DT. Environmental issues stand out as an opportunity to boost DT. There is also a growing interest in developing an interoperability strategy which is an opportunity to overcome the low technological integration of the value chain. DT can also enable a more transparent value chain and improved traceability. Some negative factors are the lack of evidence on the economic viability of investment in digital technologies, shortage of labour and young farmers, and potential unintended and unanticipated effects of DT. Important policies strategies to foster DT are: improving environmental efficiency though DT; promoting youth employment in the sector; enhancing coordination among innovation actors; developing a common interoperability strategy; and fostering technological integration in the sector.

J	Rakotondrabe, M; Girard, F				Rakotondrabe, Manohisoa; Girard, Fabien			Protecting Traditional Knowledge through Biocultural Community Protocols in Madagascar: Do Not Forget the "B" in BCP	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Madagascar; traditional knowledge; biocultural community protocol; development process; genetic resources; phytogenetic resources for food and agriculture; local community right	NATURAL-RESOURCES; COLLECTIVE ACTION; BIODIVERSITY; STEWARDSHIP; CONSERVATION; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; ACCESS; FOREST; RIGHTS	As in many other countries in the south, the traditional knowledge (TK) of local communities in Madagascar is facing extinction. Biocultural community protocols (BCP), introduced in Madagascar following the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol (2010) and defined by the Mo'otz Kuxtal Voluntary Guidelines as "a wide range of expressions, articulations, rules and practices produced by communities to indicate how they wish to engage in negotiations with stakeholders", holds out hopes for TK protection. By analysing two pilot BCPs in Madagascar, one established around the Motrobe (Cinnamosma fragrans) with a view to strengthening the existing value chain (BCP in Mariarano and Betsako) and the second initially established around plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (BCP of the farmers in Analavory), this study aims to assess the place and value ascribed to TK in the overall BCP development process and to analyse whether or not the process has helped to strengthen and revitalise TK at the community level. The ethnographic studies show commonalities in both BCP, in particular their main focus on access and benefit-sharing mechanisms, this against the backdrop of an economic model which stresses the importance of financial and institutional incentives; and conversely, a relative disregard for what relates to the biocultural dimension of TK. Local taboos (fady) as well as traditional dina (social conventions), which have long allowed for the regulation of access to common resources/TK, are scarcely mentioned. Based on these findings, we conclude that in order to revitalise TK, the process of developing BCPs should recognise and give special importance to TK, considering it as a biocultural whole, bound together with the territory, local customs, and biological resources; or else, TK is likely to remain a commodity to be valued economically, or a component like any other.

Considering the advantage of Iran's access to natural gas, this study evaluates and compares the economic value of different plans to complete the value chain of propylene production from natural gas and methanol in the form of four units based on three price scenarios, namely, optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic, using the COMFAR III software. Iran has been ranked as the second most prosperous country globally based on its natural gas reserves. Methanol and propylene production processes via natural gas will lower the release of greenhouse gas. This, increasing the investment and accelerating the development of methanol and propylene production units driven by natural gas will lead the world to a low emission future compared to coal-based plants. The economic evaluation and sensitivity analysis results revealed that the conversion of methanol to propylene is more attractive for investment than the sale of crude methanol. The development of methanol to propylene units is more economical than constructing a new gas to propylene unit because of the lower investment costs.

J	Takman, J; Andersson-Skold, Y				Takman, Johanna; Andersson-Skold, Yvonne			A framework for barriers, opportunities, and potential solutions for renewable energy diffusion: Exemplified by liquefied biogas for heavy trucks	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Renewable energy; Heavy trucks; Framework; Opportunities; Barriers; Liquefied biogas	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES; OVERCOMING BARRIERS; ALTERNATIVE FUELS; TRANSPORT; VEHICLES; LAND; INFRASTRUCTURE; BIOFUEL	This study has developed and applied a framework to analyse barriers, opportunities, and potential solutions for the diffusion of alternative fuels, here exemplified by liquefied biogas (LBG) for heavy trucks. The study is based on expert and stakeholder interviews in Sweden. Also, the study estimates a cost example of using heavy duty LBG-trucks instead of conventional diesel trucks. The framework is based on two previously published frameworks to categorise barriers, opportunities, and potential solutions and comprises five categories: financial, technical/commercial/physical, policy, public acceptability, and market structure/interaction barriers. Each category considers both the system and actor levels. The results of this study fit the framework's categories well, and the framework is appropriate for analysing the diffusion of liquefied biogas for heavy trucks, and other technologies with similar characteristics. The results further indicate that a network level, in addition to the system and actor levels, could advance our understanding of renewable energy diffusion. The most mentioned opportunities were climate/environmental benefits, potential profitability, and newly introduced policies. The cost estimates show that given current taxes and policies in Sweden, the costs of using LBG-trucks are only marginally higher than those of using conventional diesel trucks. Commonly cited barriers were financial issues, an unstable policy context, lack of infrastructure, and lack of knowledge. Suggested solutions for overcoming barriers were financial incentives, a stable policy context, demonstration projects, and information campaigns. Improved knowledge and working together throughout the biogas value chain, with a palette of renewable energy options, are important for accelerating a sustainable renewable fuel diffusion. Several policy instruments that currently exists in Sweden already target the mentioned barriers. Thus, it is important to continuously evaluate policy instruments to understand if they are effective and efficient, or if anything need to be changed to reach the targets of the policy instrument.

J	Ulmanen, J; Bergek, A				Ulmanen, Johanna; Bergek, Anna			Influences of technological and sectoral contexts on technological innovation systems	ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS			English	Article						Functions approach; Context system; Context structure; Regime; Sustainable innovation; Bio-based chemicals	SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE; LOCK-IN; DYNAMICS; ENERGY; OPPORTUNITIES; MECHANISMS; INDUSTRIES; FRAMEWORK; OIL	This paper analyses how technological and sectoral context structures influence the functional pattern of a focal technological innovation system (TIS), focusing on value chain interdependencies. Through a case study of the 'embryonic' bio-succinate from mixed food waste TIS in Sweden, we show that all identified context structures exert both negative and positive influences on TIS functions by influencing resource availability and accessibility, market conditions and the wider selection environment. Contextual influences result from interdependencies throughout the value chain, but in contrast to previous studies, direct structural overlaps are not as relevant as competition for resources, markets and policy support. Competition does not only come from the regime but also from other related TISs and sectors. The study also confirms the importance of contextual influences from the international TIS. These findings suggest that a wide perspective on context structures and selection pressures should be considered in future research.

Aquafeed value chain analysis of striped catfish in Vietnam*	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Aquafeed subsector; Aquaculture; Value chain analysis; Striped catfish; Vietnam	MEKONG DELTA	The Vietnamese striped catfish (pangasius) production sub-sector is characterized by intensive pond production technology and high-quality production inputs. In 2014, annual production of pangasius was 1,143,797 t. The key actors in the value chain comprise input suppliers, including feed ingredients suppliers, feed manufacturers, and hatchery operators (seed producers), along with fingerling and grow-out farmers, fish processors, exporters, consumers and service providers. The pangasius production sector is centred in ten provinces of the Mekong Delta. The value chain analysis revealed that in 2014, there were 109 hatcheries in operation producing 23.6 billion larvae per annum. Hatchery-reared larvae were distributed across 2683 nurseries with a combined annual production of 2.58 billion fingerlings per annum. The grow-out sector comprised 5089 ponds operated as 143 enterprise farms (3389 ha ponds), 1490 family-run farms (1572 ha ponds), and 11 cooperatives (209 ha ponds). In grow-out production, the highest production cost was for feed, which accounted for about 81% of the total production cost. A total of 78 registered feed ingredient-trading companies supply an estimated 1.6 million tonnes of feed ingredients to feed manufacturers. 50.9% of feed ingredients used in aquatic and terrestrial animal feed in Vietnam are imported. The majority of imports comprise high quality protein sources such as fishmeal, poultry meal, meat & bone meal, blood meal, and soybean and canola oil seed meal. In addition, many of the feed additives used in the formulated feed are also imported. There are 48 commercial aquafeed manufacturers supplying the pangasius sector with high quality floating extruded feed. These facilities have an installed production capacity of 5,232,500 t/annum, with an average production capacity of 10,900 t/annum/manufacture. The feed manufacturing sector is centred in Dong Thap province where 26 of the 48 feed manufacturing facilities of the sector are located. Overall, the facilities operate below the installed capacity. In 2014, commercial feed production was estimated at 1,830,075 t (34% capacity), with a mean production cost of USD0.511 +/- 0.03/kg based on the grower feed formulation. Profit margins accruing to the feed manufacturing sector were estimated at 4.7%. The study found that farm-made feed production was negligible at (<10,000 t/annum). Feed is distributed through 882 feed wholesalers and retailers, registered as suppliers of pangasius feed. On average, wholesalers traded 643 t of feed per annum, with 94% supplying between 10 and 1000 t per annum. Profit margins for suppliers was estimated at 4.1%.

In recent years, the prevalence of NTS carrying multiple antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been increased. The genomic characterization along the pig value chain and the identification of ARGs and plasmids have the potential to improve food safety by understanding the dissemination of ARGs from the farm to the table. We report an analysis of 13 S. Derby and 10 S. Rissen isolates, collected in 2013 at different stages in Vietnamese slaughterhouses and markets. VITEK 2 Compact System was used to characterize the phenotypical antimicrobial resistance of the isolates. In addition, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to detect ARGs and plasmids conferring multidrug resistance. Whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism typing was used to determine the genetic diversity of the strains and the spread of ARGs along the pig value chain. Altogether, 86.9% (20/23) of the samples were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Resistance to ampicillin was most frequently detected (73.9%), followed by piperacillin and moxifloxacin (both 69.6%). At least one ARG was found in all strains, and 69.6% (16/23) were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The observed phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistance were not always concordant. Plasmid replicons were found in almost all strains [95.6% (22/23)], and the phylogenetic analysis detected nine clusters (S. Derby, n = 5; S. Rissen, n = 4). ARGs and plasmid content were almost identical within clusters. We found six MDR IncHI1s with identical plasmid sequence type in strains of different genetic clusters at the slaughterhouse and the market. In conclusion, high rates of multidrug resistance were observed in Salmonella strains from Vietnam in 2013. Genomic analysis revealed many resistance genes and plasmids, which have the potential to spread along the pig value chain from the slaughterhouse to the market. This study pointed out that bioinformatics analyses of WGS data are essential to detect, trace back, and control the MDR strains along the pig value chain. Further studies are necessary to assess the more recent MDR Salmonella strains spreading in Vietnam.</p>	[Gonzalez-Santamarina, Belen; Garcia-Soto, Silvia; Abdel-Glil, Mostafa Y.; Tomaso, Herbert] Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Bacterial Infect & Zoonoses, Jena, Germany;

J	Li, JJ; Li, YJ; Song, H; Fan, CX				Li, Jingjing; Li, Yongjian; Song, Hua; Fan, Chunxing			Sustainable value creation from a capability perspective: How to achieve sustainable product design	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Sustainable value; Capabilities; Product design; Value chain; Integration	SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT; ARCS	Studies that integrate sustainable value with capabilities and product design are scant. To bridge this gap, this study adopts an exploratory case study method to clarify the process of sustainable value creation in product design from the capability perspective. Drawing from present literature and case practices, we suggest a new sustainable value-creation system composed of three capabilities: value chain operations, internal integration and external integration. The sustainable value flows and relationships between them are distilled explicitly. Taking it toward theorizing, this paper complements capability-oriented operations strategies by disclosing the dominant role of value chain operations, the fundamental role of integration capability, and reciprocity between internal integration and external integration. Our verified framework provides a holistic and systemic perspective to companies who are willing to integrate sustainability in product design and contextualize the firm-level sustainable value streams. Organizations should periodically reassess this system to create sustainable value.

With a high market aggregate value, the production of cello-oligosaccharides (COS) as functional oligosaccharides from cellulosic substrates has been investigated. As COS/cellopentaose production process are rarely described in the literature, this study estimated the cellopentaose production cost and performed a life-cycle assessment of the cellopentaose production process previously developed using sugarcane straw as a substrate. The results demonstrated that, through the six scenarios studied, it was possible to obtain a cellopentaose unit production cost varying between USD 0.40 and 1.15/mg, and that optimization in the upstream sector can reduce the total plant direct cost and the overall life-cycle impact. The results also suggested that a better understanding of the hydrolysis solid/liquid proportion is necessary to reduce the bulk material cost. An environmental impact reduction of between 16.2% and 19.9% was also observed. In terms of the integrated biorefinery concept, sugarcane straw fermentation represents a prospective technology for the production of COS.

J	Chen, ZM				Chen, Zhaomeng			Seawater microbial environment detection and coastal port logistics management based on fuzzy image restoration	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Blurred image restoration; Seawater microorganisms; Coastal ports; Logistics management		Using fuzzy image restoration technology in adversarial networks to solve image recognition under fuzzy conditions is a topic worthy of study. This article introduces the basic information in the field of fuzzy image recognition and the current research status in the field of image recognition. At the same time, it summarizes the relevant results of image recognition under fuzzy conditions. Based on this point, this article discusses the problem of insufficient carbon source in raw water and uses sodium acetate as an additional carbon source to meet the requirements of seawater microbial denitrification and seawater extraction. Using the SMBR process of CAS-MBR and A/O-MBR, the removal efficiency of pollutants in the process of salt transportation management was further studied, and the mechanism of pollutant removal and the ability to inhibit marine microbial activity were discussed. SMP and EPS and their degradation characteristics were analyzed. Finally, the article summarizes relevant theories about project management, coastal port logistics management, supply chain, and cost chain. In the entire supply chain, coastal ports do not exist in isolation. They are connected with suppliers, manufacturers, and nodes (such as suppliers, container terminals, logistics companies, and other connected ports). The ultimate goal is to optimize the logistics management of the whole supply chain, not just part of self optimization . Both the value chain and the supply chain have capital flow, logistics, information flow, and process flow, but the focus of the value chain is the growth of value, while the focus of the supply chain is supply.

J	Guilhaume, N; Schuurman, Y; Geantet, C				Guilhaume, Nolven; Schuurman, Yves; Geantet, Christophe			The role of catalysis in the valorization of woody biomass fast pyrolysis liquids: Overview and contribution of IRCELYON	CATALYSIS TODAY			English	Article						Fast pyrolysis; Bio-liquids; Catalysis; Co-processing; Reforming; Upgrading	ORBITRAP MASS-SPECTROMETRY; BIO-OIL; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; GAS-OIL; INTEGRATED HYDROPYROLYSIS; SEQUENTIAL CRACKING; BLENDING COMPONENTS; FLASH PYROLYSIS; MODEL COMPOUNDS; DIESEL FUELS	The objective of this review article is to focus on the role of catalysis in the various pathways involved in the value chain of fast pyrolysis liquids produced from wood. During the last 15 years, IRCELYON has been involved in many of these routes. This article is mainly focused on the role of catalysts in bio-liquid conversion and coprocessing with petroleum feedstocks. We provide relevant references for each pathway and focus on the specific contributions of IRCELYON and on the most recent studies, not covered by previous reviews.

The plan aims at not only ensuring substantial material savings throughout value chains and production processes but also generating extra added value and unlocks economic opportunities. Within the European Atlantic area, commercial alliances and common interests in food production and consumption are numerous, particularly for seafood. To assess the benefits and disadvantages of potential changes in the technology regimes along the value chain, stakeholders need to be provided with tools to guarantee positive environmental and economic balance of new circular economy practice. The article investigates the use of economic methodologies to assess the performance of circular economy practice in existing scientific literature dealing with fisheries, aquaculture, or seafood production sectors. As demonstrated in other sectors, the lack of studies on socioeconomic dimension limits the ability for decision-makers to mainstream circular economy practices into existing business models. Different economic performance assessment tools that could help bring valuable arguments to design transformative economic systems are reviewed.

Consumer trust in the dairy value chain in China: The role of trustworthiness, the melamine scandal, and the media	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						consumer trust; food safety; dairy value chain; food scandal; media influence	FOOD SAFETY; SOCIAL MEDIA; PERCEPTIONS; FARMERS; CONSUMPTION; CONFIDENCE; GOVERNMENT; PRODUCTS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM	decision-making for food purchases (Coveney, 2008). As a much-cited definition by Rousseau et al. (1998, p. 395) states, trust is defined as a "psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another." Faced with the increasing complexity of the food supply chain, consumers cannot easily assess credence attributes such as food safety and determine whether the food they purchase meets their expectation (Lassoued and Hobbs, 2014). Trust in the food value chain could compensate for consumers' lack of knowledge of food cultivation and production processes This study provides a deep insight into Chinese consumer trust in the Chinese dairy value chain, as a lack of trust due to the 2008 melamine scandal has been widely recognized as a barrier to the development of the domestic dairy industry in China. Based on face-to-face interviews with 954 Chinese consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shijiazhuang, this study measured consumer trust in farmers, manufacturers, retailers, the government, and third parties. Consumer trust was studied by measuring the effect of beliefs on the trustworthiness of actors (i.e., competence, benevolence, integrity, credibility, and openness), and current experiences regarding the melamine scandal and the media. The results showed that the level of trust in dairy chain actors varied. The government and third parties were relatively highly trusted, whereas retailers were considered less trustworthy. The importance of consumer beliefs about trustworthiness are different among actors. Consumer belief of competence determines trust in farmers and manufacturers. For retailers, the government, and third parties, respectively, benevolence, credibility, and openness are the most important factors. Trust in dairy chain actors is still strongly negatively affected by current experiences regarding the melamine scandal, even though it occurred more than 10 years ago. Using social media to directly provide more information and establish continuous daily communication with consumers could help manufacturers and third parties to strengthen consumer trust.

Drawing upon analysis of the compulsory Survey of Innovation and Business Strategy (SIBS) administered by Statistics Canada, this paper investigates how and why natural resource industries innovate. We show that natural resource firms are leaders in the use of advanced technologies, rely less on intellectual property protection and R&D in favor of quasiintegration with suppliers as a source of innovation that is often fueled by regulatory compliance.

Analysing price volatility in agricultural value chains using systems thinking: A case study of the Indonesian chilli value chain	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Causal loops; Governance; Oscillation behaviour; Smallholder farmers; System archetypes	TRANSMISSION; MARKETS; POLICY	CONTEXT: High price volatility in agricultural commodities can be a major issue for value chain actors exposed to its adverse economic impacts. Price volatility results from the interaction of multiple factors linked within dynamic and complex agricultural systems. Therefore, to address price volatility, the approach needs to be capable of analysing feedback that occurs in such complex systems. OBJECTIVE: We integrate a systems thinking approach and value chain analysis to overcome the constraint of other methods to explicitly describe and understand how system structure influences system behaviour observed in price volatility and the assessment of the consequences of ex-ante and ex-post policy interventions based on this understanding. METHODS: The proposed integrated approach involves the active participation of value chain actors and stakeholders to improve their understanding of the complex systems they operate within including the policy environment. The approach takes the Indonesian chilli value chain as a case study. We implemented the first two steps of systems thinking (i.e., articulating problems and formulating dynamic hypotheses). In the group model building processes, we developed causal loop diagrams to represent a dynamic hypothesis that explains the feedback loops that cause price oscillation behaviour and systems archetypes that identify potential intervention points. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: The integrated approach was able to link the Indonesian chilli value chain's system structure and the system behaviour observed in price volatility. The causal loop diagram clearly displays the feedback between production, market governance, consumption, and price. The diagram also portrays how these factors impact value chain actors' performance and the influence of time delays and random shocks on the entire value chain system. Limits to growth and shifting the burden archetypes were identified as critical leverage points in formulating fundamental policy interventions to address price volatility. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the strengths of the proposed approach in developing a comprehensive dynamic qualitative model of a whole value chain system that influences the system behaviour, such as oscillation, which other modelling studies do not consider. The use of system archetypes to identify intervention points is another research contribution in that it improves value chain analysis. The results also highlight the benefits of participatory system dynamics modelling in enhancing the learning of value chain actors in anticipating the consequences of any actions or random shocks on the entire systems.

Humans are exposed to AFM1 mainly through the consumption of aflatoxin contaminated milk and foods. Determining levels of AFM1 is of significant public health importance due to the risk of exposure to breastfeeding infants. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of AFM1 in BM and assess factors associated with BM AFM1 levels in mothers. Data, collected between July 2015 and July 2017, were derived from the Aflacohort study (n = 1675) in Banke district, of Province 5 in the south-west region of Nepal. AFM1 was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with a lower limit of detection of 0.04 ng/L (ng/L). Multivariate linear and quantile regression models were used to examine the relationship of factors with AFM1, including mother?s age, food consumption and body mass index, as well as, seasonality and wealth quintiles. Approximately 94% of BM samples had detectable levels of AFM1 (geometric mean 0.78 ng/L and range 0.04 ng/L to 315.99 ng/L). The consumption of particular foods such as yogurt, milk, hydrogenated oil and ripe pumpkin was positively associated with BM AFM1 levels (p-value <0.05), while consumption of legumes was associated with lower BM AFM1 levels (p-value <0.05). Seasonal influences were significant, with BM collected in the pre-winter and winter seasons exhibiting significantly higher AFM1 levels compared to the spring (p-value <0.05). These results suggest near-ubiquitous presence of aflatoxin in the food supply of this part of Nepal, and possible exposure of AFM1 to infants through BM of mothers. The findings justify integrated strategies across the value chain and at household level to identify dietary sources of aflatoxin exposure, proper post-harvest management and monitoring for aflatoxin control and mitigation.

J	Ramasoota, P; Kitikamdhorn, A				Ramasoota, Pirongrong; Kitikamdhorn, Abhibhu			"The Netflix effect" in Thailand: Industry and regulatory implications	TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY			English	Article						VoD; OTT; Globalization; Thailand; Netflix; Content streaming		This study examines the economic, technological and cultural implications of Netflix in Thailand on local content industries and regulators. It also explores industry and regulatory responses to Netflix's emergence in a small market like Thailand. The study finds Netflix has markedly affected the industries' value chain but with contrasting impacts for broadcasting and film. Broadcasters have migrated online either by establishing their own platforms or by repositioning themselves as content providers for international streaming players in addition to acquiring business deals with other OTTs or broadcasters in regional markets. For film, a window of opportunity has been created by Netflix for small and independent filmmakers wishing to bypass the long-standing monopoly in the Thai film industry. Meanwhile, the country's regulator has looked for ways to bring foreign OTTs like Netflix under its oversight and may adopt a reward-based scheme while promoting local content industry with capacity-building and promotional measures.

That is, the global economic system is always changing to form one dynamic equilibrium after another. In this paper, a nestedness-based analytical framework is used to define the generalist and specialist sectors for the purpose of analyzing the changes in the global supply pattern. We study why the global economic system can reach a stable equilibrium, what the role of different sectors play in the steady status, and how to enhance the stability of the global economic system. In detail, the domestic trade network, export trade network and import trade network of each country are extracted. Then, an econometric model is designed to analyze how the microstructure of the production system affects a country's macroeconomic performance.

This situation in the power sector has also hampered the growth of allied economic sectors. This study uses the Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) system for simulating Pakistan's electrical system from 2016 to 2040. It has forecasted the electricity demand at the provincial level. At the supply side, five scenarios Business as Usual Scenario (BAUS), Coal Scenario (CS), Gas Scenario (GS), Nuclear Scenario (NS), and Renewable Scenario (RS) have been analysed based on the technoeconomic and environmental parameters. The study has also included environmental externality costs for evaluating the actual costs and benefits of different scenarios. Contrary to the expectations, RS has a lower generation than even BAUS. The study has concluded that the generation from RS has five times lesser costs than BAUS, CS, and GS. NS can also be an alternative for the sustainable future of Pakistan. Generation from imported coal is not a good option, however, indigenous coal with clean coal technologies should be promoted. This paper proposes energy planners of the country to devise incentives for the utilization of indigenous energy resources including renewables on priority and then clean coal to reduce the energy crises of Pakistan.

A New Rapid Method for the Authentication of Common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris) in Seafood Products Using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) and Lateral Flow Assay (LFA)	FOODS			English	Article						Octopus; Octopus vulgaris; RPA; Lateral Flow detection; species authentication; seafood control	IDENTIFICATION; DNA; OMMASTREPHIDAE; LOLIGINIDAE; MEAT	The common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) is a highly valued cephalopod species which is marketed with different grades of processing, such as frozen, cooked or even canned, and is likely to be mislabeled. Some molecular methods have been developed for the authentication of these products, but they are either labor-intensive and/or require specialized equipment and personnel. This work describes a newly designed rapid, sensitive and easy-to-use method for the detection of Octopus vulgaris in food products, based on Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) and a detection using a Lateral Flow assay (LFA). After studying several gene markers, a system of primers and nfo-probe was designed in the COI (Cytochrome Oxidase I) region and was successfully tested in 32 reference samples (covering 14 species) and 32 commercial products, after optimization. The method was also validated in a ring trial with eight European laboratories and represents a useful tool for food authenticity control at all levels of the value chain.

J	Hoang, V				Viet Hoang			Impact of Contract Farming on Farmers' Income in the Food Value Chain: A Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Study in Vietnam	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						agriculture; contract farming; income; sustainability; theoretical analysis; Vietnam	MARKETING PREFERENCES; EAST JAVA; WELFARE; AGRICULTURE; PRODUCERS; RISK; PARTICIPATION; COORDINATION; SMALLHOLDERS; SUPERMARKETS	This study empirically analyzes the influence of contract farming on income and farming difficulties in Vietnam by using the econometric models and theoretically identifying the affecting mechanism of contract farming on income, sustainability, and welfare by using the qualitative method. The empirical results show that contract farming insignificantly impacts farms' income while it can facilitate farming activities and decrease difficulties. The factors of education-head, gender of head, type of crop, and technology may affect farmers' income. The impacting mechanism of contract farming on income, sustainability, and welfare is theoretically proposed as follows: Contract farming initially impacts the intermediate factors such as cooperative, market access, knowledge and skill, product quality, technology, and support. These factors then affect capacity, linkage, quality, and certification which can enhance farmers' competitiveness. In the long term, stronger competitiveness, higher price, increasing productivity, and lower cost may significantly improve income, sustainability, and welfare. In general, contract farming may have positive impacts on income, sustainability, and welfare in the medium term and long term. In the short term, the result is not significant due to the similar or lower price comparing with the spot market price, growing production cost, decreasing productivity, and weak contract performance. The findings may help policymakers decide how to expand contract farming and its benefits. Economic scholars can test and compare both quantitative and qualitative findings in other contexts.

J	Wu, G; Pu, Y; Shu, TR				Wu, Gang; Pu, Yue; Shu, Tianran			Features and evolution of global energy trade network based on domestic value-added decomposition of export	ENERGY			English	Article						Global energy trade; Complex network; Global value chains; Domestic value-added; Multiple regression quadratic assignment; procedure	FOSSIL-FUEL TRADE; INPUT-OUTPUT; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; FLOWS	With the extension and expansion of the global value chain of energy, the traditional trade accounting method is no longer able to reflect the intrinsic value flow and country gains of energy trade, which render it necessary to further analyze the value added of energy trade from the perspective of global value chain (GVC). Against this backdrop, we construct the Global Energy Trade Domestic Value-added (DVA) network and three sub-networks of it by means of the new trade accounting system, and shed light on the topological features and major driving factors of those networks, and get the following results. First, at the macro level, the growing DVA networks exhibit vivid core-periphery structure, display "small world" characteristics in the early stage but have the average path lengths increased later. At the medium level, the DVA networks are split into 3 communities, and the community structure of the trade for intermediate energy products remains constant, but the trade for final energy products is volatile. At the micro level, advanced and emerging economies stay at the core of global energy trade and play key intermediary roles. The USA and Germany are key players in the downstream and intermediate part of the GVC of the energy sector, while China is the core economy that imports intermediate energy products to manufacture final products for domestic consumption. Finally, economic and population resultant forces, historical links, bilateral trade agreements, especially common language and common currency are important driving factors of DVA network and its sub-networks.

There are neither licensed vaccines nor treatments available, and even though humans are not susceptible to the disease, the serious socio-economic consequences associated with ASF have made it one of the most serious animal diseases of the last century. In this context, prevention and early detection play a key role in controlling the disease and avoiding losses in the pig value chain. Target biosecurity measures are a strong strategy against ASF virus (ASFV) incursions in farms nowadays, but to be efficient, these measures must be well-defined and easy to implement, both in commercial holdings and in the backyard sector. Furthermore, the backyard sector is of great importance in low-income settings, mainly for social and cultural practices that are highly specific to certain areas and communities. These contexts need to be addressed when authorities decide upon the provisions that should be applied in the case of infection or decide to combine them with strict preventive measures to mitigate the risk of virus spread. The need for a deeper understanding of the smallholder context is essential to prevent ASFV incursion and spread. Precise indications for pig breeding and risk estimation for ASFV introduction, spread and maintenance, taking into account the fact that these recommendations would be inapplicable in some contexts, are the keys for efficient target control measures. The aim of this work is to describe the 305 outbreaks that occurred in domestic pigs in Sardinia during the last epidemic season (2010-2018) in depth, providing essential features associated with intensive and backyard farms where the outbreaks occurred. In addition, the study estimates the average of secondary cases by kernel transmission network. Considering the current absence of ASF outbreaks in domestic pig farms in Sardinia since 2018, this work is a valid tool to specifically estimate the risk associated with different farm types and update our knowledge in this area.

J	Reyes-Belmonte, MA				Reyes-Belmonte, Miguel Angel			The energy and environment connection, research trends based on a bibliometric analysis	ENERGY ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Energy; Environment; Research; Bibliometrics; Scientometrics; Renewables	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CONSUMPTION; IMPACT	Energy and environmental topics are tightly linked and cannot be understood without each other especially under the stringent legislation policies and environmental social awareness. Both are considered hot scientific research topics with more than 5 million documents archived on the Web of Science until the year 2019. Based on a vast number of publications, this work proposes a bibliometrics approach to derive scientific connections and to envision future research trends based on semantic analysis and networking landscape representations. The study found that research trends have evolved from a theoretical approach to a more general point of view related to the optimization and integration of renewable energy applications. In particular, the whole energy value chain from harvesting to consumption (including distribution, storage, management and conservation) is the trendiest area of current research and especially its application to the building environment. Those research areas are strongly supported by the recent developments on the internet of things and wireless sensor networks.

J	Agyabeng, AN; Preko, A				Agyabeng, Anthony Nkrumah; Preko, Alexander			A stakeholder analysis of government policy intervention in the Ghanaian slum communities	HOUSING CARE AND SUPPORT			English	Article; Early Access						Ghana; Stakeholder; Informal settlement; National policy; Slums upgrading; Slums prevention; Government commitment	INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS	Purpose Slum upgrading has received intense attention in the Global South, particularly among stakeholders. This study aims to examine government policy priorities towards slum management with the view of establishing its level of commitment in terms of measures undertaken and identify specific policies to structure the sector. Design/methodology/approach The study systematically reviewed national policies, guided by the frequency statistics method in identifying key issues relating to slums management. Content analysis was used to identify findings into themes and discussed in line with the study's objectives. Findings The results revealed the government's determination to upgrade the existing slums, with the establishment of a Ministry for Inner City and Zongo Development to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders in the value chain of slum management. Furthermore, the study established government's resolve to strengthen the Local Government Act, 1993, and the National Development Planning Act, 1994 within context to pave way for slums upgrading. Research limitations/implications The study used a national policy framework to inform the conclusion reached. Further studies are needed in similar contexts to understand the inputs of government and stakeholders and their contributions towards slum management. This would further expand the frontiers of knowledge in the domain. Practical implications The findings revealed policy-driven that can be used by policymakers, practitioners, housing managers and other relevant stakeholders to create workable policies for slum management. Originality/value This study provides first insight into government commitment to slums management using national policy documents in context.

The social organisational life cycle assessment (SO-LCA) of the academic activity of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), in northern Spain, has been performed, in order to estimate its social impacts. Method The assessment has been run using openLCA software and supported on the PSILCA-based Soca add-on for the Ecoinvent v3.3 database, covering 53 social indicators for almost 15,000 industrial sectors and goods in 189 countries. Results and discussion The analysis undertaken reflects social impacts and associated risk levels for four stakeholders: Workers, Local Community, Society, and Value Chain Actors. Labour activity in the UPV/EHU is the sub-process with the greatest social impact, followed by processes related to transport, energy, materials, and waste management. Among the socio-economic context which supports the academic activity of the UPV/EHU (indirect impacts), the existence of traces of child labour and illiteracy outside the Basque Country stands out. Further analysis would be required in order to more accurately determine the geographical location of such impacts, and also to better tackle the concept of social debt. Conclusion SO-LCA may have great potential for HEIs, helping them to identify hotspots, reduce their social footprint, and raise awareness among the academic community, which undoubtedly contributes to the knowledge, progress, human values, and sustainability these HEIs stand for.

J	Weber, H; Wiek, A				Weber, Hanna; Wiek, Arnim			Cooperating With "Open Cards"-The Role of Small Intermediary Businesses in Realizing Sustainable International Coffee Supply	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						global food supply; value chains; small businesses; fair prices; transformation; transdisciplinarity	FAIR-TRADE; VALUE CHAIN; FARMERS; CONSTRAINTS; STANDARDS	Despite improvements, international food supply in general and coffee supply in particular continue to cause significant greenhouse gas emissions, economic inequities, and negative impacts on human well-being. There is agreement that dominant economic paradigms need to change to comply with the sustainability principles of environmental integrity, economic resilience, and social equity. However, so far, little empirical evidence has been generated to what extent and under which conditions sustainable international coffee supply could be realized through small intermediary businesses such as roasteries, breweries, and/or retailers. This case study reports on a collaborative project between a small coffee brewery and its customers in the U.S. and a small coffee roastery and its suppliers in Mexico that demonstrates how sustainable coffee supply could look like and explores under which conditions it can be realized. A research team facilitated the cooperation using a transdisciplinary research approach, including field visits and stakeholder workshops. The project (i) assessed the sustainability challenges of the current supply and value chains; (ii) developed a vision of a joint sustainable coffee supply chain; (iii) build a strategy to achieve this vision, and (iv) piloted the implementation of the strategy. We discuss the project results against the conditions for sustainable international coffee supply offered in the literature (why they were fulfilled, or not). Overall, the study suggests that small intermediary coffee businesses might have the potential to infuse sustainability across their supply chain if cooperating with "open cards. " The findings confirm some and add some conditions, including economic resilience through cooperation, problem recognition, transparency, trust, and solidarity across the supply chain. The study concludes with reflections on study limitations and future research needs.

J	Bhattacharyya, SS; Shah, Y				Bhattacharyya, Som Sekhar; Shah, Yash			Emerging technologies in Indian mining industry: an exploratory empirical investigation regarding the adoption challenges	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Mining-industry; Emerging technologies; Diffusion of innovation; Blockchain; Internet of things (IoT); Digitization and automation; Technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) framework	QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; USER ACCEPTANCE; DETERMINANTS; RELIABILITY; INTERRATER; DIFFUSION; HEALTH; MODEL; DIE	Purpose Emerging technologies have been transforming most industries. A wide range of emerging technologies such as blockchain, internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotics and many others have changed the way in which firm value chain activities or processes were executed traditionally. The mining industry has also witnessed the introduction of these emerging technologies in various processes from the exploration stage to the final processing of ores. The purpose of this paper is to understand the pace of adoption of emerging technologies in the Indian mining industry and identify the challenges that managers confront while adopting emerging technologies. Design/methodology/approach The authors undertook qualitative research. Data collection was done in two stages. Secondary research was conducted to arrive at a repository of use cases of the adoption of emerging technologies in the global mining industry. Primary data collection was also done. The insights on emerging technology adoption and challenges faced in the Indian mining industry were captured by in-depth interviewing of subject matter experts. The authors interviewed 21 mining subject matter experts with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. The responses were content analyzed by thematic content analysis. Technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) frameworks were applied to segregate different factors affecting the adoption of emerging technologies in the Indian mining industry. Findings Emerging technologies such as blockchain, IoT, AI, ML, robotics has been applied across various mining engineering value chain activities such as in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling. However, emerging technologies adoption was hindered because of a lack of managerial awareness, cultural inertia, substantive upfront investments and the nature of intangible benefits in the short run. Research limitations/implications The research applied technology adoption frameworks in the mining industry. The authors used TOE and DOI frameworks to understand the challenges faced by Indian mining firms. The research findings, thus added to the conversation of TOE and DOI frameworks in the context of the Indian mining industry. Practical implications The research finding would help mining firm managers to anticipate the challenges with respect to technology adoption. This would allow mining executives to create a proper technology adoption plan and intervene proactively. The research would also provide information about the steps taken by competing firms with respect to emerging technologies adoption. The research would help managers to decide technology implementation steps in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling to be undertaken for successful adoption of emerging technologies. Technology firms could gain insights into the issues faced by mining firms in adopting emerging technologies. This research would help managers to influence organizational technology policy and endorse the addition of pro-technology policies in mining activities. Policymakers involved in the mining sector could also incorporate industry-level policy decisions so as to facilitate the adoption of emerging technologies among mining firms and remove the barriers to the adoption of emerging technologies. This would create an opportunity for technology providers to redesign product offerings, which could be a good fit for Indian mining firms. Originality/value Indian mining industry contributed significantly to the Indian economy. Despite this, limited focus has been put regarding the adoption of emerging technologies in the mining industry. Mining managers did not have any framework to understand the challenges faced in the adoption of technologies across the mining value chain that is in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling. This study focused on identifying those challenges through the use of technology adoption frameworks. This research was one of the first studies to gain insights on emerging technologies adoption in the context of the mining industry through the theoretical lens of TOE and DOI frameworks.

J	Bahl, M; Lahiri, S				Bahl, Mona; Lahiri, Somnath			Managing global value chain triversity and innovation performance using social mechanisms	THUNDERBIRD INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						diversity; global value chain; innovation performance; social mechanism	RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; NETWORKS; LOCATION; STRATEGY; CONNECTIVITY; FIRM	Scholarly interest in global value chain (GVC) has gained momentum in recent years, yet a comprehensive framework that elucidates how GVC affects an important firmlevel outcome-innovation performance (IP)-is so far elusive. To address this gap, we develop a conceptual framework related to three diversities (activity, governance structure, and partner location) that lead firms in GVC utilize in order to enhance IP. We draw upon the GVC and social capital research to develop the framework. We propose that the three diversities (collectively termed as triversity) have the potential to affect lead firms' IP positively as well as negatively. We further propose that mechanisms related to the three dimensions of social capital (relational, cognitive, and structural) help augment the positive effects and mitigate the negative effects of triversity on IP. This article contributes to the understanding of the relationship between GVC triversity, IP, and social mechanism.

However, despite decades of research on RDTs and a relatively permissive regulatory environment in the UK, few devices are in commercial use. Challenges discussed by RDT developers included identifying commercially-viable targets, and management of the innovation ecosystem, e.g. to create clear pathways to market supporting positive interactions between farmers, vets, and other actors along the value chain. Future support for RDT development could be provided through incorporation in: assured food systems; business service packages provided by centralised laboratories; or animal health monitoring packages related to the spread of AMR. Breeding stock sales could require an accompanying health package including RDTs, vaccines and/or antibiotics, linking to precision agriculture approaches. Unlike the example of RDT development for COVID-19, it seems that the urgency of the issue and the clarity of links between animal and human health outcomes are not yet sufficient to support a fast-tracking programme for the development of RDTs to combat AMR.

J	Xia, HS; Weng, J				Xia, Huosong; Weng, Juan			Effectiveness of industry-university-research cooperation in China: impact of innovation input and open innovation environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Open innovation; Effectiveness of IURC; Marginal effect; Innovation value chain theory; R&D mechanism	DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; ACADEMIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP; TRIPLE-HELIX; COLLABORATION; FIRMS; PERFORMANCE; GENERATION; FRAMEWORK; SUBSIDIES	Purpose Industry-university-research cooperation (IURC) is a crucial way to build an innovative country. How to improve the effectiveness of IURC has become an important issue to be solved urgently. Design/methodology/approach This paper studies the data of industry, university and research activities in various regions of China from 2016 to 2018 and analyzes the impact mechanism of innovation input and open innovation environment on the effectiveness of IURC based on innovation value chain theory. Findings This research finds that innovative talent input has an inverted U-shaped impact on the effectiveness of IURC. When there are more innovative funds invested, the marginal effect of IURC will decrease. When innovative talent input exceeds a certain value, the open innovation environment can alleviate the positive marginal effect of its decline. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature and provides practical guidelines for improving the efficacy of IURC.

J	Thamthanakoon, N; Huang, IY; Eastham, J; Ward, S; Manning, L				Thamthanakoon, Nithicha; Huang, Iona Yuelu; Eastham, Jane; Ward, Shane; Manning, Louise			Factors driving Thailand rice farmer decision-making in the choice of marketing channel	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Decision-making; Structural equation modeling (SEM); Rice farmers; Theory of reasoned action (TRA); Marketing channel choice; Transaction condition	PLANNED BEHAVIOR; COOPERATIVES; SATISFACTION; PREFERENCES; PRODUCERS; INTENTION; ATTITUDES; MODELS; GOALS; TRUST	Purpose Since the end of the latest rice-pledging scheme, Thai rice farmers have had more freedom in selecting marketing channels. Understanding the determinants of farmers' decision-making associated with these channels is of particular interest to multiple stakeholders in the rice value chain. This study aims to examine how economic, relational and psychological factors concurrently underpin Thai rice farmers' decision-making and influence their marketing channel choice. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the theory of reasoned action and utility maximization of farmers' decision making, this study used structural equation modeling to examine data collected from a nationwide sample of Thai rice farmers (n = 637), focusing on their past and intentional use of the three major marketing channels for paddy rice. Findings The determinants identified include four direct independent variables: attitude, subjective norm (social referents), transaction conditions and economic goals, and two indirect independent variables: past behavior and trust. Multi-group analysis suggests that rice co-operative users were more empowered to consider economic goals and attitude toward the channel, whilst rice miller and local collector users were more likely to be influenced by their social referents and the transaction conditions offered by the channel. Practical implications The findings highlight the need for policy to address trust and transparency issues with intermediaries and to empower farmers through the improvement of market access. Originality/value The study makes a unique and substantive contribution to the knowledge of farmers' decision-making about marketing channel choice in Thailand and theoretically contributes to the indirect role of past behavior in predicting prospective intention.

J	Ahmed, RR; Zhang, XQ				Ahmed, Rana Rabnawaz; Zhang, Xueqing			Multi-layer value stream assessment of the reverse logistics network for inert construction waste management	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Reverse logistics; Inert construction waste; Network design; Value stream mapping; Indicator performance; Sustainability; Lean management	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; COMPARATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION; SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; MAPPING SUS-VSM; DEMOLITION WASTE; RECYCLED CONSTRUCTION; AGGREGATE PRODUCTION; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; ROUTING PROBLEM	Reverse logistics (RL) concepts have brought sustainable solutions to the problems pertinent to inert construction waste (ICW) management. However, the involvement of different processes and facilities across the RL value chain makes it difficult to visualize and manage the whole process conveniently. Consequently, issues such as inadequate assessment of environmental hazards, unclear cost accrual patterns, misleading information to stakeholders, and other process-related deficiencies arise, thereby questioning the overall sustainability and alike circularity concepts. Despite the prominent role of lean management (LM) concepts in process improvements across various product-oriented sectors, its integration within RL management to solve ICW problems is almost non-existent. This paper presents a unique lean thinking-based multi-layer value stream assessment (MVSA) approach deriving from a conventional value stream mapping (VSM) technique to assess the overall RL network of ICW management. RL network design entails both facility-based and non-facility-based processes, with four different value streams, i.e., time, cost, environmental quality, and process efficiency aspects. A case study of Hong Kong demonstrates the developed MVSA approach. The case study features an assessment of the RL network's current and future states, considering multiple scenarios. Furthermore, a detailed sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide valuable insights and discussions. In the end, an agenda for continuous improvement related to the proposed MVSA approach is expounded. The research findings verify that the proposed MVSA approach can significantly contribute to the overall process improvement, better visualization, and RL network assessment, leading to effective waste management systems.

The present paper focuses on the possible use of nepheline syenite, originated as a mine byproduct, in alumina production through leaching with an azeotropic HCl solution. Previous work on nepheline syenite dissolution focused more on the extraction of potassium and sodium values. In this work, emphasis is given at the characteristics and leachability of aluminum content phases by applying a high temperature HCl leaching in untreated material. From this point of view, leaching experiments were conducted on nepheline syenite, at a temperature range of 90 degrees C to 150 degrees C and with aqueous azeotropic HCl solution. Leaching, in the aforementioned conditions, is a process, characterized by medium aluminum dissolution. The results show that the aluminum-bearing phases that withstand the dissolution process are mainly the ones of sodium and potassium feldspars.

Using the Creating Shared Value (CSV) framework, we apply the case study method in examining the Peruvian Cacao Alliance's experience in redesigning both the stages and relationships within its supply of cacao to the world. Data were collected from both primary and secondary sources and analyzed after coding from categories defined in the literature on CSV. The case demonstrates the opportunity to successfully participate in the supply chains of globally recognized, consumer-facing chocolate brands while simultaneously obtaining social, economic and environmental benefits for the rural communities that supply cacao. While addressing both social and business gains remains fairly important for supply chain members, there are several implementation challenges that need to be considered to achieve the goals of CSV strategies in a sustained way. By analyzing the experience of this particular cacao value chain, we are able to offer practical insight on how to more effectively implement the creating shared value approach, thereby illuminating that it is possible for value generated through such supply chains to be more equitably shared. As such, we provide a valuable initial step in better understanding how the CSV concept applies in practice by identifying its boundary conditions for achieving improved cacao supply chain practices and relationships.

However, very few studies have assessed the effect of multiple technologies on PHL incurred at various stages of a food value chain. This study evaluated the effect of five technologies (harvesting tools, cold stores, plastic crates, fruit fly traps, and ground tarps) promoted by the Rockefeller Foundation Yieldwise Initiative (YWI) in Kenya on PHL incurred at three mango value chain stages (harvest, transportation, and point of sale). After extensive screening of the YWI data, the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used to compare each YWI promoted technology to smallholder farmers (SHF) traditional practices. Results indicated that plastic crates used to transport or store mangos and fruit fly traps used to attract and kill fruit flies were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in reducing PHL at the point of sale. Meanwhile, no statistical evidence of PHL reduction was observed from SHF using harvesting tools, cold stores, and ground tarps. Cold stores were the least adopted of the promoted technologies due to their high costs of implementation and utilization. While this study asserts that increased technology adoption is associated with PHL reduction, further research is needed to identify additional factors that favor technologies' efficacy in reducing PHL in similar food value chains.

Physicochemical parameters and functional properties of flours from advanced genotypes and improved cassava varieties for industrial applications	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cassava genotypes; Cassava flour; Functional properties; Chemical properties; Cassava starch	STARCH; ROOTS; FOOD	Cassava has potential for many industrial uses, which provide an opportunity for more rewarding markets. Therefore, significant research on improved varieties, targeting industrial applications, is required as a possible approach to spur improvements in the value chain. To this end, this study evaluated the physicochemical parameters and functional properties of ten (10) improved cassava genotypes for fast-tracking adaptable and preferred cassava genotypes for industrial use. The genotypes were collected from a multi-location (Uniform yield Trial) trial of the IITA breeding program in Malawi. Their flour samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters and functional properties compared with currently marketed High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF). Results show that genotype effect on overall quality characteristics endearing to industrial applications was significant, allowing identification of industry preferred genotypes. Starch and amylopectin content are the major determinants of variability in the cassava flours' functional properties, such as water and oil absorption capacities, solubility, and swelling power. Overall, genotypes I020452 and I010040, and the released variety Sagonja have a high starch and amylopectin content, high bulk density, and all the analysed functional properties. These genotypes showed comparable/or superior functional properties to market HQCF.	[Chimphepo, Lifa; Monjerezi, Maurice; Saka, John D.

In aquacultural systems, insects are gaining interest as feed to provide a sustainable alternative to the fishmeal paradox, whose production leads to high consumption of resources and negative environmental impacts. Within the scope of this study, the production of fish feed from Hermetia illucens larvae and Lemna minor in an inline recirculating aquaponics model for urban sites was developed and optimized, which efficiently combines waste and environmental service concepts in one production system. At the same time, the value chain produces high-quality, market-accessible raw materials for the fish feed industry. All investigations were accompanied by a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to measure and compare ecological effects to finally result in sustainable alternatives. The results achieved in this research show that fish feed based on Hermetia illucens and Lemna minor can have the potential to be ecologically competitive or more sustainable than standard feed. It should be noted that the comparison here represents the results of the project on a pilot scale. Various optimization potentials were shown, which are essential for the large-scale implementation of the breeding of both species as well as their processing up to the fish feed pellets.

J	Lee, SY				Lee, Su-Yol			Sustainable Supply Chain Management, Digital-Based Supply Chain Integration, and Firm Performance: A Cross-Country Empirical Comparison between South Korea and Vietnam	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable supply chain management; digital-based supply chain integration; operational performance; comparative analysis; structural equation modeling	IMPACT; IMPLEMENTATION; COMPETITIVENESS; RESPONSIBILITY; CAPABILITIES; METAANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; COMMITMENT; FRAMEWORK; DRIVERS	Sustainability and digitization issues have coevolved in supply chain management (SCM), receiving attention from the academic and business circles. However, few studies have addressed this topic in an integrated way. In this regard, this study examined the relationships between sustainable SCM, digital-based supply chain integration, and supplying firms' performance in two different country settings: South Korea and Vietnam. This comparative study provides evidence that sustainable SCM facilitates the adoption and implementation of supply chain integration using digital technologies, leading to suppliers' operational competitiveness. This study also indicates the differences and similarities of sustainable SCM and its effects in the two different economies. These findings provide scholars, managers, and policymakers with theoretical and practical implications to encourage firms in Asian countries to enhance corporate competitiveness by adequately responding to environmental and social issues and digitalization along the global value chain.

J	Mani, V; Gunasekaran, A				Mani, Venkatesh; Gunasekaran, Angappa			Upstream complex power relationships and firm's reputation in global value chains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Global value chains; Ethical issues; Value chain perspective; Governance mechanisms	VALUE CO-CREATION; SUPPLY CHAIN; GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS; SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; METHOD VARIANCE; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; IMPACT; FOOD	Previous research into the upstream supply chain governance mechanisms that focal firms use with suppliers to improve their ethical performance and reputation is incipient. The original contribution includes the development of empirical model using global value chain and transaction cost perspective by exploring the complex power relationship between upstream supply chain governance mechanisms (Modular, relational and captive), value co-creation efforts, sustainable ethical performance and reputation through an original survey of companies from an emerging economy - India. The results indicate that, supplier modular and relational governance mechanisms have an impact on suppliers' ethical performance, supply chain performance and reputation. Additionally, suppliers' ethical performance plays a mediating role between governance mechanisms in upstream supply chain networks and the supply chain performance and reputation of focal companies. In agreement with the literature, focal firms' sustainability-related value co-creation activities were found to positively influences the ethical performance of both suppliers' and focal firms' reputation. This provides implications for practitioners which was previously unknown with respect to food supply chains.

J	Martinez-Hernandez, E; Amezcua-Allieri, MA; Aburto, J				Martinez-Hernandez, Elias; Amezcua-Allieri, Myriam A.; Aburto, Jorge			Assessing the Cost of Biomass and Bioenergy Production in Agroindustrial Processes	ENERGIES			English	Article						biomass CHP; biomass cost; bioenergy cost; biomass netback; agave bagasse; coffee pulp; orange peels	TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS; COMBINED HEAT; SMALL-SCALE; BIO-ENERGY; POWER; VALORIZATION; BIOREFINERY; COMBUSTION; GENERATION; EFFICIENCY	This paper presents bioenergy value chain modelling to estimate the biomass and bioenergy cost of production and biomass netback in combined heat and power (CHP) systems. Modelling compares biomass cost and netback to analyse the feasibility of CHP systems, as well as the internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PBP). Models are implemented into the IMP Bio2Energy(R) software (Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo, Mexico City, Mexico) for practical application and demonstrated for bioenergy generation in the agroindustrial processes of tequila production, coffee and orange processing using as biomass the agave bagasse, coffee pulp and orange peels coproducts, respectively. Results show that the CHP systems are economically feasible, i.e., biomass cost of production is lower than netback, PBP between 3 and 4 years and IRR > 20%. The cost of bioenergy is lower than the cost of fuel oil and grid electricity being replaced. The sensitivity analysis for boiler steam pressure showed that there is an optimal pressure for coffee pulp (40 bar), a threshold pressure for orange (60 bar) and agave bagasse (70 bar). Sensitivity to biomass input indicated a maximum capacity where economy of scale does not produce any improvement in the indicators. Results demonstrate the usefulness of the modelling approach and IMP Bio2Energy(R) in analysing biomass CHP systems.

Results project a global average carbon intensity ranging between 8.6 and 18.0 kg CO2 eq/kg in 2100, compared to 18.3 kg CO2 eq/kg at present, that could be further reduced under mitigation scenarios. Co-benefits with other environmental indicators are observed. Scaling aluminium production impacts to the global demand shows total emission between 1250 and 1590 Gt CO2 eq for baseline scenarios by 2050 while absolute decoupling is only achievable with stringent climate policy changing drastically the electricity mix. Achieving larger emission reductions will require circular strategies that go beyond primary material production itself and involve other stakeholders along the aluminium value chain	[Pedneault, Julien;

J	Quarton, CJ; Samsatli, S				Quarton, Christopher J.; Samsatli, Sheila			How to incentivise hydrogen energy technologies for net zero: Whole-system value chain optimisation of policy scenarios	SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION			English	Article						Hydrogen; Energy policy; Net zero; Integrated multi-vector energy networks; Value chain optimisation; Value Web Model	RENEWABLE ENERGY; ELECTRICITY STORAGE; DESIGN; POWER; MODEL; COST; MECHANISMS; EXPERIENCE; OPERATION; HEAT	Policy intervention is essential for enabling energy decarbonisation, and historic examples such as wind and solar power show how well-designed policy can lead to long term system benefits. Hydrogen technologies are emerging technologies that, with sufficient policy support, can also become established and provide valuable energy services. In this study, the policies available for supporting emerging energy technologies and encouraging system decarbonisation are analysed, and their relevance to hydrogen technologies is considered. Value chain optimisation is used to assess the effectiveness of these policies in a system undergoing transition to net-zero emissions. The optimisation results show that both carbon budgets and carbon taxation approaches can be effective in achieving net-zero emissions, but that the details of the policy design can significantly influence overall costs and emissions. The results also show that in a net-zero energy system, hydrogen technologies have a role in industry without needing specific policy support, but policy intervention is needed for hydrogen to become established in other sectors (such as domestic and commercial heating). Both feed-in tariffs and obligations for hydrogen injection were found to be effective at increasing hydrogen uptake, although with an increase in overall system cost of 11-14 pound for each additional MWh of hydrogen in the system. This study shows the benefits of using value chain optimisation to analyse energy policies and technologies. It also emphasises the importance of careful policy design in order to achieve the best overall system outcomes. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Rambaree, K; Sundstrom, A; Wang, Z; Wright, SAI				Rambaree, Komalsingh; Sundstrom, Agneta; Wang, Zhao; Wright, Sandra Ann Ingela			Qualitative Stakeholder Analysis for a Swedish Regional Biogas Development: A Thematic Network Approach	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						biogas; energy; PESTEL; qualitative stakeholder analysis; thematic network approach	TRANSPORT SECTOR; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	The creation of pathways toward a societal transition to clean energy requires the engagement of multiple stakeholders with different and sometimes conflicting interests. In this connection, stakeholder analysis (SA) offers a technique for identifying, assessing and structuring different needs, interests and concerns related to different stakeholders within the context of sustainability. This article aims to present the findings from a qualitative stakeholder analysis (QSA) by using a thematic network approach (TNA), with the help of the ATLAS.ti software. It focuses on Project X, which was aimed at engaging multiple stakeholders and creating favorable conditions for small and medium-sized companies in a region situated in the central part of Sweden, with the potential to start biogas production. In this work, the findings and discussions of the QSA using TNA are structured by using the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal (PESTEL) themes of the model. The present study concludes that for the small-scale biogas industry to successfully develop an understanding of the possibilities of the biogas value chain, it is necessary to have analyzed the nature of the main themes by which various stakeholders relate to biogas production and envision their contribution to creating a sustainable society. Herein, we demonstrate that QSA by a TNA, combined with the application of a PESTEL model, are valuable analytical tools in sustainable project management. The lessons from Project X can be applied to other local biogas initiatives, as many identified threats and opportunities are shared by others.

Fish fraud represents a threat to human health and poses serious concerns due to the consumption of toxins, highly allergenic species, contaminates or zoonotic parasites, which may be present in substituted fish. The substitution of more expensive fish by cheaper species, with similar morphological characteristics but different origins, reflects the need for greater transparency and traceability upon which which the security of the entire seafood value-chain depends. Even though EU regulations have made significant progress in consumer information by stringent labelling requirements, fraud is still widespread. Many molecular techniques such as DNA barcoding provide valuable support to enhance the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in the protection of consumer interests by unequivocally detecting any kind of fraud. This paper aims to highlight both the engagement of EU fishery policy and the opportunity offered by new biotechnology instruments to mitigate the growing fraud in the globalized fish market and to enforce the food security system to protect consumers' health. In this paper, after a presentation of EU rules on fish labeling and a general overview on the current state of the global fish market, we discuss the public health implications and the opportunities offered by several techniques based on genetics, reporting a case study to show the efficacy of the DNA barcoding methodology in assessing fish traceability and identification, comparing different species of the Epinephelus genus, Mottled Grouper (Mycteroperca rubra) and Wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), often improperly sold with the commercial name of "grouper".

J	von Delft, S; Zhao, Y				von Delft, Stephan; Zhao, Yang			Business models in process industries: Emerging trends and future research	TECHNOVATION			English	Article						Business model; Business model innovation; Process industries; Production management; Innovation management; Literature review	PRODUCT-SERVICE SYSTEM; BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; MARKET STRATEGY; SUCCESS FACTORS; CAPTURING VALUE; VALUE CREATION; FRONT-END; SUSTAINABILITY; TECHNOLOGY	This article reviews the literature on business models in process industries. The review reveals that the business model concept has gained an increasing amount of attention in process-industrial research, but it also shows that the literature exhibits a lack of construct clarity and that it is developing in different domains, depending on the perspectives scholars have taken to study business models in process industries. Specifically, while innovation management scholars have explored the relationship between technological innovations and business models as well as the process and outcomes of business model innovation, scholars from the domain of production management have focused on value chain (re)configurations and taken a system-based perspective to consider boundary-spanning exchanges with key stakeholders in the design of business models. However, despite variance in the perspectives, the review further shows that works in these divergent domains point to a family of emerging themes and to common ideas that have not been explored together. This allows us to identify the particularities of business models in process industries and develop a definition of process-industrial business models, which extends prior business model literature into the process industry context. Furthermore, we synthesize these connections to develop an agenda for future, cross-disciplinary research on business models in process industries that assists cumulative theorizing and subsequent empirical progress.

A Sample of Job Advertisements in the COVID-19 Period	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						controllers; supply chain; sustainable management; value chain; competences; tasks	SUPPLY CHAIN; ACCOUNTANTS; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION; CAPABILITY; IDENTITY; IMPACT	This article aims to present a profile of functional controllers created in German-speaking countries in the context of their competences and tasks for sustainable management and value chain creation. Sustainable chain management requires finding a balance between the economic, social, and environmental spheres, inside and outside the organizations, in all business functions/processes related to value chain formation. Managers for sustainable management need to have adequate and high-quality financial and non-financial information. They are crucial during the pandemic COVID-19 period. Functional controllers can provide this. Content analysis of job advertisements was used as a research method. The identification of competences was based on Cheetham and Chivers' model. Tasks were referred to as essential functions of controlling. Descriptive statistics and the Student's t-test with Cochran-Cox correction and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the data. In terms of the studied controllers, more functional than meta competence was identified. There were more hard skills than soft skills. In terms of tasks, studied controllers are preoccupied with analysis, coordination and optimization, participation in management, definition of new tools, and reporting. The results confirm that functional controllers have an impact on sustainable development and value chain creation.

Value Chain Creation in Business Analytics	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Absorptive Capacity; BA Outcomes; BA Value Chain Model; Business Analytics; Organizational Resilience	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; RESILIENCE; INNOVATION; QUALITY; MODEL	Firms are awash in big data and analytical technology as part of the process of deriving values in the current turbulent environment. The literature has reached a consensus that investments in technology only may not reap benefits from business analytics (BA). As such, the main purpose of BA is not about how to install technical capabilities, but about how to create a process whereby a firm builds a value chain converting data into insights and ultimately into quality outcomes. Drawing upon the theory of the information value chain, this study develops a BA value chain creation model and tests it with 268 firms. Results show that organizational resilience, absorptive capacity, and analytical IT capabilities are critical antecedents of analytical decision-making quality, which in turn influences BA net benefits. In particular, organizational resilience emerges as a more significant determinant of analytical decision-making quality than technology and people in the BA value chain creation. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed in this paper.

This work was carried out on a metal(loid)-contaminated site and aimed at assessing the suitability of Salvia sclarea L. (sage) and Coriandrum sativum L. (coriander) combined with an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) inoculant to immobilize metal(loid)s and produce essential oils (EO). The effect of the inoculant on the transfer of metal(loid)s (ML, i.e., Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Ni, and Sb) to plants and the ML soil mobility were investigated. The ML concentrations in EO from both plant species and the valorization options for the distillation residues (soil conditioner, animal fodder, and anaerobic digestion) were studied. Sage was a suitable candidate for this value chain because it presents an excluder phenotype and the residues of oil extraction could be used as a soil conditioner. The metal concentrations in the sage EO were similar to those obtained from plants cultivated on an uncontaminated soil. These results indicate the suitability of sage harvested on the contaminated soil according to the ML fate in the whole value chain. Like the EO of sage, ML concentrations in the coriander EO did not differ from those in the commercial EO that were obtained from plants grown on uncontaminated soil. However, the use of distillation residues of coriander was limited by their relatively elevated Cd concentrations. The use of a mycorrhizal inoculum did not decrease the Cd mobility in soil for the coriander.

Carbon neutral manufacturing via on-site CO2 recycling	ISCIENCE			English	Article							SYNTHETIC NATURAL-GAS; HIGH-TEMPERATURE ELECTROLYSIS; DIOXIDE REDUCTION; CAPTURE; ELECTROREDUCTION; ETHYLENE; METHANATION; CONVERSION; CATALYSIS; HYDROGEN	The chemical industry needs to significantly decrease carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in order to meet the 2050 carbon neutrality goal. Utilization of CO2 as a chemical feedstock for bulk products is a promising way to mitigate industrial emissions; however, CO2-based manufacturing is currently not competitive with the established petrochemical methods and its deployment requires creation of a new value chain. Here, we show that an alternative approach, using CO2 conversion as an add-on to existingmanufactures, can disrupt the global carbon cycle while minimally perturbing the operation of chemical plants. Proposed closed-loop on-site CO2 recycling processes are economically viable in the current market and have the potential for rapid introduction in the industries. Retrofitbased CO2 recycling can reduce annually between 4 and 10 Gt CO2 by 2050 and contribute to achieving up to 50% of the industrial carbon neutrality goal.

J	Vaskelainen, T; Munzel, K; Boon, W; Frenken, K				Vaskelainen, Taneli; Munzel, Karla; Boon, Wouter; Frenken, Koen			Servitisation on consumer markets: entry and strategy in Dutch private lease markets	INNOVATION-ORGANIZATION & MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Market entry; strategy; servitisation; private leasing; carsharing; sharing economy; disruptive innovation; ecosystem	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; SERVITIZATION; INDUSTRY; ONLINE; MANUFACTURERS; COMMUNITIES; CHALLENGES; INCUMBENTS	Servitisation, which occurs when products are offered with service components as product-service bundles, has increased rapidly in consumer markets during recent years because of digitalisation. Digital technologies have enabled the emergence of peer-to-peer marketplaces and made it possible for B2B lease and rental actors to push for B2C markets. Despite extensive research on servitisation, we know little of what kinds of companies can best exploit the opportunities created by it and how digitalisation affects inter-company relationships regarding these opportunities. This article addresses these research gaps by making a revelatory case study on the entry order and strategy of established B2B lease companies to enter the B2C private leasing and carsharing markets. We collect an interview-based dataset on key companies in the Dutch car lease market, that we analyse abductively. We find that knowledge of the opportunities, position in the value chain, and resources are focal elements that define which companies are pioneers, early followers, and late entrants. In contrast to former servitisation literature, manufacturing incumbent companies are not active in exploiting opportunities created by private leasing. Additionally, we discover that the leasing companies create capabilities for private leasing themselves whereas they partner to enable carsharing. We discuss the contribution of these findings to research on disruptive innovation, servitisation, and digital innovation.

It further compares diversification by three rice production systems: two-season rain-fed, two-season irrigated and one-season rain-fed rice production. Design/methodology/approach Primary data were sourced from 225 rice farmers. Margalef index and three-stage least-squares were employed. Findings Majority of rice-farming households in Ghana diversify livelihoods. The extent of livelihood diversification differs among two-season rain-fed, two-season irrigated and one-season rain-fed rice-producing households. Credit, distance to district capitals, production purpose and number of farming seasons influence crop and income diversifications, and consumption expenditure of rice-producing households. While crop diversification reduces consumption expenditure, income diversification increases it. Crop and income diversifications positively influence each other. Consumption expenditure reduces crop diversification but increases income diversification. Practical implications Policy should be directed towards the promotion of more livelihood activities to boost rice farmers' welfare. There should be awareness creation and training programmes to enable rice farmers realize different economic activities within and outside the agricultural value chain. Originality/value Crop and income diversifications were measured as continuous response variables, unlike previous studies that used a binary response variable. The authors established a synergy among crop and income diversifications, and consumption expenditure (welfare). The authors further compared crop and income diversifications by three rice production systems: two-season rain-fed, two-season irrigated and one-season rain-fed rice production systems.

J	Zheng, Z				Zheng, Zhi			Re-calculation of responsibility distribution and spatiotemporal patterns of global production carbon emissions from the perspective of global value chain	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Carbon dioxide emissions; Assignment of responsibility; Globalization; Global value chain; Spatiotemporal patterns	CO2 EMISSIONS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; IMPORTS; EMBODIMENT; JAPAN	This study proposes a non-differentiated producer responsibility (NDPR) principle to assign carbon dioxide emission responsibility. The NDPR principle redistributes carbon dioxide emissions along a value chain according to the proportion of profits obtained, which can eliminate the unfairness of carbon dioxide emissions transfers caused by transnational production processes. Compared with existing models, the NDPR model can be directly applied to a multi-region input-output table (MRIO), thereby improving the practical value of the method. Furthermore, this study applies the NDPR model to a long-term MRIO to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of carbon emission responsibility worldwide. We found that both the volume and growth of carbon emissions are highly concentrated in European countries, the United States, and emerging market countries, and the basic emission pattern is stable. Both the producer and consumer responsibility principles lead to most developing countries in Asia bearing a greater proportion of the emission responsibility than the proportion of value they capture from global value chains. This study suggests that countries with the highest carbon emissions should assume the greatest responsibilities for global carbon emission reduction targets and develop measures and policies that significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. More attention should be paid to correcting the unfairness of carbon dioxide emission transfers within the global value chain and providing middle-income and low-income countries with more rights for development in future carbon emissions accounting.

J	Bertheussen, BA				Bertheussen, Bernt Arne			Sustained Competitive Advantage Based on Industry-Specific Institutional Frameworks	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						fisheries industries; competitive advantage; industry-specific institutions; bargaining power; competitive forces; seafood value chain	BRINGING INSTITUTIONS; STRATEGY; VIEW; PERFORMANCE; NORWAY; PROFIT; MATTER	This study investigates the relationships between industry-specific institutions, industry structure, and industry performance. The Norwegian Pelagic value chain's harvesting industry and its processing industry comprised the empirical context. The study findings reveal that the harvesters (the fishers), on average, achieved nearly twice the return on assets relative to the processors. Furthermore, the fishers' cash flow margin was, on average, more than eight times higher, and their annual growth rate was approximately 70% above the corresponding figures of the processing industry. This study argues that the two industries' performance differences are related to the variations in their institutional setups. The processing industry is subject to the general Norwegian business environment, whereas the fish harvesting industry benefits from a sector-specific framework that supports its relative competitiveness. The fishers have collectively established a legally supported sales organization, thereby strengthening their bargaining power, vis-a-vis the processors (buyers). The fishers' rivalry is curbed by catch share regulations, and incumbent fishers are protected from intruders through entry barriers, for example, license requirements. Moreover, the processing industry's potential threat to vertically integrate upstream into the fish harvesting industry is blocked through legislation. Finally, in contrast to the processing industry, the fish input cost is free for the harvesting industry. This study concludes that the fish harvesting industry has gained a sustained competitive advantage over the processing industry, based on a more supportive industry-specific institutional framework.

J	Lange, A; Husig, S; Albert, M				Lange, Anne; Huesig, Stefan; Albert, Martin			How frugal innovation and inclusive business are linked to tackle low-income markets	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Frugal innovation; inclusive business; low-income context	FRAMEWORK; TYPOLOGY; GROWTH; BASE	Frugal innovations purportedly address unmet consumer needs. Inclusive business includes consumers as employees and business owners in the value chain, especially to address challenges in base of the pyramid contexts. Recent literature has described increasing numbers of cases in which frugal innovations have been implemented based on inclusive business structures. This paper explores how frugal innovation affects the design of inclusive business by analyzing 11 frugal cases implemented in the African context. We derive an inclusive business link model for frugal innovations (IBLMFI) and propose that frugal innovations with modular features support a deep level of inclusive business integration.

Livestock keepers have also singled out poor animal health service delivery, which is largely the domain of the public sector, as the major constraint to improving animal health and productivity. In the current study, we describe the animal health service delivery system and compile from five questionnaire surveys involving 4,162 livestock keepers to characterize animal health service delivery in Ethiopia. The mapping of the animal health service delivery system along the livestock value chain clearly highlights the role of informal animal health services and variations of roles of the private sector. Also, the survey results clearly showed that livestock keepers' access to, use of and satisfaction with animal health services significantly varied across livestock production systems, geographic locations, socioeconomic strata, and service providers. Livestock keepers in crop-livestock and agropastoral systems had 5.5 (odds ratio = 5.453, P = 0.000) and 2.5 (odds ratio = 2.482, P = 0.000) times more access to services in reference to the pastoral system. In reference to private veterinary clinics, livestock keepers reported higher access to services provided by all the other service providers, particularly to services provided by extension agents, drug shops and CAHWs. Similarly, better access was reported by male than female (odds ratio = 1.098; P = 0.025) and wealthier than poorer (odds ratios = 1.40-1.79; P = 0.000) farmers and pastoralists. In general, low access to services was reported, 32.7, 25.2, and 19.3% of the respondents reporting access in crop-livestock, agropastoral and pastoral systems, respectively. Effective demand for services was evaluated through proxy variables, namely number of visits to service providers and health expenditures over a year. Highland farmers used the services more often than pastoralists (odds ratio = 2.86; P = 0.000), but pastoralists' expenses were significantly higher. Wealth (measured by livestock owned), gender and age also had significant effects on the use of services and expenditure on services. Satisfaction with services was evaluated based on four measures, namely availability (av), accessibility (ac), quality (qw), and timeliness (tm) of services. The average scores (out of 10) for av, ac, qw, and tm were 6.1, 5.9, 6.2, and 5.7, respectively. Principal component analysis was conducted to derive the latent variable "satisfaction" from the four measures, extracted only one factor, indicating the four variables are measuring the same construct (satisfaction). Regressing the latent variable satisfaction on the four measures gave significant (P = 0.000) b values of 0.22, 0.20, 0.13, and 0.14 for av, ac, qw, and tm, respectively, indicating strong relationships between the latent variable satisfaction and its measures. There was a significant dissatisfaction with the public sector, with average scores of 0.06 and 0.19 for the public and private service providers, respectively. It can be concluded that livestock keepers in remote regions of the country, pastoralists, women, poorer, and older livestock keepers have less access to services. Satisfaction with services is low to medium and the major concerns of livestock keepers appears to be availability and accessibility of services. Based on our findings, we recommend an integrated, multi-sectoral involvement to improve the veterinary service delivery through improved veterinary infrastructure, public-private partnership, and animal health information system across the various livestock production systems.

J	Wesz, VJ				Wesz Junior, Valdemar Joao			Soybean production in Paraguay: Agribusiness, economic change and agrarian transformations	JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE			English	Article; Early Access						agrarian change; corporate food regime; Paraguay; smallholder farmer; soybean production	FOOD REGIME; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; FINANCIALIZATION; GLOBALIZATION; LAND; DYNAMICS; TOBACCO	Contemporary corporate-led agricultural commodity production has seen profound transformations in rural spaces. This article focuses on soybean production in Paraguay, analysing corporate activity in the productive, commercial and economic dynamics of the soybean market and identities the impacts of this monoculture on small farmers. Drawing on mixed methods, the research points to high levels of concentration of this market in the hands of a few transnational companies, which control the value chain via contractual relations with farmers. Through a complex set of relations, soybean production has seen smallholder farmers fall into debt and become unable to maintain their activity and migrate to new regions, leasing their land and, in the worst cases, lose both their land and status as farmers.

J	Hochachka, G				Hochachka, Gail			Finding shared meaning in the Anthropocene: engaging diverse perspectives on climate change	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Psychology of climate change; Meaning-making; Constructive-developmental psychology; Photovoice; Ontological pluralism; Transformations to sustainability	PHOTOVOICE; RISK; TRANSFORMATION; PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; COGNITION; EMOTIONS; MODELS; WANT	The scientific evidence of climate change has never been clearer and more convergent, and calls for transformations to sustainability have never been greater. Yet, perspectives and social opinions about it remain fractured, and collaborative action is faltering. Climate policy seeks to forge a singular sense of climate change, dominated by an 'information deficit model' that focuses on transferring climate science to the lay public. Critics argue that this leaves out certain perspectives, including the plurality of meanings uncovered through participatory approaches. However, questions remain about how these approaches can better account for nuances in the psychological complexity of climate change, without getting stuck in the cul-de-sacs of epistemological relativism and post-truth politics. In this paper, I explore an approach through which we might find shared meaning at the interface of individual and collective views about climate change. I first present a conceptual framework that describes five psychological reasons why climate change challenges individual and collective meaning-making, and also provides a way to understand how meaning is organized within that. I then use this framework to inform the use of photo voice as a transformative (action-research) method, examining its ability to overcome some of the meaning-making challenges specific to climate change. I discuss how participants from a coffee cooperative in Guatemala reflected first on their own climate meanings and then engaged in a meaning-making process with other actors in the coffee value chain. Findings suggest a psychosocial approach to climate engagement-one that engages both subjectively and intersubjectively on the complexities unique to climate change-is helpful in acknowledging an ontological pluralism of 'climate changes' amongst individuals, while also supporting a nexus-agreement collectively. This may in turn contribute to a more effective and ethical process of transformation.

J	Mendhurwar, S; Mishra, R				Mendhurwar, Subodh; Mishra, Rajhans			'Un'-blocking the industry 4.0 value chain with cyber-physical social thinking	ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						Blockchain; cyber-physical social thinking systems; digital business transformation; industry 4; 0; smart contract; social internet of things architecture	SUPPLY-CHAIN; BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY; RESEARCH FRAMEWORK; CHALLENGES; INTERNET; SECURITY; ENERGY; TRACEABILITY; OPERATIONS; THINGS	Integration of diverse technologies fuels business-model transformation, evolving new applications. Industry 4.0 utilizes emerging-technologies like IoT, AI to make next-generation manufacturing-processes more efficient and agile. Cyber physical systems (CPS) augmented with social, thinking technologies effectuate cyber physical social thinking systems (CPST). Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) like Blockchain are synergistic with architectural-elements of such industry-blueprints. Extant literature explores contextual-roles of distinct technology-components as-well-as their limited-combinations; clearly necessitating consideration of integrated-applications. This contemporary conceptual paper: (i) concisely analyses potential-synergies amongst Blockchain, CPST technologies; (ii) proposes novel integrated architecture; (iii) outlines underlying challenges, opportunities and performance considerations; bearing benefits beyond traditional-ecosystems to societal-stakeholders.

J	Zhu, Z; Zheng, H; Zhu, Z				Zhu, Zhu; Zheng, Hang; Zhu, Zhu			Analysis on the economic effect of Sino-US trade friction from the perspective of added value	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Sino-US trade friction; Trade added value; WWZ decomposition method; Trade effect; Economic growth		Based on the theory of trade added value, this paper discusses the potential actual trade scale and benefit damage degree of the two countries under the background of big country game by measuring the real trade scale of China and the USA, simulating the economic impact of tariffs imposed by China and the USA and utilizing Wang-Wei-Zhu (WWZ) method to decompose the potential changes in Sino-US trade. The results show that: firstly, the size of China-US trade in terms of total value is significantly overestimated and China's overall trade with the USA in 2001-2014 was overestimated by an average of 3.06 percent, of which goods trade was overestimated by 8.06 percent. Secondly, although tariff increases can reduce the degree of trade imbalance between China and the USA to some extent, the adverse effects are mutual and global, and the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan and Canada become the main transfer countries of Sino-US trade. Thirdly, the pattern of China's final exports and the US' intermediate exports determines that China's trade interests are more damaged than those of the USA. It is proved that there is a big gap between China and the USA in the depth and breadth of China's participation in the value chain division of labor and the trade scale measured by Gross Domestic Product is more instructive than the total value.

J	de Brauw, A; Kramer, B; Murphy, M				de Brauw, Alan; Kramer, Berber; Murphy, Mike			Migration, labor and women's empowerment: Evidence from an agricultural value chain in Bangladesh	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Rural; Labor; Agriculture; Migration; Gender; Bangladesh	INVESTMENT; CHILDREN	As a substantial portion of the rural labor force migrates to urban areas, it is commonly assumed that women could take over traditionally male tasks in agricultural production, with potentially empowering outcomes for women. We study how changes in the supply of labor may influence female labor partici-pation and empowerment outcomes. Using a detailed panel dataset on jute producers in the delta region of Bangladesh, we test whether out-migration of household members and perceived labor shortages are associated with the share of household and hired labor performed by women, and women's empower-ment. When a household experiences reduced household or hired labor supply, we observe a relatively larger use of female household labor, but a reduced share of female hired labor. We also find that reduced labor supply is not associated with significant reductions in gender wage gaps, or enhanced women's empowerment. These findings suggest that given existing gender norms, male and female labor are not perfect substitutes for one another, and as a result, male outmigration is not associated with improved outcomes for women in cash crop production in the short run. Our results demonstrate a need for better understanding of the role of gender in rural labor markets, particularly in contexts of rapid urbanization. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

J	Facchini, F; Ranieri, L; Vitti, M				Facchini, Francesco; Ranieri, Luigi; Vitti, Micaela			A Neural Network Model for Decision-Making with Application in Sewage Sludge Management	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						waste-treatment process; sewage-sludge management; circular economy; decision support system; decision problem; artificial neural network	SUSTAINABILITY	Wastewater treatment (WWT) is a foremost challenge for maintaining the health of ecosystems and human beings; the waste products of the water-treatment process can be a problem or an opportunity. The sewage sludge (SS) produced during sewage treatment can be considered a waste to be disposed of in a landfill or as a source for obtaining raw material to be used as a fertilizer, building material, or alternative fuel source suitable for co-incineration in a high-temperature furnace. To this concern, this study's purpose consisted of developing a decision model, supported by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN model), allowing us to identify the most effective sludge management strategy in economic terms. Consistent with the aim of the work, the suitable SS treatment was identified, selecting for each phase of the SS treatment, an alternative available on the market ensuring energy and/or matter recovery, in line with the circular water value chain.

The Importance of the Social License to Operate at the Investment and Operations Stage of Coal Mining Projects: Application using a Decision Support System	EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Social License to Operate; Operational risk management; coal mining; Value Chain	MODEL; RISK; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS	The Social License to Operate (SLO) and the Value Chain business model are basic elements that need to be considered both at the planning and operation stages of mining operations and in particular in coal mining projects. If a coal mining enterprise loses its SLO, it may face risks in operations, which may lead to value chain risks. One of the causes of enterprise failure as related to coal mining operations is the inability to reliably assess/manage risk holistically and the inability to understand that lack of SLO is a critical risk. Although financial risks are typically assessed for mining projects, lack of SLO risk should also be taken into account starting as early as the bankable feasibility study. Furthermore, as it is difficult to establish a proactive decision-making policy for SLO risk in coal mining operations, the Operational Risk Management (ORM) methodology is probably a good tool to apply towards that goal. For this reason, a Mining Operational Risk Management Model (MORMM) was developed to incorporate risk probabilities and risk severities evaluated by experts. The final risk assessment is coded using Risk Assessment Codes (RACs). A hypothetical scenario was developed utilizing the MORMM model in order to illustrate how risks can be managed during the SLO granting process. This scenario describes a hypothetical coal mining project evaluated by virtual risk evaluators under specific hazard categories. Risk evaluation involves the assessment of risk probability and risk severity. Through this scenario this paper presents ways: (i) to establish a baseline ORM process that will be applicable to any coal mining operation environment, and (ii) to provide a theoretical example to demonstrate how the method can be applied to coal mining operations. The resulting RACs can provide critical information to decision makers regarding the rejection, acceptance or re-engineering of the mining business plan.

J	Kubo, K; Pritchard, B; Phyo, AS				Kubo, Koji; Pritchard, Bill; Phyo, Aye Sandar			How Chinese demand for fresh fruit and vegetables is creating new landscapes of rural development and vulnerability in Southeast Asia: Insights from the Myanmar melon frontier	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Land grabs; Fresh fruit; Value chains; China; Myanmar; COVID-19; Strategic coupling	GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS; PRIVATE STANDARDS; VALUE CHAINS; GOVERNANCE; FOOD; IMPACT; SUPERMARKETS; SCHEMES; TRADE	Mainland Southeast Asia has become an increasingly important source for Chinese imports of fresh fruit. But how have these activities contributed to patterns of regional development in sites of production? This paper uses insights from China-centric melon production in Myanmar to generate new insights into this question. We argue that the expansion of this trade has created a structural form of strategic coupling in which benefits have flowed to a relatively small number of participants. Whereas these outcomes have some similarities to fresh fruit and vegetable export chains elsewhere in the world, what makes this case special is their creation through a form of value chain governance quite unlike the retailer-led arrangements typically associated with export fresh fruit and vegetable production. In the Myanmar-China melons trade, brokers, not retailers, exercise lead firm functions. These arrangements have generated distinctive and highly uneven distributions of risk and reward that have inhibited value chain upgrading and created substantial environmental despoliation. The vulnerabilities associated with these processes were brought into sharp relief with the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, which led to local farmers bearing huge costs and debts when the border trade was abruptly curtailed.

J	Langford, NJ				Langford, Natalie J.			From Global to Local Tea Markets: The Changing Political Economy of Tea Production within India's Domestic Value Chain	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article							AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS; PRODUCTION NETWORKS; GOVERNANCE; LABOR; STANDARDS; STATE; SUSTAINABILITY; INDUSTRY; TRADE	The growth of emerging economies has led to a significant expansion of domestic markets in the global South. Yet, the vast majority of studies examining contemporary patterns of trade and production continue to use a global value chain (GVC) lens, therefore obfuscating important spatial and temporal shifts occurring within domestic geographies of production in the early decades of the 21st century. This article explores how a rapid increase in domestic consumption in the case of Indian tea production has transformed the industry, and how institutional and regulatory actors have responded to these changes. Using a value chain framework to explore the key actors and processes shaping the political economy of domestic production, this article identifies three processes which have driven the creation of new trade and production structures within India's domestic tea market: a significant rise in the outsourcing and fragmentation of the production process; the expansion of smallholder-led production; and the introduction of private standards and governance programmes within the domestically oriented segment of production.

J	Manyise, T; Dentoni, D				Manyise, Timothy; Dentoni, Domenico			Value chain partnerships and farmer entrepreneurship as balancing ecosystem services: Implications for agri-food systems resilience	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES			English	Article						Participation; Learning; Rural livelihoods; Agribusiness; Farming systems	SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; AGRICULTURE; ORGANIZATION; EFFECTUATION; BUSINESSES; INNOVATION; CAUSATION; INSIGHTS; LESSONS	Both in the European Union (EU) and worldwide, the resilience of agri-food systems depends on the human ability to balance between socio-economic and ecological trade-offs. Recent ecosystem services literature acknowledges that smallholder farmers' participation to stakeholder partnerships and continuous learning influences their balancing ability. Yet, little research has so far focused on how smallholders' participation in partnerships with other value chain actors - such as companies supplying or procuring from them - shape their learning processes and, in turn, how their mindset and behavioral change influences agri-food systems resilience outcomes. To address this gap, this conceptual paper advances a framework suggesting plausible linkages between: the organization of value chain partnerships; smallholder farmer entrepreneurship (meant as the ability to redeploy resources innovatively in and around farms); and agri-food systems resilience outcomes (such as stabilizing rural livelihoods, supporting ecological services and enhancing socio-cultural services). This framework suggests that value chain partnerships are more effective in supporting the smallholder farmers' entrepreneurial learning: when they pool more resources (both tangible, like financial or physical assets, and intangible as knowledge or market information) among partners; when they distribute decision-making rights over their use more evenly; and when they balance between formal and informal coordination mechanisms. On the basis of empirical examples, these conceptual arguments suggest that policy incentives - such as the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU - should be directed towards resource pooling, experimentation and learning to effectively support smallholder farmer entrepreneurship and their contribution to the achievement of agrifood systems resilience outcomes.

As a result, the quantity and quality of barites produced do not satisfy the nation's oil sector demands and other industries that require the mineral. This situation leads to massive importation of the mineral with negative impact on the country's drive toward increasing the contribution of solid minerals to the gross domestic product (GDP). This study reviews the existing policies and government interventions on ASM of Nigerian barite; evaluates the operations of ASM through a survey of mines in Nasarawa state, Nigeria; identifies factors that affect sustainability of the sector and proffers solutions to foster sustainability of ASM of barite in the region. The study adopted the 4Is optimization technique (Information gathering, Interpretation, Implication, and Implementation) through personal interactions with the stakeholders at the barite mining sites, and government agencies, regarding policies and interventions specific to ASM of barite. Challenges identified include: weak implementation and enforcement of mining laws; inadequate support from government and development partners; poor access to mining equipment and technology; poor infrastructure (access road, water, electricity); poor pricing of products (marketing challenges); poor remuneration of mine workers; poor mining skills; inadequate formal education; limited awareness on environmental health and safety hazards; fragility and conflict; insufficient information and data on mines and miners; security issues; lack of access to finance; lack of formalization of operations and poor legal framework for operations. The strategies suggested for fostering the sustainability of ASM of barites include: enhanced policy and legislation formulation and implementation, strengthening of institutions, formalization of ASM operations, training of miners, awareness campaign, improvement in environmental and safety of operations, empowerment and support by government and development partners for individual miners and processors and organized groups within the sector (such as Miners Association of Nigeria, Association of Miner and Processors of Barite, AMAPOB). Implementation of these strategies will lead to sustainable operations of the sector and hence improved rural livelihoods, stimulation of entrepreneurship in an environmentally responsible manner, and improvement in the contribution of the mineral sector to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), and hence national development.

To succeed, some actors in the chains define new practices to establish common sustainability goals. To date, there is little evidence that the visions and values of the various actors in the chains have been leading to common solutions. This work explores the impact of collaboration on the value chain actors' ability to jointly decide strategies for redesigning their activities. It reports on an empirical approach, which elicits the values and priorities of different stakeholders. The case takes place in the context of a value chain of the production/processing/sale of pork products. This value chain involves two French production-processing and redistribution cooperatives. Stakeholders were questioned about their prioritization of sustainability issues and these weights were applied to evaluate 12 animal feed solutions that vary in terms of the composition and geographical origin of rations, and the means and locations of their production. The results show that despite several years of cooperation, the objectives of the upstream and downstream actors remain different. The objectives of the upstream actors are driven by the economic difficulties of production and those of the downstream actors by the multiplicity of consumer demands and cost control objectives. In a reversal of the current practice marked by the economic difficulties of the actors upstream of the chain, an integrated culture could be led by bottom-up approaches to create a shared vision. Public policy would be then essential in regulating the sharing of value among actors; and in promoting chain models that help the required investments.

A gender analysis of the processing sector of the tuna value chain in General Santos City, Philippines	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Tuna processing sector; Gender analysis; Gendered value chain; Philippines		This paper aims to examine the roles and relations of women and men in the processing sector of the tuna value chain in General Santos City, Philippines. Based on the household survey, focus group discussions and key informant interviews the study reveals the gender division of labor in canning, frozen and tuna value-adding processing (TVAP). Women are assigned to tasks that require more attention to details and thoroughness while men do the physically demanding and mechanical work. College graduates have full time jobs in canneries but the females' income is at most only 60% of the males' income. Although women are perceived to be more efficient in processing tuna and more trustworthy than men on money matters, they are economically disadvantaged and are likely to experience sexual harassment at work. It is the men in TVAP who are the most marginalized due to the intersections of gender, age, education and migrant status. The paper proposes that there should be more gender responsive policies and programs that will challenge the existing power relations at the household, community, and industry level. Processors and other value chain enablers should work towards women's empowerment and gender equitable outcomes.

The originality of the study lies in the assumption that in every business model the generator of added value is the value chain which, if original enough, will maximize potential while minimizing costs. This approach will provide the respective enterprise with a high level competitiveness in the long term. The tested group of enterprises consisted of 354 SMEs, one hundred eighty-seven of which were from the manufacturing and industry sector, with 167 from the services sector. The novelty of this approach also consists of the integrated approach to the business environment in which the value streams were analyzed. The results suggest that the analysis of value streams is suitable for the projection of business models. In addition, the methods of dimensional reduction and logit regression have been identified as appropriate analytical tools, with representative results found valid and utilizable in business practice. The authors of the article are aware that this is only the first step in addressing this issue, one which will play a critical role in the gradual process of the upcoming digital transformation of all business models, not only those of SMEs in the Czech Republic.

J	Wurster, S				Wurster, Simone			Creating a Circular Economy in the Automotive Industry: The Contribution of Combining Crowdsourcing and Delphi Research	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						management; sustainable; circular economy; crowdsourcing; Delphi; automotive industry; tyres; recycling; labelling; PAH	TOOL	The circular economy (CE) is an essential societal topic of the 21st century. Although various scientific disciplines address it, many research gaps exist. The Delphi is a proven instrument for managerial decisions, which also gained importance in sustainability-oriented innovation research. Likewise, innovation processes using the input of crowds are emerging phenomena. Nevertheless, the Web of Science publication record includes a few articles applying crowdsourcing or the Delphi method to support CE-oriented management decisions only, and their further application has limitations. Addressing these gaps, this article presents an advanced concept integrating both methods to support the development of CE products and software responding to the worldwide need for more sustainable automotive products and CE solutions for tyres specifically. A combination of two-stage crowdsourcing and Delphi approaches was used, involving 509 participants from the EU member state Germany in total. This article provides, in particular, five contributions: First, it identified specific benefits of combining crowdsourcing and the Delphi method. Second, the attractiveness of a CE software system with product configuration tools is shown. Third, the interest in a quality label for sustainable tyres is unveiled. As the fourth contribution, the analyses show the importance of the CE software's and labels' consideration of social aspects in the tyre value chain and certain substances influencing appropriate recycling.

Hutong neighborhoods in Beijing, capital of China, cannot be rebuilt due to the protection of historical heritage, while residents still need to keep the habit of defecating in public toilets. One hundred public toilets with nonsewered sanitation in the Hutong neighborhoods of Beijing were visited to investigate the actual operating status in response to the ?toilet revolution? campaign. The fault tree approach was used to identify the barriers toward a decent and environment-friendly public toilet and evaluate potential risks from the malfunction of various components. Four subsystems are defined and elaborated to calculate the fault possibility. These subsystems are environment- and user-friendly, regarded as ancillary facilities, and used for fecal sludge (FS) management. Statistical analysis of targeted cases indicated that fault probabilities of environmental considerations, userfriendly considerations, ancillary facilities, FS management are calculated as 0.79, 0.96, 0.96, and 0, respectively. The subsystems were weighted using a Delphi method concept. Results showed that the well operation ratio of Beijing Hutong public toilets is only 32%, and the sanitation service value chain can be further optimized. This study also provides references for other countries, which are dedicated to promoting urban sanitation and public health.

Protecting Intellectual Property and Appropriating Value from Innovations in Weak Appropriability Regimes Two constructs, barrier to imitation and barrier to commercialization, are two tools multinational enterprises can use to block imitators.	RESEARCH-TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Weak appropriability regimes; Non-patent IP protection mechanisms; Value appropriation	FIRMS	Overview: How can multinational enterprises (MNEs) protect their intellectual property (IP) when patents are weakly enforced? An imitator will only take action to appropriate an innovator's value if the imitator has the financial motivation, opportunity, and ability to copy and commercialize the innovator's product/service. If the innovator can decrease one of these conditions to a level that demotivates or inhibits the imitator from taking action, the innovator will have protected its IP. In this article, we introduce the constructs of barrier to imitation and barrier to commercialization, two separate hurdles that can block imitators from appropriating MNE rents. We prescribe MNE IP strategies contingent on country characteristics, local imitator capabilities, an MNE's barriers to imitation and commercialization, and the value chain activities the MNE desires to locate in the country of interest.

Monirul			Post-harvest fish loss in the fish value chain and the determinants: empirical evidence from Bangladesh	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Bangladesh; Fish loss; Post-harvest; Market actors; Quality loss; Food security	SHRIMP	The fisheries and aquaculture sector plays an important role for food and nutrition security for the majority of people in Bangladesh. Recently, however, fish farmers and market actors face potential income loss due to post-harvest fish loss. This study assesses the factors influencing post-harvest loss of four important fish species (i.e., rui, catla, tilapia and pangas) in Bangladesh. Data were collected from 200 fish farmers and 212 market actors in Mymensingh and Jashore districts. The results reveal relatively high post-harvest fish loss for fish farmers (8.10 kg per hundred) as well as for Bepari, Paikar and retailers (2.18, 2.68 and 2.61 kg per 100 kg per hundred, respectively). Poor packaging and handling practices and inefficiencies at collection points are the major factors causing fish losses. Econometric results indicate that education, training, better transportation and infrastructure facilities are the significant factors to reduce post-harvest fish loss. Raising farmers' awareness, improving infrastructure and road transportation facilities as well as effective market information flow could potentially contribute to reduce post-harvest fish losses.

Results show that the majority of youth were engaged in agricultural production, especially in Zambia, while in Vietnam, they engaged in more diversified agricultural activities including input supply, transportation and advisory services delivery. Perceptions regarding the agricultural sector showed significant (P < 0.01) negative impact on youth participation in agribusiness in Vietnam, but not in Zambia. Barriers to effective youth engagement were; lack of start-up capital, low profitability of enterprises, and personal aspirations. Employing innovative value chain financing and market linkages can enhance enterprise profitability and youth participation in agribusiness.

To achieve sustainable development of social economy, green technology innovation emerges in response to the proper time and conditions. In this context, the correct approach to measure the efficiency of green technology innovation in China's industrial enterprises is an important research topic. Based on existing studies, this paper divides innovation activities into two stages based on the innovation value chain and constructs a two-stage evaluation index system including all kinds of undesirable outputs transferred from negative externalities of the ecological environment. To evaluate green technology innovation efficiency, SBM and EBM network DEA models are applied to conduct empirical analysis from the perspective of time and space. This paper also calculates the efficiency values based on the SBM model and the EBM model, respectively, and compares the differences between them. The results show that the efficiency value of the achievement transformation stage is significantly higher than that of technology development stage; there are noticeable gaps in the efficiency of green technology innovation between different regions of China. Besides, the eastern region has a better performance in green technology innovation than the western region and Qinghai has the best green technology innovation performance. Combining the empirical results, the corresponding policy recommendations are put forward.

J	Schilling-Vacaflor, A; Lenschow, A				Schilling-Vacaflor, Almut; Lenschow, Andrea			Hardening foreign corporate accountability through mandatory due diligence in the European Union? New trends and persisting challenges	REGULATION & GOVERNANCE			English	Article; Early Access						Brazil; commodity chain; deforestation; European Union (EU); human rights	SUSTAINABILITY; GOVERNANCE; SOY; CERTIFICATION; BRAZIL; POWER; LAND	The negative externalities of global commodity chains and existing governance gaps have received wide scholarly attention. Indeed, many sectors including forest-risk commodities (FRCs) like soy and beef from Brazil remain largely unregulated. This article analyzes ongoing policy-making processes at European Union level to adopt new regulations for reducing accountability gaps: one regulation of FRCs and one general, cross-sectoral directive on human rights and environmental due diligence. This article draws on and aims to contribute to previous research into foreign corporate accountability, therein analytically distinguishing between input, output, and surrogate accountability. This study shows that new policies will likely be more comprehensive than previous supply chain regulations, while their specific institutional design and stringency are highly contested. More in general, we argue that for hardening corporate accountability, due diligence politics will need to confront important governance challenges that have limited the potential of previous regulations, such as a lack of consequentiality of reporting obligations, weak state monitoring, limited stakeholder involvement, and difficulties to establish legal liability.

Using a unique combination of location bound (country-specific) and non-location bound (firm-specific) advantages, companies in this industry have overcome their latecomer disadvantages by exploring knowledge from mature markets through backward and forward integration of the value chain, and exploiting this knowledge to enhance their competitive position, first at home, then in emerging markets and later in developed countries. We test and refine springboarding theory and propose the learning portal model. The learning portal model can be used as a new theory of emerging markets multinationals beyond China and the automobile industry. Management Summary The globalization of Chinese enterprises is upon us. Chinese enterprises have not only successfully internationalized to other emerging markets, but also to advanced economies. To do so, these firms used springboard strategies to leapfrog certain technological development stages and accelerate their catch-up trajectory with incumbent firms from the advanced economies. This article investigates the catch-up strategies of China's leading automotive companies. We find that Chinese enterprises establish learning portals in mature markets to acquire knowledge and assets, which they first exploit in their home market, before seeking to expand their market share in other emerging markets and finally advanced economies.

J	Al Sidawi, R; Urushadze, T; Ploeger, A				Al Sidawi, Rami; Urushadze, Teo; Ploeger, Angelika			Factors and Components Affecting Dairy Smallholder Farmers and the Local Value Chain- Kvemo Kartli as an Example	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						dairy products; value chain; smallholder farmers; food safety; heavy metals; Georgia	RISK PERCEPTION; WATER-QUALITY	Smallholder farmers are the cornerstone of the livestock sector and an essential element in building and developing the local dairy value chain, critical for developing its local economy. In Georgia, and despite the efforts made since independence from the Soviet Union until now, farmers still face many problems that prevent them from participating effectively in developing the dairy value chain, especially heavy metal pollution that afflicts the study region. This research study refers to smallholder farmers' viewpoints in the Kvemo Kartli region on the dairy production sector and the problems these farmers face. This study also investigates the effect of several factors (ethical factors, traditions, animal welfare, cultural factors, etc.) on the dairy value chain. The convergence model was used in the mixed-method approach's triangular design as a methodology for this research study. As part of the social data, 140 farmers who produce and sell milk and cheese in the Kvemo Kartli region were interviewed. The results showed the influence of the ethical, cultural, and traditional factors in developing the value chain. The results also showed the problems and difficulties small farmers face in rural areas, on the one hand, and the gap between these farmers and governmental and private organisations on the other hand. These results are compared to those of a previous study, where interviews with experts in Georgia's dairy production sector were performed.

J	Kumse, K; Suzuki, N; Sato, T; Demont, M				Kumse, Kaittisak; Suzuki, Nobuhiro; Sato, Takeshi; Demont, Matty			The spillover effect of direct competition between marketing cooperatives and private intermediaries: Evidence from the Thai rice value chain	FOOD POLICY			English	Article						Thailand; Jasmine rice; Spillover effect; Marketing cooperatives; Instrumental variable	AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES; COLLECTIVE ACTION; SMALLHOLDERS; CULTURE; IDENTIFICATION; DETERMINANTS; DECISIONS; ECONOMICS; LANGUAGE; IMPACTS	Despite the widespread belief that marketing cooperatives' benefits may extend beyond participating farmers, little is known about the cooperative's effect on nonparticipating farmers. This paper exploits exogenous variation in language spoken at home in Thailand to obtain instrumental variable estimates of the spillover effect of marketing cooperatives. We hypothesize that farmers who sell rice to private intermediaries in the area where there is direct competition between marketing cooperatives and private intermediaries (treated areas) are likely to receive a higher price than those who sell rice in other areas. Using household-level data of rice farmers in Thailand in the marketing year 2018/19, we find strong evidence that farmers in treated areas receive 10.9% higher prices from private intermediaries than those in comparison areas. Our results provide crucial implications for food policy debates regarding the role of marketing cooperatives in agri-food value chains. In particular, evaluating the inclusiveness of marketing cooperatives toward poor farmers should not be limited to sampling and analyzing its members only. Failure to consider the spillover effect could lead to substantial underestimation of the impact of marketing cooperatives on societal welfare.

Nearly the entire harvested volume (1727 t in 2019) is exported to high-end markets, mostly as live crabs, although RKC can also be processed into two sections (i.e., clusters) commercialized as a frozen or ready-to-eat product under refrigeration. The fact that the Norwegian RKC fishery is a year-round activity constitutes an advantage over competing RKC fisheries, which are inactive during the winter and the spring. Nonetheless, this also involves the commercialization of RKC harvested between March and May, when its quality is considered poorer due to the physiological changes related to molting. This study aimed to acquire quantitative information on the seasonal quality variation of RKC by comparatively evaluating the quality attributes of spring and autumn harvests, which are, respectively, associated predominantly with a postmolt and intermolt population. Specifically, in the processed clusters obtained from spring postmolt RKCs, it was observed significantly (p < 0.05) lower exoskeleton thickness, yield (by between 8 and 15 percentage points), and leg meat content. The cooked meat of spring postmolt RKCs had significantly lower textural firmness and whiteness index. Furthermore, during refrigerated storage, cooked clusters of spring postmolt RKCs were characterized by significantly higher drip loss, and their leg meat reached significantly earlier the acceptability limit of 5 log CFU g(-1) in the total viable psychrotrophic count. The present study highlighted the risk of incurring economic losses for stakeholders along the value chain when dealing with postmolt RKC harvested in the spring. It should be questioned if the commercialization of the RKCs with poorer eating quality attributes in the spring season is an appropriate way to utilize at best this natural resource in terms of value creation, market reputation, and sustainability.

The distinct production process and application emissions of nitrogen fertilizer types for top dressing produce different GHG savings when energy crops value chains are compared to fossil energy alternatives. In this study, three types of fertilizers (calcium ammonium nitrate, urea and ammonium sulphate) at N top dressing rates of 80 kg N/ha are used to grow rye for electricity generation under the conditions of the Continental Mediterranean climate of central-northern Spain. Complete LCAs for the whole value chain based on real data were performed in conjunction with soil nitrogen balances (SNBs) to assess the accomplishment of European Union (EU) GHG savings sustainability criteria, as well as the sustainability of fertilization practices for soil nitrogen stocks. The results obtained can provide interesting insights for policy making, since calcium ammonium nitrate, the most common fertilizer for rye crops, led to 66% GHG savings, as opposed to the 69% achieved when applying urea and 77% when ammonium sulphate was used. Nevertheless, the three fertilizers produced annual soil deficits greater than 50 kg N/ha. In order to ensure savings above 80%, as required by the EU sustainability criteria, and sustainable SNBs, additional optimization measures should be taken at key points of the value chain.

We investigate how the governance dynamics of the tanker shipping value chain (a major emitter of greenhouse gases) limits the effectiveness of the European Union (EU) monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) regulation, which mandates the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions for ships calling at EU ports. Although MRV seeks to help shipowners and ship managers save fuel and reduce emissions, it does not address the complexity of power relations along the tanker shipping value chain and currently cannot disentangle how different actors influence the design, operational, commercial, and ocean/weather factors that together determine fuel consumption. In particular, the EU MRV neglects to reflect on how oil majors exert their power and impose their commercial priorities on other actors, and thus co-determine fuel use levels. We conclude that, in its current form, the EU MRV is unlikely to lead to significant environmental upgrading in tanker shipping. More generally, we argue that regulators seeking to facilitate environmental upgrading need to expand their focus beyond the unwanted behaviors of producers of goods and providers of services to also address the incentive structures and demands placed on them by global buyers.

Enhancing Biomass Value Chain by Utilizing Biochar as A Free Radical Scavenger to Delay Ultraviolet Aging of Bituminous Composites Used in Outdoor Construction	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Biochar; Circular economy; Aging; Oxidation; Ultraviolet; Bitumen	LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES; MODIFIED ASPHALT; BIO-CHAR; BITUMEN; OXYGEN; DIFFUSION; FTIR	This study examines the merits of using biochar to delay aging in construction while promoting the economic viability of biofuel production and enhancing the biomass value chain. Biochar residue from pyrolysis of biomass to biofuel was introduced to neat asphalt and rubberized asphalt binders. The study results showed biochar can delay oxidation and UV-induced aging at binder and mixture level as evidenced by lowering rheological and chemical aging indexes. The rheological aging index was measured based on the change in crossover modulus due to aging, and the chemical aging index was measured based on the change in carbonyl and sulfoxide functional groups due to aging. Four types of aging were examined including oxidation and UV aging at the binder level as well as aging and weathering at the mixture level. In terms of oxidation aging, biochar was more effective for rubberized asphalt, while in the case of UV aging, neat asphalt appeared to benefit more than rubberized asphalt from the presence of biochar. The latter can be attributed to the role of biochar as a UV-light blockage and free radical scavenger. Rubberized asphalt inherently contains carbon black which enhances the internal resistance against UV aging, hence the role of biochar was not as significant in rubberized asphalt compared to that of the neat asphalt. However, in the case of oxidation aging, biochar noticeably improved the rubberized asphalt compared to neat asphalt. The study outcomes provide a simultaneous solution to promote resource conservation and enhance aging resistance of bituminous composites. Biochar, carbonaceous particles, made from biowaste can be used as a free radical scavenger to delay ultraviolet aging of bituminous composites. Therefore, this study promotes sustainability by creating applications for biochar while increasing pavement durability by delaying asphalt aging.

J	Wu, Y; Strange, R; Shirodkar, V				Wu, Yan; Strange, Roger; Shirodkar, Vikrant			MNE divestments of foreign affiliates: Does the strategic role of the affiliate have an impact?	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Divestment; Multinational enterprise; Foreign affiliate; Strategic role; Relatedness; Global value chain	KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; BUSINESS RELATEDNESS; DECISION-MAKING; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES; DIVESTITURE; PERSPECTIVE; LOCATION; FIRM	Divestments by multinational enterprises (MNEs) of their foreign affiliates are an increasingly important phenomenon in the contemporary global economy. We investigate what determines the likelihood that a foreign affiliate will be divested emphasising, in particular, the strategic roles played by the affiliates within their parent MNEs' global value chains, and hence the degree of relatedness between the affiliate and the parent firm. We find that poor parent performance and poor affiliate performance are key determinants of affiliate divestment, but that the magnitude of these effects varies significantly depending upon whether the affiliates are in related or unrelated sectors, are horizontal or vertical affiliates, and are located upstream or downstream in the global value chain of their parent MNE.

J	Baglioni, E				Baglioni, Elena			The Making of Cheap Labour across Production and Reproduction: Control and Resistance in the Senegalese Horticultural Value Chain	WORK EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						class; gender; global value chains; households; labour disciplining; labour exploitation; labour regimes; political economy; social reproduction; unpaid work	GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS; GENDER; GLOBALIZATION; COMMODITY; MARRIAGE; POLITICS; REGIMES; WOMEN	This article investigates the making of cheap workers at the bottom of global value chains. Adopting a class relational approach, it engages in labour regime and social reproduction analyses, to examine the labour process in Senegalese export horticulture and its relations with rural households. Drawing from primary qualitative data, it analyses power relations within workplaces and households investigating the structural relations between them through the disciplining and exploitation of women. It argues that labour control beyond workplaces is crucial to the supply of cheap and disciplined workers, showing how patriarchy and religion regulate a continuum of class relations between households, fields, and packaging centres. It shows the inherent conflict between production and reproduction intensifies South of the supply chain and fuels fragmentation of women in 'classes of labour'. While women shape, respond and defy some forms of subordination, their resistance to the combined pressures of disciplining and exploitation is less manifest.

J	Bhattacharya, S; Momaya, KS				Bhattacharya, Sanjay; Momaya, K. S.			Actionable strategy framework for digital transformation in AECO industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						4IR; Strategy as process and practice (SAPP); Digital transformation strategy; AECO competitiveness; Comprehensive; integrating framework; Continuity and change	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; EVOLUTION; GLOBALIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; CAPABILITIES; AUTOMATION; CONTINUITY; READINESS; FUTURE	Purpose The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) holds the potential to improve capabilities- and technology-based innovation, which will enable breakout for architectural, engineering, construction and operation and maintenance (AECO) companies, for international competitiveness. Though the top management of such companies is convinced on the utility of the applications, they are unsure on the strategy of implementing the same. The objective of this research is to suggest a strategy framework for digital transformation of the AECO value chain. Design/methodology/approach The nascent level of research on 4IR in construction necessitated the adoption of the integrative review methodology for the study. Extensive literature review of research on strategy and 4IR has been utilized to establish the validity of the first two pillars, namely "a strategy of simple rules in a complex environment; and deployment of dynamic capabilities." The validation of a construct for the third pillar of "confluence of change and continuity forces" has been achieved via hypothesis testing of data obtained through a questionnaire survey. Findings The present study has integrated three diverse ideas of strategy, named as the pillars, to facilitate sustainable digital transformation. Within the third pillar, top three continuity forces which offer resistance to change are organization culture, existing delivery processes and networks, and existing standard operating procedures. On the other hand, the leading drivers of change are needs of competitiveness; global industry trends and the advent of new technologies/innovations. Research limitations/implications This provides a practical approach to operationalize digital transformation of the AECO at an organization level. The validation relied on opinion and perspectives of a sample frame in the Indian context, which was its limitation. Originality/value This paper suggests a strategy framework of three pillars to help address specific strategy dilemmas during implementation of digital transformation of particular organizations in AECO. The study contributes to both theory and practice by helping leaders of AECO companies, associations, policymakers and the academia to strategize transformations successfully.

Design/methodology/approach The study employs a dual macro-micro lens based on global value chain (i.e. market, modular, relational and captive governance modes) and social network analysis (network centrality) to assess the impact of power (im)balance onto financial performance. Different from previous research, this study adopts information reliability techniques - such as information entropy - to differentiate the weights of distinct financial performance metrics in terms of the maximal entropy principle. This principle states that the probability distribution that best represents the current state of knowledge given prior data is the one with largest entropy. These weights are used in TOPSIS analysis. Findings Results offer insightful reflections to SCM research. We show that buyers outperform suppliers due to power asymmetry. We ground our findings both analyzing across governance modes and comparing network centrality. We show that market and modular governances (where power balance prevails) outperform relational and captive modes at the dyadic level - thus inferring that in the long run these governance modes may lead to financially healthier supply chains. Originality/value This study advances SCM research by exploring the impact of governance modes and network centrality on performance at both firm and dyadic levels while employing an innovative combination of secondary data and robust set of techniques including TOPSIS, WASPAS and information entropy.

J	Potnis, DD; Halladay, M				Potnis, Devendra Dilip; Halladay, Macy			Role of gatekeeping on Facebook in creating information benefits for vulnerable, pregnant women in the rural United States	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Gatekeeping; Social networking sites (SNS); Facebook; Vulnerable populations; Information vulnerability; Pregnant women; Information benefits; Rural United States	HEALTH; INTERNET; SUPPORT; ONLINE; TECHNOLOGY; ALGORITHMS; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK	Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate why and how gatekeepers on social networking sites (SNS) create what types of information benefits for gated, vulnerable, pregnant women in the rural United States. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative study adopts "network gatekeeping" as a theoretical lens to implement a combination of deductive and inductive qualitative approaches for analyzing in-depth interviews with members and administrators of a Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) Group on Facebook with a membership of over 500 pregnant women in rural Appalachia in the United States. Findings The VBAC group administrators' (a) vision of transforming the existing doctor-centric birth culture to a more mother-centric birth culture in the rural United States, (b) expertise and experience in healthcare and (c) valuing scientific, evidence-based information lead to recurring, authoritative but evolving manifestations of combinations of nine network gatekeeping mechanisms. Implementations of nine network gatekeeping mechanisms (i.e. localization, infrastructure, cost effect, channeling, censorship, regulation, editorial, user-interaction and value adding mechanisms) help VBAC group administrators control interactions and information on the group, thereby creating 16 information benefits for the gated, vulnerable women before, during and after pregnancy. Originality/value This sociological study of network gatekeeping posits and proves an "information value chain" (i.e. Why to create information benefits? - How to create information benefits? - What types of information benefits?) for vulnerable, pregnant women on Facebook. Rarely any study shows the role of network gatekeeping mechanisms in implementing an information value chain.

Among the variety of technological innovations and considering the scarcity of resources, it is unclear which technologies to focus on and where to implement them in the value chain. To develop the most probable technology forecast that addresses the application of emerging technologies in the grocery value chain within the current decade, we conduct a two-stage Delphi study. Our results suggest a high relevance of almost all technologies. The panel is only skeptical about three specific projections. As a consequence, grocers are advised to build up knowledge regarding the application of these technologies in the most promising areas of their value chain.

J	Lamghari, A; Dimitrakopoulos, R; Senecal, R				Lamghari, Amina; Dimitrakopoulos, Roussos; Senecal, Renaud			A matheuristic approach for optimizing mineral value chains under uncertainty	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						Mineral value chains; Mining complexes; Stochastic simultaneous optimization; Large-scale optimization; Matheuristics; Decomposition	MINING COMPLEXES; OPEN-PIT; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; PROGRAMS	Mineral value chains, also known as mining complexes, involve mining, processing, stockpiling, waste management and transportation activities. Their optimization is typically partitioned into separate stages, considered sequentially. An integrated stochastic optimization of these stages has been shown to increase the net present value of the related mining projects and operations, reduce risk in meeting production targets, and lead to more robust and coordinated schedules. However, it entails solving a larger and more complex stochastic optimization problem than separately optimizing individual components of a mineral value chain does. To tackle this complex optimization problem, a new matheuristic that integrates components from exact algorithms (relaxation and decomposition), machine learning techniques (reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks), and heuristics (local improvement and randomized search) is proposed. A general mathematical formulation that serves as the basis for the proposed methodology is also introduced, and results of computational experiments are presented.

J	Bair, J; Mahutga, M; Werner, M; Campling, L				Bair, Jennifer; Mahutga, Mathew; Werner, Marion; Campling, Liam			Capitalist crisis in the "age of global value chains"	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Article						World Bank; global value chains; trade; development; World Development Report	PRODUCTION NETWORKS; WORLD-BANK; COMMODITY CHAINS; GOVERNANCE; INDUSTRIAL; TRADE; RISE; GLOBALIZATION; NEOLIBERALISM; CONSEQUENCES	In this article, we analyze the strategies, surprises, and sidesteps in the World Bank's 2020 World Development Report, Trading for Development in the Age of Global Value Chains. Strategically, the Report promotes an expansion of neoliberal globalization couched in the language of global value chains. Curiously detached from the broader academic literature on global value chains in international trade, it promotes a sequentialist vision of global value chain upgrading that evokes the stagism of classic modernization theory. The authors sidestep important issues, such as China's pivotal role in the landscape of global trade, and are largely silent on others, including climate change. Significantly and somewhat surprisingly, given the general endorsement of global value chain integration, the Report acknowledges negative distributional trends associated with the rise of global value chains, including the excessive benefits reaped by "superstar firms" and the now well-documented decline in labor's income share. These observations are not reflected in the document's policy section, however, where the World Development Report largely recapitulates familiar prescriptions, with the threat of nationalist populism and rising protectionism providing a new bottle for this old wine. Drawing on a range of literature including United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's 2018 Trade and Development Report, we highlight not only the limits of the Bank's adherence to an increasingly embattled orthodoxy, but also the necessary starting points for a more useful discussion of the merits, limits, and future of global value chains.

J	Birat, JP				Birat, Jean-Pierre			MFA vs. LCA, particularly as environment management methods in industry: an opinion	MATERIAUX & TECHNIQUES			English	Article						LCA; MFA; management tool; industry; materials		MFA was born in the 1980s, independently, in various laboratories around the world. On the one hand, Industry was trying then to put numbers on its circular economy practices, while, on the other, Academia endeavored to construct a metaphor of natural ecology (BioGeoChemical Cycles [BGCC]) or of the metabolism of ecosystems to describe the activities of the anthroposphere, especially its material and the energy flows (and stocks). This article briefly reviews the early efforts of Usinor (now ArcelorMittal) in this area, in the framework of a program called "The Cycle of Iron" and points out what it was trying to achieve: basically, analyze and evaluate a true recycling rate (RR) of steel. MFA turned out to be potentially a more powerful tool than ad hoc models of materials circularity too and Industry left the leadership to academic groups to flesh out the new methodology to confront such difficult questions as the evaluation of a RR. Then the article conducts a kind of methodological and epistemological audit of the present status of MFA, positioning it in the wide framework of descriptions of material flows in space and time, and thus picturing it as a competing methodology to LCA. While the former is macro-scale, synchronic, broadly economy-oriented, the latter is micro-scale, diachronic, product and value chain-oriented, while both "report" to different communities, the Industrial Ecology community and the LCA community respectively, and more. Both schools of thoughts have been attending SAM conferences regularly, where they have been reporting their continuous search for new developments and their search for a better sustainability assessment of materials, products, industrial systems and economic activities of all kinds. The various contributions over the first 12 SAM events are analyzed. Finally, MFA and LCA are compared, feature by feature, in terms of the communities they serve and of their strengths and weaknesses. Unsurprisingly, the conclusion is that they are more complementary than competing with each other.

J	Colla, V; Pietrosanti, C; Malfa, E; Peters, K				Colla, Valentina; Pietrosanti, Costanzo; Malfa, Enrico; Peters, Klaus			Environment 4.0: How digitalization and machine learning can improve the environmental footprint of the steel production processes	MATERIAUX & TECHNIQUES			English	Article						digitalization; Industry 4.0; Artificial Intelligence; machine learning; steel industry; environmental footprint; carbon neutrality		The concepts of Circular Economy and Industrial Symbiosis are nowadays considered by policy makers a key for the sustainability of the whole European Industry. However, in the era of Industry4.0, this results into an extremely complex scenario requiring new business models and involve the whole value chain, and representing an opportunity as well. Moreover, in order to properly consider the environmental pillar of sustainability, the quality of available information represents a challenge in taking appropriate decisions, considering inhomogeneity of data sources, asynchronous nature of data sampling in terms of clock time and frequency, and different available volumes. In this sense, Big Data techniques and tools are fundamental in order to handle, analyze and process such heterogeneity, to provide a timely and meaningful data and information interpretation for making exploitation of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence possible. Handling and fully exploiting the complexity of the current monitoring and automation systems calls for deep exploitation of advanced modelling and simulation techniques to define and develop proper Environmental Decision Support Systems. Such systems are expected to extensively support plant managers and operators in taking better, faster and more focused decisions for improving the environmental footprint of production processes, while preserving optimal product quality and smooth process operation. The paper describes a vision from the steel industry on the way in which the above concepts can be implemented in the steel sector through some application examples aimed at improving socio-economic and environmental sustainability of production cycles.

J	Fakih, M; Klemp, O; Puch, S; Gruttner, K				Fakih, Maher; Klemp, Oliver; Puch, Stefan; Gruttner, Kim			A modeling methodology for collaborative evaluation of future automotive innovations	SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING			English	Article						Innovation Modeling Grid (IMoG); Automotive innovations; Model-based design; SysML		The rapid introduction of innovations plays a major role in automotive industries. Today, once a member of the automotive value chain devises an innovation, the time-to-market could be years due to traditional forms of collaboration. It is thus indispensable for companies to collaborate on reducing the time to find and design innovations in order to remain competitive. One idea is to streamline the innovation process outside current product development cycles (7 + years) within the automotive value chain. In our work, we propose a modeling methodology offering a better collaboration in this innovation design phase. Beginning with the innovation idea, our approach allows capturing requirements, functional, and structural aspects of the innovation under design in an innovation model with defined semantics. This innovation model can then be exchanged between automotive partners, who in their turn can refine and exchange the refined model within an iterative process toward an initial innovation evaluation. Additionally, we propose a generic description of how such innovation models can be captured in SysML, a system modeling standard. Our approach is illustrated by a "wireless car charging" innovation case-study showing how a possible collaboration at different modeling abstraction levels could take place and how consistency of the models exchanged can be verified. The consistency check is exemplified by timing specifications.

Targeted applications include sensing, energy conversion, and storage. Phosphorene is one of the most promising systems in this context, but its high reactivity under atmospheric conditions and its small-area/lab-scale deposition techniques have hampered the introduction of this material in real-world applications so far. However, phosphorene oxides in the form of low-dimensional structures (2D POx) should behave as an electroresponsive material according to recent theoretical studies. In the present work, we introduce electrospraying for the deposition of stoichiometric and large-area 2D POx nanoflakes starting from a suspension of liquid-phase-exfoliated phosphorene. We obtained 2D POx nanostructures with a mean surface area two orders of magnitude larger than phosphorene structures obtained with standard mechanical and liquid exfoliation techniques. X-ray spectroscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy confirmed the P2O5-like crystallographic structure of the electrosprayed flakes. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated for the first time the electromechanical responsivity of the 2D P2O5 nanoflakes, through piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). This work sheds light on the possible implementation of phosphorus oxide-based 2D nanomaterials in the value chain of fabrication and engineering of devices, which might be easily scaled up for energy-harvesting/conversion applications.

Current research has also shown the possibility of using portable instruments as tools to monitor composition along the entire food value chain. The objective of this study was to evaluate two sample presentation methods (dry powder and fruit puree) to measure total soluble solids (TSS) and moisture (M) in wild harvested Kakadu plum (KP) (Terminalia ferdinandiana, Combretaceae). Kakadu plum is an endemic plant of Australia that contains high concentrations of vitamin C, ellagic acid as well as other bioactive compounds. These properties make this plant of high economic and social importance for the Aboriginal communities of Australia. Fruit samples were wild harvested in January 2020 from locations in the Kimberley region (Western Australia, Australia) and analysed using both reference and NIR spectroscopic methods. The SECV and RPD values in cross validation were 0.65% (RPD: 2.2) and 0.22% (RPD: 4.2) to predict M and TSS in the KP dry powder samples. The SECV and RPD values obtained in cross validation for the KP fruit puree samples were 0.56% (RPD: 2.8) and 0.24% (RPD: 3.8) for M and TSS, respectively. The results of this study demonstrated the ability of NIR spectroscopy to measure M and TSS in wild harvest fruit. These findings can be also utilised by the Aboriginal communities to develop a grading/sorting system to rapidly screen and evaluate relevant chemical parameters associated with fruit quality and safety.

Wolf is carbon neutral with utilization of waste-based organic fertilizer and process carbon dioxide capture	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Short rotation coppice; Salix schwerinii; Bioethanol; RED; Biorefining		The sustainability of transportation biofuel production value chains is under discussion as a consequence of the implementation of the European Union Bioeconomy Strategy and renewable energy production. Greenhouse gas emissions from the biomass produced for biofuel, and the energy required during the production process are, in many cases, greater than the emission reductions from the biofuels that are produced and used to replace fossil fuels. In this study, the sustainability of bioethanol production from short rotation coppice Salix schwerinii was considered from cultivation and harvesting to biofuel pro-duction and distribution. The sustainability of the full value chain was evaluated according to the Eu-ropean Union Renewable Energy Directive and calculations of greenhouse gas emission savings (%) from biofuel production were compared to a reference fossil fuel (gasoline). For comparison, four bioethanol production scenarios were developed, and specific attention was focused on the utilization of waste-based organic fertilizers (for biomass production) and on carbon dioxide capture at the fermentation stage, and their effects on value chain greenhouse gas emissions. Based on our evaluation, Salix bio-ethanol production achieved 60% emission savings compared to the fossil reference (requirement for installations that will commence operations until end of December 2020). When waste based organic fertilizers were used in the Salix biomass production, 65% emission savings were achieved (requirement for the installations that will commence operations from 2021).

This study applies Porter's value chain to museum management to understand (1) how ICTs impact the primary production processes of museums, and (2) how museums are currently relocating in the new emerging environment. The study is conducted through an extensive literature review on museums and digital technologies. The research results identify four approaches to digital transformation: (1) a back-office approach to improve the preservation of cultural heritage; (2) an onsite approach to enhance the quality of the museum experience; (3) an online approach to extend the museum experience beyond museum doors; and (4) an onlife approach based on multisensorial and interactive technologies, LOD and IoT, to create a wider, more accessible and hybrid museum experience.

J	Liang, LM				Liang, Linmeng			Design of the Internet plus Drug Circulation Business Model Based on Value Chain	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article								With the continuous development of computers and the Internet, all industries in China have brought new opportunities for change, and pharmaceutical e-commerce has also shown great potential for development. With the call and encouragement of national policies, the "Internet + drug distribution" business model has shown great potential to replace the traditional drug distribution model in the near future due to its advantages of shortening the transaction process and reducing the cost of enterprises. This paper presents a literature review on theories related to "Internet + drug distribution," value chain and business model at home and abroad, and focuses on how traditional drug distribution enterprises should adopt the "Internet + drug distribution" model when the country is vigorously promoting it. The study focuses on how traditional pharmaceutical distribution companies should innovate their business models from the perspective of value chain to seek better development. By comparing the business models before and after the innovation, the new business model of "Internet + drug distribution" can help enterprises establish diversified value propositions, increase revenue channels, and reduce operating costs. At the same time, it can integrate and innovate the internal and external value chains of enterprises, so that traditional pharmaceutical distribution enterprises can further enhance their competitiveness and expand their market share. This thesis can enrich the application of value chain and business model theories in the field of "Internet + drug distribution," and it is hoped that the model experience developed in this thesis can be used as a reference for similar enterprises in their transformation process.

Ex-ante impact of on -farm diversification and forward integration on agricultural value chain resilience: A system dynamics approach	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Diversification; Forward integration; Value addition; Resilience	CROP DIVERSIFICATION; SUPPLY CHAIN; COCOA; CYCLE	Objective: This paper examines the ex-ante impacts of on-farm diversification and forward integration strategies on agricultural value chain resilience, with an empirical focus on Ghana's cocoa value chain. Method: System dynamics modelling was used to explore five scenarios involving variable-input on-farm diversification pursued by cocoa farmers in Ghana and the simultaneous adoption of forward integration stra-tegies by Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. Results and Conclusions: An adaptive strategy involving the simultaneous pursuit of variable-input on-farm diversification and a cooperative forward integration strategy by both Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire was found to result in the highest level of resilience. Under such an adaptive strategy, in-country processors will be the most impacted when the level of safety stocks are below 25% of the average stock level during the period of losses in raw material production. Significance: The findings suggest that a policy direction that supports on-farm diversification and in-country processing enhances the aggregate resilience of the cocoa value chain, irrespective of the forward integration strategy adopted by Cote d'Ivoire.

Their effectiveness with links to geodemographic conditions has not been analysed systematically in studying biogas development in a less urbanised regions, with high potential and primitive gas infrastructure. One such region identified is Gavleborg in Sweden. By using value chain statistics, interviews with related actors, and studying biofuels policy instruments and implications for biogas development, it is found that the policy measures have not been as effective in the region as in the rest of Sweden due to different geodemographic characteristics of the region, which has resulted in impeded biogas development. In addition to factors found in previous studies, the less-developed biogas value chain in this region can be attributed particularly to undefined rules of the game, which is lack of consensus on trade-off of resources and services, unnecessary competition among several fuel alternatives, as well as the ambiguity of municipalities' prioritization, and regional cultural differences. To strengthen the regional biogas sector, system actors need a strategy to eliminate blocking effects of identified local factors, and national policy instruments should provide mechanisms to process geographical conditions in regulatory, economic support, and market formation.

Today, the main economic driver for waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) recycling stems from metal recovery. WEEE plastics recycling, on the other hand, still represents a major challenge. Strategies like design 'for', but also the much younger concept of design 'from' recycling play a key role in closing the material loops within a circular economy. While these strategies are usually analysed separately, this brief report harmonises them in comprehensive Design for Circularity guidelines, established in a multi-stakeholder collaboration with industry leaders from the entire WEEE value chain. The guidelines were developed at the product and part levels. They are divided in five categories: (1) avoidance of hazardous substances; (2) enabling easy access and removal of hazardous or polluting parts; (3) use of recyclable materials; (4) use of material combinations and connections allowing easy liberation; (5) use of recycled materials. These guidelines are the first harmonised set to be released for the EEE industry. They can readily serve decision-makers from different levels, including product designers and manufacturers as well as policymakers.

Crimson Seedless) along the Supply Chain and Associated Economic, Environmental and Resource Impacts	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						postharvest losses; food waste; physicochemical properties; table grape; shelf-life; decay; stem browning; SO2 damage; socioeconomic impacts	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; COLD-STORAGE; PROCESSED FOODS; VINIFERA L.; BOTRYTIS; RACHIS; FRESH; ATTRIBUTES; LINERS; WASTE	High incidence of postharvest losses is a major challenge to global food security. Addressing postharvest losses is a better strategy to increase business efficiency and improve food security rather than simply investing more resources to increase production. Global estimates show that fruit and vegetables are the highest contributors to postharvest losses and food waste, with 45% of production lost. This represents 38% of total global food losses and waste. However, the lack of primary data on postharvest losses at critical steps in the fruit value chain and the unknown economic, environmental and resource impacts of these losses makes it difficult to formulate mitigation strategies. This paper quantifies postharvest losses and quality attributes of 'Crimson Seedless' table grapes at farm and simulated retail levels. Table grapes were sampled from four farms in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, the largest deciduous fruit production and export region in Southern Africa. Mean on-farm losses immediately after harvest was 13.9% in 2017 and 5.97% in 2018, ranging from 5.51% to 23.3% for individual farms. The main reason for on-farm losses was mechanical damage (7.1%). After 14 days in cold storage (-0.3 +/- 0.7 degrees C, 81.3 +/- 4.1% RH), mean grape losses were 3.05% in 2017 and 2.41% in 2018, which increased to 7.41% in 2017 and 2.99% in 2018, after 28 days. After 10 days of further storage under simulated market conditions (5.4 +/- 0.6 degrees C, 83.7 +/- 2.9% RH), fruit losses were 3.65% during retail marketing and 4.36% during export. Storing grapes under ambient conditions (25.1 +/- 1.3 degrees C and 46.6 +/- 6.0% RH) resulted in a higher incidence of losses, increasing from 7.03 to 9.59 and 14.29% after 3, 7 and 10 days, respectively. The socioeconomic impacts of these postharvest losses amounted to financial losses of over ZAR 279 million (USD 17 million according to the conversion rate of 20 October 2020) annually, and this was associated with the loss of 177.43 million MJ of fossil energy, 4.8 million m(3) of fresh water and contributed to the emission of approximately 52,263 tons of CO2 equivalent.

The Unexplored Socio-Cultural Benefits of Coffee Plants: Implications for the Sustainable Management of Ethiopia's Coffee Forests	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						socio-cultural benefits; Gomma; symbolic; utility; coffee forest; society	HERITAGE TREES; LOSS CONTINUES; ARABICA; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; SECTOR; POLICY; BITTER	Coffee is among the most popular commodity crops around the globe and supports the livelihoods of millions of households along its value chain. Historically, the broader understanding of the roles of coffee has been limited to its commercial value, which largely is derived from coffee, the drink. This study, using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, explores some of the unrevealed socio-cultural services of coffee of which many people are not aware. The study was conducted in Gomma district, Jimma Zone, Oromia National Regional state, Ethiopia, where arabica coffee was first discovered in its natural habitat. Relying on a case study approach, our study uses ethnographic study methods whereby results are presented from the communities' perspectives and the subsequent discussions with the communities on how the community perspectives could help to better manage coffee ecosystems. Coffee's utilities and symbolic functions are numerous-food and drink, commodity crop, religious object, communication medium, heritage and inheritance. Most of the socio-cultural services are not widely known, and hence are not part of the benefits accounting of coffee systems. Understanding and including such socio-cultural benefits into the wider benefits of coffee systems could help in promoting improved management of the Ethiopian coffee forests that are the natural gene pools of this highly valuable crop.

Multilevel innovation platforms for development of smallholder livestock systems: How effective are they?	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multilevel structure; Innovation platforms; Functions of innovation systems, smallholder; livestock; Ethiopia	DAIRY DEVELOPMENT; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Context: There is growing recognition that sustainable development of smallholder agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a systems approach. One response to this has been applying the agricultural innovation systems concept and the use of Innovation Platforms (IP) as tools for agricultural development. By providing social space and facilitating interactions among farmers, researchers and other stakeholders, IPs can promote collective action and foster innovation. Objective: The question is, how effective are these IPs in stimulating innovation that can be sustained beyond their lifetime, and can they be used to link issues across multiple scales? The case study reported here examined the effect of a multilevel IP structure in achieving smallholder livestock innovation outcomes in the Ethiopian Highlands. Methods: Two years after the multilevel IPs were phased out, focus group discussions and key informant interviews with multiple stakeholders from all levels of the IP were undertaken to collect qualitative data on the innovation processes and analysed using thematic analysis. Results and Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a series of IPs inter-linked across scales facilitated researcher-led technical innovations that enhanced farmers and livestock experts' capacity around feed technologies. The multilevel IPs also improved linkages and strengthened partnerships between actors within and across levels to effectively implement farm-level technologies. However, sustained innovation requires creating a shared understanding among actors on the complex nature of the various value chain issues that need to be addressed to achieve meaningful change. Specifically, we found that farmers lack access to affordable services. This requires integrating value chain concepts within multilevel IPs at the early stages of formation to engage relevant actors across levels to stimulate multiple interventions beyond the farm-level. Significance: Changes are needed at the organisational level to facilitate reconfiguration of resources and devolution of responsibilities to support the innovation process. The existence of power dynamics and an institutional context favouring the status quo are key issues that need to be considered when building and evaluating effective multilevel IPs to achieve inclusive value chain innovations.

However, the organic growers have been facing issues in production, organic certification, and product marketing. To date, little is known about the challenges faced by the organic growers in Kathmandu valley. This study aimed to explore the status of organic farming, attitudes of farmers towards organic farming, their suggestions for improvement, and strengthening the value chain of organic products. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at Agriculture Knowledge Centre, Lalitpur, Nepal during December 2019 with 37 organic growers directly or indirectly involved in organic farming. The results showed that organic growers face challenges in marketing and institutional recognition. Challenges in product certification and marketing were reported by 45.95% of the total interviewed organic growers while following organic practices (transitional organic). Our study suggested that reducing the cost of production through easy access to organic inputs like organic seeds, fertilizers, and biopesticides are highly desired by the growers. Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) or group certification along with collective marketing could be the policy implications to address the issues. Organic farming in Kathmandu valley is limited to a niche market; however, due to increasing consumer demand for safe, fresh, and local food, the popularity of organic products is extending to other regions within the country.

Along the processing steps, several by-products are produced. This work is focused on the thermochemical use of Jatropha and Moringa husk in order to increase the overall value chain of their utilization. Comprehensive characterization studies and their assessment for calorific utilization are quite limited in the literature. The scope of the paper is a comprehensive fuel characterization based on the results, with focus on thermochemical utilization pathways. Proximate analysis shows that Jatropha and Moringa husk have low moisture content (9.19 and 6.25%, respectively) and ash (< 5%) and high content of volatile components. Higher values of C, N and S for M. oleifera in comparison with J. curcas husk were obtained. M. oleifera seed husk shows the highest LHV (20.83 MJ kg(-1)). The ash melting analysis of husk shows melting points above 1500 degrees C. By simulation of the gasification process, the LHV, the amount of gas producer and energy output are estimated. The energy produced by simulation of gasification demonstrates that it is enough to cover the energy needs involved in a biodiesel facility with capacity of 800 L of biodiesel per day.

While transitioning from a linear production system to a closed-loop system is not straightforward, adequate methodology and tools can support industrialists in this sustainable shift. This paper proposes a multi-tool approach to systematically identify, classify, and assess the contribution of influence parameters and action levers to close the loop on products and key materials. Industrial ecology and model-based engineering tools are combined to ensure a systemic analysis and evaluation. The developed multi-tool approach combines, in a stepwise methodology, material flow analysis, fuzzy cognitive mapping, structural analysis, and system dynamics, to model and qualify the impact of potential and promising CE strategies. To illustrate each step of this multi-tool methodology, a case study is carried out on a real-world industrial product: a catalytic converter, which contains a non-negligible amount of platinum, considered as a critical raw material by the European Commission. New insights to close the loop on platinum from catalytic converters are thus provided and discussed. Notably, the connections between key action levers to close the loop on platinum are identified and highlighted, including regulations to limit the number of exports, mandatory recycling and reuse rate, end-users behaviors, based on regulatory constraints and financial motivations, and platinum price fluctuation. These findings could help to generate and fine-tune an ad hoc system dynamics model to evaluate the impact of key action levers through more specific scenarios. For instance, the broader implication of this multi-tool methodology could support an original equipment manufacturer in the evaluation of potential CE strategies, through the simulation of selected action levers on the circularity and sustainability performance of their value chain. Ultimately, it could provide quantitative insights to relevant prospective questions, such as, what if a take-back scheme is proposed to augment the collection rate by a given percentage, or what if the design is modified for easy disassembly.

Thus, they seek greater flexibility and agility to cope with disruptions, as well as to solve needs or meet the demand for growth. Therefore, smart industrial applications require a lot of flexibility to be able to react more quickly to continuous market changes, offer more personalized products, increase operational efficiency, and achieve optimum operating points that integrate the entire value chain of a process. This requires the capture of new data that are subsequently processed at different levels of the hierarchy of automation processes, with requirements and technologies according to each level. The result is a new challenge related to the addition of new functionalities in the processes and the interoperability between them. This paper proposes a distributed computational component-based framework that integrates communication, computation, and storage resources and real-time capabilities through container technology, microservices, and the publish/subscribe paradigm, as well as contributing to the development and implementation of industrial automation applications by bridging the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. The main idea is to enable plug-and-play software components, from predefined components with their interrelationships, to achieve industrial applications without losing or degrading the robustness from previous developments. This paper presents the process of design and implementation with the proposed framework through the implementation of a complex pH control process, ranging from the simulation part to its scaling and implementation to an industrial level, showing the plug-and-play assembly from a definition of components with their relationships to the implementation process with the respective technologies involved. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was experimentally verified in a real production process, showing that the results scaled to an industrial scale comply with the simulated design process. A qualitative comparison with traditional industrial implementations, based on the implementation requirements, was carried out. The implementation was developed in the beverage production plant "Punta Delicia", located in Colima, Mexico. Finally, the results showed that the platform provided a high-fidelity design, analysis, and testing environment for cyber information flow and their effect on the physical operation of the pH control.

Navigating risks and uncertainties: Risk perceptions and risk management strategies in the Philippine seaweed industry	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Risk perception; Risk management strategies; Philippine seaweed industry		The Philippine seaweed industry is affected by multiple but interrelated risks. Farmers mainly encountered environment-related risks (e.g. disease, pest infestations) which, if unmanaged, could result to production failure. Traders and processors considered volatility of seaweed supply and poor quality of raw materials as precursors of other risks such as increased competition among local traders and processing companies. Gender differences in awareness and knowledge of risks were more prominent among seaweed farmers but not among traders and processors as roles become more homogenous up the value chain. Poor governance resulted in the adoption of informal and market-driven strategies to prevent or minimise losses. However, this restricted farmers to participating in higher-income trading and processing activities and contributed to increased market inefficiency. The lack of government support has also curtailed the capacity of traders and processors to engage in product development and diversification. Gender and community experiences influence and shape people?s understanding of their situations and environment including their coping and adaptive strategies in sustaining livelihoods amidst recurring risk events. Embedding informal structures and the differential needs of the stakeholders in the national institutional framework is therefore essential for the promotion of resilient and sustainable seaweed industry.

While the benefits of new health resources are recognized, there is a distinct lack of accurate cost-of-illness information to aid healthcare decision makers. Methods The cost-of-illness study for CM was conducted from the perspective of two health systems in Brazil: the public health system (Unified Health System, SUS) and the private health system (Health Management Organization, HMO). The study considered the direct medical cost in a bottom-up analysis, using melanoma incidence, knowledge of the disease's progression, and the overall survival rates. The executional costs for the complete healthcare delivery cycle were investigated considering different disease stages and possible clinical course variations. The structural cost was assessed qualitatively considering the health value chain in Brazil. Results CM represents a critical financial burden in Brazil, and the cost of illness varied according to the health system and by stage at diagnosis. HMO patient costs are approximately 10-fold and 90-fold more than a SUS patient in the early-stage and advanced disease, respectively. Overall, spending on advanced disease patients can be up to 34-fold (SUS) or 270-fold (HMO) higher than that required for the early-stage disease. Given the massive amount of resources spent by the SUS and HMO, significant efforts must be made to improve the health value chain to deliver the right mix of medical care goods and services using available resources. Conclusion The cost-of-illness study for CM has the potential to inform policymakers and decision-makers regarding the economic burden that melanoma impose on a society in terms of the use of health care services, assisting them in making projections of future health care costs and resource allocation decisions. We believe that cost-of-illness analysis from a strategic perspective could be of help in assessing executional costs and be used to support the change in structural costs required for long-term strategies related to the health value chain.

J	Mao, ZQ				Mao, Zhuqing			GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS (GVCS) AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: A NONLINEAR ANALYSIS	SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						Global value chains; economic growth; nonlinear analysis; quantitative analysis; emerging economies	INNOVATION SYSTEMS; INSTITUTIONS; SPECIALIZATION; GOVERNANCE; SUPPLIERS; EMPIRICS; FIRMS	This study examines the relationship between economic growth and participation in global value chains (GVCs) and demonstrates that the U-shaped nonlinear pattern of GVCs could be more effective than the simple linear pattern of GVCs in terms of economic growth in high- and middle-income economies. The U-shaped nonlinear pattern expresses that there are decreasing foreign-dominated GVCs (increasing high value-added domestic value chains) for building local value chain and then raise the GVCs participation to benefit at a better position in GVCs. This paper investigates a panel of 63 advanced and emerging economies and obtained significant evidence by using systemic quantitative analysis. This research suggests that emerging markets should decrease foreign-dominated GVCs (increase high value-added domestic value chain) and then raise the participation of the GVC for economic growth.

J	Rathzel, N				Rathzel, Nora			Trade union perceptions of the labour - nature relationship	ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						Environmental Labour Studies; labour-Nature Alliance; worker environmentalism; social movement unionism		This paper is based on research with environmentally engaged trade unionists in India. It follows their trajectories into the trade union and explores their environmental engagements. A short presentation of the history of Indian trade unionism, aims to understand its 'multi-unionism'. Analysing three exemplary life-histories of unionists, their motivations to engage in unions and their relationships to workers and to poor people, three models of perceiving the labour-nature relationship are offered: the container model, nature as a mediator of survival, and the nature-labour alliance. I show that the way in which unionists perceive the labour-nature relationship is shaped by their practices and influences their environmental policies. Furthermore, trade unions who seek alliances with other social movements on equal terms, develop a more comprehensive perception of the labour-nature relationship and thereby the development of more wide-ranging environmental policies. I conclude suggesting that the conditions enabling a more comprehensive perception of the labour-nature relationship could become possible if workers along the value chain could collaborate to learn from each other about their working conditions and the natures they transform.

J	Medcalf, N				Medcalf, Nicholas			Re-engineering the innovator-clinic interface for adoption of advanced therapies	REGENERATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						activity-based cost analysis; Advanced Therapy Treatment Centres; business process re-engineering; hospitals; institutional readiness; risk-sharing; technology adoption		Tweetable abstract The cost of clinical adoption of advanced therapies must include the impact of any shortfall in 'institutional readiness'. This paper proposes wider use of business process engineering accompanied by activity-based cost analysis to quantify the cost of such impact. The relationship between regenerative medicine innovators and the clinics that will use their inventions continues to evolve. In the UK, the Advanced Therapy Treatment Centres exemplify this. The agents in the value chain are becoming collaborators in a shared innovation process. This paper proposes a larger role for systems engineering in this change and a cost-based representation of institutional readiness in designing suitable operational models for clinical adoption. The proposed approach places this value in a whole-lifetime cost framework. The current value for the adoption process can then be estimated for comparison with the sum of the adoption costs, the costs of operating at steady state and, if need be, replacement costs at end of life of the innovation.

The information on viral agents spread and persistence in the Vietnamese eel aquaculture is scarce. Therefore, the mortality of A. marmorata at the Van Xuan Farm was the prerequisite to identify the possible aetiologic agent and additionally to formulate first recommendations for viral disease screening in the Vietnamese eel aquaculture. Juvenile giant mottled eels with haemorrhagic lesions in the skin and liver, and hyperaemia of the gut were tested with qPCR and end-point PCR for AngHV-1 presence. Here, we report the first detection of AngHV-1 associated with mortality in giant mottled eel in winter and spring seasons. On the basis of the obtained results, we recommend to test eel seeds in "hatcheries," since tropical eel farms operate in interconnected scheme and monitoring of AngHV-1 prevalence requires well-implemented measures. Disease screening in the rearing centres and on-growing facilities should be based on everyday health checks, including by-catch fish used as a base of the feeding programmes at eel farms in Vietnam.

J	Wei, W				Wei, Wang			The path of improving the value chain flow of agricultural products industry under the effect of technology agglomeration	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Technology agglomeration effect; industrial structure; agricultural products; value chain flow		Technology agglomeration effect is the economic effect produced by the spatial concentration of industry and economic activities, and it is one of the key factors to enhance the industrial value chain. In recent years, China's agricultural market has gradually opened up, speeding up the marketisation and commercialisation of agricultural products. However, due to the increasing competition in the Chinese agricultural market, the value chain of the agricultural product industry is facing many challenges. The challenges faced by the value chain of the agricultural product industry are of two types: upstream and downstream. The upstream is the scope to improve yield and scarcity of resources and the downstream includes food chain loss, consumption moving towards F & V and pulses and lack of transparency and traceability. Thus, on the basis of the connotation of the agricultural product industry's value chain and value flow, this article compares and analyses the development status of domestic and foreign industrial value chains, and finally proposes an upgrade path to increase the flow of Chinese agricultural industry's value chain. It is expected to provide a reference for improving the economic benefits of Chinese agricultural product industry's value chain.

Evidence from the Lao-Vietnamese border	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Agriculture; conservation agriculture; sustainable; maize; maize value chain; markets; Vietnam		Intensive maize cultivation in the uplands of North-west Vietnam has resulted in soil erosion leading to reduced maize yields along with negative impacts downstream. Despite the introduction of sustainable agricultural technologies over many years, adoption rates are low mostly due to their incompatibility with existing farming systems and lack of secure markets for alternative crops. In addition, the temporary nature of development programmes and limited capacity of government extension systems have resulted in limited spread of technology, and where they have been introduced, unable to secure long-lasting commitments from farmers. In this study, we explore an alternative model involving maize value chain actors for attaining more durable transition towards sustainable maize farming systems. We find maize traders operating at lower levels of the value chain with active engagement with the farming community to be best suited for engaging in technology dissemination. While their involvement may require additional incentives and oversight from the government it is imperative that support for commercialization through promising market links are established to achieve a more meaningful shift towards sustainable farming methods.

J	Miao, ZL				Miao, Zhenlong			Digital economy value chain: concept, model structure, and mechanism	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article						Digital economy; value chain; digital economy value chain (DEVC); model structure; operating mechanism		The paper breaks through the existing research on digital economy and value chain, puts forward to digital economy value chain (DEVC) for the first time, discusses the connotation, value activity composition, and value chain characteristics of the digital economy value chain. Digital Economy Value Chain is the innovation of the value chain driven by digital elements (data, digital technology, digital mode, etc.) and the integration of the digital economy and value chain. Its foothold in the digital elements and its essence is the chain organization of value creation activities of the digital economy. Every value-added link of the digital economy value chain can realize value creations. The flow direction of the value chain is the process of value creation and value transfer. At the same time, this study attempts to analyse the operation mechanism of the digital economy value chain. This paper analyzes the formation mechanism, transmission mechanism, and the working mechanism of the digital economy value chain, reveals the operation mechanism of the digital economy value chain, and constructs a complete theoretical framework of the digital economic value chain.

J	Reddy, K; Sasidharan, S				Reddy, Ketan; Sasidharan, Subash			Financial constraints and global value chain participation: Firm-level evidence from India	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Global value chains; financial constraints; manufacturing		This paper explores the relationship between financial constraints and firm participation in global value chains (GVC). We use a rich firm-level data belonging to the Indian manufacturing sector for the period 2001-2016. Controlling for endogeneity and sample selection bias, our empirical outcome reveals a negative impact of financial constraint on firm GVC participation. We also find that inter-firm trade credit fosters firm participation in GVCs. Our findings also highlight that firms dependent on external finance find it challenging to participate in GVCs. Further, sub-sample analysis shows a significant effect of financial constraints in the case of small firms. Finally, we find that firms that are relatively more financially constrained are more likely to become a part of GVC (GVC starters) during the study period. Our findings have strong policy implication on the lines of promoting GVC participation for Indian manufacturing firms and hence remains of interest for policymakers.

J	Roth, A; Zheng, YC				Roth, Aleda; Zheng, Yanchong			A Tale of Two Food Chains: The Duality of Practices on Well-being	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						food system; regenerative; organic practices; value chain innovation; quadruple&#8208; aim performance		In this paper, we honor Stanford University Professor Hau Lee, who is a great inspiration and thought leader in the supply chain and operations management (SC&OM) field. Our discussion centers around one of the most challenging SC&OM problems-food production, distribution, and consumption from dirt to table. We advocate and link our notions of emergent regenerative, organic food value chains (ROFVC) with quadruple-aim performance (QAP) that connects financial outcomes with ecological, human, and socioeconomic well-being. To do so, we first overview the systemic problems underlying the conventional food supply chains (CFSC) that render them unsustainable in the long run. In contrast, we introduce salient distinctions between CFSC and the new paradigm of ROFVC that uphold QAP. We believe the ideas generated in this paper can move the food systems' SC&OM design, implementation, and performance measurement from an efficiency-oriented industrial paradigm of large-scale, factory farming toward a more encompassing view of eco-responsible practices. In CFSC, the many hidden costs are cumulative and have broad deleterious consequences; however, in ROFVC, pollution is shunned and "taxed," and sustainability, as a public good, is rewarded by sequestering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintaining biodiversity, living soil, as well as clean air and water. We conclude with research, teaching, and policy agendas. We believe that the underlying principles here cut across sectors by fostering the introduction of regenerative business models that take a system's view in capturing QAP in their value chain strategy and execution.

J	Wang, JB; Xing, C				Wang Jianbo; Xing Cao			Factors Affecting the Evolution of Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Networks Based on Cloud Computing and Multiagent Simulation	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Facing the pressure of low-cost competition brought by the homogenization of commodities, the manufacturing industry seeks to survive by providing services. By providing outsourcing of value-added services to date, we are focusing on innovation in our business model. With the advancement of science and technology, manufacturing innovation is facing higher challenges, especially the popularization of the Internet, which makes the manufacturing industry have to move closer to new industries. Based on cloud computing, this paper conducts a multiagent simulation on the evolution factors of the innovation network of advanced manufacturing. This article takes three types of simulation subjects: evolutionary network, manufacturing (cluster), and innovation evolution system as the research objects. The factors affecting the evolution of the research are innovation resources, innovation opportunities, innovation desire, innovation pressure, relationship strength, network scale, and network scope. Network differences carry over variable indicators and analyze quantitative regression indicators and then build a research model. The research results show that the average conversion efficiency of the manufacturing industry (0.523) is significantly lower than the average R&D innovation efficiency (0.725), which to a certain extent indicates that the manufacturing industry still has weak links in the export conversion stage at the back end of the innovation value chain. Some of the companies may have problems such as low ability to transform scientific and technological achievements and insufficient export competitiveness of high-tech products, which to a large extent affects and restricts the improvement of manufacturing export transformation efficiency.

J	Schrobback, P; Rolfe, J				Schrobback, Peggy; Rolfe, John			Methodological and ideological options exploring supply chain models for Sydney rock oysters	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Australia; Models; Seafood; Supply chain; Sydney rock oyster; Value chain		The processing/wholesale supply chain model has been historically adopted by farmers of Australia's Sydney rock oyster (SRO) (Saccostrea glomerata) industry to transfer their product to consumers. The model has been criticized for restricting farmer's price bargaining power and for offering limited added value to the product. Recent anecdotal reports suggest that there has been a change in how oysters are supplied by farmers to the market. This case study aimed to map the supply chain of SROs at an industry level, to identify and to describe the existing supply and value chain models within the broader supply network structure, and to investigate factors that determine how farmers choose supply chain models. A literature review, a web-content search, and semi-structured interviews with supply chain stakeholders were undertaken to achieve these aims. Results suggest that the processing/wholesale model still plays a dominant role within the broader supply network. However, other models of supply chain coordination that generate higher returns have emerged in response to farmer's dissatisfaction with the processor/wholesaler model. Findings suggest that oyster farmers choose specific distribution models based on the net financial value they generate and other considerations such as farmers' skills, interest in maximizing profits, knowledge about consumer demand, time/effort to develop network links and existing trust-based relationships.

J	Liu, CJ; Zhao, GM				Liu, Cenjie; Zhao, Guomei			Can global value chain participation affect embodied carbon emission intensity?	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Global value chain participation; Embodied carbon emission intensity; Input-output method; Panel quantile regression	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; POLLUTION HAVEN HYPOTHESIS; CO2 EMISSIONS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; URBANIZATION; IMPACT; SOUTH	With the deepening of the global division of labor, it is significant to analyze the impact of global value chain participation on embodied carbon emission intensity. It provides implications for countries to address climate issues and improve development quality. The present work uses a multi-region input-output table provided by World Input Output Database to calculate the global value chain participation and the embodied carbon emission intensity of 42 different countries, for the period between 2000 and 2014. In addition, we decompose the carbon emission intensity into the carbon emission intensity embodied in domestic demand and foreign exports demand, and the carbon emission intensity of foreign exports demand is further divided into three types of embodied carbon emission intensity. Then, we analyze how global value chain participation affects the embodied carbon emission intensity, and examine different impacts across different development countries and different types of embodied carbon emission intensity. We also explore the different impacts under different embodied carbon emission intensity distributions. The results show that global value chain participation has a significantly negative impact on the embodied carbon emission intensity. Compared with the developed "north" countries, the global value chain participation of developing "south" countries have a larger negative impact of embodied carbon emission intensity. From the perspective of different types of demand, the impact of global value chain participation on carbon emission intensity embodied in foreign exports demand is greater than that embodied in domestic demand. The quantile regression results show that the global value chain participation at the high quantiles has a greater impact on the embodied carbon emission intensity, which indicates countries with higher embodied carbon emission intensity should participate in the global value chain to expand the production scale while reducing carbon emissions. These results provide relevant material and insights to countries about how their participation in the global production fragmentation affects their greenhouse gas emission profile, which can be used to elaborate structured political measures to address, at the same time, global market inclusion and climate change mitigation.

J	Schrage, S; Rasche, A				Schrage, Stephanie; Rasche, Andreas			Inter-Organizational Paradox Management: How national business systems affect responses to paradox along a global value chain	ORGANIZATION STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						corporate social responsibility; global value chains; living wages; national business systems; paradox		This study discusses the relationship between inter-organizational paradox management, national business systems and global value chains. Using case study evidence from a global value chain in the footwear industry (in Germany and China), we analyse how different businesses in the chain responded to the paradoxical tension arising from the competing demands to provide a living wage to workers and to uphold financial performance. Our findings highlight organizational responses to this paradox along the value chain, showing how these responses were shaped by the interplay of different types of pressures exerted by national business systems and the value chain itself. While these pressures were aligned in the German part of the chain, they were not aligned on the Chinese side. The study makes two contributions: (1) we develop a taxonomy outlining how the alignment of different types of pressures influences whether organizations choose either proactive or defensive paradox management; and (2) we argue that theorizing the impacts of cross-national distance on paradox management can be enhanced by adopting a multidimensional approach to institutional variety that extends beyond culture-based arguments.

J	Adu-Baffour, F; Daum, T; Birner, R				Adu-Baffour, Ferdinand; Daum, Thomas; Birner, Regina			Governance challenges of small-scale gold mining in Ghana: Insights from a process net-map study	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Artisanal small-scale mining; Mining legal framework; Governance challenges; Process net-map; Gold mining value chain; Mined land rehabilitation	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; HEALTH IMPACTS; MERCURY; COMANAGEMENT; LIVELIHOODS; REFLECTIONS; OPERATIONS; GOVERNMENT; COMMUNITY; GALAMSEY	The artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) sector - commonly described as low-tech, labor-intensive mineral extraction and processing, in developing countries, is increasingly associated with the use of heavy earth moving machines and hazardous chemicals for ore extraction, which can have negative implications on agricultural land use and the environment. Moreover, land reclamation, or the lack thereof, associated with ASM is a rising concern. Despite the potentially far-reaching effects of informal ASM operations on the environment and human health, the legal framework for ASM, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries, is not well implemented. Focusing on Ghana as a study case, this paper explores the factors that hinder the implementation of its legal framework for mining. A combination of qualitative explorative methods was applied, including an innovative tool called "Process Net-Map", a visual participatory mapping technique. The results help to explain the governance challenges of the ASM sector, enabling identification of policy reform options to address them. The findings exposed outdated legislature, which fails to capture the ever-growing complexities of the subsector's operations, as a major bottleneck. Hurdles associated with formal licensing bureaucracies and fees, land tenure, compliance monitoring, and ineffective collaboration of relevant stakeholders with and at the local level were identified as hindering the implementation of the existing legal framework. These bottlenecks must be addressed. Moreover, we recommend the adoption of collaborative governance systems, like co-management, which has been successfully implemented in other disciplines, in the ASM sector to ensure sustainability.

J	Cavallaro, E; Villani, I				Cavallaro, Eleonora; Villani, Ilaria			Club Convergence in EU Countries: A Sectoral Perspective	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION			English	Article						Club convergence; Dynamic factor model; Economic integration; Vertical specialization; Global value chain	PANEL-DATA; STRUCTURAL-CHANGE; PRODUCT-QUALITY; GROWTH; SPECIALIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; TRANSITION; EVOLUTION; EMPIRICS; EUROPE	We employ Phillips and Sul's (2007) nonlinear dynamic factor model to investigate whether economic integration within the EU has caused countries' productive structures to become increasingly similar and sector-level productivity to converge over the period 1995-2018. This analysis provides several results. First, the EU countries do not converge to a unique path; instead, we observe clustered patterns for aggregate and sector-level productivity growth. Second, although successful integration in global production networks enabled most Central-Eastern European countries to catch up to other EU countries, asymmetries have increased following the recent financial crisis. Third, the heterogeneity in countries' long-run productivity levels reflects differences in their vertical specialization; countries approaching the high-growth paths specialize in knowledge-intensive production, and the foreign value-added content of their exports is lower. Our analysis is relevant to the ongoing debate on the effects of internationalizing production, as it sheds light on countries' growth prospects and indicates possible directions for policy actions.

It analyzed the impacts of climate change on agriculture and livestock and identified key opportunities which can be tapped into to improve sustainability in food systems. The study applied a "multiple case studies approach" and collected data from four study sites at different altitudes, using the method of slow focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and non-participant observation. Findings revealed that the contribution of local agriculture and livestock to people's food consumption has gradually declined, increasing their dependence on external food items. Local food systems are losing diversity, which has negatively impacted people's dietary diversity. The youth has lost interest in agriculture due to low productivity and profitability in a high altitude village-Misgar (approximate to 3200 m above sea level). In all sites, local people perceived mixed impacts (both positive and negative) of climate change on food systems. Climate change together with enhanced use of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers, high yielding seed, and improved farm management have positive, and climate-attributed increase in crop pest attacks has negative impact on crop productivity. Moreover, local people perceived negative impacts of climate change on pastures and water availability in traditional irrigation systems without significant influence on crop and livestock productivity. In food systems, these are needed to maximize benefits from the local potential for organic production, livestock integration, value chain development, traditional food crops, medicinal plants, and protected vegetables cultivation to reduce the vulnerability of food systems to climactic and economic shocks, and improve the sustainability.

J	Koppenhagen, F; Held, T				Koppenhagen, F.; Held, T.			The implications of product modularisation on the development process, supplier integration and supply chain design in collaborative product development	ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supply chain design; Robust value chains; Modularity; Product development; Complexity management; Awarding process; Supplier integration; Automotive industry		Generating economies of scale is one of the most desirable goals when developing modular product systems. Since complex products are commonly developed in collaboration between an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and its suppliers, pursuing this goal inherently establishes interdependencies between the development process, supplier integration and supply chain design. To fully reap the benefits of modular product systems requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses these fields and addresses the interdependencies between them via a coherent collaboration between development and purchasing. This is the main focus of this work. In this paper, we first describe how the product development process has to be restructured for the concerted development of modules and overall products within the scope of a modular product system. Secondly, we propose a new collaboration model between the OEM and its suppliers, since OEMs need to collaborate directly with suppliers of lower levels of the value chain in order to facilitate the standardisation of components and modules across different products. Finally, we delineate an awarding process for both development services and production volumes for series supply that resolves the conflicting priorities of economies of scale and avoiding over-dependence on single suppliers. The process models described in this paper have been conceived based on systems engineering principles and have been successfully tested and further refined throughout several industrial projects carried out with two automotive manufacturers. The resulting approach will be demonstrated using a generic example taken from the automotive industry.

To approach these, a multipole refinement using the Hansen and Coppens method, followed by a topological analysis using Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules, was employed. The electron localization function based on density functional theory calculations supported the experimental findings. Thereby, unobserved electron shifts within the isobutyl group become detectable. It is shown that the impact of this electron shift is dependent mainly on whether the Bu-i substituent of the homoleptic triisobutylaluminum dimer [AI(i)Bu(3)](2)(1) is connected by a directional (sigma) or a multicenter (mu) bond to the metal. The effect found is assumed not only to be of paramount importance for organoaluminum compounds, widely used in synthesis and in the industrial value chain, but also to be present in organometallic chemistry in general.

J	Trejos, B; Flores, JC				Trejos, Bernardo; Flores, Juan Carlos			Influence of property rights on performance of community-based forest devolution policies in Honduras	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Community forestry; Devolution; Forest policy; Honduras; Land tenure; Property rights	NATURAL-RESOURCES; QUINTANA-ROO; GOVERNANCE; TENURE; DECENTRALIZATION; MANAGEMENT; INSTITUTIONS; MEXICO; PETEN; POWER	Devolution refers to shifting responsibility of forest management to community organizations, in contrast to public decentralization to local state institutions. Research on community forestry policies can aid in determining how property rights affect local governance structures. The objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of property rights on the application of devolution policies related to community-based forestry. The study included four sites in non-indigenous Honduras where forestry cooperatives were operating. Common property theory was used to interpret data gathered via value chain and sustainable livelihoods approaches. Results show that historical policy changes regarding land tenure recognition have affected community-based forestry initiatives. Recent policies have focused on the promotion of community-based forestry, which has resulted in an expansion in the area of devolved land. Nonetheless, de facto land tenure arrangements continue despite formal assignment of land. It was also found that these initiatives have been developed in areas where agricultural activities are less important. Strategies for inclusion of communities in forest management should not be based solely on the recognition of formal property rights. De facto ownership should also be considered when it is respected among local residents, as part of a local governance approach to forest management.

J	Xie, R; Niu, M; Su, B; Ge, JL				Xie, Rui; Niu, Meng; Su, Bin; Ge, Jiali			Are global value chains merely global? The case of Chinese Provinces in global value chains	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article						Global value chains; geographical distribution; changing mechanism; trans-national inter-regional input-output model		We extend the measure of the global value chain (GVC) decomposition framework to the sub-national regional level based on a new Trans-national Inter-regional Input-Output (TIIO) table , which covers 30 Chinese provinces for 2007 and 2012. We answer the question whether fragmentation of GVCs is mainly national, regional or merely global by deriving the geographical distribution by province and the trends related to the production chain of a particular final good. Depending on whether the intermediate inputs cross borders for production or not, we further divide these production activities into GVC or non-GVC activities and identify the changing mechanism from the perspective of simple and complex GVC activities. We find that coastal provinces show a higher decline in nationalization compared to inland provinces. The degree of regionalization weakening of each province is generally the same, which is more evident in coastal provinces. Additionally, coastal provinces show a more significant decline of globalization compared to inland provinces. Regarding border crossing production-sharing activities, complex GVC embeddedness is the main mode of Chinese provinces. They, however, show signs of gradual weakening over time. This is more pronounced in the dynamic evolution of regionalization and globalization in coastal provinces.

This study was initiated to identify the marketing channels of charcoal and the major factors influencing its market supply in Fagita Lekoma district, Northwest Ethiopia. Results of multiple regression analyses revealed that producers, brokers, local collectors, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are the main actors. The most important channel starts from producers and then involves brokers as an intermediary and directs into the out of region market. Retailers had the largest net profit margin. Age and educational level of household heads, price, and post-harvest value addition were significant factors that influence the market supply of charcoal. The major opportunities of charcoal marketing were the growing demand for charcoal, and adequate supply of labor; whereas, the major constraints were lack of government support, storage problems, problems of government policy, and lack of access to credit. The study identified the need for policy interventions by the Government to improve the sustainable development of charcoal production.

Therefore, understanding the farm-to-farm variation and longitudinal shifts in the composition of the bulk tank milk microbiota is fundamental to increase the quality and reduce the spoilage and waste of milk and dairy products. In this study, we performed a double experiment to study long- and short-term longitudinal shifts in microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We analyzed milk from 37 farms, that had also been investigated two years earlier, to understand the stability and overall microbial changes over a longer time span. In addition, we sampled bulk tank milk from five farms every 1-2 weeks for up to 7 months to observe short-term changes in microbial composition. We demonstrated that a persistent and farm-specific microbiota is found in bulk tank milk and that changes in composition within the same farm are mostly driven by bacterial genera associated with mastitis (e.g., Staphylococcus and Streptococcus). On a long-term, we detected that major shift in milk microbiota were not correlated with farm settings, such as milking system, number of cows and quality of the milk but other factors, such as weather and feeding, may have had a greater impact on the main shifts in composition of the bulk tank milk microbiota. Our results provide new information regarding the ecology of raw milk microbiota at the farm level.

In Sri Lanka, the agricultural sector is comprised largely of smallholder farmers where rain-fed rice is often a staple. Yet climate change projections indicate rice yields could drop by 40%, affecting the majority of farmers, and poverty levels could increase from 17% to 33%. At the same time, fertilisers are highly subsidized, without which farmers in this import-dependent island state would be exposed to future price fluctuations like the 800% phosphate price spike in 2008. Collaborative research between Sri Lankan and Australian researchers investigated the capacity of smallholder farmers, policy-makers and other food system stakeholders in Sri Lanka to adapt to these twin challenges via a participatory rapid integrated vulnerability assessment framework. We find that while Sri Lanka is vulnerable, there are many adaptive strategies already in place or planned. Although these strategies are not driven by climate change adaptation or phosphorus scarcity, they could be strengthened to support phosphorus and climate smart agriculture (PACSA). Sri Lanka's food production is in the midst of a major transformation, largely driven by the President's push for organic agriculture and organic fertilisers, waste-to-energy systems implemented through public-private partnerships, and the National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change. There are many 'win-win' PACSA opportunities both on- and off-farm, such as developing crop varieties that are drought-tolerant and need less phosphorus fertiliser and improved cold storage in the food value chain to reduce food losses.

Developing a self-sufficient Philippine milkfish industry through value chain analysis	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Milkfish value chain; Aquaculture investments; Philippine milkfish industry		The Philippine milkfish industry has been dependent on the importation of juveniles for grow-out ever since the decline of wild fry catch and with inadequate supply from local hatcheries. However, self-sufficiency is required to address recent global uncertainties. Value chain analysis of the upstream stages of the milkfish aquaculture pathway reveals options for efficient utilization of coastal aquaculture resources, capital investments and workforce. This paper presents a value chain that starts in an integrated breeding and hatchery (IBH) facility that will produce the required juveniles to yield 7.7 thousand mt milkfish valued at PHP 692 million per year (1 USD = 50 PHP). The number of IBH needed annually were determined, such that the country should have 60 IBH in 2030 to produce 448 thousand mt milkfish worth PHP 61 billion for its 128 million projected population. Economic analysis showed that public-private partnership should fund high-investment but low-profit IBH, while private investors should operate profit-earning hatcheries, nurseries and 4-cage mariculture system to secure the milkfish industry.

J	Eling, M; Nuessle, D; Staubli, J				Eling, Martin; Nuessle, Davide; Staubli, Julian			The impact of artificial intelligence along the insurance value chain and on the insurability of risks	GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE			English	Article; Early Access						Artificial intelligence; Insurance; Value chain; Insurability; Technology; Digitalisation	BIG DATA; BUSINESS; AGE	Based on a data set of 91 papers and 22 industry studies, we analyse the impact of artificial intelligence on the insurance sector using Porter's (1985) value chain and Berliner's (1982) insurability criteria. Additionally, we present future research directions, from both the academic and practitioner points of view. The results illustrate that both cost efficiencies and new revenue streams can be realised, as the insurance business model will shift from loss compensation to loss prediction and prevention. Moreover, we identify two possible developments with respect to the insurability of risks. The first is that the application of artificial intelligence by insurance companies might allow for a more accurate prediction of loss probabilities, thus reducing one of the industry's most inherent problems, namely asymmetric information. The second development is that artificial intelligence might change the risk landscape significantly by transforming some risks from low-severity/high-frequency to high-severity/low-frequency. This requires insurance companies to rethink traditional insurance coverage and design adequate insurance products.

J	Calleja, M; Gonzalez, H				Calleja, Margarita; Gonzalez, Humberto			Agrifood field analysis and sociocultural brokerage. Mexico and the United States: 1950-2016	JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE			English	Article						agrifood field; agrifood system; food regime; global value chain; sociocultural brokerage		In this work, we propose the heuristic and explicative possibilities of agrifood fields analysis (AFFA) for the historical study of capitalism in agriculture and food. This approach considers the agroclimatic conditions of the territories and the sociocultural plurality of the actors who inhabit them. This phenomenological and eco-territorial approach allows to study, on many scales, the networks of social relations in which actors take part who are competing for the benefits that are created by human labor applied to producing certain foods and making them accessible to consumers. To show the value of the AFFA, we present a historical study of the agrifood field that was developed from the production of fresh fruits and vegetables in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas and several regions of Mexico for the market in the United States and Canada. The concept of sociocultural brokerage allowed us to take into account the social and cultural plurality in the AFFA and the role played by the creativity and skills of the actors in managing the resources of knowledge, society, technology, and capital at their disposal. This way we were able to explain the dynamics of power and the changes in agrifood governance in the field.

J	Moreno-Brieva, F; Merino-Moreno, C				Moreno-Brieva, Fernando; Merino-Moreno, Carlos			Technology generation of lithium batteries in leading countries	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Technology generation; Lithium batteries; Knowledge generation; Lithium; Global value chain; Geostrategy	INNOVATION CAPABILITIES; FUTURE; AVAILABILITY; CONNECTIVITY; BOTTLENECKS; SYSTEM; TRADE; CHAIN	Rechargeable lithium batteries are a key component of the global value chain of this chemical element. They have revolutionized different industries in the world (such as the automotive industry), with the intention of reducing the greenhouse effect and combating climate change. The aim of this research is to know the positioning of leading countries in the technology generation of lithium rechargeable batteries and the existing geo-strategic support between them. To achieve this purpose, we created and applied a new linear index to determine the technology regimes and the application of other known indexes (related to attractiveness, specialization and benchmarking) linked to technology generation in lithium batteries from 1993 to 2015. The main results show that China is oriented to technological regimes and that the USA, Germany, South Korea, and Japan are focused on scientific regimes, and the consequences of these regimes are a direct technological competition between China and South Korea (this last country supported by Germany and Japan).

J	Nitturkar, H				Nitturkar, Hemant			A practical tool to enhance the chances of success of digital agriculture interventions for sustainable development in Africa and India	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT			English	Article						Agribusiness; Covid-19 pandemic; digital agriculture; inclusive development; project evaluation tool; project monitoring; sustainable value-chain development; youth		Effective and sustainable tools, mechanisms and strategies are needed to significantly improve the prevailing agricultural productivity, farmer remuneration, and food availability globally to be able to meet the food, livelihood, and nutritional needs of the projected population in coming decades. Digital agriculture has the potential to efficiently bring together the benefits of the advances in agricultural research and the developments in information and communication technology space to help positively transform the entire spectrum of pre-farm to post-fork activities in the agriculture sector. Through interactions with over 338 stakeholders across India and Africa, supplemented with study of various digital agricultural interventions across the globe, the author observed that most digital agricultural interventions did not succeed, causing great loss of time and resources, which the world can ill afford. The world is falling behind on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Drawing lessons from the failures and successes of the past digital agricultural interventions, the author has developed an innovative MS Excel tool called HeDAPSEE, to help estimate the success of a digital agricultural intervention before implementing it. This can help strengthen it in planning stages and enhance its chances of success.

J	Schotter, A				Schotter, Andreas			Resilient or not: boundary-spanning in innovation focused MNEs during global crises	CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS			English	Article						Resilience; Multinational; Boundary spanning; Microfoundations; Global crisis; Lateral collaboration	INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; TASK INTERDEPENDENCE; CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE; TRUST; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; LEADERSHIP; MNCS; ORGANIZATIONS; OPPORTUNITIES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical perspective on whether the boundary-spanner model and consequently complex disaggregated intra-MNE value chain activities are crisis resilient. Design/methodology/approach The paper is a conceptual theory development based on literature integration and phenomenological juxtaposing. Findings The need for boundary-spanning in assisting dispersed new and complex knowledge creation activities - which can hardly be replicated in virtual collaboration spaces alone - will endure if not even grow. This requires deeper understanding of boundary spanning in the context of the globally dispersed MNE. Increased location diversification engendered by COVID-19 implies a greater need for the boundary spanning function, not less. Research limitations/implications Regarding future research, the crisis provides a unique opportunity for taking a closer look at the formation, nurturing and resilience of interdependence, particularly behavioural interdependence and the actions and characteristics of individuals associated with [boundary spanning] actions. Specific research questions should focus on the boundary-spanning model in the virtual space; the characteristics and effects of temporality and the boundary-spanning model, the specific actions of boundary spanners during unforeseen events and the empirical testing of the relationships developed in Table 1. Practical implications For practitioners, I suggest avoiding compromising structural interdependence with defaulting on top-down hierarchical approaches during crises; and while doing so, not paying attention to the effects of such actions on behavioural interdependence and its champions (i.e. global boundary spanners). Such interference likely results in sub-optimal global collaboration outcomes and innovation, characterized by fundamentally recursive processes involving creativity, failure, reconfiguring, sensemaking and improvisation. Social implications TBC Originality/value The author develops a critical perspective to assess the crisis-resilience of the boundary-spanning model. In so doing, I juxtapose two contemporary views on the persistence or fading of the global MNE model, and hence, the future need for a socio-behavioural managerial function - like boundary-spanning - connecting dispersed MNE activities. The authors provide numerous avenues for advancing extant research on boundary-spanning in MNEs.

J	van Huellen, S; Abubakar, FM				van Huellen, Sophie; Abubakar, Fuad Mohammed			Potential for Upgrading in Financialised Agri-food Chains: The Case of Ghanaian Cocoa	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Agri-food; Cocoa; Financialisation; Ghana; Global value chains; Upgrading		We revisit functional upgrading opportunities for developing and emerging market companies in the context of highly financialised food systems. We argue that the assessment of upgrading potential within the global value chain literature lacks consideration of constraints posed by financialisation, not only of the sector within which upgrading takes place but also by the global financial architecture more broadly. For the Ghanaian cocoa-chocolate sector, we show that financialisation acts as limiting factor to upgrading, with contradicting tendencies. First, financialisation of lead firms, eager to outsource non-core activities, has promoted cocoa processing in Ghana, but the resulting consolidation of power hinders further functional upgrading. Second, Ghana's dependency on cocoa for foreign exchange earnings necessitates upgrading into higher value-added segments, while also undermining feasible upgrading strategies that build on domestic or regional markets first. These contradicting tendencies constitute a middle value-added trap, which is difficult but not impossible to overcome.

Maize and three small grain cereals (sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet) produced by smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe during 2016 and 2017 were examined for fungal community structure, and total aflatoxin (AF) and fumonisin (FM) content. A total of 800 maize and 180 small grain samples were collected at harvest and during storage from four agroecological zones. Fusarium spp. dominated the fungi associated with maize. Across crops, Aspergillus flavus constituted the main Aspergillus spp. Small grain cereals were less susceptible to both AF and FM. AF (52%) and FM (89%) prevalence was higher in maize than in small grains (13-25% for AF and 0-32% for FM). Less than 2% of small grain samples exceeded the EU regulatory limit for AF (4 mu g/kg), while <10% exceeded the EU regulatory limit for FM (1000 mu g/kg). For maize, 28% and 54% of samples exceeded AF and FM Codex guidance limits, respectively. Higher AF contamination occurred in the drier and hotter areas while more FM occurred in the wetter year. AF exposure risk assessment revealed that small grain consumption posed low health risks (<= 0.02 liver cancer cases/100,000 persons/year) while maize consumption potentially caused higher liver cancer rates of up to 9.2 cases/100,000 persons/year depending on the locality. Additionally, FM hazard quotients from maize consumption among children and adults were high in both years, but more so in a wet year than a dry year. Adoption of AF and FM management practices throughout the maize value chain coupled with policies supporting dietary diversification are needed to protect maize consumers in Zimbabwe from AF- and FM-associated health effects. The higher risk of health burden from diseases associated with elevated concentration of mycotoxins in preferred maize during climate change events can be relieved by increased consumption of small grains.

J	Brobbey, LK; Hansen, CP; Kyereh, B				Brobbey, Lawrence Kwabena; Hansen, Christian Pilegaard; Kyereh, Boateng			The dynamics of property and other mechanisms of access: The case of charcoal production and trade in Ghana	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Authority; Contestations over property; Formalization; Institutions; Natural resources governance	NATURAL-RESOURCES; RIGHTS REGIMES; LIVELIHOODS; MANAGEMENT; LAND; DIVERSIFICATION; ENTITLEMENTS; INSTITUTIONS; COMMUNITY; QUESTION	An analysis of the dynamics of access to resources is important for a fuller understanding of rural livelihoods especially with changing times and technology. This paper uses benefits from charcoal production and trade in the forest savanna transition zone of Ghana as a case to explore the dynamics of access in time and space and the mechanisms various social actors apply in order to benefit. The study applies an analytical framework combining the revised property rights framework with "A Theory of Access". Participatory rural appraisal methods, stakeholder meetings, document reviews and interviews were conducted with social actors along the charcoal commodity chain in Ghana. The paper shows that the ability to benefit from charcoal is more dependent on property than other mechanisms of access, and both customary and statutory institutions are involved in mediating access to charcoal in the area. The realization of economic benefits of charcoal led to a contestation between chiefs and family heads over rights to trees on family lands in some communities and changes in the mode of payment for trees used in producing charcoal. Scarcity and concern over sustainability of trees have also driven the dynamics of the access mechanisms. Chiefs have strengthened their authority in charcoal-producing communities and the low presence of statutory institutions with de jure mandate to regulate the charcoal sector in those communities has implication on plans by the state to formalize and regularize charcoal production and trade in the country. We envisage four adverse effects from the government's attempt to formalize the charcoal sector - elite capture, exclusion of vulnerable and marginalized people, criminalization of livelihoods and loss of rights. We recommend that the planned formalization should be devoid of directives that would make charcoal production and trade prohibitive for low-income households.

The problem that arises in the current state is that customer feedback data only reaches the service provider, while it is necessary to reach the partners and suppliers of the service provider. An example is an online ticket company, such as Traveloka.com or Tiket.com; customer data only reaches the online ticket company, not necessarily the suppliers and partners. This qualitative research was conducted by mapping the value chain of the digital services industry with TOGAF. The aim of this study is to gain an overview of the design of an enterprise architecture model for fulfilling customer feedback information electronically and automatically providing it to service companies, partners and suppliers. By leveraging the existing value chain in the digital services industry by taking on the responsibilities of the service provider and then doing the value chain mapping with TOGAF result in the design of a model in four phases which are the phases of the TOGAF, namely architecture vision, business architecture, information systems architecture and technology architecture. This is the design of an electronic customer feedback governance model provided by the company to meet the customer's information needs to reach partners and service providers. In this study, only the first four phases of TOGAF were reached because the first four phases were architecture in this study.

The transition to organic farming of rice farms could represent a solution for environmental protection, as well as for their economic sustainability, consumer safety, and as a measure of climate mitigation. However, there are currently several weaknesses in the control and certification system. The objective of the current study was to propose advice for improving the control and certification scheme in the organic rice sector. The goal was achieved by adopting a qualitative methodology based on participant observation at stakeholder meetings and community-led workshops, and information collected in focus groups and deep interviews with relevant local actors. The findings show that there are some solutions to mitigate the weakness of the Italian certification scheme. The study also contributes to improving the Italian organic rice sector by highlighting that a revision of procedures and sanctions alone is not enough, and that an ethical and cultural change is also needed along the whole value chain.

J	Habiyaremye, A				Habiyaremye, Alexis			Co-Operative Learning and Resilience to COVID-19 in a Small-Sized South African Enterprise	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						co-operative learning; sustainable innovation; crisis resilience; knowledge management strategies		Constraints imposed by the shrinking resources and the climate change dynamics necessitate a behavioral change to increase knowledge exchange and optimize resource utilization. Existing entrepreneurship and innovation practices are therefore undergoing transformation to adapt production systems to the post-COVID-19 reality of increased risks of calamities within a context of shrinking resources. This paper uses a knowledge-centered crisis management framework to examine how enhanced knowledge sharing through co-operative learning can be applied to induce higher innovation performance and more efficient resource utilization structures during crises comparable to the current pandemic. Using the collaborative learning experiences of a small enterprise producing ecological fertilizers, this study was able to link crisis resilience enhancement to increased knowledge exchange between business entities connected through the agro-ecological value chain. New insights generated through the co-learning process were found to constitute a key input for strengthening the required capability endowments that enable the organization and its partners to weather the COVID-19 crisis and lay the foundation for the sustainability of post-COVID-19 operations.

J	LaRoche-Boisvert, M; Dimitrakopoulos, R				LaRoche-Boisvert, Melanie; Dimitrakopoulos, Roussos			An Application of Simultaneous Stochastic Optimization at a Large Open-Pit Gold Mining Complex under Supply Uncertainty	MINERALS			English	Article						industrial mining complex; simultaneous stochastic optimization; production scheduling; strategic planning; gold mining		The simultaneous stochastic optimization of mining complexes optimizes various components of the related mineral value chain jointly while considering material supply (geological) uncertainty. As a result, the optimization process capitalizes on the synergies between the components of the system while not only quantifying and considering geological uncertainty, but also producing strategic mine plans, maximizing the net present value. This paper presents an application of simultaneous stochastic optimization at a large gold mining complex. The complex contains three open-pit mines, three stockpiles, a waste dump, and a processing facility. Material hardness management is integrated at the processing facility. The case study generated production schedules for each mineral deposit considered, as well as an overall assessment of the project and related forecasts. It resulted in an 18 year life-of-asset and identified the semi-autogenous grinder (SAG) mill as the bottleneck of the operation.

Bamboo is an important income source for rural villagers around the world, especially in tropical developing countries, such as Lao PDR (Lao People's Democratic Republic). This study applied a value chain approach to compare potential incomes from different bamboo utilization models: (1) existing model of selling semi-processed raw materials (bamboo splits), and (2) new model of producing handcraft products locally. Using a rural village in eastern Lao PDR (Nongboua village in Vientiane Capital province) as a case study, we provided empirical assessments of two bamboo value chains. Based on interviews with the villagers and stakeholders and government statistical data from 2017 to 2019, existing and new bamboo production chains were evaluated. In the existing value chain, the final products, bamboo chopsticks, are worth $6.74/kg. The value chain starts with bamboo harvesting, collection, and management, which are done by villagers in Lao PDR and taxed by the Lao PDR government. Bamboo splits are then transported to Vietnam to make the final products to sell. Local villagers received only 4.9% of the total value. The new bamboo handicraft model could produce 9 bamboo cups and 60 medals from one bamboo stem worth $52.6-61.7 and $343.8. In this value chain, bamboo harvesting, management, and processing to final products are done by villagers. The handcrafts were collected by traders to be sold at souvenir shops. Local villagers could capture 29.4%-42.3% of the total values. Producing bamboo cup and medal could generate 1.12-2.17 and 234.8-244.6 times higher income for villagers per labor hour and per bamboo stem, respectively, and allow them to use more bamboo resource than producing bamboo splits to export to Vietnam. If applied to other rural areas in Lao PDR, the new bamboo product model for handicrafts can be a better income source for local villagers in Lao PDR with sustainable use of bamboo resources than the existing model. However, it requires extensive bamboo handicrafts training over a year. Although alternative uses of bamboo would be different depending on social, economic, and market contexts, the value chain analysis demonstrated in this study can be applied elsewhere to increase local retention of economic values generated from agroforestry.

The B. cereus population did not grow and remained mainly unaltered during storage of milk at 4 degrees C while storage at a suboptimal temperature at 8 degrees C (representative of a broken cold chain) caused a major shift in its composition. Mesophilic strains dominated the B. cereus population in raw milk and after storage at 4 degrees C, while psycrotrophic strains dominated after storage at 8 degrees C. All psycrotrophic and mesophilic isolates (n = 368) demonstrated high spoilage potentials of the milk components. Fifteen out of 20 mesophilic isolates but only two out of 40 psychrotrophic isolates, exhibited vero cell toxicity. No genes encoding the emetic toxin cereulide were detected in the genomes of 100 milk isolates while 14 of them harbored the enterotoxin genes cytK1/cytK2. Both psycrotrophic and mesophilic isolates carried the enterotoxin genes nheA and hblA. Together, the results provide insight into the composition and properties, of the B. cereus population present in milk along the value chain and during storage at optimal refrigerated temperature and at suboptimal temperature. This knowledge is useful in the dairy industry's work to assure high quality products and for risk assessment.

Therefore, conservation strategies of livestock genetic resources should be designed to assure profitability to the farmers. The development of "mono-breed" brand products is one of the most effective actions towards this aim. These products are usually sold at a higher price compared to undifferentiated ones, as the consumers consider positively the link between these breeds and the perceived quality of their products. The premium price, however, also attracts fraudsters that unscrupulously see an economic advantage by selling mis-labelled products to obtain an unjustified additional economic gain. These frauds undermine the whole strategy designed to support a sustainable conservation of autochthonous genetic resources. Mora Romagnola is a local pig breed raised in the north of Italy. Mono-breed pork products derived from this breed are part of an important niche value chain that is intrinsically linked to the conservation of this local genetic resource. In this study we present how the Mora Romagnola Herd Book standard integrated information of DNA markers of two genes (MC1R and NR6A1), affecting morphological traits, to allow the authentication of mono-breed products of this breed. This is one of the first examples of sustainable conservation of a pig genetic resource designed starting from the genotype of the animals registered to the breed herd book, with the specific purpose to combat frauds. Mora Romagnola is an autochthonous pig breed, raised in the north of Italy. Mono-breed pork products of this breed are part of important niche value chain that is intrinsically linked to the conservation of this local genetic resources that can only survive due to the premium price that these products can obtain on the market. However, the added value attracts fraudsters that unscrupulously sell mis-labelled Mora Romagnola products, causing consumer distrust that, in turn, undermines the conservation strategy of this breed. To monitor and better characterise this local breed, we phenotyped 826 Mora Romagnola pigs for three breed-specific traits. Then, we genotyped almost all living sows and boars registered to the Herd Book (n. = 357 animals) for polymorphisms in the MC1R and NR6A1 genes (affecting coat colour and vertebral number, respectively). The results were used to re-define the breed descriptors of the Mora Romagnala breed that included information on the allowed genotypes at these two genes. A few pigs that did not carry the allowed genotypes were excluded from its Herd Book. Finally, we evaluated the usefulness of these DNA markers to authenticate Mora Romagnola meat against meat derived from other 11 pig breeds and wild boars. To our knowledge, the Mora Romagnola Herd Book is one of the first examples that established a direct link between a genetic standard of a breed with the possibility to authenticate mono-breed products using DNA markers with the specific purpose to combat frauds and, indirectly, support the conservation of a livestock genetic resource.

The nuts are a lucrative commodity and are used for household consumption, income generation among farming families and as a foreign exchange earning crop at country-level. Macadamia production in Malawi has increased significantly in recent years. Malawi is the seventh top producer of macadamia nuts valued at 23.5 pound million, with a global market share of 3%. In 2018, the country was the fourth-largest exporter of macadamia nuts that were valued at 18.2 pound million. The majority (90%) of this crop was grown by large commercial estates with smallholder's production only contributing about 10% of the total crop production. However, the smallholder sector is vital for the future growth of the macadamia sector in the country. Further, Malawian smallholders consider macadamia production as a low-input crop with large returns per unit area (10.7 pound kg(-1) ha(-1)), and it thus a lucrative commodity with high potential for poverty reduction and wealth creation among these farming families. This paper, therefore, explores: (i) the historical and current trends in macadamia nut production in Malawi; (ii) analyses the country's macadamia value chain focusing on smallholder farmer contributions; and (iii) discusses the constraints of smallholder macadamia production in Malawi for informed policymaking. We conclude that the synthesis of the Malawian macadamia sub-sector provides an understanding of the vital contributions of macadamia to Malawi's economic growth and improvement of livelihoods.

J	Islam, AMS				Islam, Abu Hayat Md. Saiful			Dynamics and Determinants of Participation in Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture Value Chain: Evidence from a Panel Data Analysis of Indigenous Smallholders in Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES			English	Article								This study examines the dynamics of integrated aquaculture-agriculture (IAA) value chain participation and assess the determinants of participation (non-participators, continuing participators, and leavers) using three wave panel data obtained from small-scale indigenous farm households in Northern and North-eastern region of Bangladesh. We employ panel estimation strategies to control for omitted variables and endogenous regressors. The results confirm some previous findings that educated, larger family size with better access to extension, market information and community-based organisation (CBO) are more likely to participate and continue in IAA value chain activities. Importantly, farm size and farm income does not matters for IAA value chain continuous participation, suggesting that IAA value chain activities are appropriate for resource-poor households who are only able to afford low-input technology.

Innovating carbon-capture biotechnologies through ecosystem-inspired solutions	ONE EARTH			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; BIOFILM ACCUMULATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MASS-TRANSFER; POROUS-MEDIA; CO2 CAPTURE; SOIL; ROOT; SEQUESTRATION	Rising atmospheric carbon concentrations affect global health, the economy, and overall quality of life. We are fast approaching climate tipping points that must be addressed, not only by reducing emissions but also through new innovation and action toward carbon capture for sequestration and utilization (CCSU). In this perspective, we delineate next-generation biotechnologies for CCSU supported by engineering design principles derived from ecological processes inspired by three major biomes (plant-soil, deep biosphere, and marine). These are to interface with existing industrial infrastructure and, in some cases, tap into the carbon sink potential of nature. To develop ecosystem-inspired biotechnology, it is important to identify accessible control points of CO2 and CH4 within a given system as well as value-chain opportunities that drive innovation. In essence, we must supplement natural biogeochemical carbon sinks with new bioengineering solutions.

J	Tedaldi, G; Giovanni, M				Tedaldi, Gianluca; Giovanni, Miragliotta			The role of Engineering-to-Order machinery manufacturers in future Cloud Manufacturing supply chains: a business case and a strategic perspective	PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL			English	Article; Early Access						ETO Machinery manufacturer; Cloud Manufacturing; Manufacturing-as-a-Service; value chain strategy		The visionary paradigm of Cloud Manufacturing (CM) struggles to take off in the real manufacturing world. This paper develops a single-case study on one fully-operative platform we found in Europe (metal processing business) which can be regarded as representative - and maybe 'revelatory' - for the future CM paradigm. The case, with an explanatory purpose, studies the platform success from a resources perspective. The findings show how an Engineer-to-Order (ETO) company, namely the manufacturer of the machineries virtualised, provided a key contribute to build such a system, thanks to its own peculiar resources and competences. Resorting to theoretical available knowledge, the paper suggests that ETO machine manufacturers should consider CM as a strategic option for their competitiveness but - at the same time - they should recognise that their internal resources and competences are not enough to build completely a CM platform on their own.

J	Frohm, E; Gunnella, V				Frohm, Erik; Gunnella, Vanessa			Spillovers in global production networks	REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS			English	Article								This paper studies the role of global input-output linkages in transmitting economic disturbances in the international economy. Our empirical results find that these links are both statistically significant and of economic importance for generating spillovers. We also provide evidence that it is not the inter-linkages per se that matter for the international transmission but rather the presence of global hub sectors that are either large suppliers or purchasers of other sectors' inputs. When the links between these sectors and the rest of the global value chain are severed, the spillovers diminish strongly and eventually become statistically insignificant. This highlights the importance of the structure of the production network for enabling spillovers and outlines the prominent role played by hub sectors in the global economy.

J	Soares, B; Ribeiro, I; Cardeal, G; Leite, M; Carvalho, H				Soares, Bruno; Ribeiro, Ines; Cardeal, Goncalo; Leite, Marco; Carvalho, Helena			Social life cycle performance of additive manufacturing in the healthcare industry: the orthosis and prosthesis cases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article								One of the most promising areas for additive manufacturing (AM) adoption is in the healthcare industry, through its ability to produce customized medical devices with personalized fit, feel and functionality. The shift from conventional manufacturing systems to AM implies several changes throughout the medical product's life cycle phases, from workforce qualification to the relationship with customers. This study investigates the social impact of adopting AM in the medical devices industry. To this end, two case studies related to medical devices were developed: a prosthesis and an orthosis, by applying a social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) methodology. The methodology measures and compares performance and impact of developing, producing, and using the two devices produced by AM, and by conventional processes. The results show how the different stakeholders along the product life cycle stages are affected by the change in the manufacturing technology. Evidence of positive social impacts were found in the 'Customers', 'Local community' and 'Society' stakeholders. A negative social impact was found for the stakeholder 'Value chain actors'. Furthermore, this study illustrates the suitability of the S-LCA methodology to pinpoint the benefits and negative impacts of AM in each case under study.

J	Fernandez-Polanco, J; Llorente, I; Asche, F				Fernandez-Polanco, Jose; Llorente, Ignacio; Asche, Frank			Gilthead seabream price dynamics in the Spanish market: The role of retailers and international trade on price linkages	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Price integration; Price transmission; Market integration; Value chain; Seafood market; Seabream	SEA BREAM; INTEGRATION; AQUACULTURE; WILD; TRANSMISSION; SALMON; TILAPIA; BASS	This paper extends the literature on price-integration in the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) market in Spain by shedding new light on established relationships using additional data allowing investigation of the importance of origin. Although the conclusions for the overall market are in the line of those previously reported for market integration and price transmission in the domestic value chain, there are significant differences in the relationships across the price series when the market is disaggregated by countries of origin. While the overall model, with minor differences, confirms Turkey's price leadership and the influence of domestic wholesalers on the changes in the price along the value chain, alternative models with more specific focus on the country of origin show how organization along the value chain and differentiation of domestic product provide different distribution channels and different mechanisms of price transmission. Domestic and international producers establish alliances with downstream agents both at national and international level depending on to the market targeted. Differentiation is exerted by domestic producers based on the origin of the product.

J	Potnis, D; Mallary, K				Potnis, Devendra; Mallary, Kevin			Proposing an information value chain to improve information services to disabled library patrons using assistive technologies	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Academic libraries; assistive technologies; disabled patrons; information value chain; information services; service innovation		Information services offered by academic libraries increasingly rely on assistive technologies (AT) to facilitate disabled patrons' retrieval and use of information for learning and teaching. However, disabled patrons' access to AT might not always lead to their use, resulting in the underutilization of information services offered by academic libraries. We adopt an inward-looking, service innovation perspective to improve information services for disabled patrons using AT. The open coding of qualitative responses collected from administrators and librarians in 186 academic libraries in public universities in the United States, reveals 10 mechanisms (i.e. modified work practices), which involve searching, compiling, mixing, framing, sharing, or reusing information, and learning from it. Based on this information-centric reorganisation of work practices, we propose an 'information value chain', like Porter's value chain, for improving information services to disabled patrons using AT in academic libraries, which is the major theoretical contribution of our study.

J	Pande, B; Adil, GK				Pande, Bhavya; Adil, Gajendra Kumar			Assessment of the current state of sustainability in a manufacturing firm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Sustainable manufacturing practices; Extent of implementation; Sustainability assessment; Drivers and barriers; Sustainable value chain		Purpose-Sustainable manufacturing is gaining prominence in light of the rising environmental and social concerns worldwide. One major task to enhance manufacturing sustainability is assessment of the current state of sustainability of a manufacturing firm. This paper reviews the existing sustainability assessment approaches applicable for manufacturing firms and observes that most of these approaches are not easy to apply for reasons such as high amount of skill, data and time requirement. Towards bridging this gap, this study proposes a sustainability assessment approach. Design/methodology/approach-The assessment approach proposed in the paper uses a predefined list of potential sustainable manufacturing practices (SMPs) covering the primary and support activity domains of a manufacturing firm's value chain. It proposes a method to assess the extent of implementation of SMPs and identify associated drivers and barriers for each SMP area/category along the value chain of a firm as well as at overall firm level. A case study from textile industry is presented to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Findings-The sustainability assessment approach adopted in this study uses less time and skills as well as ensures comprehensive coverage of SMPs. It provided valuable information to the management of the case company on how sustainable their practices are and why?

J	Bernard-Mongin, C; Hoxha, V; Lerin, F				Bernard-Mongin, Claire; Hoxha, Valter; Lerin, Francois			From total state to anarchic market: management of medicinal and aromatic plants in Albania	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs); Common pool resources (CPR); Value chain analysis; Natural resource management; Albania	NATURAL-RESOURCES; VALUE CHAIN; SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; LESSONS	Medicinal and aromatic plants' management raises increasingly important issues of sustainable use of natural resources, biodiversity conservation, economic growth, social inclusiveness and rural development. This paper examines the genesis and development of the medicinal and aromatic plant (MAP) sector in Albania since 1945. This sector is of national importance and steered by a growing international market. The sustainable management of MAPs is a central issue in both practical and analytical terms. We develop a longitudinal analysis combining the use of documents and archives, statistical and operational data and field studies with an analytical focus rooted in institutional analysis development (IAD) and global value-chain analysis (GVC). We describe the changing system of rules alongside two historical dystopias: total communist state control versus an unregulated (anarchical) market. The paper explains the complexity of the non-sustainable and non-optimum management of MAPs in Albania and identifies major limiting factors in both dystopias. Attempts to establish territory-based resource management and a relevant management community are thwarted by lock-in along the value chain under export-driven monopolist/monopsony control, conflicting institutional interplays over access to the resource and inadequate knowledge on sustainable MAP use. Overcoming these shortcomings requires tackling the diversity of local situations and plant ecology. The paper highlights the need for a renewed form of community engagement in natural resource governance within global value chains.

J	Akrong, R; Mbogoh, SG; Irungu, P				Akrong, Rexford; Mbogoh, Stephen G.; Irungu, Patrick			Youth agripreneurship in the horticultural value-chain: The case of small-scale mango farmers in Southern Ghana	AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT			English	Article							MARKET PARTICIPATION; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; AGRICULTURE; ACCESS; AGRIBUSINESS; CHALLENGES; PROGRAM	Development partners are promoting youth entrepreneurship in agriculture (agripreneurship) in sub-Saharan Africa. While youth engagement in food crop production and marketing has received a lot of attention on both policy and academic fronts, the low level of involvement of youth in the horticultural value-chain has received little attention. To this end, this study assessed the factors that influence participation of youth in the horticultural value-chain. Using the multistage sampling technique, data were collected from 224 mango-producing households in southern Ghana. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the binary logit model. The study found that there exist differences between the youth and older farmers in terms of socioeconomic factors including education, household size, and income, and institutional support services including certification, credit, extension services and group membership. The results of the econometric model revealed that age, education, and access to credit and extension services motivate youth participation in agriculture. Access to credit and ownership of motorized transport encouraged participation of older farmers in high value markets. The study recommends that development partners provide credit facilities and capacity development through agricultural training and extension services to enhance youth participation in high value markets.

The paper adopts a practice-based approach to examine the impact of Covid-19 on gold and gemstone artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) practices in sub-Saharan Africa. It highlights the informality of ASM and discusses how the Ghana and Kenya governments' measures have significantly increased the vulnerabilities of the miners and mining communities. Based on a document analysis of the governments' responses to Covid-19, mining industry reports, and interviews with 29 mining stakeholders in Ghana and Kenya, the paper identifies the economic and social impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on gold and gemstone ASM in both countries. We highlight the key policy challenges and suggest actions that can help mitigate the negative impacts the pandemic has had on ASM, which include the need to address informality in the ASM sub-sector.

Low dietary diversification and imbalance consumption of food groups are the main characteristics of Iranian households. Food production diversity can be a significant determinant of dietary diversity in developing countries such as Iran. Thus, this research tries to examine the impact of food production diversity alongside the socioeconomic and sociodemographic determinants on dietary diversity in rural and urban areas of the country. For this aim, a panel data set is constructed based on all the available data in rural and urban areas of 31 provinces of Iran from 2011 to 2016 and panel quantile regression applied to investigate the impact of the control variables. The main results indicate that food production diversity, household income, the share of food in household expenditure, literacy rate have a positive and significant impact on the dietary diversity in rural and urban regions of the country. Moreover, the food price index has a negative and significant effect on dietary diversity in both regions. Finally, the age of head of household and family size only has a negative impact on diet diversification in rural areas. According to these results, encouraging small farmers to change their production patterns to a more diverse pattern in a short time, and pursuing multidimensional approaches such as the promotion of agricultural value chain should be considered by policymakers to improve the dietary diversity in rural and urban areas. Furthermore, the establishment of rural retirement found and redistribution of current income subsidy can help the elderly and extended family in rural areas to enhance their diet quality. Finally, design a price monitoring approach alongside a flexible trade strategy to manage the food market prices can help households to consume the appropriate diet with enough micronutrients.

This indicates the potential of developing agro-food regional production networks aligning with the region's comparative advantage in agro-food products. However, intermediates trade, as an indicator of value chain integration, has been low and sluggish due to various structural and policy factors. This article aims to analyze the determinants of trade in agro-food intermediates in the Arab region, focusing on the role and significance of regional trade arrangements and trade facilitation. The Broad Economic Category (BEC) classification is used to categorize goods into intermediate and final goods. Our analysis, using the gravity model, shows that regional trade arrangements in their current form do not significantly affect regional trade (except in the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC]). We also reveal that timeliness in export delivery is an important determinant of trade in agro-food intermediates. Thus, Arab countries should simplify their customs clearance procedures and engage in a deeper form of regional integration to help build trade corridors and enhance regional value-added chains (RVCs).

KM is frequently materialized as a risk management (RM) plan. An RM plan allows for anticipating, avoiding, mitigating, or reducing potential problems impacting project performance. However, despite their high complementarity, KM and RM are not the same, nor share the same purpose. In the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, managing complex projects involves many KM-related challenges, such as differential competitiveness enhancement and value chain streamlining. Naval platforms are complex projects that require the integration of multiple sources of knowledge and information. They also need to keep on integrating latest digital technology innovations in their production processes. In this context, streamlining the requirements management may become a differential asset for project stakeholders of naval platforms. Namely, enhancing requirements management can make the customers' needs easier to meet, shorten the projects duration, reduce costs, optimize resources, and allow for higher flexibility. However, requirements management has KM as pre-requisite and RM as consequence. Unfortunately, potential synergies between KM and RM have remained largely unexplored in the project management literature, and so has requirements management as a potential bridge between both concepts. In this paper, a holistic model for shipbuilding organizations linking KM and RM is proposed. The model draws from existing KM and RM models while considering organizational factors, technological platforms, and competitiveness factors. A case study of a naval platform showing the model's applicability is provided. It is shown how the model can allow shipbuilding companies to sustain a competitive advantage by facilitating more robust decision making in dynamic project environments. Furthermore, the model also facilitates the identification of the companies' core competences to reach and keep a strong position in current global markets.

Basing on evidence from the Brazilian automotive industry, a case of unused opportunities for building a strong IES is considered. This is due to the insensitivity of such ecosystems to new complicated configurations and the formats of non-traditional interaction that they suggest - a "new ecology of competition", etc. The internal context of companies in relation to the practice of open innovation has been studied. Despite joint projects with close value chain partners, carmakers are showing a closed attitude to external collaboration, unlike players in industries such as aerospace or information and communications technology that gained growth and major transformation by building a broader IES. Only a high demand from the government for creating a strong IES can change the situation.

In this study, we applied a choice experiment to investigate supply side consumer preferences, and to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for cooking oil certified under Roundtable for Sustainable Palm oil (RSPO). Sustainability standards for the palm oil industry were introduced to address environmental issues, such as biodiversity conservation, and the harmful reduction in CO2 emission. To achieve this, we examined Malaysian consumer knowledge of the CSPO, and investigated its influence on their choice of palm oil supply value chain model, considering biodiversity conservation, CO2 reduction and the willingness to pay (WTP). The main finding of this study indicated that Malaysian consumers are willing to pay more than a 5% price premium for RSPO certified palm (cooking) oil, while the most prioritized attributes is the mass balanced supply chain model that included both moderate levels of biodiversity conservation and of CO2 emission.

J	Fernqvist, F; Goransson, C				Fernqvist, Fredrik; Goransson, Caroline			Future and recent developments in the retail vegetable category - a value chain and food systems approach	INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						value chain; food systems; trends; vegetables; retail	COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN; LOCAL FOOD; ORGANIC FOOD; CONSUMERS PERCEPTIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; THE-LITERATURE; MEAT; DRIVERS; PREFERENCES; CONSUMPTION	In this study, the value chain perspective was combined with a food systems approach to assess food system responses in the value chain and external drivers from environmental and socioeconomic perspectives. The research object was the Swedish value chain for vegetables, with the aim of providing a comprehensive picture of current trends and drivers and identifying future developments important for vegetable growers, producer organizations, wholesalers and retailers. The empirical data is based on in-depth interviews with key-decision makers in the Swedish value chain, constituting a single case. The point of departure is that key actors in this chain, from producer organizations to retailers, can provide a comprehensive picture on the category's past development and future directions. A combined food systems and value chain approach has been applied. Drivers and chain responses have been identified and categorized into six main categories related to: (1) health; (2) consumer interest for food and variation; (3) convenience; (4) origin; (5) sustainability; and (6) urbanization. Value chain responses and future challenges as well as aspects on value chain dynamics and sustainability issues in the food system arc presented and discussed.

However, nowadays environmental protection trends seek to care for the environment along the entire value chain, consequently, making industries more responsible for managing aspects, such as pollutant emissions, resource consumption, and energy consumption. This paper reports a comparative cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of the two most common types of containers for wine fermentation, i.e. stainless-steel tanks and concrete tanks. The present study estimates the environmental impact from building, installation, and dismantling of tanks to analyse the environmental impact from alcoholic fermentation and malolactic fermentation. Results indicate that building the tank - either out of concrete or stainless steel - has a high impact on the environment, for instance, in terms of global warming impact per liter of wine 6.03E-02 kg CO2 equivalent from steel tank or 1.31E-02 kg CO2 equivalent from concrete tank (ratio is 4.6). In addition, the building stage in a concrete tank has the highest environmental impact due to the concrete consumption and low recycling rate, while in stainless-steel tank, the fermentation stage is the highest environmental impact mainly due to direct CO2 emissions and because it has a high recycling rate.

J	Kais, SM; Islam, MS				Kais, Shaikh Mohammad; Islam, Md Saidul			Resilience to Climate Change in Industrial Shrimping in Bangladesh: Assessing the Comparative Role of the Stakeholders	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate crisis; community capital; NGO interventions; resilience gradient; shrimp policy; Bangladesh	SEA-LEVEL RISE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; COMMODITY CHAIN; ADAPTATION; AQUACULTURE; VULNERABILITY; MEANINGS	Over the last few decades, the global shrimp aquaculture industry has grown considerably and experienced important transformations in coastal regions in the Global South. However, despite being a major contributor to GDP and export earnings of the country, the shrimp industry in Bangladesh is not yet fully developed. This important sector is often plagued by numerous environmental challenges including frequent climate disasters. To address local climate perturbations, the shrimping industry undertakes a wide range of individual, communal, and institutional level resilience activities. Drawing on primary data collected through ethnography and qualitative interviews in three shrimping communities, this paper examines the nature, effects, and efficacy of resilience strategies adopted by various stakeholders in the shrimp industry in coastal Bangladesh. This research demonstrates that there is a clearly visible resilience gradient in the shrimp aquaculture industry in Bangladesh: individual shrimp farmers and households play a pivotal role in resilience enhancement, while other stakeholders including community, state, and civil society organizations have moderate-to-little involvement in aiding resilience in the sector. The study offers a series of recommendations for resilience to climate change.

J	Kapfhammer, W; Winder, GM				Kapfhammer, Wolfgang; Winder, Gordon M.			Slow Food, Shared Values, and Indigenous Empowerment in an Alternative Commodity Chain Linking Brazil and Europe	SOCIOLOGUS			English	Article						Amazonia; Brazil; Commodity Chains; Guarana; Satere-Mawe	NETWORKS; GOVERNANCE; MARKET	This article explores governance and power relations within the guarana (Paullinia cupana) global commodity chain (GCC) of the Satere-Mawe, an Indigenous group of the Lower Amazon, Brazil. The paper draws on ethnographic work and joint field research in Para, Brazil and pursues an interdisciplinary approach combining economic geography and anthropological interest in ontological diversity. It describes the guarana value chain in commodity chain terms, and discusses issues of narrative, transformation, and power in the community of values associated with the chain. Guarana is a ritual beverage of central importance to Indigenous cosmology and is now a commodity traded within the global Fair Trade network. We found that the commodity chain is the result of not only economically, but also politically motivated Indigenous and European actors. It has a simple organization and is based on inter-personal business relations, with neither retailers nor producers controlling the chain. In this context, diverse actors, including Indigenous and non-Indigenous agents, cooperate in a joint project despite their, at times, differing values. These values are discernable in the narratives and discourses braided around the chain. This paper identifies the values at work and the tensions and dissonances produced as they rub against each other. It argues that, far from making the chain unmanageable, the tensions are creative and help the chain's participants to bridge between Brazil and Europe.

Rapid changes in the world triggered by COVID-19 crisis happening now reemphasize the need to better understand how BM can be successfully innovated in different markets. Digital component of BM innovation comes under a special spotlight, while NASDAQ stock index representing aggregated value of technological companies reaches its all-time high in June 2020. In the current paper we review the innovation strategies on the corporate level using the example of a company within the pharmaceutical industry, through the prism of BM innovation. In particular, this study demonstrates how BM innovation can be developed and implemented in practice within the pharmaceutical market, which accelerates its digital transformation to increase the value it brings to the healthcare systems around the world while sustaining the ongoing crisis. In order to do that the current paper offers the framework for BM innovation that defines BM elements, BM innovation aspects and BM innovation logic. This new approach is applied to undertake a deep analysis of opportunities to build innovative BM using the case of a pharmaceutical market. The paper uses a case study method to demonstrate BM innovation insights. The research described in this paper is of a cross-border nature and includes the analysis of a pharmaceutical company's BM on six markets representing different value creation systems and mechanisms (Russia, Ukraine, Thailand, Chile, Mexico, Israel).The paper demonstrates how technological innovations can be activated using managerial tools and insights and also how they can be combined into the holistic system based on the needs of the key value chain actors.

Nearly 10% of GDP and 55% of the country's foreign exchange earnings depend on cotton products. Approximately 1.5 million people in Pakistan are engaged in the cotton value chain. However, several diseases such as Mildew, Leaf Spot, and Soreshine affect cotton production. Manual diagnosis is not a good solution due to several factors such as high cost and unavailability of an expert. Therefore, it is essential to develop an automated technique that can accurately detect and recognize these diseases at their early stages. In this study, a new technique is proposed using deep learning architecture with serially fused features and the best feature selection. The proposed architecture consists of the following steps: (a) a self-collected dataset of cotton diseases is prepared and labeled by an expert; (b) data augmentation is performed on the collected dataset to increase the number of images for better training at the earlier step; (c) a pre-trained deep learning model named ResNet101 is employed and trained through a transfer learning approach; (d) features are computed from the third and fourth last layers and serially combined into one matrix; (e) a genetic algorithm is applied to the combined matrix to select the best points for further recognition. For final recognition, a Cubic SVM approach was utilized and validated on a prepared dataset. On the newly prepared dataset, the highest achieved accuracy was 98.8% using Cubic SVM, which shows the perfection of the proposed framework..

Organizational factors affecting successful physician-system integration: A qualitative study of Washington State health executives	HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						health executives; physician&#8211; system integration; qualitative research		Background Health care delivery is moving toward a value-based environment, which calls for increased integration between physician groups and health systems. Health executives sit at a key nexus point for determining how and when physician-system integration occurs. Purpose The objective of this study was to identify the organizational factors that health executives perceived to have made physician-system integration successful. Methodology/Approach We used a multiple-case study research design. We conducted semistructured, qualitative interviews with 25 health executives in the roles of CEO, chief medical officer, chief financial officer and physician group chief executives from eight of Washington State's largest integrated delivery systems. To guide our analysis, we employed open systems theory and Porter's Value Chain to identify physician group and hospital factors that were integral to successful integration. Results Using the executives' perspectives, the factors grouped into three themes: (1) organizational structure-a mix of integration contracts united by common structural characteristics between physician groups and hospitals); (2) organizational culture-alignment of leadership between physician groups and hospitals; and (3) strategic resources-designated resources to establish and support care coordination activities. Conclusion Our work indicates that health systems should focus on the pathway to integration success through the alignment of structure (not just the integration contract), culture, and resources and not on an end goal of the physician employment model. Practice Implications Health system executives are key drivers for when and how physician groups are integrated into health services organizations. This article provides executives with an evidence-based model to aid in formulating integration approaches that combine elements of organizational structure, organizational culture, and strategic resources.

J	Ogola, RJO; Ouko, KO				Ogola, Robert John O.; Ouko, Kevin Okoth			Synergies and trade-offs of selected climate smart agriculture practices in Irish potato farming, Kenya	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE			English	Article						synergies; trade-offs; climate change; climate smart agriculture; Irish potato; Kenya	SOIL FERTILITY; MANAGEMENT; ADOPTION	Research on and disseminating Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) practices has led to increased awareness and farmers' capacity to develop resilient agricultural production systems for sustainable livelihoods and food security while addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation. Thus, there is a potential in gaining valuable insight into how Irish potato smallholder farmers should respond to current and future climate risks. However, studies exploring and linking expert opinion on synergies and trade-offs in adapting the CSA practices are limited. This study integrated qualitative and quantitative data from 22 expert surveys and semistructured questionnaires to answer the following objectives: 1) Which top five CSA practices are currently used by Irish potato farmers and which ones are preferred by experts in response to climate change adaptation in Kenya? 2) How do the selected CSA practices perform in Irish potato farming in Kenya? 3) Which synergies and trade-offs occur upon implementation of these CSA practices? The study found that CSA practices most preferred by both experts and farmers are improved crop varieties, efficient use of agrochemicals, early land preparation, diversified crop production, efficient use of inorganic fertilizer, irrigation and changing planting dates. These selected CSA practices indicated the productivity pillar to be the best performing CSA pillar synergistically while trade-offs to occur across CSA pillars. These findings can inform different potato value chain stakeholders on the synergies and trade-off dynamics associated with adopting CSA practices for climate change adaptation. In conclusion, while CSA practices are perceived as essential, most preferred CSA practices are focused on increased production and adaptation, while mitigation goals receive less attention. The findings of this study provide an important basis for recommendation to farmers and policymakers. This study calls for sustainable and innovative ways that help to upscale the selected CSA practices in Irish potato farming in Kenya and beyond.

The fish supply chain was modeled from landing to consumption of unprocessed (fresh) and processed (salted and sun-dried, smoked, filleted) fish. Data related to the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in fish, taking into account survey information on handling, storage, processing and consumption of Nile tilapia were collected from recently completed studies in Kenya. Other model inputs were complemented with data from published and unpublished literature. A probabilistic exposure model was developed with Monte Carlo simulation in Excel addin software using @Risk software. The simulated levels of S. aureus in fish after handling and storage of salted and sun-dried and smoked fish ranged between 4 log CFU/g and 9.01 log CFU/g (maximum population density), while in fillet, levels of S. aureus following growth during display at retail shops was between 3.10 log CFU/g (5% percentile) and 9.01 log CFU/g (95% percentile). Estimated SE dose per-serving in fish supplied after processing was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the unregulated (ranged between 0.000150 ng (5% percentile) and 30.0 ng (95% percentile)) than semi-regulated chain. The model revealed that the factors with the highest impact on dose of SE per-serving were the time taken to sell the fish at street markets under ambient conditions and refrigerated fish fillets at retail shops followed by cross-contamination from fish handlers most. The model simulated a zero risk of exposure to SEs from fish supplied via the semi-regulated and unregulated value chain if crosscontamination from handlers was eliminated. Therefore, this highlighted the need for good hygiene practices during the handling and storage of fish along the value chain. A significant reduction in the risk of exposure to SE in processed fish was noted when shelf-life was reduced to a maximum of 72 h. Although the model can be used in risk assessments of fish supplied under the same scenarios, the current study revealed data gaps that need to be addressed to improve the risk assessment.

Maarit I.; Bergland, Olvar; Solberg, Birger			New elasticities and projections of global demand for coniferous sawnwood	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article							FOREST PRODUCTS; MARKET; WORLD; WOOD	Coniferous sawnwood is the most important solid wood product in terms of its production volume and economic significance. It also plays a vital role in the forestry-forest industry value chain. We estimated priceand income elasticities for per capita softwood sawnwood consumption based on FAO data. Varying demand patterns are found across the regions. Only the countries with little supply from their own domestic sources had significant price elasticities of demand, relatively inelastic in the short-term, but more elastic in the long-term. They also tended to have the highest income elasticities. The elasticity estimates obtained for the panels of very low- or very high-income countries were not statistically significant. The potential for demand growth for coniferous sawnwood was assessed under five SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) scenarios. The demand increase varies a lot from 88 to 154 Mm3 from 2015 to 2030 but demonstrates that the market growth can provide solid support for bioeconomy formation in the terms of economic income, carbon storage and substitution possibilities, and supply of by-products to other traditional or emerging products.

This relationship is primarily concerned with continued education, consultancy, collaborative research and development (R&D) and technology transfer from the university to the enterprise. This third mission has been promoted by the university through the establishment of specialized structures such as university enterprise interfaces, incubators and technological information centres for invention patents. Also, several strategies and programs of incentives for innovation have been promoted by the public authorities to create a national system of innovation in Morocco. However, all these efforts failed to unleash and activate the potential of Moroccan universities. In this work, we will propose an effective and efficient institutional Technology Transfer (TT) policy backed up by a complete repository related to the establishing of the University Technology Transfer Office (UTTO). This proposal complements the work done in a previous paper, which assesses the different policies and programs within Moroccan universities, related to TT activities, and proposes a remodelling of the value chain of the process of technology transfer in the universities.

Using attributes derived from positive psychological capital as proxies for entrepreneurship and data collected from 458 smallholders in and around irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal, the study empirically examines factors affecting smallholder engagement in entrepreneurship activities. Findings show that access to extension and information from scheme committees, being a male farmer, having more earned income, membership to a cooperative and access to markets have a positive effect on farmers' entrepreneurial behaviour. Factors inhibiting entrepreneurship in the context of smallholder farming include land tenure insecurity, access to land without the necessary complementary resources, consumption credit and staying far away from irrigation schemes. The study recommends addressing gender bias regarding access to resources and information. Promoting interactive learning through networking will also result in positive entrepreneurial behaviour. There is also a need for the provision of demand-driven extension services, facilitation of market linkages and enhancing access to finance for would-be entrepreneurs. Access to credit should be directly linked to agricultural production through input vouchers and value chain financing. Addressing land tenure issues along with access to other complementary resources, inputs and services will also enhance on-farm entrepreneurship in the smallholder agriculture sector.

J	Yang, L; Zeng, HM; Xu, PZ				Yang, Ling; Zeng, Haomei; Xu, Pengzhi			A comparative study of service trade competitiveness for green innovation development using the WWYZ model - based on China and the 26 countries along 'the Belt and Road'	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						global value chain; GVC; service trade competitiveness; the Belt and Road; China		The service industry is known as the 'green engine' of economic development due to its low pollution and high efficiency. We found that China's service industry is slowly participating more in the upstream production activities of the GVC for green innovation development. The degree of GVC forward participation in China's service industry was significantly affected by the 2008 financial crisis, showing a downward trend. The degree of GVC backward participation continued to decline except for 2009-2011, during which it varied more greatly than of the degree of GVC forward participation. Although China's degree of GVC participation is relatively small compared to the 26 countries along 'the Belt and Road', its GVC position is comparatively high. Therefore, China should strengthen its industrial complementation with the 26 countries along 'the Belt and Road' through capacity cooperation and achieve mutual benefits from green innovation development.

In this paper we present data from a study of shrimp and prawn aquaculture in Bangladesh to argue that this relationship is not as straightforward as it would seem. Analysing quantitative and qualitative data from a multi-method field study involving 300 "missing middle" farmers, we demonstrate the importance of socio-economic and ecological conditions to any disease management strategy. We describe how a technical programme to introduce "disease-free" seed faltered partly as a result of the farmers' tendency to offset disease and livelihood risks by frequently re-stocking their ponds. Changes to seed provision were accompanied by calls to alter farmers' livestock production practices. Paradoxically, these changes exposed farmers to more intense risks, potentially locking them into unsustainable disease management practices. The analysis emphasises that vernacular farming practices should be considered as key assets rather than barriers to disease management strategies, and that closer attention be paid to value chain and other risks as drivers of unsustainable practices.

J	Alemu, D; Guinan, A; Hermanson, J				Alemu, Dawit; Guinan, Alice; Hermanson, Judith			Contract farming, cooperatives and challenges of side selling: malt barley value-chain development in Ethiopia	DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE			English	Article						Environment (built and natural) &#8211; Agriculture; Labour and livelihoods &#8211; Poverty reduction; Sub-Saharan Africa		This paper presents the experience of malt barley value-chain development through cooperative-based contract farming. The descriptive and qualitative analysis used primary data collected from the actors involved and secondary data. The results indicate that side selling is a major challenge, estimated at about 30%. Promoting the role of cooperatives and avoiding side selling by addressing both farmer- and system-level issues requires considering the dynamic nature of the malt barley market, involvement of all relevant stakeholders, capacitating cooperatives rather than providing handout-type support, and promoting market-based disincentives and incentives for the misconduct and conduct of actors.

J	Mehar, MA				Mehar, Muhammad Ayub			Magnitude of investment and global value chain: a case study of textile and clothing industry of Pakistan	JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE			English	Article; Early Access						downstream industries; textile and clothing; general system of preferences; total assets; SMEs; panel data		The objective of this study is to assess the impact of value addition chain and investment size on the sales revenue of export-oriented firms in Pakistan. Pakistan is severely facing the economic crisis because of its declining exports and growing external debt. The manufacturing of the intermediate products - yarn and fabric - belong to the capital-intensive industries. The large part of these products is exported to USA, China, European Union and Bangladesh. The importing partners convert these intermediate products into finished goods (garments, home textile, towel, etc.). Similarly, the finished goods which are produced by Pakistani companies and exported directly by the producers or small-scale brokerage houses do not have Pakistani brand names. The clothing sector companies in European Union and USA sale these products in super stores and retail shops under their brand names. This mechanism explains the distribution of benefits through the global value addition chain in textile and clothing industry. It is hypothesized in this study that sale revenues of textile manufacturing companies ares determined by the size of investment, type of products (stage of the integration), average lending rates, exchange rate in term of rupees per US dollar and the market access. Data for this analysis was extracted from the Annual Reports of the companies listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange. The data consists of 248 companies and 14 years (from 2003 to 2016). Through this panel data we quantified the impacts of the size of investment and the stage of value addition in textile chain on sales revenue. It is concluded that size of a company is a serious matter, while the total assets lead further increase in the sales revenue, however the negative sign with significant and robust parameters attached with the composite variable of the large companies' category and value of its total assets reflects the decreasing rate of return on additional investment in large-scale companies. The devaluation of Pakistani currency has been positively affecting the sales of exporting sector companies. However, the lending rate of interest has not shown a significant impact.

Supply Chains with a Conscience	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						social and environmental responsibility; value chain innovations; supply chain management; shared values; supply chains in developing economies	MANAGEMENT; DELIVERY	As supply chains become more and more globalized, even in times of disruptions and trade frictions, and that consumers are increasingly more demanding on the environmental and social responsibility performances of the supply chains that supply products they are buying, research in supply chain management should also contribute to make an impact under such trends. I call this "supply chains with a conscience," where supply chains need to continuously strive to minimize the harms and negative impacts to the environment and people, while maximize the values and well-beings of society at large, especially for those in emerging and developing economies. I want to share some frameworks of perspectives on this subject, some illustrative developments, and an example of a personal journey.

Hsiao, known as "Huangqi" in Chinese, has been used as a traditional herbal medicine or food in China for more than 2,000 years and is now consumed globally. Unfortunately, the increasing demand for RA has led to the overexploitation of its wild stock, as well as quality problems, including adulteration and contamination. Therefore, the sustainable cultivation of RA is urgently needed. In the present research, semi-structured interviews and key informant interviews were conducted, over a 2-year period, to collect data from stakeholders in the main production areas; moreover, a targeted chemical analysis-based quality assessment strategy was applied to understand the quality of RA. Accordingly, 10 different types of value chains (VCs) were identified in RA production; meanwhile, the contents of the main active ingredients (astragaloside and calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside) were analyzed by HPLC-ELSD-UV and the yield of medicinal material was demined and further analyzed using k-means clustering analysis. The results show that the tight relationship between quality of the RA and stakeholders' revenues among the VCs, which reflects a more general trend in the production system. Over the past few decades, vertical coordination has emerged increasingly in VCs of RA, which leads to a more coherent traceability system and rigorous regulations in the supply chains. Daodi herbs can be considered to be a standard that is distinctive with good quality characteristics that emphasize the origins of the medicinal plants. We find that the suitability of geographical areas and vertical integration can improve the VCs of RA, which further contributes to its quality control, as well as its sustainable production.

Mapping of product flow and core actors involved in value chains are based on primary data pertaining to year 2019. The total sample size was 27 of small and micro dairy processing units in Karnal district of Haryana state. The study concluded that cost of milk procurement was the least in collection centre (Model-I). The integrated production and processing system (Model-II) could attain higher profits (Rs. 9.56/L) compared to Model-I (Rs. 2.65/L) and Vendor system, i.e. Model-III (Rs. 1.78/L). The identified three key interventions, viz. training in milk handling, packing and processing; efficient transportation and processing technology and efficient design of procurement systems need to be applied for leveraging of milk value chain.

J	Theyel, G; Hofmann, KH				Theyel, Gregory; Hofmann, Kay H.			Manufacturing location decisions and organizational agility	MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						Offshoring; Reshoring; Global value chain; Organizational agility; Manufacturing location	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; ENTERPRISE AGILITY; STRATEGIC AGILITY; TRANSACTION COST; PERSPECTIVE; GOVERNANCE; DRIVERS; FLEXIBILITY	Purpose This paper aims to investigate the strategic consequences of manufacturing location decisions, with a focus on understanding the link between collocating manufacturing with other value chain activities, via reshoring or retaining and organizational agility. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses qualitative data from 115 interviews with executives from UK high value manufacturing companies to explore the recent phenomenon of reshoring and the strategic effects of manufacturing location. Findings The location of manufacturing is operationally and strategically important for multinational companies. The spatial dispersion of manufacturing is determined by firm-specific and external factors, both of which are subject to constant change. The analysis shows that concentrating on manufacturing in their home countries enables firms to increase organizational agility and stimulate innovation. Better integration with and more extensive collaboration between related value chain activities, such as research and development, sales and marketing, leads to higher flexibility, speed and responsiveness to customer requirements. However, under certain conditions, firms also continue to benefit from the known advantages of offshoring. Originality/value This research sheds light on possible strategic downsides of global value chains, characterized by dispersed activities and intermitted processes. The results provide evidence that retaining manufacturing or bringing back manufacturing operations to a company's home country can increase organizational flexibility, speed, adaptability, innovativeness and responsiveness to customer requirements. As these capabilities are critical for long-term survival, especially in dynamic environments, firms need to review their global factory configurations and determine whether the short-term advantages of foreign locations continue to justify offshoring practices.

J	Che, Y; Liu, WQ; Zhang, Y; Zhao, L				Che, Yi; Liu, Weiqiang; Zhang, Yan; Zhao, Lin			China's Exports during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic	FRONTIERS OF ECONOMICS IN CHINA			English	Article						China's exports; COVID-19 pandemic; global value chain; processing exports; elasticity of substitution	PERFORMANCE; TRADE	The global COVID-19 pandemic caused various economic contraction in most countries, including all of China's major trading partners. Using a difference-in-differences model, this study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on China's monthly exports from January 2019 to May 2020. We find strong and robust evidence that China's exports to countries at high risk from the pandemic experienced a larger decline than exports to low-risk countries after the onset of the pandemic, with the prices of exports increasing significantly. Furthermore, the results of a triple differences model show heterogeneous effects across different industries and goods. Chinese industries located upstream in the global value chain are more vulnerable than those located downstream. Industries with high labor and contract intensity (proxies for processing trade) experienced greater declines than other industries. Exports of goods with high import elasticity of substitution experienced higher prices and moderate volume losses due to the pandemic.

J	Dayo-Olupona, O; Genc, B; Onifade, M				Dayo-Olupona, Oluwatobi; Genc, Bekir; Onifade, Moshood			Technology adoption in mining: A multi-criteria method to select emerging technology in surface mines	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						AHP; Decision-making; Fuzzy multiple attribute; MCDM; Mining technology; PROMETHEE	DECISION-MAKING METHODS; MULTIPLE CRITERIA; SHAFT	The integration of technologies across the mining value chain is becoming critical, and it is crucial to identify the best possible technologies applicable to an operation, based on the chosen criteria. This study investigates the adoptable technologies for a mining project, develops a conceptual framework for the analytical process and validates the framework using a hypothetical case study. The case study comprised of a technology decision problem, the result of which consisted of six technology alternatives, four criteria, and one decision maker. Of the several Multi-Criterial Decision Making (MCDM) techniques available, the fusion of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and preference ranking organisation method of enrichment (PROMETHEE) techniques were used for this study. The AHP was used to determine the hierarchal weight of each decision-making criterion and its consistency, while the PROMETHEE method was used to carry out the overall process evaluation. Additionally, the fuzzy set theory was infused into the hierarchical structure analysis to evaluate the quantitative economic criterion to curb uncertainty and imprecision. The results of the analysis show that the technology alternative A3 - Artificial Intelligence (AI) - is the most preferred alternative, which outranks other comparative technologies. The approach proposed in this study can help provide the basis for any technology adopting mining company to build its technology business case, strategy and or roadmap to achieve the desired outcome.

J	Delera, M; Foster-McGregor, N				Delera, Michele; Foster-McGregor, Neil			On PTAs and Bilateral Trade: Is GVC Trade Sensitive to the Breadth of Trade Policy Cooperation?	ECONOMIES			English	Article						PTAs; PTA breadth; horizontal depth; GVCs; structural gravity model	AGREEMENTS; GRAVITY	We study the relationship between the scope of trade policy cooperation and bilateral trade flows with a particular focus on global value chain (GVC) trade using data on the core and non-core provisions included in preferential trade agreements (PTAs). We find that broader PTAs have a larger impact on trade flows involving intermediates relative to flows involving all products, suggesting that GVC trade is particularly sensitive to the scope of trade policy cooperation. We also investigate different dimensions of heterogeneity in PTAs. We find that core provisions tend to drive the effect of PTAs on the level of GVC trade and that PTAs are particularly effective in raising the level of GVC trade between developing economies. We explore these issues using a sample of 189 countries over the period 1990-2015, with data obtained from the latest release of the EORA multi-regional input-output tables and UN-COMTRADE data.

J	Dmitriev, SS				Dmitriev, Sergei S.			U.S.-CHINA TECHNOLOGICAL RIVALRY: FROM "ARROGANCE" TO BOYCOTT	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						USA; China; globalization; protectionism; international trade; national security; technological boycott		The spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the slowdown in economic activity in the United States have strengthened the position of supporters of "decoupling" from China. The U.S.-China relations are progressing from "patient integration" to "impatient disengagement". Escalating research spending, accelerated industrial modernization, and the expansion of China's high-tech exports have been identified as major challenges to American technology dominance. The fragility of global value chains in cooperative relationships between US and Chinese companies has become particularly evident. The United States plan to free themselves from dependence on China's innovative technologies and critical materials. Washington's efforts to revive the country's manufacturing industry received a new impetus. American TNCs have begun to return some of their enterprises to the USA. The "technological boycott" of China is aimed at causing maximum damage to the development of any competitive business that presents a challenge to American multinational corporations, and to slow down the progressive technological development of the PRC. Equally important are considerations of industrial policy aimed at crowding out competitors. Washington's protectionist actions led to a reduction in trade and mutual investment and have put American companies targeting Asian consumers in a difficult position. Washington is beginning to fear that Beijing may powerfully respond to the United States with countermeasures that are sensitive to the American military-industrial complex and innovative sectors of the economy. Washington's aggressive actions are mobilizing China's efforts to move up the value chain and localize products to achieve self-sufficiency in key technologies. However, the threat remains that protectionism could become a "new normal" not only for U.S.-China relations. The only viable alternative to this scenario may be the joining of efforts of market participants interested in returning to international legal norms of trade.

The global industry of fresh berries (strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, and blueberry) manages a highly perishable product, which requires high levels of coordination between agents. This study uses the GVC approach, emphasising governance forms and structures, to understand Mexico's berry boom and its drivers. The study implements a grounded theory methodology to analyse data from interviews, agri-food databases, and a documentary review. We find that the governance of GVC of berries lies in globally trading companies, who determine and coordinate its operation. We observe that the greater the complexity in transactions between growers and traders, the higher levels of coordination are established through hierarchical and captive governance structures. Agricultural producers play a subordinate role, although the local conditions, as proximity to the United States market, climate, and labour availability, determine their specific functioning. The study shows the opportunities and threats of the successful insertion of a peripheral country into a GVC, as a supplier of a very perishable product, with highly seasonal production.

However, critics often arise to point out the inefficiencies and economic distortions that subsidies create, which raise the question of-whether the existing WTO subsidy rules are adequate, and how to reshape WTO subsidy rules to address new emerging concerns especially in a global value-chain world. This article first reviews WTO Members' subsidy-related proposals under the Doha Development Agenda and then addresses key concerns on subsidy rules in the current broader discussion of the WTO reform, trying to figure out feasible approaches toward shaping a new generation' of subsidy rules under the aegis of the WTO.

The analysis covers the results of the ex-ante assessment of the NAMA potential contribution to the achievement of Mozambique's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target. The expected impacts show that the proposed actions tied to NAMA (e.g., introducing improved kilns, sustainable forest management, briquetting of charcoal waste and torrefaction) can cumulatively lead to emission reductions amounting to 314,521 +/- 45,138 t CO2-eq (119% reduction) by 2025, and 442,706 +/- 26,766 t CO2-eq (113% reduction) by 2030 at the national level, compared to a business as usual scenario. This shifting represents a transformation of the charcoal sector from a net source of emissions to net carbon sequestrating. The analysis also identifies a wide range of sustainable development cobenefits, including increased income, improved gender equity, job creation (23% increase by 2025, and 15% decrease by 2030), and increased revenue (USD 825,000 by 2025, and USD 1.6 million by 2030). The assessment process concluded that unless robust data collection, processing, and sharing is put in place, a full assessment of all direct and indirect environmental, social, and economic impacts cannot be comprehensively reported. Finally, we highlight the lessons learned and specific barriers for a robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of the given policy under the current MRV set up and available capacities.

Case Study in Spanish Winery	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						winery; MFCA; carbon footprint; environmental impact		Companies are gradually becoming conscious about the necessity of reducing their environmental impact and adopting low-carbon strategies in order to cope with increasing institutional and social demands. However, remaining competitive while reducing the environmental impact and improving the corporate image requires adopting sophisticated mechanisms boosting eco-efficiency and keeping costs tight. Material Flows Cost Accounting (MFCA) is an instrument that allows the monitoring of, measurement of, and accounting for physical and monetary processes along the production process. If extended to the supply chain, and applied to the energy usage and CO2 emissions, it allows one to account for the Carbon Footprint (CF) of a company and its products at any given stage of the value chain. The current paper presents a case study developed under the framework of a three-year project to introduce an energy use and carbon emissions monitoring and accounting system in a large winery company in Spain, based on the MFCA approach and CF accountability. Including the supply chain of the company and the whole farming cycle of its main input, the case study presents the method and phases adopted to implement the project, its direct and indirect results and outcomes, and the conclusions that can be extracted, which may be inspirational for practitioners and scholars envisaging similar projects.

J	Mvulirwenande, S; Wehn, U				Mvulirwenande, Silas; Wehn, Uta			Opening the innovation incubation black box: A process perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Incubation; Innovation process; Innovation value chain; Water innovation	TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; PRODUCT; EFFECTUATION; SMES	The past years have seen a rising number of initiatives to foster water-related innovations around the world. Many of such initiatives take the incubation approach to support individuals or entities with potential for developing marketable water innovations. Despite the growing research on incubation, the innovation processes of incubatees - which are generally intertwined with the incubation process itself - have arguably received the least attention of researchers. Using the process perspective to innovation, this paper sheds light on the issue of how incubated innovators manage their innovation processes and the extent to which these processes are influenced by the incubator support. Empirical evidence was collected from 12 water innovators supported by VIA Water, a Dutch programme on water innovation in Africa. The study finds that innovation activities of incubated water innovators during the period preceding the incubation process are in essence informal, hardly planned and with little focus. The incubator support enables innovators to innovate systematically, notably by maintaining linkages between the different phases of the innovation processes, and to build convincing innovation cases.

J	Park, JH; Jung, H; Lim, CH; Chang, T				Park, Jung Ho; Jung, Hojin; Lim, Chang Ho; Chang, Taejin			The economic impact analysis of satellite development and its application in Korea	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Satellite development; Economic impact; Cost-benefit analysis; Network building effect		Many countries began satellite development from the beginning of the space era and especially after the Apollo era. Korea started satellite development in 1992 by launching small satellite KITSAT-1 more than 20 years after the Apollo 11 lunar landing. Since then, Korea has developed 15 satellites including eight small satellites, five low earth orbit (LEO) Korean Multi-Purpose Satellites (KOMPSAT), and two geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites. Korea is currently developing KOMPSAT 6 and 7 with advanced optical and radar observation capability, GEO-KOMPSAT 2B, middle-sized Compact Advanced Satellites (CAS), and next generation small satellite (NEXTSat). These efforts will raise Korea's satellite technology to the next level. To prepare strategies for efficient and effective development of satellites, it is essential to elaborately assess the economic impacts of previous satellite development projects and their application. In this paper, we examine the economic impacts of Korea's investment into the research and development of national satellites, and their application in the perspective of satellite value chain. To this end, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis on the development of representative satellites. As non-economic impacts, we examined the change of technology independence and technology level, network building effect, and aerospace ecosystem activation effects.

J	Philbin, SP				Philbin, Simon P.			Critical Analysis and Evaluation of the Technology Pathways for Carbon Capture and Utilization	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						carbon capture and utilization (CCU); carbon dioxide; technology pathways; critical analysis and evaluation; circular economy	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; DIRECT AIR CAPTURE; CO2 UTILIZATION; DIOXIDE UTILIZATION; METHANOL SYNTHESIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WASTE-WATER; ENERGY; STORAGE; POWER	Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is the process of capturing unwanted carbon dioxide (CO2) and utilizing for further use. CCU offers significant potential as part of a sustainable circular economy solution to help mitigate the impact of climate change resulting from the burning of hydrocarbons and alongside adoption of other renewable energy technologies. However, implementation of CCU technologies faces a number of challenges, including identifying optimal pathways, technology maturity, economic viability, environmental considerations as well as regulatory and public perception issues. Consequently, this research study provides a critical analysis and evaluation of the technology pathways for CCU in order to explore the potential from a circular economy perspective of this emerging area of clean technology. This includes a bibliographic study on CCU, evaluation of carbon utilization processes, trend estimation of CO2 usage as well as evaluation of methane and methanol production. A value chain analysis is provided to support the development of CCU technologies. The research study aims to inform policy-makers engaged in developing strategies to mitigate climate change through reduced carbon dioxide emission levels and improve our understanding of the circular economy considerations of CCU in regard to production of alternative products. The study will also be of use to researchers concerned with pursuing empirical investigations of this important area of sustainability.

J	Puschmann, T; Hoffmann, CH; Khmarskyi, V				Puschmann, Thomas; Hoffmann, Christian Hugo; Khmarskyi, Valentyn			How Green FinTech Can Alleviate the Impact of Climate Change-The Case of Switzerland	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainability; FinTech; InsurTech; green FinTech; climate change; digital transformation	BLOCKCHAIN; SUSTAINABILITY; TECHNOLOGY; ECONOMY	The financial services industry is currently undergoing a major transformation, with digitization and sustainability being the core drivers. While both concepts have been researched in recent years, their intersection, often conceived as "green FinTech," remains under-determined. Therefore, this paper contributes to this important discussion about green FinTech by, first, synthesizing the relevant literature systematically. Second, it shows the results of an empirical, in-depth analysis of the Swiss FinTech landscape both in terms of green FinTech startups as well as the services offered by the incumbents. The research results show that literature in this new domain has only emerged recently, is mostly characterized by a specific focus on isolated aspects of green FinTech and does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic yet. In addition, the results from the literature and the market analysis indicate that green FinTech has an impact along the whole value chain of financial services covering customer-to-customer (c2c), business-to-customer (b2c), and business-to-business (b2b) services. Today the field is predominantly captured by startup companies in contrast to the incumbents whose solutions are still rare.

Using Dairy Value Chains to Identify Production Constraints and Biosecurity Risks	ANIMALS			English	Article						dairy value chain; farm biosecurity; cattle infectious diseases; value chain mapping; risk nodes	BRUCELLOSIS; FARMERS; CATTLE; PUNJAB; HEALTH	Simple Summary The dairy industry plays a key role in the Indian economy. This study was conducted to understand the dairy inputs and outputs and to identify production constraints and biosecurity. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were conducted in the Punjab state of India with 119 participants, including veterinarians, paraveterinarians, veterinary academics, dairy farmers and key informants. Farm inputs (e.g., feed and animal health services) and outputs (e.g., milk, animal sales, carcass and manure disposal) were mapped. Production constraints and biosecurity practices were identified and included the availability of green and dry fodder, provision of veterinary services by untrained practitioners, improper disposal of carcass/placenta/excreta, absence of health certification during sale or purchase of animals and absence of testing of village bulls. The government was a major provider of health and management services in the state, although a very high proportion of farmers relied on untrained or partially trained service providers for health advice and veterinary procedures. Improvement in biosecurity practices and adequate use of personal protective equipment is recommended to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases and minimize their impact. The dairy industry plays an important role in the economy and food security of India. A study of the dairy value chains was conducted in Punjab, India, to identify production constraints and biosecurity risks. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were conducted during 2018-2019 with a total of 119 participants comprising veterinarians (41), paraveterinarians (15), veterinary academics (12), dairy farmers (46) and key informants (5). Input and output value chains were created, and potential risk nodes were identified that could facilitate the transmission of pathogens between animals, farms and villages. The majority of the participants were male (93%), middle-aged (68%) or worked in rural areas (75%). Most of the farmers self-cultivated their green fodder (82%), used the wheat straw from their own fields (60%) but purchased commercial feed (63%). Artificial insemination was used by 85% of farmers for cattle, but only 68% for buffaloes. Most of the farmers (76%) reported getting their animals vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease and hemorrhagic septicemia. Animals were sold and purchased without any health certification and testing in most cases. Adoption of biosecurity measures by farmers and the use of personal protective equipment by veterinary personnel were very low. We recommend conducting epidemiological studies to further characterize the identified risk nodes, training of veterinary practitioners and farmers to ensure adequate biosecurity practices and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment.

Performance of Islamic Microfinance Institutions: Accounting for Well-Being	GLOBAL JOURNAL AL-THAQAFAH			English	Article						Islamic Microfinance Institutions; Well-being; Social Performance	POVERTY	Islamic micro-finance, despite being a small part of the Islamic finance industry, plays a significant role in poverty alleviation and financial inclusion activities. One of the key challenges facing Islamic micro-finance institutions (IMFIs) is the lack of measures of performance, which hinders the process of evaluating IMFIs' performance and the dynamic growth of the micro-financing sector. Unlike the conventional financial sector, there have been few attempts to measure the performance of IMFIs. The knowledge of measures and determinants of success factors for IMFIs is limited and compounded by a lack of theoretical basis underpinning research in this area. This paper focuses on examining the performance measures of micro-financing institutions in Islamic micro-financing. The determination of IMFI success factors would assist in the external evaluation and internal improvements of IMFIs, which would contribute to a more dynamic micro-finance industry. Therefore, IMFIs should be evaluated not only on output and the outcome measures of both social and financial performance, but also the process and with a view of the entire value chain of financing, along with the internal process of fostering borrower cooperation to enable the achievement of well-being.

Gray) has gained interest as a potential source of natural and hypoallergenic rubber in Southern Europe. Although, native to northern Mexico, it is suited to semi-arid and Mediterranean environments. A research study was conducted in Sardinia (Italy) to evaluate adaptation and biometric traits of introduced guayule lines and to determine the contents and yields of rubber and resin obtainable from its aboveground biomass. Seedlings of the accessions AZ-1, AZ-2, P803, and 11591 were field transplanted in 2015 at two locations of southern, and northern Sardinia, respectively, differing for annual precipitation. Plant survival rate, height and width, trunk diameter, leaf chlorophyll concentration and photosystem photochemical efficiency were monitored. Shoots were harvested at 30 months after transplanting and were partitioned into twigs and remaining stems and its rubber and resin contents were determined. Location markedly affected plant survival rates and biometric traits. Dry matter yield of aboveground components as well as contents of rubber and resin and plant rubber and resin yields differed significantly among accessions under comparison. We found that AZ1 and 11591 were the most successful accessions at southern Sardinia site, whereas 11591 was the only accession exhibiting a satisfactory plant survival rate in the northern location.

J	Sun, YY; Wu, L; Yin, S				Sun, Yingying; Wu, Lei; Yin, Shi			Green Innovation Risk Identification of the Manufacturing Industry under Global Value Chain Based on Grounded Theory	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						manufacturing industry; green innovation; risk identification; influence factor; grounded theory	PERFORMANCE	Green innovation in the manufacturing industry has been widely recognized. Although green innovation can create economic, social, and ecological value, it is also a high-risk activity. We must facilitate and protect the value of green innovation through scientific and systematic management of the risks generated in the process of innovation. The primary task of risk management is risk identification. Therefore, based on the perspective of the global value chain, this paper identifies the risk of green innovation in the manufacturing industry using the research method of grounded theory. By examining the interview records of 25 manufacturing enterprise executives, we summarize and identify the four major risks and 31 risk factors of green innovation. The empirical results of this paper are as follows: (1) the green innovation risks of the manufacturing industry under the global value chain include green R&D risks under the global value chain; manufacturing risks under the global value chain; marketing risks under the global value chain; service risks under the global value chain. (2) Green R&D risks under the global value chain include seven risk factors; green manufacturing risks under the global value chain include 10 risk factors; green marketing risks under the global value chain include nine risk factors; green service risks under the global value chain include five risk factors.

As transaction costs are difficult to measure the theoretical framework of analysis is based on transaction costs economics of new institutional economics. The results revealed that the spot market-based governance structure was the most preferred market arrangements by smallholders farmers in north-central Namibia because vegetable farmers struggle to meet the quality and quantity standards as required by the contractors market-based and commission market-based arrangements. The results also suggest that due to incomplete information, farmers and market agents suffer from high transaction costs. Skewed information distribution between farmers and marketing agents leads to slow development of vegetable enterprises. The study recommends that information shared to farmers must be packaged in an adequate manner to minimise transaction costs in the vegetable value chain.

Sustainable business models' (SBMs) multi-stakeholder lens offers a promising alternative path to mutual value, but BoP-based SBM studies are scarce. This single case study explores whether and how SBM characteristics manifest in the business model and value outcomes of Habi, a Manila footwear company successfully creating mutual value with BoP suppliers. We find SBM characteristics underpin Habi's dual-structure business model (value chain/shop) and success in four ways: viewing profits as a tool for community development resulted in designing both product and business model around community strengths; understanding communities as systems helped Habi address the complexities of poverty; balancing short-term business needs with a long-term, slow-growth approach led to their choice of investors; and implementing community value capture mechanisms ensured enduring community benefit.

Meeting such demand through local production of affordable milk presents an opportunity to improve the welfare of producers and market agents through the income and employment generated along the value chain (VC). Efforts to maximize milk yields, production and profitability need to be balanced with long-term sustainability. We combined environmental and economic ex-ante impact assessments of four intervention scenarios for two production systems in the Tanzanian dairy VC using the CLEANED model and an economic feasibility analysis. Intervention scenarios propose increases in milk production through (i) animal genetic improvement, (ii) improved feed, (iii) improved animal health and (iv) a package combining all interventions. Results show that economically feasible farm-level productivity increases of up to 140% go hand-in-hand with increased resource-use efficiency and up to 50% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities. Absolute increases in water, land and nitrogen requirements in mixed crop-livestock systems call for careful management of stocks and quality of these resources. An overall rise in GHG emissions is expected, with a maximum of 53% increase associated with an 89% increase in milk supply at VC level. The CLEANED tool proved effective to evaluate livestock interventions that improve incomes and food security with minimal environmental footprint. Here, our simulations suggest that due to current low productivity, the greatest efficiency gains in combination with relatively low increases in total GHG emissions can be made in the extensive agro-pastoral dairy systems, which represent the majority of herds.

J	Dell'Era, C; Trabucchi, D; Magistretti, S				Dell'Era, Claudio; Trabucchi, Daniel; Magistretti, Stefano			Exploiting incumbents' potentialities: From linear value chains to multisided platforms	CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business model; digital platform; incumbent; tourism; two&#8208; sided platform	RADICAL INNOVATION; PRODUCT INNOVATION; VALUE CREATION; TECHNOLOGY; MODEL; COLLABORATION; PERSISTENCE; COMPETITION; CAPTURE; SUCCESS	Two-sided (or multisided) platforms are significantly transforming the competitive landscape. Companies like Airbnb and Uber entered and challenged traditional industries by adopting business models able to innovatively exploit the opportunities provided by digital technologies. Recent studies have pointed out that the characteristics of multisided platforms might inspire traditional businesses to foster innovation, enabling different kinds of value creation and capture. This paper aims to explore this possibility through a longitudinal case study of an Italian tour operator that moved from a traditional linear value chain model to a multisided platform. Relying on the literature about multisided platforms and the modalities adopted by incumbents in fostering innovation, this research offers contributions to both theory and practice. Firstly, it shows how incumbents can reinterpret their resources and relationships in order to conceive new multisided platforms. Secondly, it investigates how the experience gained by incumbents can unveil technological opportunities. Thirdly, it shows how the incumbents can manage complexity and adopt a systemic perspective in developing multisided platforms. Thus, the contribution to the academic dimension is in enriching the knowledge of how multisided platforms can help incumbents in dealing with their 'typical curse'.

This paper reports the use, analysis and interpretation of the mid-infrared spectra of different plant parts (fruits and leaves) from an Australian native tropical plant, Terminalia ferdinandiana Exell [Combretaceae]. The use of infrared spectroscopy together with chemometric techniques will allow to obtain different levels of information about the chemical composition of leaf and fruit samples associated with maturity. Freeze-dried powder and puree of Terminalia ferdinandiana is commercially available as a functional food ingredient, whereas leaves or any other tissues are not considered as functional ingredients. The use of mid-infrared spectroscopy can provide an initial screening tool for the discovery and development of new ingredients and products. This technology can be an easy to use, cost-effective and high throughout method to ensure quality and authenticity of food products throughout the value chain.

J	Henson, S; Agnew, J				Henson, Spencer; Agnew, Jessica			Are market-based solutions a viable strategy for addressing micronutrient deficiency? Lessons from case studies in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia	DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						business; food; markets; micronutrient deficiency; undernutrition	WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; EXPERIMENTAL AUCTIONS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; NUTRITION; BOTTOM; HEALTH; FOODS; SUPPLEMENTS; CHALLENGES; DIVERSITY	Motivation While public and civil sector nutrition interventions in low- and middle-income countries have demonstrated positive impacts on nutritional status, micronutrient deficiency remains persistent and severe. Accordingly, there is much debate about the viability of market-based strategies directed at reducing micronutrient deficiencies among the poor, particularly concerning the role businesses can take. Purpose This article explores the potential for both large and micro/small businesses to engage in markets for nutrient-dense foods. It examines the challenges businesses face in establishing and maintaining sustainable business models and whether these businesses can achieve the scale required to achieve substantive impacts on the nutrition of the poor. Methodology This article presents a comprehensive literature review and in-depth case studies of market-based initiatives directed at enhancing the access of the poor to nutrient-dense foods. The case studies involved analysis of secondary data and interviews with stakeholders, including value chain actors, civil society organizations, government officials, etc. Findings All bottom of the pyramid (BOP) businesses face considerable challenges in the context of markets for nutrient-dense foods directed at the poor that relate to the difficulties faced in presenting a viable value proposition to consumers and in distributing products to the places where the poor reside, while achieving sustainable scale. Importantly, the results indicate a critical role for micro/small businesses in promoting the consumption of nutrient-dense foods by the poor. Policy implications The findings raise important questions over the role and focus of public support to businesses looking to enter and/or expand in markets for nutrient-dense foods directed at the poor, and especially with respect to micro/small businesses as opposed to large/multinational corporations. Originality The article presents the first comparative analysis of market-based strategies of micro/small to large businesses directed at reducing micronutrient deficiencies in the poor.

There is still poor treatment in OA but science holds the key to finding better treatments and a cure. It is essential to learn what's important to patients from them to implement the most effective OA management. The OA Patients Task Force, conducted the Global OA Patient Perception Survey (GOAPPS)-the first global survey made by patients to analize the quality of life (QoL) & patient perceptions of care. The goal was to collect data on OA patients' perception of OA to understand patients' needs and expectations to improve OA management.MethodsObservational, cross-sectional study by online survey data collection from six countries, translated into three languages. The questionnaire was comprised of 3 sections: patient demographics and clinical symptomology characteristics; relationship with physicians: perception of attention, treatment, and information provided; and OA impact on daily activity and QoL. The results of the survey were evaluated using the Limited Data Set. The survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics to characterize the patients' answers. Additionally, Cronbach's alpha was calculated to determine internal consistency validity.ResultsA total of 1512 surveys were completed in 6 countries. 84.2% of respondents reported pain/tenderness and 91.1% experienced limitations to physical activities. 42.3% of patients were not satisfied with their current OA treatment. 86% had comorbidities, especially hypertension, and obesity. 51.3 and 78% would like access to additional drug or additional non-drug/non-surgical treatments respectively. 48.2% of patients perceived their QoL to be affected by OA. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.61.ConclusionsOA has a significant impact on patients' daily activities and their desire to play an active role in managing this disease. Patients are seeking additional treatments, especially no pharmacological/no surgical treatments stressing the need for investing in clinical research, implementing OA preventive measures, and managing interventions to improve the healthcare value chain in OA.

Nigeria's Energy deficit: The challenges and Eco- friendly approach in reducing the energy gap	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Renewable energy; policy drivers; pyrolysis; biomass; solar energy	SOLAR-ENERGY; BIOMASS PYROLYSIS; PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION; FLASH PYROLYSIS; FUELS; PARAMETERS; GASIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; COALS	This study provides an overview of the current energy deficit in Nigeria due to the massive challenges linked to the energy value-chain particularly the generation, distribution and decentralisation in Nigeria. The review discusses in detail, the possibility of using alternative resources to increase the usage of clean energy. The resources are represented by a huge biomass potential and solar energy availability in the country, which can be harnessed to solve the energy challenges. Therefore, solar-biomass pyrolysis technology was suggested as an appropriate technology to harness the combined energy potential presented by solar energy and biomass. This review helps to make the best design, choice, and adoption of suitable technology approaches for Nigeria. Moreover, the existing research on solar-biomass pyrolysis design architecture, configurations, were also reviewed. The choice of incorporating a solar-pyrolysis system for energy supplies and environmental resilience will be a novel attempt in the energy model using the Nigeria case.	[Ndukwu, M. C.; Horsfall, I.

Using a multi-stage sampling procedure, 384 growers were selected at random to participate in the survey. A structured household survey was the main tool for data collection. Descriptive statistical methods and the double-hurdle model were employed in the analysis. Our study finds that the probability of a household being participating in the apple value chain increases with household head education level, experience, extension contacts, and membership in local cooperatives, while decreases with household size and incidence of disease and insect pests. Results further showed that mango plot size and membership in local cooperatives increase the probability of participation decisions in the mango value chain. Moreover, households' intensity of participation in the apple value chain increases with education level and extension contacts, whereas age squared and distance to the nearest market decrease their intensity of participation in the mango value chain. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at improving rural infrastructure (roads and markets), price information systems, human capital, and promotion of farmers' cooperatives, as well as access to disease and insect pest control mechanisms, could improve the participation of farmers in the fruits value chain.

MILK Symposium review: Improving the productivity, quality, and safety of milk in Rwanda and Nepal	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	MILK Symposium on Improving Milk Production, Quality, and Safety in Developing Countries at the ADSA Annual Meeting	JUN, 2019	Cincinnati, OH	ADSA		smallholder; quality; productivity; training	PREVALENCE; MASTITIS	Dairy production plays an important role in the lives of many people in Rwanda and Nepal. The aim of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems (LSIL; Gainesville, FL) is to introduce new location-appropriate technologies and to improve management practices, skills, knowledge, capacity, and access to inputs across livestock value chains in developing countries such as Rwanda and Nepal. To assist LSIL, our first aim was to describe gaps in the management of cows and in milk processing that constrain milk quality and quantity in Rwanda and Nepal. Our second aim was to describe training-of-trainers workshops in both countries as an initial response to the findings from the first objective. We conducted literature reviews and did rapid needs assessments in both countries. The literature reviews revealed similar aspects of the challenges of smallholder crop-livestock mixed farming systems in both countries. Many farms are struggling with feed quality, reproduction, and health of dairy cows. Milk production per cow and quality is often low. Fresh milk is collected by milk collection and cooling centers. Hygiene and milk processing capability and shelf life of products can be improved. Local rapid needs assessments were conducted in 2016 (Rwanda) and 2017 (Nepal) through visits to farms, milk collection and chilling centers, and processing plants, and through discussions with local dairy officials. The assessments supplemented and completed our understanding of stakeholders' needs in management and processing of milk. Limiting factors to improving the productivity, quality, and safety of milk in Rwanda and Nepal were a combination of sometimes limited knowledge in areas such as feeding, mastitis control, and hygiene, and a lack of access to resources such as quality feeds, transportation, and cooling that hindered implementation of existing knowledge. Training-of-trainers workshops in milk processing and hygiene were developed and given in Rwanda and Nepal based on the rapid needs assessments, and these were well received. We concluded that Rwanda and Nepal both have smallholder dairy farms that often face similar challenges such as lack of quality feeds, needs for basic dairy management education, low cattle productivity, and undesirable milk quality. Training-of-trainers programs to address these basic issues may be successful. Continued improvements in the dairy value chain depend on available resources for education.	[De Vries, A.; Dahl, G.

Chains of Meaning: Crops, commodities, and the 'in-between' spaces of trade	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Commodities; Trade; Certifications; Rice; India; Madagascar; Ethnography	BASMATI RICE; FAIR TRADE; NEOLIBERAL CONSERVATION; COFFEE; MARKET; PARADOXES; CERTIFICATION; CONSUMPTION; PRODUCTS; PLANT	Both basmati rice in India and red rice in Madagascar have gained special export status in their respective countries, being more easily allowed to enter global commerce compared to other kinds of rice. Using a `chains of meaning' framework that centers ethnographic and comparative analysis, we examine how basmati and red rice are both made 'exportable' in part through the negotiation of non-economic meanings by individuals operating in the in between' spaces of trade regulation. We note key differences between basmati and red rice regarding how actors situated along the commodity chain frame and negotiate the export process, especially with respect to regulatory, scalar, and material dimensions. The two case studies illustrate how the paths that seemingly similar specialty commodities pursue through global supply chains are neither linear nor interchangeable, but are rather mediated by broader cultural and social relationships. Attention to these relationships can strengthen programs in sustainable trade, as they facilitate commodity circulation across spheres of exchange. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, FL; Wu, L; Zhang, F				Wang, Fulin; Wu, Ling; Zhang, Fan			Network Structure and Influencing Factors of Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Spatial Correlation Network-A Study Based on Data from 30 Provinces in China	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						agricultural science and technology innovation; spatial correlation network; network structure; influencing factors; agricultural innovation	SECTOR; SPILLOVERS; GEOGRAPHY; GROWTH	Based on the perspective of the value chain of agricultural science and technology innovation, in this paper, we divided the process of agricultural science and technology innovation into two stages: the Research and Development (R&D) of agricultural technology and the application of agricultural technology. We took the efficiency of agricultural science and technology innovation of the two stages as a comprehensive index measure for the development of agricultural science and technology innovation in China. On this basis, we used social network analysis to establish a two-stage spatial correlation network for the innovation development of agricultural science and technology in China. The spatial-temporal evolution trends, structural characteristics, and influencing factors of the network were analyzed from the three aspects of the overall, local, and individual network structure. The results show that: a. The development of agricultural science and technology innovation in China demonstrated a clear spatial correlation and spillover effect, and the spatial correlation network was in a connected state. b. The network had the distribution characteristics of 'core-edge' and strong stability, and the hierarchical structure of the members of each province in the network was gradually broken. c. The differences at the market level in agricultural science and technology, the differences in government support for agriculture, the geographically adjacent relationships, and the level of agricultural economic development were important factors affecting the spatial correlation of agricultural science and technology innovation. This study provides a policy reference to use a cross-regional coordinated development mechanism to solve the uneven and asymmetry problem of the distribution of elements in various regions in China.

Often the two targets of this criticism have been the impact of fair trade and the asymmetry of power between the Global North and South that benefits the North. This article presents a case study from Madagascar which illustrates the positive aspects of fair trade, along with its capacity to involve Global South producers higher up the value chain (functional upgrading), thereby ensuring that these producers are better able to manage their production and the inherent risks.

Starting from artichoke by-products, the inulin fraction was assessed both in terms of total amount and degree of polymerization as a function of the harvest season and storage conditions. These parameters have been found significant at influencing inulin yield of extraction. For the first time, artichoke wastes were proposed to be exploited taking into account the optimal conditions to preserve their high-added chemical value. Our data suggest that Italian farms could obtain from their wastes a total amount of 16 t/year of inulin with an average polymerization degree higher than 40 and would allow the development of a circular economy process within the artichoke supply chain, by exploiting its wastes representing 70% of the total artichoke biomass.

Our objective was to explore suitable conditions, at farm and downstream levels, for organic hempseed oil production in Sicily, taking on an action-research perspective that involves local actors. Based on a preliminary characterisation of barriers to organic hemp development at different value chain levels, we carried out targeted complementary investigation: (i) assessment on agroenvironmental performances of integrating hemp in durum wheat-based rotations; (ii) chemical analysis of local hempseed oil; (iii) exploration of marketing opportunities and value chain development. Our results showed that the lack of technical and economic knowledge as well as the deficiencies of suitable cultivars and adequate machinery were the main barriers for the organic hemp value chain development in Sicily. The analysis of agroenvironmental performances also revealed both strengths and weaknesses of hemp introduction in durum-wheat based rotations. Despite the identified limitations, we demonstrated that the organic hemp value chains represent interesting perspectives for the Sicilian farming sector, particularly in case of substantial barriers removal or adaptation.

Public concerns about sustainability of biogas started with the issue of energy crop cultivation in the 2010s. To steer sustainability in the biogas sector, a broad variety of regulations and acts were enacted, mainly via top-down legislation making. But in order to govern sustainability in every step of the value chain, involvement of numerous stakeholders in the biogas sector is necessary. This paper will address the question: What are the perceptions of the relevant stakeholders in the biogas sector regarding various sustainability issues and what are their expectations? Methods Following an instrumental approach, three steps were initially undertaken for the systematic analysis of the stakeholder landscape, namely (1) stakeholder identification, (2) stakeholder categorization, and (3) investigation of stakeholder relationships. In addition, a theoretical mapping was performed to identify those actors, who most likely impact the implementation of biogas value chains, or are strongly affected by this implementation. These were then subject to surveys via questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to gather information on their sustainability governance perception. Results Results indicate that key players are farmers and biogas associations due to anchoring in agricultural sector, along with environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and policy makers. Furthermore, the surveyed stakeholders agree on regulating sustainability at national level, while tending toward neutral or even disagreeing for the regulation of sustainability at local and international level. They also agree that certification and standards can be an effective tool for compliant sustainability governance. Conclusions This study revealed a clear expectation gap regarding the transfer of the current energy legislation in a bio-economy and how sustainability shall be steered then (mandatory/voluntary and local (national) level/international level). The surveyed stakeholders expect transparent and clear rules from the government to steer sustainability that they currently do not perceive with regard to the expectation gap. In order to integrate the different stakeholders in the bio-economy development instead of confronting them with opaque legislation making, it is important to clearly communicate not only the opportunities but also the requirements that come along with the implementation of a bio-economy.

J	Irwin, S; Flaherty, MS; Carolsfeld, J				Irwin, Sean; Flaherty, Mark S.; Carolsfeld, Joachim			The contribution of small-scale, privately owned tropical aquaculture to food security and dietary diversity in Bolivia	FOOD SECURITY			English	Article						Aquaculture; Food security; Dietary diversity; women's participation; Value chain; Bolivia	BLUE REVOLUTION; VALUE CHAINS; FISH; NUTRITION; FISHERIES; IMPACTS; TRENDS	New aquaculture systems are emerging in new contexts around the world in part due to aquaculture's perceived development benefits. However, linkages between aquaculture and food security in these systems are unclear. This study investigated the impact of emerging small-scale, business-oriented fish culture in central Bolivia on the food security and dietary diversity of aquaculture producers (n = 40) and workers (n = 26) in the value chain and compared them to local non-aquaculture farmers (n = 40). Three pathways were investigated: fish consumption, household income, and women's participation. Food insecurity was widespread and did not vary in a statistically significant way between groups, but a trend toward greater food security amongst aquaculture producers was observed. Dietary diversity was highly homogenous, with the notable exception of high fish consumption amongst producers. Aquaculture was related to higher income, and income has a modest positive effect on food security for aquaculturists and non-aquaculture farmers, but not aquaculture value chain workers. Income did not have an effect on dietary diversity. Women's involvement in aquaculture was correlated positively to productivity, profitability, and size of operation, while male-only aquaculture was negatively correlated to these. The value chain generated employment, especially for women, but average wages were higher for men. The research provides important insight into aquaculture-food security linkages by showing that the introduction of small-scale business-oriented aquaculture systems can provide nutritious products for regional consumption and can have positive effects on food security but is not sufficient to change local dietary preferences more broadly.

J	Bisht, IS				Bisht, Ishwari Singh			Agri-food system dynamics of small-holder hill farming communities of Uttarakhand in north-western India: socio-economic and policy considerations for sustainable development	AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agri-food system; traditional farming landscapes; eco-nutrition; indigenous food sovereignty; sustainable agriculture	AGRICULTURE; BIODIVERSITY; FARMERS; VALUES	The small-scale ecological farming methods of Uttarakhand hills are key to ensuring resilience to climate change as these are based on enhancing diversity, thereby increasing options to respond to climate instability. Beside eco-nutrition, local community-level economic incentives are also considered important for sustainability of traditional hill farming and food systems. Feasibility of integrating four local marketing initiatives to traditional hill farming, i) promoting community-supported organic/biodynamic agriculture (CSA), ii) linking traditional farming with school meal (MDM) programs, iii) enhanced market access and value chain development for local plant food resources, and iv) creating off-farm employment opportunity at community level for rural youths, among others, are explored in the present study. The need of re-assessing existing food and nutrition-related health and agriculture policy, and developing cross-sectoral implementation strategies on food and livelihood security, nutrition, and health was also addressed. The outcomes are expected to set priorities for state policy for a more profitable local level agriculture and regenerative food system.
