J	Beiser, F				Beiser, Frederick			A Mayfly for Prof. Hegel:Herbart's Forgotten Review of Hegel's Rechtsphilosophie	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review						Hegel; J; F; Herbart; Schelling; Spinoza; natural law		Herbart and Hegel were contemporaries and both became famous, in their time and thereafter. It would be interesting therefore to know what they thought of one another. We could easily answer this question if they reviewed one another. Hegel never reviewed Herbart; but Herbart did review Hegel. Though in his later years Herbart protested that he did not want to engage with Hegel, he had already written, in 1822, one of his longest and most important reviews, which was of Hegel's Philosophie des Rechts. Herbart maintained that there is a Spinozistic element to Hegel's political philosophy which equates right with might. Hegel tried to avoid the implications of this equation by bringing Kantian transcendental freedom into his system, which for him boiled down to the idea of dialectical development. But Herbart rejected the fundamental idea behind dialectical development: that the ego posits the opposite of itself. Herbart then criticized Hegel's attempt to revive natural law and his theory of the state. Herbart contended that reason cannot prove the fundamental principles of natural law, that reason by itself is an abstract and formal power and as such cannot demonstrate any principle having substantive content. And Herbart criticized Hegel's doctrine that the individual finds his identity only in the state. Much more liberal than Hegel, Herbart stressed the importance of individuality outside the state.

J	Nah, D				Nah, Darren			Hegel, Weber, and Bureaucracy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Hegel; Weber; bureaucracy; corporatism; collegiate; Prussia		Hegel gave the bureaucracy a distinctively corporatist and collegiate structure and insulated it from legislative control. The close match between these features of the Philosophy or Right and the structure of the Prussian bureaucracy, which had been used by reformers to insulate progressive decisions from Junker resistance, suggests that Hegel, too, wanted the bureaucracy to spearhead reform within a hostile environment.

J	Abizadeh, A				Abizadeh, Arash			Consequences, Conscience, and Fallibility: Early Modern Roots of Toleration	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						conscience; diversity; heresy; intolerance; laicite; paternalism; politiques		The transition away from the highly intolerant and persecutory regimes of late-medieval and early-modern Europe was facilitated by four important developments. First, Europeans learned that social order and cohesion are threatened less by diversity than by intolerance of it. Second, the traditionally paternalist vision of the state's role was called into question by a new valuation of the individual conscience and consequently of individual liberties. Third, the assumption that the meaning of symbols is objectively determined was replaced by the recognition that symbols are intersubjectively determined by convention. Fourth, Europeans began to distinguish two senses of publicity: visibility and representativeness. The tenuous hold of these four modern assumptions is illustrated by laws of laicite, which harken back to the medieval mindset on all four counts.

J	Yack, B				Yack, Bernard			Revisiting The Longing for Total Revolution	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						freedom; Hegel; Kant; Marx; Rousseau; revolution; Schiller		This paper reconsiders the arguments of my book, The Longing for Total Revolution, in response to the thoughtful analyses collected in this symposium. It restates the book's main genealogical and critical arguments about the philosophical sources of uniquely modern forms of social discontent, while distinguishing those arguments from recent attempts to uncover the deeper, theological sources of discontent. It focuses, in particular, on the role played in modern social discontent by the group of thinkers I describe as the "Kantian left": a long line of social critics who sought to "realize" Kant's understanding of human autonomy in society, thereby gaining what Marx called "control and conscious mastery" over our social world, not just over our wills.

J	Layman, D				Layman, Daniel			ROBUST DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						deliberative democracy; incentive problems; knowledge problems; Mark Pennington; spontaneous order		Deliberative democracy aspires to secure political liberty by making citizens the authors of their laws. But how can it do this in the face of deep disagreement, not to mention imperfect knowledge and limited altruism? Deliberative democracy can secure political liberty by affording each citizen an equal position as a co-author of public laws and norms. Moreover, fundamental deliberative democracy-in which institutional design is ultimately accountable to public deliberation but not necessarily subject to its direct control-does not strain knowledge or altruism. Thus, there is a place for deliberative democracy in a robust political economy.

ON THE MERITS OF CRITICAL REALISM AND THE "ONTOLOGICAL TURN" IN ECONOMICS: REPLY TO STEELE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC ORDER; CAUSAL; DAVIDSON,PAUL; EQUILIBRIUM; EXPLANATION	The discipline of economics can benefit from a more explicit, systematic, and sustained concern with ontology; that is, with the philosophical analysis of the nature of the social world. Contrary to the argument advanced in these pages by Gerry Steele (2005), critical-realist ontological analysis encourages fruitful economic research in a number of ways: by helping to identify research methods suitable for analyzing economic issues; by promoting the development of key substantive economic concepts; and by helping to reveal and resolve inconsistencies in existing research.

J	Mokyr, J				Mokyr, Joel			THE ECONOMICS OF BEING JEWISH	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In his Capitalism and the Jews, Jerry Z. Muller discusses the relationship between Jews and ousuryo; explains how Jews have benefitted from capitalism; argues that most Jews are not on the left; and describes the relationship between Jews and nationalism. In covering this much ground in so compact a book, he naturally leaves out a great deal, such as the importance of ideology in issues of determining Jewish economic savoir faire, and why, despite their accomplishments in many fields, Jews are conspicuously underrepresented in the pantheon of great inventors before the modern industrial age. Jewish traditional culture was inherently backward-looking and conservative and thus did not encourage revolutionary ideas and thinking outside the box.

J	Tulis, JK				Tulis, Jeffrey K.			The Rhetorical Presidency in retrospect	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The Rhetorical Presidency is not, principally, a book about rhetoric or the presidency. Rather, rhetoric and the presidency are windows on the American constitutional order as a whole. Critics have greatly enhanced the historical narrative but have not undermined the principal historical and theoretical claims. Recent changes in the American polity are best understood as exacerbations of problems described in the book, rather than as fundamental alterations of our political world. Contemporary political pathologies can still be diagnosed as a product of the contending imperatives of the new constitutional order that has been layered on top of the old one. And while problems may be attenuated by a creative melding of the old and new orders, they cannot be solved within the confines of American constitutionalism, as it has been traditionally understood.

J	Greenfeld, L				Greenfeld, L			The trouble with social science	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Sonic of the most celebrated theories of nationalism exemplify the self-confirming, evidence-averse, deterministic, and ideological aspects of social science as we know it. What has gone wrong? The social sciences have modeled themselves on physics, failing to grasp the essential difference between the contingent, historical development of cultural particularity and the universal, law-like regularities of inanimate matter The physicist's tools for conducting, the method Popper called '' conjecture and refutation '' are largely inappropriate when dealing with imaginative and therefore unpredictable human beings. Obsessive quantification and the assumption Of universal '' social '' laws, in particular, need to be de-emphasized in favor of a Weberian willingness to make conjectures about the causes of unique events, and to test those hypotheses by comparing them to apparently similar cases.

J	Heilbroner, R				Heilbroner, R			The self-deception of economics	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Formalization has led contemporary economics to turn its back on the study of capitalism as the social order to which it owes its origins and its intrinsic analytical focus. As a consequence, contemporary economics turns a blind eye to the empirical analysis of capital accumulation, the real-world properties of markets, and the bifurcation of political power that capitalism with its unique historical properties. Instead, economics takes scientific, not social, analysis as its model, a view that gives an ideological cast to its findings.

J	BEINER, R				BEINER, R			RORTY,RICHARD LIBERALISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Richard Rorty, with his tendency to shock, to provoke, and to seize on Continental fashions, might be thought an unlikely liberal. Nevertheless, Rorty illustrates very well some of the characteristic weaknesses of contemporary liberalism. To the extent that he draws upon postmodern and deconstructionist sources, he highlights, and radicalizes, the liberal urge to break out of frozen identities and to destabilize static roles and fixed stations in life. His distinctive version of pragmatism yields a (novel) way of drawing liberal boundaries between private and public, culture and justice. And his antifoundationalism helps to legitimize a typical liberal reluctance to engage in any very ambitious social criticism. What distinguishes Rorty's liberalism is its higher degree of candor, which at least acknowledges that a liberal vision of things far from being ''neutral'' toward rival ideas of the good, is implicated in the defense of a particular way of life.

Technocracy, Governmentality, and Post-Structuralism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						collaborative governance; deliberation; Foucault; governmentality; knowledge-power; post-structuralism; technocracy	GOVERNANCE; POWER; PARTICIPATION; IDEAS	The technocratic dimension of government-its reliance upon knowledge claims, usually in scientific guise-is of great importance if we wish to understand modern power and governance. In Power Without Knowledge: A Critique of Technocracy, Jeffrey Friedman investigates the often-overlooked question of the relationship between technocratic knowledge/power and ideas. Friedman's contribution to our understanding of technocracy can therefore be read as a contribution to governmentality studies, one that introduces the possibility of adding normative solutions to this critical tradition.

J	Min, JB				Min, John B.			POLITICS MUST GET IT RIGHT SOMETIMES: REPLY TO MUIRHEAD	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						democratic legitimacy; epistemic democracy; epistemic proceduralism; procedure-independent standard of correctness		In "The Politics of Getting It Right," Russell Muirhead has contended in this journal that democracy is valuable because of its procedural legitimacy rather than because of the epistemic values of "getting things right." However, pure procedural theories of legitimacy fail. Thus, if democracy is legitimate, it will have to be due partly to its (potential) epistemic advantages. There are two ways of thinking about these advantages. One approach, associated most prominently with David Estlund and Helene Landemore, equates the epistemic advantages of democracy with its ability to approximate a procedure-independent standard of correctness. The other, associated with Fabienne Peter, explicitly rejects that standard. Peter's view, however, is incapable of answering challenges against pure procedural theories of legitimacy.

The framing of conspiracy theories as rooted in erroneous or delusional belief in conspiracies is characteristic of "positive" approaches to the topic, which focus on identifying the causes and cures of conspiracy theories. "Critical" approaches, by contrast, focus on the historical and cultural construction of the concept of conspiracy theory itself.

J	Moore, A				Moore, Alfred			HAYEK, CONSPIRACY, AND DEMOCRACY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						conspiracy theories; Hayek; spontaneous order	INVISIBLE-HAND	Hayek's social theory is resolutely anti-conspiratorial: He consistently rejects conceiving complex orders as though they were designed or planned. His account of democratic politics, by contrast, treats it as conducive to conspiracy, organized deception, and ultimately totalitarianism. His epistemology of spontaneous order and his radical suspicion of democratic politics are connected: The decay of democracy is itself a complex consequence of popular misunderstandings of social order. However, since Hayek is unable to account for self-correction within democratic structures, his argument has the unanticipated consequence of leading him to an implicitly authoritarian position.

J	Hoffman, T				Hoffman, Tom			Rational Choice and Political Irrationality in the New Millennium	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Joseph Schumpeter; rational irrationality; Ilya Somin; rational ignorance; rational choice theory		Ilya Somin's Democracy and Political Ignorance uses a by-now familiar rational-choice lens with which to explain and analyze Americans' widespread political ignorance. Unlike some scholars who tout rational choice on purely predictive or heuristic grounds, Somin claims that it also offers a more accurate description of reality, in this case better explaining the findings of empirical public-opinion research. In this essay, I compare Somin's central concept of rational ignorance and the related concept of "rational irrationality" with the earlier explanatory approach taken by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in his classic study, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. While Schumpeter developed his description of the mass democratic citizenry over 70 years ago-prior to any of the significant empirical studies of American public opinion-its broad approach remains at least as persuasive as Somin's.

J	Murphy, JB				Murphy, James Bernard			Free Market Morals	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							SOCIAL-CLASS; BEHAVIOR	John Tomasi argues that a theory of justice should include economic liberty since it provides people with a way of living self-authored lives. However, as Aristotelians have pointed out, even seemingly neutral theories of justice rely on non-neutral conceptions of the good. In Tomasi's case, the ideal of self-authorship assumes that it is good to exert economic agency and in so doing, exercise one's economic liberty. Thus, Tomasi equates self-authorship with participation in market activities, tacitly universalizing what is, in fact, a narrow and objectionable conception of the good.

J	Kelly, JT				Kelly, Jamie Terence			DEMOCRACY AS THE RULE OF A SMALL MANY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								What is the optimal size of a democratic society? While not taking an explicit stand on this issue, H l ne Landemore's model of democracy in Democratic Reason suggests that democracies ought to be small, certainly smaller than many existing states. If, as Landemore argues, we must rely on the random selection of representatives, then we should be concerned about both the size of the population and the way cognitive diversity is distributed within it. Given the realities of party politics and media framing, this means that smaller political societies will yield wiser decisions than very large ones.

J	Runde, J				Runde, Jochen			DISSECTING THE BLACK SWAN	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								What constitutes a Black Swan? And under what conditions may a Black Swan be expected to arise? As Nassim Taleb describes it, a Black Swan is an event that displays three key properties, the two most important of which are that: (1) it is not even imagined as a possibility prior to its occurrence; and (2) it is in some way significant in its impact. It follows that whether or not an event counts as a Black Swan depends on the subjective imaginings of contemporaneous observers and their (usually implicit) criteria regarding what counts as a "significant impact." Since there is nothing in determinism that precludes (1) and (2), Black Swans may occur even in a perfectly deterministic world. Nevertheless, if the world is indeed characterised by randomness, free will, emergence, and the like, then it is arguably more likely to throw forth events that display the above-mentioned properties. The same goes for various specific features of an increasingly interconnected global economy, which allowed Taleb (paradoxically) to forecast what was, for most of us at least, the great Black Swan of 2008.

J	Wittman, D				Wittman, Donald			THE MYTH OF THE RATIONAL VOTER?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								While Bryan Caplan's theory of rational irrationality is important and original, he does not actually demonstrate that the theory explains public opinion about economics. The theory holds that voters are aware of the insignificance of their votes, and therefore feel free to vote based on whatever beliefs they prefer to hold, regardless of whether or not these beliefs are true. Yet by voting, voters suggest that they do not, in fact, understand that the odds against their votes counting are astronomical. And by failing to vote in greater numbers for minor-party or write-in candidates, they confirm that they think that their votes may be decisive, and must thus be confined to one of the two candidates who might win. It is therefore implausible to think that voters don't care whether they are voting based on true beliefs. A better explanation for voter errors may be that voters are simply ignorant (in this case, ignorant of economics). Yet even this thesis may be too strong, because Caplan's data do not show all that much disagreement between voters and economists. Nor is it clear that these disagreements concern economics rather than xenophobia and, possibly, other non-economic attitudes on the part of the public. In that case, however, it would still be true that, as Caplan argues, public policy reflects the views of the peoplehowever blinkered or distasteful those views may be.

J	Quirk, PJ				Quirk, Paul J.			When the president speaks, how do the people respond?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							CITIZEN COMPETENCE; PUBLIC-OPINION; INFORMATION; ELECTIONS; MEDIA	Tulis's critique of popular presidential leadership raises several questions about public opinion: Do modern, rhetorically inclined presidents influence the public? Mat types of presidential rhetoric might, in, principle, mislead or manipulate the public? And is the net result that the people are led into error and distortion in their policy opinions? The public-opinion literature, which has assiduously documented the public's ignorance about politics and policy, might seem, at first glance, to offer grounds for an unequivocal "yes" to the third question. But most scholars of public opinion discount public ignorance and defend an optimistic view of the citizenry's political competence. The more convincing arguments and evidence, however, support more critical views. There is ample reason to worry about the consequences of policy making driven by popular rhetoric, and thus to consider whether any remedies for plebiscitary democracy might be found.

J	Bennett, SE				Bennett, Stephen Earl			Democratic competence, before converse and after	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The topic of the democratic public's limited competence has preoccupied students of democracy for centuries. Anecdotal concerns about the problem reached their peak of sophistication in the writings of Walter Lippmann and Joseph Schumpeter. Not until Philip E. Converse "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics" did statistical research overwhelmingly confirm the worst fears of such democratic skeptics. Subsequent work has tended to confirm Converse's picture of a tiny stratum of well-informed ideological elites whose passionate political debates find little echo, or even awareness, in the mass public. While a great deal of attention has been devoted to "saving" democratic legitimacy from such findings, the Converse-inspired work of John Zaller (1992) shows how fruitful Converse basic ideas can be not only in analyzing real-world political events, but in pulling together and stimulating new lines of research into what moves the "creative synthesizers" of belief systems; into the factors that affect the small numbers of people who grasp such systems and attempt to transmit them to the public; and into the long-term psychological or cultural sources of the predispositions with which members of the mass public confront the resulting political messages.

J	BROOKS, DL				BROOKS, DL			THE PROBLEMS OF POSTLIBERTARIANISM - REPLY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Jeffrey Friedman presents positive libertarianism as consisting of an objective morality, autonomy, and moral totalism. He then defines postlibertarianism as a consequentialist positive libertarianism. However, Friedman's claim that the choice of moral axioms is unjustifiable, and an equivocation in his use of the term ''moral,'' makes his presentation of positive libertarianism incoherent. Nor is Friedman successful in grafting consequentialism onto positive libertarianism. The autonomy of positive libertarianism renders consequentialism superfluous, and the ends of the two systems conflict, for positive libertarianism judges people, while the consequentialism of postlibertarianism judges actions.

J	KOLAKOWSKI, L				KOLAKOWSKI, L			ON THE PRACTICABILITY OF LIBERALISM - WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The radical liberal ideal of a completely neutral state is unattainable. A liberal society must educate its young, and this means engendering liberal principles in them. Fear of the law is not sufficient to sustain liberal society; conversely, if everything depends on fear of the law, the result will be the multiplication of laws in order to regulate everything, education having failed to impart self-restraint. Nor is the desire for freedom so natural that it need not be implanted through education. For similar reasons, the welfare state and a degree of economic regulation are, at least at this point in history, necessary for the survival of liberal societies.

J	MANSFIELD, HC				MANSFIELD, HC			HUMAN-RIGHTS IN EMERGENCIES	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Rights theorists tend to take tempi pacifici for granted, but it is precisely in emergencies that rights are most difficult to protect and most in need of protection. Two remedies are:first, to be successful in emergencies and second, to establish a free government capable of handling emergencies. These remedies play no role in the thinking of the ACLU, which has increasingly come to define the public's understanding of rights. For the ACLU, a right is not a right unless it can be carried to an extreme and used irresponsibly. A better liberal theory, with instruction from Machiavelli, will seek to combine our interest in security with our assertion of rights.

J	DIZEREGA, G				DIZEREGA, G			SOCIAL ECOLOGY, DEEP ECOLOGY, AND LIBERALISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review								Murray Bookchin's influential writings on social ecology attempt to unite the traditional leftist critique of liberal democratic society with contemporary environmental concerns. His work is undermined, however, in part by the dubious comparisons he makes between market systems and ecosystems, and in particular hy his failure to understand that these systems operate in a like fashion according to impersonal principles of self-organization. In the case of the market, while this impersonal process facilitates cooperation and exchange, it also rewards the instrumental nature of the relationship between human and ecological communities. Deep ecologists are therefore right to criticize the unwillingness of participants in market societies to appreciate the intrinsic value of nature. The challenges they pose to the human community - to become less anthropocentric and to approach property rights with a sense of stewardship - may be taken up by an ''evolutionary liberalism,'' which would strive to achieve harmony between humans and the natural world under the guidance of rules ordered by self-organizing principles.

J	Lamey, A				Lamey, Andy			Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The notion of spontaneous order has a long history in the philosophy of economics, where it has been used to advance a view of markets as complex networks of information that no single mind can apprehend. Traditionally, the impossibility of grasping all of the information present in the spontaneous order of the market has been invoked as grounds for not subjecting markets to central planning. A less-noted feature of the concept of a spontaneous order is that when it is applied to ecosystems it yields a reasonably strong environmental ethic: It generates a presumption against interfering with their natural functioning in a manner that results in anthropogenic species loss.

J	Sardamov, I				Sardamov, Ivelin			Out of Touch: The Analytic Misconstrual of Social Knowledge	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Jiro Tanaka; Anthony Jack; positivism; C. P. Snow; weird; social sciences; interpretivism; neuroscience; political science; psychology; holism; epistemology	DEFAULT-MODE; CULTURAL NEUROSCIENCE; RISK; SELF	The schism between positivism and interpretivism in the social sciences is usually explained by the explicit epistemological and methodological commitments of social scientists and philosophers. It can be better understood, though, as a collision between two contrasting cognitive modes and sensibilities, rooted in the predominant recruitment of two distinct networks in the human brain. Since the activation of these networks is negatively correlated, the analytic reasoning typical of positivists and the empathetic, intuitive, and holistic thinking employed by intepretivists produce incommensurate versions of social reality. The analytic cognitive mode is fostered and privileged in complex modern societies and in institutionalized social-science research. It is nevertheless inadequate for understanding the social world, as it facilitates the modeling of causal interactions between inanimate objects.

J	Jablecki, J				Jablecki, Juliusz			THE EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN-DEBT CRISIS: A FAILURE OF REGULATION?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Recent scholarship has underscored the possibility that capital-adequacy regulations may have contributed to the 2008 financial crisis by privileging highly rated asset-backed securities, such as mortgage-backed securities. The same regulations gave an even more privileged position to sovereign debt, leading to the question of whether they helped cause the European sovereign-debt crisis. There is little question that the regulations encouraged European banks to invest in European governments' bonds, but it does not appear that this encouragement led to more government borrowing by significantly reducing the yield governments needed to pay on their debt. However, it does appear that capital-adequacy regulations-along with post-2008 liquidity regulations-concentrated sovereign risk in the European banking system, aggravating the sovereign-debt problem by requiring government bailouts that, in turn, required the issuance of more sovereign debt, further jeopardizing the governments' fiscal position and banks' solvency. Exacerbating the situation, in the midst of a panic, the European Banking Authority imposed new capital requirements on banks and effectively forced them to realize mark-to-market losses on sovereign exposures.

J	Pennington, M				Pennington, Mark			DEMOCRACY AND THE DELIBERATIVE CONCEIT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Over recent years support for deliberative democracy as a regulative ideal against which political and economic institutions should be judged has become the dominant tradition within political theory. Deliberative democrats such as Amy Guttman and Dennis Thompson argue that deliberative public decision making would bring with it important epistemological and ethical gains. Closer inspection of these claims, however, suggests that deliberative democratic arrangements are not only impractical but are fundamentally at odds with the epistemic and ethical goals that their supporters seek to advance. Arrangements based on oexito rather than ovoiceo may be better placed to meet these challenges in a world characterized by complexity and conflicting moral values.

J	Rosenfield, DK				Rosenfield, Daniel K.			RETHINKING CYBER WAR	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Cybernetic attacks have been wrongly perceived as weapons of physical destruction rather than of disruption. Because modern, post-industrial societies have become critically dependent on computer networks to function on a day-to-day basis, disruption of those networks could have serious social and economic consequences.

J	Kirshner, O				Kirshner, Orin			Superpower politics: The triumph of free trade in postwar America	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							LIBERALIZATION	Since World War II, American presidents have consistently advanced a world free-trade agenda, despite the fierce opposition of domestic interests threatened by free trade, and despite these interests' ability to mobilize local pressure and nationalist sentiment against free trade in Congress. A theoretical resolution of these paradoxes would consider both the countervailing pressure of domestic interests that benefit from free trade and an international factor: namely, America's dominance of world trade. This global dominance gives the United States "superpower" status not only economically, but politically, enabling American presidents to get most of what they want in international trade negotiations. Consequently, they can afford to make tactical concessions to American mercantilist interests-defanging congressional opposition to free trade-because in international negotiations, these concessions can be turned into powerful levers against the barriers to free trade that are erected by countries desiring access to the immense American market.

J	Kirzner, IM				Kirzner, Israel M.			Hayek and economic ignorance: Reply to Friedman	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Markets can be said to overcome ignorance in two senses. First, in art imaginary world of economic equilibrium, market prices can signal to consumers how they may alter their behavior so as to conform to supply and demand conditions of which they are ignorant. This is a point that was underscored by FA. Hayek and, now, by Jeffrey Friedman. But the more important manner in which markets overcome ignorance was identified by Hayek's mentor, Ludwig von Mises, and is not mentioned by Friedman: when market prices are not perfectly aligned to supply and demand conditions (and they never are), they present profit opportunities to entrepreneurs who are alert to make such discoveries. Their profit-motivated actions then reallocate resources in a pattern more efficiently reflecting the true supply and demand conditions. It is this way of overcoming ignorance that most clearly separates the market arena from the political arena, because no corresponding corrective discovery process exists in politics.

Shackle stood at the historic crossroads where the economics of Hayek and Keynes met. Shackle fused these opposing lines of thought in a macroeconomic theory that draws Keynesian conclusions from Austrian premises. In Shackle scheme of thought, the power to imagine alternative courses Of action releases decision makers from the web of predictable causation. But the spontaneous and unpredictable choices that originate in the subjective and disparate orientations of individual agents deny us the possibility of rational expectations, and therewith the logical coherence of market equilibrium over time.

J	Eichengreen, B				Eichengreen, B			The crisis of (confidence in) global capitalism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In The Crisis of Global Capitalism, George Soros claims that the international financial economy is inherently unstable, and that while economists have failed to recognize this because of their commitment to static equilibrium theory, politicians have failed to stabilize the global economy because of their commitment to an unquestioned faith in the complete efficiency of laissez faire. While Soros is right to argue that market participants' expectations about the future can cause instability, he is wrong to maintain that this has gone unrecognized by economists, and his notion that ive live in a world of economic laissez faire is equally mistaken. Indeed, his own analysis of the Asian financial crisis points to the "moral hazard" created by expectations of government intervention, rather than to laissez faire, as the culprit.

J	Hoffman, T				Hoffman, T			Rationality reconceived: The mass electorate and democratic theory	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Early voting behavior research confronted liberal democratic theory with the average American citizen's meager ability to think politically. Since then, several lines of analysis have tried to vindicate the mass electorate. Most recently, some researchers have attempted to reconceptualize the political reasoning process by viewing it in the aggregate, while others describe individuals as effective-albeit inarticulate-employers of cognitive shortcuts. While mass publics may, in these ways, be described as "rational," they still fail to meet the basic requirements of democratic theory.

J	Johnston, D				Johnston, D			Is the idea of social justice meaningful?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							EQUALITY	Hayek claimed that the idea of social justice is meaningless in a market economy because in that context, no identifiable agent intentionally brings about the distribution of wealth, But the assumption that the existence of injustice entails an identifiable agent of injustice is erroneous. Moreover, Hayek ignores the fact that in a market economy, the broad pattern of economic outcomes is foreseeable even If detailed, person-by-person outcomes are not. Hayek's rejection of the idea of social justice reveals a striking naivete about his own ethical presuppositions.

Schumpeter criticized the high level of rationality the classical model of democracy imputes to citizens, and he provided an alternative theory, inspiring rational choice theory and allowing for diverse forms of irrationality. Following in Schumpeter's footsteps I will discuss four problems: the deficient rationality of voters, politicians as ''political entrepreneurs,'' leadership in democracy and the vise of the ''political class,'' and the affinity between democracy and capitalism.

Similarly, the debate over ''minimal statism'' versus the planned economy is outdated. Instead of claiming to be in possession of foundations of our scientific-cum-political knowledge in broad terms, and instead of severely limiting our knowledge to given proofs, we offer the putative heuristics Of critique in general and the critical evaluations of contexts in particular.

J	SHIBLES, W				SHIBLES, W			HUMANISTIC ART	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The cognitive theory of emotion (also called the rational-emotive theory) clarifies the notion of aesthetic emotion and evaluation, and when combined with Dewey's humanism and a naturalistic theory of valuation provides a basis for a holistic theory of aesthetics. From the holistic perspective, no act is moral unless it is also aesthetic. On this view, the aesthetic is no longer reduced to atomistic or quantitative perspectives, but becomes a part of our total purposive life experience. It expresses itself in gentleness and joie de vivre.			SHIBLES, W (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT PHILOSOPHY,WHITEWATER,WI 53190, USA.

J	MARMOR, TR				MARMOR, TR			UNDERSTANDING THE WELFARE-STATE - CRISIS, CRITICS, AND COUNTERCRITICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								We are now seeing a new wave of literature about the ''crisis'' of the welfare state. In the earlier wave, some critics charged that social spending significantly detracted from macro- or microeconomic performance, while others challenged the legitimacy or efficacy of welfare programs; a third group worried about the effect of macroeconomic problems on the viability of the welfare state. None of these criticisms can be said to have been satisfactory, and continued reiterations of them betray a lack of cross-national perspective and a priori reasoning about empirical matters. Works with greater historical depth and more recent studies constitute a much-needed reaction against the ''crisis'' literature.

J	CRANDALL, RW				CRANDALL, RW			REGULATION AND THE RIGHTS REVOLUTION - CAN (SHOULD) WE RESCUE THE NEW-DEAL	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In After the Rights Revolution, Cass Sunstein confronts the ''Chicago'' intellectual tradition on the effects of government regulation. While recognizing the many failures of regulation, Sunstein argues that most regulation serves a potentially useful purpose and that the courts can be relied on to correct the worst regulatory failures. He offers a dizzying array of prescriptions to ensure this outcome, many of which would appear to run afoul of clear congressional intent. In a more recent book, Breaking the Vicious Circle, Stephen Breyer offers a different diagnosis. He sees health-safety-environmental regulation as essentially out of control because of the ''vicious circle'' created by irrational and ineffective government responses to the public's concern about the risk of exposure to carcinogens. Breyer does not believe that this vicious circle of excessive and irrational regulation can be broken by the courts. Instead, he suggests the creation of an elite bureaucratic corps with the mission of proposing more effective and less costly approaches to controlling threats to human health.

J	Brinkmann, M				Brinkmann, Matthias			The Concept of Political Competence	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						democratic competence; instrumentalist theories of democracy; political competence	VOTER IGNORANCE; BELIEF SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE; DEMOCRACY	Two crucial distinctions regarding political competence must be made. First, the mere probability that you will make a morally right decision (reliability) is distinct from your ability to skillfully make a decision (competence). Empirical and normative accounts have focused primarily on reliability, but competence is more important if we take central normative commitments seriously. Second, the competence you have on your own (direct competence) is distinct from the competence you have in contributing to some collective enterprise (contributory competence). Direct competence is likely to be extremely demanding in a democratic context, so we should move to a contributory account of competence.

Received scholarly wisdom holds either that the classical doctrine had no real historical embodiments, or that it is a composite of historical arguments pieced together only so that Schumpeter could knock them down. Arguably, however, Schumpeter actually drew the classical doctrine from a very real source: Carl Schmitt.

J	Piano, N				Piano, Natasha			"Schumpeterianism" Revised: The Critique of Elites in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						democratic elitism; elites; masses; minimalism; political elites; Schumpeter; Schumpeterianism	POWER	A close reading of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy underscores Schumpeter's critique of elite political capacities. Given the neglect of this critique in contemporary scholarship, it might warrant a revision of our understanding of Schumpeterianism. To notice the critique of elites, we need to read Part IV in the context of the work as a whole, and with greater sensitivity to the sarcasm, irony, and humor that permeate the book. Such a reading produces a fundamentally altered understanding of Schumpeter's contribution to democratic theory.

J	Grewal, DS				Grewal, David Singh			CONSPIRACY THEORIES IN A NETWORKED WORLD	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						conspiracy theories; network power; social causation; social structures		The arrangements characteristic of systems of networked governance are likely to generate conspiracy theories because they rely on informal rather than formal structures of power. A formal hierarchy may be resented, but it is understood by those affected by it; in network systems, by contrast, it is often hard to determine who is in charge, even though such systems can heavily influence or even determine important social outcomes. While conspiracy theories may be motivated by many factors, in a world in which informal norms and the decisions of networked elites play a large role, we should expect to see a continued and increasing preoccupation with alleged conspiracies. Some allegations of conspiracy may even function as cognitive shortcuts-"as-if" conspiracies-which apply a cui bono style of reasoning to make sense of otherwise opaque modes of social control.

J	Gowder, P				Gowder, Paul			Market Unfreedom	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							EMOTIONAL LABOR; SERVICE; WORK; FLEXIBILITY; HARASSMENT; ENLISTMENT; WORKPLACE; EMPLOYER	John Tomasi's "market democrat" is right to suppose that Rawlsians have erred in omitting economic liberty from their theories of justice. A Rawlsian ought to include economic liberty as a basic freedom because it facilitates individuals' development and pursuit of their conceptions of the good. However, the most plausible version of economic liberty will require the state to guarantee, if possible, that no one will be driven by economic desperation to engage in immiserating work, which may impair rather than facilitate his or her pursuit of the good. There is reason to worry that contemporary economies such as the United States fall seriously short of that ideal.

WHEN DEMOCRACY MEETS PLURALISM: LANDEMORE'S EPISTEMIC ARGUMENT FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE PROBLEM OF VALUE DIVERSITY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In Democratic Reason, Helene Landemore makes an epistemic argument for democracy. She contends that, due to their greater cognitive diversity, democratic groups will engage in superior deliberation and information aggregation than will groups of experts; consequently, the quality of their policies will be better. But the introduction of value diversity into Landemore's model-which is necessary if the argument is to apply to the real world-undermines her argument for the epistemic superiority of democratic deliberation. First, the existence of value diversity threatens to stop deliberation prematurely. This has the effect of making the outcome of group deliberation more dependent on individual ability, which gives groups of experts a distinct advantage. Second, the introduction of value diversity raises the question of how to understand the standard of correctness of an epistemic argument, which Landemore does not adequately answer.

J	Lewis, P				Lewis, Paul			HAYEK, SOCIAL THEORY, AND THE CONTRASTIVE EXPLANATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC ORDER	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							SUBJECTIVISM; ECONOMICS; REALISM	Hayek's later work on the possibility of socio-economic order in decentralized market economies is an exercise in contrastive causal explanation as conceptualized by realist social theorists and philosophers. This interpretation of Hayek's work lends support to the view that Hayek's post-1960 writings can be thought of as an example of comparative institutional analysis. It also provides a means of reinforcing Hayek's own efforts to establish the scientific credentials of his work.

J	Tetlock, PE; Horowitz, MC; Herrmann, R				Tetlock, Philip E.; Horowitz, Michael C.; Herrmann, Richard			SHOULD "SYSTEMS THINKERS" ACCEPT THE LIMITS ON POLITICAL FORECASTING OR PUSH THE LIMITS?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Historical analysis and policy making often require counterfactual thought experiments that isolate hypothesized causes from a vast array of historical possibilities. However, a core precept of Jervis's systems thinking is that causes are so interconnected that the historian can only with great difficulty imagine causation by subtracting all variables but one. Prediction, according to Jervis, is even more problematic: The more sensitive an event is to initial conditions (e.g., butterfly effects), the harder it is to derive accurate forecasts. Nevertheless, if awareness of system effects can help forecasters better calibrate their probability estimates of whether or not certain events will come to pass, systems thinkers who are pessimistic about prediction are diluting their confidence too much. The challenge is a meta-cognitive one: thinking systematically about when to engage in systems thinking; and weighing the costs and benefits of using simple or complex heuristics in policy environments that can shift suddenly from quiescence to turbulence.

J	Keil, FC				Keil, Frank C.			WHEN AND WHY DO HEDGEHOGS AND FOXES DIFFER?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							ILLUSION; CHILDREN; LIMITS	Philip E. Tetlock's finding that "hedgehog" experts (those with one big theory) are worse predictors than "foxes" (those with multiple, less comprehensive theories) offers fertile ground for future research. Are experts as likely to exhibit hedgehog-or fox-like tendencies in areas that call for explanatory, diagnostic, and skill-based expertise-as they did when Tetlock called on experts to make predictions? Do particular domains of expertise curtail or encourage different styles of expertise? Can we trace these different styles to childhood? Finally, can we nudge hedgehogs to be more like foxes? Current research can only grope at the answers to these questions, but they are essential to gauging the health of expert political judgment.

J	Callahan, G				Callahan, Gene			HISTORY IS NOT HISTORICISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Nassim Taleb's dismissal of history as based on the "narrative fallacy"-which reads our present knowledge of past events into our reconstruction of the past-is based on a fundamental misconception of what historians actually do. Historians do not, as Taleb presumes, try to infer general, predictive laws from "hard" facts, as do natural scientists; instead their aim is to discover the causes of unique historical facts among antecedent facts. This is no different, in principle, from "narrating" the cause of a supernova by referring to physical causes. The construction of universal historical laws would admittedly be a fool's errand, but that is not the task historians-as opposed to historicists-actually set for themselves.

Noting that defenses based on freedom beg the question, Van Duffel explores whether libertarians can find salvation in the concept of the sovereignty of the will, and concludes that this approach leads to incoherence. But because his arguments ignore the actual moral basis of natural rights, they at best fell a straw man, not libertarianism. They do, however, call into question the viability of the entire moral enterprise.

J	Althaus, SL				Althaus, Scott L.			False starts, dead ends, and new opportunities in public opinion research	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Empirical research on public opinion has tended to misjudge the normative rationales for modern democracy. Although it is often presumed that citizens' policy preferences are the opinions of interest to democratic theorists, and that democracy requires a highly informed citizenry, neither of these premises represents a dominant position in mainstream democratic theory. Besides incorrect assumptions about major tenets of democratic theory, empirical research on civic engagement is running into dead ends that will require normative analysis to overcome. Bringing political philosophy back in to the study of public opinion can not only remedy shortcomings in the empirical literature, but can also underscore how relevant that literature is for a wide range of problems in democratic practice.

J	Garfinkle, N				Garfinkle, Norton			Supply-side vs. demand-side tax cuts and US economic growth, 1951-2004	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Supply-side economists claim that a low top marginal income-tax rate accelerates investment, employment, and economic growth. But the economic literature cited to support the supply-side hypothesis provides little to no empirical support for it. And a more comprehensive empirical examination of key parameters of US. economic performance in the postwar period, undertaken here, shows no association between low top marginal income-tax rates and high real growth in investment, employment, or GDP By contrast, the analysis yields strong evidence for the economic-growth benefits of a "demand-side" approach to taxation policy.				ngarfinkle@omcnyc.com						BUSH GW, 2001, COMMUNICATION   0508; BUSH GW, 2003, COMMUNICATION   0207; BUSH GW, 2001, COMMUNICATION   0301; BUSH GW, 2003, COMMUNICATION   0226; *C BUDG OFF, 2004, EFF FED TAX RAT 1979; *C BUDG OFF, 1988, CHANG DISTR FED TAX; *C BUDG OFF, 2004, FED TAX RAT CURR LAW; Carroll R, 2000, J LABOR ECON, V18, P324, DOI 10.1086/209961; Carroll R., 2000, DOES ATLAS SHRUG EC; CARROLL R, 2001, TAX POLICY EC, V15; *EC POL I, 2001, EC STAT; Engen E, 1996, NATL TAX J, V49, P617; FELDSTEIN M, 1989, WORKING PAPER, V2819; FELDSTEIN M, 1989, TAX POLICY EC, V3; FELDSTEIN MS, 1986, BUDGET DEFICITS TAX; Gale WG, 2002, NATL TAX J, V55, P133, DOI 10.17310/ntj.2002.1.08; GALE WG, 2004, TAX NOTES, V18, P415; HASSETT KA, 2001, TRANSITION COSTS FUN; HUBBARD RG, 2004, WALL STREET J   1109; *INT REV SERV, 2005, SEL RET FORMS FIL BE; ORSZAG PR, 2001, BUSH TAX CUT IS NOW; ROSEN HS, 2004, CASE MAKING TAX CUTS; *TAX POL CTR, 2004, EGTRRA JCWA JGTRRA D; TOBIN J, 2001, CONCISE ENCY EC; TOBIN J, 2001, 1301 YAL U COWL FDN; *US C, 2001, EC OUTL TAX POL; *WHIT HOUS, 2002, EC REP PRES	27	3	3	0	3	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0891-3811	1933-8007		CRIT REV	Crit.

J	Mann, D				Mann, D			The limits of instrumental rationality in social explanation	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The goal of social explanation is to understand human action, both individual and collective. To do so successfully we must explain action on three distinct (but intertwined) levels: the actors' intentions, the meaning that actors and interpreters ascribe to action, and the structural ideals that govern action. Each level of explanation has certain types of rationality associated with it. Only on the level of intentionality does instrumental rationality assume a prime importance, yet even there it must compete with normative and expressive accounts of action.

J	De Long, JB				De Long, JB			It doesn't work	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							BUSINESS-CYCLE; REAL WAGES; MICRO DATA	Vedder and Gallaway are mistaken in their attempted demonstration that government policies to raise veal wages have been the source of most or all US. unemployment in the twentieth century. Their case depends on a presumed correlation between high unemployment and high veal wages that has not existed since World War II, and on a naive confusion between correlation and causation:just because veal wages and unemployment were both relatively high during the Great Depression does not mean that high veal wages were the cause of high unemployment. More likely, the reverse is true. The ascription of high unemployment to higher-than-equilibrium real wages is Mot always in error. But there is no reason whatsoever to believe Vedder and Gallaway's claim that the government's policies to raise wages have been "the major cause of high unemployment in the United States.

J	Borchert, J				Borchert, J			Welfare-state retrenchment: Playing the national card	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	American-Political-Science-Association Meeting	SEP, 1994	NEW YORK, NY	Amer Polit Sci Assoc			DEMOCRACY; POLITICS	An analysis of welfare-state restructuring under conservative governments during the 1980s undermines the notion that the nation-state is being rendered obsolete by economic globalization. The nation-state is still the principal site of political conflict. Yet this conflict has to be analyzed in light of global economic and cultural pressures. Conservative attempts to restructure the welfare state were parallel events within a larger transition in the world economy, but they had decisively distinct national trajectories.

J	Schor, J				Schor, J			What's wrong with consumer capitalism? The Joyless Economy after twenty years	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							ADDICTION	The Joyless Economy seeks to explain the paradox of rising consumption and pervasive dissatifaction, and is thus often cited as a critique of consumer society. Yet it is rather ambivalent as critique. A less ambivalent critique would be predicated on the existence of biases toward private consumption as against public consumption, savings, free time, and the environment. These biases result from two sources: the importance of social comparison and the non-existence of a market in working hours. Because positional competitions occur far more readily around visible private consumer goods, these take a privileged place in expenditures. This process is compounded by the fact that employers systematically deny opportunities to trade income for leisure.

The central place of intentionality in Social life makes both unification and universalism feasible norms in social science. However, ''universalism'' in social science may be partial, in that the independence hypothesis-that the causal mechanism governing action is context independent-may hold only locally in certain classes of choice domains.

J	BLAUG, M				BLAUG, M			HAYEK REVISITED	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								F. A. Hayek's contributions to a variety of disciplines were decisively influenced by his career as an economist, running from early work in capital theory and business cycles to the economics of socialism and neo-Austrian theories of competition. After reviewing his battle with Keynesian economics, this essay examines the socialist calculation debate, which altered Hayek's views of the central task of economics and led to a definite but disguised break with the views of Ludwig von Mises; and discusses the issue of what, if anything, economics can predict, an area Hayek never thoroughly explored. An air of uncertainty therefore continues to hang over many of his fundamental ideas.

J	YEAGER, PC				YEAGER, PC			THE POLITICS OF EFFICIENCIES, THE EFFICIENCIES OF POLITICS - STATES VS MARKETS IN ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							CAPTURE	In The Political Limits of Environmental Regulation: Tracking the Unicorn, Bruce Yandle identifies some of the key weaknesses of federal environmental regulation, including its regressive effects, its tendency to better serve selected political interests than the cause of environmental protection, and the EPA's failure to follow sensible priorities. Additional problems may also be cited, including the tendency to exclude citizens' voices from deliberations regarding the degree of pollution control. But Yandle's conclusion regarding the likely superiority of decentralized and market-sensitive alternatives to centralized regulation is overstated. Any such alternatives necessarily will continue to be grounded in relatively uniform national standards. Moreover, in the context of American political economy, marker-based controls would continue to deny many citizens real voice and choice. The quest continues to be for the combination of controls that best preserves both the environment and liberty.

J	Muller, JW				Mueller, Jan-Werner			Citizens as Militant Democrats, or: Just how Intolerant should the People Be?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						citizens' assemblies; democracy; militant democracy; technocracy	FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS	Militant democracy calls for pre-emptive measures against political actors who use democratic institutions to undermine or outright abolish a democratic political system. Born in the context of interwar fascism, militant democracy has recently been revived by political and legal theorists concerned about the rise of authoritarian right-wing populists. A long-standing charge against militant democracy-also articulated with renewed force in our era-is that, as a top-down way to deal with the intolerant, militant democracy is inherently elitist and bears uncomfortable similarities with technocracy (also understood as an intolerant form of governance). But while it is true that militant democracy relies on state institutions to preserve democracy, it by no means excludes citizen engagement: "courts or the people" is a false choice. On the other hand, citizens engaged in militant democracy must take on the difficult task of distinguishing very clearly between democratic essentials under threat and political questions about which citizens might reasonably disagree. While citizen assemblies are not the answer to all of contemporary democracies' travails, they might be very helpful in clarifying such distinctions for wide audiences.

J	Gillespie, MA				Gillespie, Michael Allen			The Theological Origins and Underpinning of the Longing for Total Revolution	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						determinism; free will; Kant; Hegel; Luther; Marx; Rousseau; Nietzsche; Bernard Yack		The longing for total revolution described in Bernard Yack's seminal book, which he analyzes as an effort to find a place for human freedom and morality in a world governed by natural necessity, can be traced to Reformation debates between predestinarian Calvinists and free-will theologians. These debates were reflected in Kant's efforts to establish the very possibility of freedom and in those of Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. Considered in this light, the longing for total revolution is a yearning not merely to overcome dehumanization but to become something more than human, which must always come up short in the face of human finitude and mortality.

J	Gamble, A				Gamble, Andrew			A NOT QUITE ROBUST ENOUGH POLITICAL ECONOMY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						classical liberalism; Hayek; limited knowledge; Mark Pennington; neoliberalism; robust political economy; spontaneous order		Mark Pennington's Robust Political Economy cogently defends a "classical liberal" position that frankly acknowledges market imperfections and failures. However, Pennington's preoccupation with the comparative advantage of markets over states, in terms of epistemics and incentives, leads him into a cul-de-sac. The comparison rests on a sharp dichotomy between state and market that overlooks the fact that the state is itself a "spontaneous order" that evolved alongside, and codependent with, the market. Thus, Pennington's argument is incoherently conservative in defending whatever exists, which must have evolved -but in excluding the state from this Panglossian vision. Consequently, Pennington continues the unfortunately antipolitical tendencies of modern-day classical liberals, who treat politics as alien territory rather than as the ground on which the form of state and market alike are shaped.

USING POST-STRUCTURALISM TO EXPLORE THE FULL IMPACT OF IDEAS ON POLITICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						neo-institutionalism; discourse; constructivism; agency; ideas; political change; ideational turn	DISCURSIVE INSTITUTIONALISM; COMMUNICATIVE ACTION; DISCOURSE; POLICY; SCIENCE; POWER	Colin Hay's constructivist institutionalism and Vivien A. Schmidt's discursive institutionalism are two recent attempts to theorize ideas as potential explanations of institutional change. This new attention to the causal role of ideas is welcome, but Hay and Schmidt do not take into consideration the constitutive and structural aspects of ideas. Instead they reduce ideas to properties of individual conscious minds, scanting the respects in which ideas are intersubjectively baked into the practices shared by individuals. This aspect of ideasarguably, the institutional side of ideasis developed in post-structuralist thought, which therefore demands a place in ideational research.

J	Brennan, J				Brennan, Jason			HOW SMART IS DEMOCRACY? YOU CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION A PRIORI	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							UNAWARE	Helene Landemore claims that under certain conditions, democracies with universal suffrage will tend to make smarter and better decisions than epistocracies, even though most citizens in modern democracies are extremely ignorant about politics. However, there is ample empirical evidence that citizens make systematic errors. If so, it is fatal to Landemore's defense of democracy, which, if it works at all, applies only to highly idealized situations that are unlikely to occur in the real world. Critics of democracy will find little in Landemore's defense of democracy to make them change their minds.

J	Boettke, PJ; O'Donnell, KW				Boettke, Peter J.; O'Donnell, Kyle W.			THE FAILED APPROPRIATION OF F. A. HAYEK BY FORMALIST ECONOMICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							INFORMATION; EXPECTATIONS; EQUILIBRIUM; UNCERTAINTY; KNOWLEDGE; MARKET	Hayek argued that the central question of economics is the coordination problem: How does the spontaneous interaction of many purposeful individuals, each having dispersed bits of subjective knowledge, generate an order in which the actors' subjective data are coordinated in a way that enables them to dovetail their plans and activities successfully? In attempting to solve this problem, Hayek outlined an approach to economic theorizing that takes seriously the limited, subjective nature of human knowledge. Despite purporting to have appropriated Hayek's thought by acknowledging the information-transmitting role of prices, mainstream economists have missed Hayek's point. The predominant tool of formal economicsequilibrium analysisbegins by assuming the data held by actors to have been pre-reconciled, and so evades the problem to be solved. Even the more advanced tools for modeling knowledge in economic analysis, such as the economics of information, assume away either the subjectivism of knowledge and expectations (rendering the coordination of beliefs and plans a trivial matter) or the frictions and imperfections of reality (rendering the coordination problem indeterminate).

J	Chambers, S				Chambers, Simone			THE MANY FACES OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Diana Mutz's individual-level data show that participation and deliberation are often inversely related. This, according to Mutz, undermines many claims made by deliberative-democratic theory. However, a systemic approach to deliberative democracy challenges the significance of this finding. Although it is true that some citizens are political activists not open to hearing the other side and other citizens are less active but more open minded, both types of citizens make equally important and positive contributions to deliberative politics when it is viewed as a system that deploys a division of labor.

J	Quirk, PJ				Quirk, Paul J.			THE TROUBLE WITH EXPERTS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In his justly celebrated Expert Political Judgment, Philip E. Tetlock evaluates the judgment of economic and political experts by rigorously testing their ability to make accurate predictions. He finds that ability profoundly limited, implying that expert judgment is virtually useless, if not worse. He concludes by proposing a project that would seek to improve experts' performance by holding them publicly accountable for their claims. But Tetlock's methods severely underestimate the value of expert opinion. Despite their notorious disagreements, experts have highly pertinent information and advice in many areas of public policy. The main problem with experts is that political actors seize on their most extreme views in one direction or the other, and overlook their areas of general agreement and the core of relatively reliable information that they provide.

J	Lukitz, L				Lukitz, Liora			NATIONALISM IN POST-IMPERIAL IRAQ: THE COMPLEXITIES OF COLLECTIVE IDENTITY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Nationalism developed in Iraq before the creation of the modern state. As elsewhere, the basic European idea of modern nationalism took root quickly and widely, but it took the form of Arab/Iraqi nationalism and Kurdish proto-nationalism in the first decade of state formation. Shi'i, Sunni, and leftist/liberal variants of nationalism evolved in the decades that followedbut all were forms of Iraqi nationalism, in which the legitimacy of the Iraqi state was taken for granted. Those who assumed that religious differences would be fatal to the viability of the Iraqi state have overlooked the evolution of Iraqis' senses of identity, and the power of nationalist identification.

J	Benthall, S				Benthall, Sebastian			Kudos for, the mindless expert	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							HINDSIGHT	Arguments for skepticism about political expertise abound. The skeptics believe that political matters are too unpredictable, experts too dogmatic, social science too imprecise, or the electorate too blind to justify hopefulness about the results of real-world democracy. Philip Tetlock's empirical research suggests, however, that there is some regularity to the political world, and that while most political experts have a poor grasp of it, some (Isaiah Berlin's 'foxes") do better than others (his "hedgehogs"). And Tetlock's research suggests that our political judgments can be improved if we trust more in mechanical, statistical prediction, which outperforms even 'fox-like" experts.

J	Wisniewski, C				Wisniewski, Chris			Political culture vs. cultural studies: Reply to Fenster	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							PUBLIC IGNORANCE; EDELMAN,MURRAY; IDEOLOGY	A review of two of the strands of cultural studies that Mark Fenster contends are superior to Murray Edelman's analysis of mass public opinion-Gramsci's theory of hegemony, and Bourdieu's sociology-and a more general look at work in the field of cultural studies suggests that all of these alternatives suffer from severe theoretical and methodological limitations. Future studies of culture and politics need to pose questions similar to the ones that preoccupied Edelman, but they must move beyond the political and interpretive biases that have dominated cultural studies (some of which Edelman shared), as well as the questionable view of "ideoloqy" as a matter of elite domination of the masses, rather than as a mediating, constitutive force in the process of individual opinion formation.				wisniews19@gmail.com						Althusser Louis., 2001, LENIN PHILOS OTHER E; Ang I, 1991, DESPERATELY SEEKING; Bennett EJ, 2005, MOL CELL, V17, P351, DOI 10.1016/j.molcel.2004.12.021; Bourdieu P., 1977, OUTLINE THEORY PRACT, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511812507; Bourdieu P., 2004, SCI SCI REFLEXIVITY; Converse PE, 2006, CRIT REV, V18, P1, DOI 10.1080/08913810608443650; Converse Philip E., 1986, POLITICAL REPRESENTA; DEAN J, 2002, PUBLICITY SECRET; DeCanio S, 2005, CRIT REV, V17, P339; Denning Michael, 2004, CULTURE AGE 3 WORLDS; EDELMAN M, 2001, POLITICAL MISINFORMA; Edelman M., 1977, POLITICAL LANGUAGE W; Edelman M., 1971, POLITICS SYMBOLIC AC; Edelman Murray J., 1988, CONSTRUCTING POLITIC; Edelman MurrayJacob., 1964, SYMBOLIC USES POLITI; Fenster M., 2008, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, V(2nd); Fenster M, 2005, CRIT REV, V17, P367; Friedman J, 1998, CRIT REV, V12, P397, DOI 10.1080/08913819808443510; Gamson William A., 1992, FRONTIERS SOCIAL MOV; Geertz David E., 1964, IDEOLOGY DISCONTENT; Gramsci A., 1999, SELECTIONS PRISON NO; Hall S., 1980, CULTURE MEDIA LANGUA; Hall Stuart, 1982, CULTURE SOC MEDIA; iek S., 1989, SUBLIME OBJECT IDEOL; Knight Peter., 2001, CONSPIRACY CULTURE K; Lippmann Walter, 1949, PUBLIC OPINION; Niemi A, 2003, CRIT REV, V15, P435, DOI 10.1080/08913810308443592; Turow Joseph., 1997, MEDIA SYSTEMS SOC	28	4	4	0	3	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND	0891-3811			CRIT REV	Crit.

J	Boettke, PJ; Leeson, PT				Boettke, PJ; Leeson, PT			Still impossible after all these years: Reply to Caplan	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Socialism is strictly "impossible." Its impracticability is not, as Bryan Caplan has suggested, a "quantitative" matter, nor does he show that real-world socialism's incentive problems outweighed its informational ones. Caplan's criticism of Ludwig von Mises's critique of the "ossibility" of socialism fails to appreciate what he meant by "socialism" and misunderstands Mises's argument about economic calculation. History, too, suggests that socialism's informational deficiency was the most significant problem facing those who tried to implement socialism.

J	diZerega, G				diZerega, G			Scale and magnanimity in civic liberalism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Thomas Spragens attempts to rebuild liberal theory by arguing that realist, libertarian, egalitarian, and identity liberals all have valid insights, but develop them one-sidedly, Re-examining the work of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century liberals leads, he contends, to a more balanced liberalism. Spragens's often-impressive effort to reconstruct liberalism is undermined by insufficient appreciation of the role of the scale of the polity and by confusions about civic friendship.

J	Rosser, JB				Rosser, JB			Risk and Austrian business-cycle theory: Rejoinder to Cowen	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Cowen and I agree that rational-expectations theory is unrealistic and that risk is difficult to quantify. However, we continue to disagree about the riskiness of consumption as opposed to investment. Since more investment might lead to a recession if investment is relatively risky, Cowen's use of rational-expectations theory to buttress the Austrian school's claim that market economies can shift toward relatively more investment without experiencing macroeconomic disruption remains suspect.

Rejoinder to Viroli	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Viroli is right to draw a distinction between republican patriotism and nationalism. But in arguing that the former can correct the problems associated with the latter, he places too much trust in the descriptions of patriotism offered by republican theorists. In practice, republican patriotism has been almost as fierce and hostile to outsiders as nationalism. Patriotism might make us better citizens, but it will not make the would a move peaceful or generous place.

Wittman's Myth of Democratic Failure attempts to show that government is move rational than is often believed. For instance, Wittman argues that voters ave tolerably well informed and that politicians are responsive to the voters' will. Unfortunately, Wittman's argument proceeds at the level of economic theory which is often contradicted by empirical reality (and by non-economic theories that take account of political reality). It is no better to defend democracy on a priori grounds, as Wittman does, than to attack it on those grounds, as other economists who turn to the analysis of politics tend to do.

His assertion that we have the direction of causation reversed collapses in light of the lag between artificially high wages and unemployment. Nor are his claims about the nature of cyclical movements in productivity and veal wages consistent with the data. Finally, his contention that the model we present does not work in the post- World War II era is, at best, misleading. The evidence shows with remarkable consistency that government attempts to prop trp wages have caused twentieth-century increases in U.S. employment.

J	Williams, J				Williams, J			On the road again: Hayek and the rule of law	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							DEMOCRACY	In his political writings, F. A. Hayek faces a classic liberal dilemma: he opposes coercion but recognizes that sometimes the state can help to minimize it. Hayek attempts to resolve the dilemma of the limits of state power by offering a definition of the rule of law that does not depend on a controversial conception of rights. However, his effort to formalize the rule of law fails. Not only does Hayek implicitly rely on an undefended theory of rights, but his rule-of-law scheme is limited to the elaboration of general principles of good government, neglecting the need for reforms aimed directly at the political processes that result in the controversial forms of coercion he deplores.

J	Boyd, R				Boyd, R			Frank H. Knight and ethical pluralism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								For Frank Knight, the fact that we are free to engage in economic pursuits brings out what is both best and worst in human nature. The same competitive economy that liberates individuals to choose their own desired ends also provides them with socially undesirable wants and fosters habits potentially at odds with the demands of liberal democracy Given Knight's desire both to defend human liberty and his concession that liberty is likely to be abused his version of liberalism must of necessity be anticonsequentialist. Paradoxically, Knight's philosophical pluralism-his insistence that there ave any number of incommensurable perspectives on the good or just society-underlies both his criticism of the "ethical" possibilities of the competitive order and his defense of human liberty against the dangers of social planning.

CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Conceptions of self-management and the labor managed from (LMF) have nor been well received by economists. They have, however proved to be a continuing (though minority) interest in the socialist movement from Mane onwards. Prychitko claims that by examining the humanist side of Marx, a socialist care can be made both for the LMF and markets in a postmodern world. Such a case rests upon an assumption that self-management confers competitive advantage by enhancing information sharing (increasingly important in postmodern conditions). The case, though interesting, is not yet made.			Abell, P (corresponding author), UNIV LONDON LONDON SCH ECON & POLIT SCI,INTERDISCIPLINARY INST MANAGEMENT,HOUGHTON ST,LONDON WC2A 2AE,ENGLAND.

J	FRIEDMAN, J				FRIEDMAN, J			CULTURAL THEORY AS INDIVIDUALISTIC IDEOLOGY - REJOINDER	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								How can one examine the sources of people's beliefs, tastes, and preferences without falling into the self-refuting determinism that has so often characterized the most systematic theory of preferences, Marxism? Cultural Theory's attempt to do so posits five anthropologically derived, competing ''ways of life'' - individualism, egalitarianism, hierarchism, fatalism, and withdrawal from social life - that are intended to apply to all forms of culture and, therefore, to provide a universal framework for explaining people's preferential biases. Richard Ellis's defense of Cultural Theory, however, does not adequately address the concerns expressed in my critique of it. Ellis fails to instance a single case of a premodern culture containing the five ways of life; he does not show that exclusivist premodern versions of ''individualism'' and ''egalitarianism'' are more than superficially comparable to the inclusive modern variants of these alleged universals; and he adds new evidence to support my claim that in modern societies, people's preferences are largely unlinked to the particular social relations identified by Cultural Theory. While Ellis overtly denies that Cultural Theory is deterministic, his search for links between preferences and social relations shows that this denial cannot be sustained. Cultural Theory's reductionism stems from its neglect of historically contingent cultural traditions that thwart a priori attempts to predict culture. This ahistoricism transforms a myopic view of American politics as a battle of egalitarianism against individualism into a timeless truth, providing ideological self-affirmation for ''individualists'' but diminishing the prospects for being able to explain or criticize individualism - or any other political preference.

CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						apocalyptic ideas; ISIS; Islam; religious ideas; religious violence; terrorism		Social science seldom takes religion seriously. Graeme Wood shows the folly of this neglect in The Way of the Strangers, his portrayal of the apocalyptic religious ideas held by some of the most ardent ISIS followers. The actions and devotion of members of the Islamic State cannot be understood without grasping what Wood is telling us. Still, a central question remains: Do these religious ideas inevitably lead to violence? Here the jury is still out, since a focus solely on religion, without the socio-political context, can give a skewed perspective on the motives of this violent politico-religious movement.

J	Thomas, G				Thomas, George			Can Liberal Democracy Survive Capitalism?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						bourgeois democracy; commercial republic; James Madison; Karl Marx; Joseph Schumpeter		Joseph Schumpeter's Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy captures the unique blend of politics and economics, along with a particular culture and civil society, that are characteristic of liberal democracy. Commercial and economic activity have been so crucial to liberal democracy that it has often been characterized as commercial republicanism, and Schumpeter referred to it with justification as bourgeois democracy. Schumpeter's view, which is too often characterized as simply elitist, can be situated in the realist tradition, offering a helpful corrective to simplistic understandings of democracy, such as populist understandings, that are at odds with the promise of liberal democracy. Yet while Schumpeter thought that capitalism would collapse under its own contradictions, and wondered if democracy could survive without it, today global capitalism looks unstoppable. It is bourgeois democracy that looks fragile, not because of the collapse of capitalism, as Schumpeter predicted, but because of its success. Can liberal democracy surive if global capitalism undermines the middle class on which it depends?

However, after almost a decade, we know enough to discard much of what has, in the meantime, become folk wisdom about the causes of the debacle, including Wall Street bonus culture, bankers' greed, the moral hazard of "too big to fail," government intervention ("too much government") and deregulation (" not enough government"). While each of these factors may have played some role, the crisis can be much more accurately described as one of ignorance than malevolence. The common thread tying the emergence of the bubble to the disastrous consequences of its bursting is the misunderstanding of correlation and causation links in three key domains: economic policy, financial modeling, and the regulatory framework. These misunderstandings helped fuel the housing bubble and introduced fragility into the system, making it vulnerable to the bubble's subsequent, unavoidable burst.

J	Gunn, P				Gunn, Paul			GETTING DEMOCRATIC PRIORITIES STRAIGHT: PRAGMATISM, DIVERSITY, AND THE ROLE OF BELIEFS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						deliberative democracy; interpretivism; James Johnson; Jack Knight; political epistemology; pragmatism	POLITICS; SYSTEMS	Jack Knight and James Johnson argue in The Priority of Democracy that democracy should be theorized and justified pragmatically: Democratic deliberations should be given a central coordinating role in society not because they realize any particular abstract ideal, but because they would elicit the information needed to solve real-world problems. However, Knight and Johnson rely on a naive economic understanding of knowledge that assumes implausibly that individuals know what they need to know and need only aggregate thier separate beliefs. It is precisely because we may not know what we need to know that we need to continually test our ideas. Contra Knight and Johnson, moreover, we ought to accept that our ability to interpret social experiments properly is questionable. A pragmatic approach to social inquiry, therefore, ought to investigate what beliefs political actors actually bring to collective decisions rather than how theoretically perfect beliefs ought to be elicited and aggregated.

J	Levinson, S				Levinson, Sanford			A WELCOME DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Against critics of capacious notions of democratic rule by "the many," Helene Landemore vigorously defends what she calls " democratic reason" because of the epistemic value of active deliberation by diverse groups of people. Deliberation is necessary to overcome isolated reasoning (where one might prefer an educated "expert" over an "average" citizen), and diversity is necessary to overcome the potential echo chamber created by conversations in a (non-diverse) group of " the best and the brightest." The best way to create optimal democratic rule may involve greater reliance on random selection of decision-making bodies than on standard-model elections.

J	Muirhead, R				Muirhead, Russell			THE POLITICS OF GETTING IT RIGHT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Helene Landemore's Democratic Reason marks a crucial achievement in democratic theory, as it successfully shows that democracy is about more than procedural legitimacy-and that it should be. Nonetheless, the procedural argument remains at the heart of the case for democracy. For many democratic decisions, getting the right answer is not what we ask of political institutions. Politics is often about defining what counts as a problem, and no single definition counts as the right one. Furthermore, the epistemic claim that democracy is likely to get moral questions right can obscure the difficulty of getting moral questions exactly "right." The best political approach to controversial questions is often to strike a balance of competing claims, and every actual democracy does this in ways that leave many citizens dissatisfied. This is why many citizens participate in democratic politics as partisans: they put more trust in their party than in the democratic regime to get it right. Partisanship fuels the never-ending democratic contest over what it means to get it right in politics, but it is also appropriately epistemic, in that it is prompted by the never-ending possibility that even democracy will get things wrong.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			HAYEK'S TWO EPISTEMOLOGIES AND THE PARADOXES OF HIS THOUGHT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Editorial Material								Hayek developed two contradictory epistemologies. The epistemology for which he is famous attributed dispersed knowledge to economic actors and credited the price system for aggregating and communicating this knowledge. The other epistemology attributed to human and non-human organisms alike the error-prone interpretation of stimuli, which could never truly be said to be knowledge. Several of the paradoxes of Hayek's economic and political thought that are explored in this symposium can be explained by the triumph of the first epistemology over the second, including his historical interpretation of socialism as a planning mentality; his tendentious definitions of liberty and justice; and his opposition to economic redistribution even as he endorsed all manner of economic and social regulations.

J	Gamble, A				Gamble, Andrew			HAYEK AND LIBERTY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Hayek's political theory is directed against coercion, which he defines as the intentional control of one person by another. The element of personal intention ensures a clear conceptual distinction between the freedom from coercioni.e., the libertythat is exercised in the private sphere, and the freedom of choice and opportunity that may be severely constrained by the impersonal, unintentional operation of market forces. Hayek's narrow definitions of coercion and liberty therefore suggest that he was more intent on defending the benefits conferred on us by market forces than on affirming any value intrinsic in freedoma suggestion confirmed by his lack of interest in species of freedom, such as autonomy, that might conceivably be fostered by state coercion. Hayek's consequentialist defense of liberty, however, was grounded in economic doctrines such as his own view that prices served a vital epistemic function. Given his strictures against the ignorance of modern electorates, Hayek was driven to propose extravagant limits on democracy and to embrace traditionalism; a different Hayekianism might limit inequalities of wealth and encourage the ability to learn from experimentation.

J	DeHart, PR				DeHart, Paul R.			LEVIATHAN LEASHED: THE INCOHERENCE OF ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGN POWER	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Early modern theorists linked the idea of sovereign power to a conception of absolute power developed during the medieval period. Ockham had reframed the already extant distinction between God's absolute and ordained powers in order to argue that God was free of moral constraint in ordaining natural law for human beings. Thus, the natural law could command the opposite of what God had ordained if He wished to make it so. Bodin extended Ockham's argument to earthly sovereigns, who do not (he argued) have to obey civil law. However, Bodin undermined his absolutism by maintaining that civil law has to be consistent with natural and divine law. Hobbes more consistently argued that while mortal sovereigns are accountable to God, the power of sovereigns to command is not subject to moral constraints. Underlying Ockham's view of God's sovereignty, and Bodin's and Hobbes's view of earthly sovereigns, is a notion of the will's unconstrained power. But this notion is self-referentially incoherent. This incoherence, in turn, infects the very notion of sovereignty.

J	Stiglitz, JE				Stiglitz, Joseph E.			THE ANATOMY OF A MURDER: WHO KILLED AMERICA'S ECONOMY?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The main cause of the crisis was the behavior of the bankslargely a result of misguided incentives unrestrained by good regulation. Conservative ideology, along with unrealistic economic models of perfect information, perfect competition, and perfect markets, fostered lax regulation, and campaign contributions helped the political process along. The banks misjudged risk, wildly overleveraged, and paid their executives handsomely for being short-sighted; lax regulation let them get away with itputting at risk the entire economy. The mortgage brokers neglected due diligence, since they would not bear the risk of default once their mortgages had been securitized and sold to others. Others can be blamed: the ratings agencies that judged subprime securities as investment grade; the Fed, which contributed low interest rates; the Bush administration, whose Iraq war and tax cuts for the rich made low interest rates necessary. But low interest rates can be a boon; it was the financial institutions that turned them into a bust.

J	Taylor, JB				Taylor, John B.			ECONOMIC POLICY AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF WHAT WENT WRONG	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The financial crisis was in large part caused, prolonged, and worsened by a series of government actions and interventions. The housing boom and bust that precipitated the crisis were enabled by extraordinarily loose monetary policy. After the housing boom came to an end, the Federal Reserve misdiagnosed financial markets' uncertainty about the location and value of risky subprime mortgage-backed securities as being, instead, a liquidity problem, and it took inappropriate compensatory actions that had side effects that included raising the price of oil. Finally, in mid-September 2008, the government's ad-hoc bailouts, and the unpredictable terms of the proposed tarp legislation, appear to have caused a sharp spike in uncertainty in the financial markets.

Partisan disagreement as a challenge to democratic competence	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review							PARTY POLARIZATION; ATTITUDE POLARIZATION; MOTIVATED SKEPTICISM; BELIEF SYSTEMS; HOT COGNITION; POLITICS; IGNORANCE; KNOWLEDGE	The partisan and ideological polarization of American politics since the 1970s appears to have affected pubic opinion in striking ways. The American public has become increasingly partisan and ideological along liberal-conservative lines on a wide range of issues, including even foreign policy. This has raised questions about how rational the public is, in the broad sense of the public's responsiveness to objective conditions. Widespread partisan disagreements over what those conditions arei.e., disagreements about the factssuggest that large proportions of the public may be perceiving the facts incorrectly. The facts in question are important enough that these partisan disagreements may translate into sub-optimal policy preferences and electoral decisions.

J	Laracey, M				Laracey, Mel			Presidents' party affiliations and their communication strategies	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								More than half of all pre-twentieth century presidents communicated with the public on policy matters. Some gave speeches or wrote public letters and messages, while others utilized the facade of a presidential newspaper. The partisan affiliations of the presidents who communicated with the public suggest that even before the full articulation of the concept of the "rhetorical" presidency by Woodrow Wilson, there was underlying disagreement among American political leaders about the proper role of the public in influencing public policy-and of the role of the president in influencing public opinion.

J	Caplan, B				Caplan, B			Toward a new consensus on the economics of socialism: Rejoinder to my critics	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								This has been an unusually productive exchange. My critics largely accept my main theoretical claims about economic calculation and socialism. They have also started to do what advocates of the Misesian view should have been doing for decades: offer empirical evidence that that the calculation problem is serious. While I continue to believe that incentive problems explain most of the failures of socialism, I am slightly less confident than I was before. Fortunately, there are many unexploited sources of information to help resolve the issue.

J	Somin, I				Somin, I			Democracy and voter ignorance revisited: Rejoinder to Ciepley	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Democratic control of public policy is nearly impossible in the presence of extreme voter ignorance, and this ignorance is in part caused by the vast size and scope of modern government. Only a government limited in its scope can be meaningfully democratic. David Ciepley's response to my article does not seriously challenge this conclusion, and his attempts to show that limited government is inherently undemocratic fail. Ciepley's alternative vision Of a "democracy" that does not require informed voters turns out to be not a defense of democracy at all, but a rationalization for any form of government that achieves a high level of leadership skill and bureaucratic efficiency.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, J			The libertarian straddle: Rejoinder to Palmer and Sciabarra	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							FRIEDMAN	Palmer's defense of libertarianism as consequentialist runs afoul of his own failure to provide any consequentialist reasons for libertarian conclusions and of his own defense of nonconsequentialist arguments for the intrinsic value of capitalism-cum-negative freedom. As such, Palmer's article exemplifies the parasitic codependency of consequentialist and nonconsequentialist reasoning in libertarian thought. Sciabarra's defense of Ayn Rand's libertarianism is even move problematic, because in addition to the usual defects of libertarianism, Rand adds a commitment to ethical egoism that contradicts both her concern for the consequences of capitalism and her commitment to the rights of everyone, not just herself.

J	diZerega, G				diZerega, G			Market non-neutrality: Systemic bias in spontaneous orders	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The market is sometimes thought to be a largely neutral means for coordinating cooperation among strangers under complex conditions because it is, as Hayek noted, a ''spontaneous order'' But in fact the market actively shapes the kinds of values it rewards, as do other spontaneous orders. Recognizing these biases allows us to see how such orders impinge on one another and on other communities basic to human life, sometimes negatively. In this way we may come to acknowledge the inevitability of placing limits on spontaneous orders.

J	de Waal, A				de Waal, A			Group identity, rationality, and the state	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The rational choice approach to the understanding of group identity and conflict tends to overlook the extent to which groups are mutable, and the element of design by group leaders (especially those wielding state power) in the definition of group identity and the shaping of rationality. The 1994 genocide of the Rwandese Tutsis was the outcome of an extreme case of planning ethnic and ideological engineering. To see such phenomena as instances of "rational self-interest" stretches that concept beyond its breaking point.			de Waal, A (corresponding author), 11 Marshalsea Rd, London SE1 1EP, England.

Those dangers clearly mark ethnic and cultural conflicts, so the liberalism of fear is an especially appropriate political ethic for an age marked by such conflicts, A multiculturalism of fear keeps its attention on those central political dangers while also noting that some kinds of cruelty and humiliation might not be appreciated without reference to the larger ethnic and cultural context, and that treating ethnicity and culture as completely outside of politics is not the best way to prevent cruelty.

J	HORNE, TA				HORNE, TA			LIBERALISM AND THE PROBLEM OF POVERTY - A REPLY TO ASHCRAFT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In Property Rights and Poverty, I argued that seventeenth- to mid-nineteenth-century liberal theories of the natural right to property included both the ability to exclude others from resources lawfully acquired and the ability to claim as property the resources necessary for life and livelihood. Virtually every defense of the right to exclude written during this period carried limits which allowed and even required the government to enforce the rights of those without resources to the property of others. But although Locke, among others, was a theorist of welfare rights, it is a mistake to describe him as a radical, as Richard Ashcraft does, which identifies Locke's purposes too closely with the legitimately radical theorists of the early nineteenth century who were deeply influenced by his work.

J	Friedman, S				Friedman, Shterna			German Idealism and Tragic Maturity	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						enlightenment; maturity; moralization; totality; tragedy; Isaiah Berlin; Kant; Hegel; Schelling		Isaiah Berlin viewed value conflict as tragic, as it requires the sacrifice of some values for others. It is a mark of maturity, he thought, to accept this tragic truth. This view raises certain conceptual problems that can be attributed to Berlin's subtle departures from the German authors (Kant, Schelling, and Hegel) who originated the doctrine of tragic maturity-figures who had, in turn, transformed the earlier idea that enlightenment is a natural and morally neutral process of maturation. Kant moralized the notion of enlightened maturation by portraying it as contingent on our courage to bring it about, such that we are responsible if we remain immature. This theory of maturity rested on the idea, which would have been uncongenial to Berlin, that we are intelligible creatures inhabiting the noumenal realm, duty bound to exercise moral freedom, even though this duty surpasses our ability to carry it out, as we also inhabit the phenomenal realm, where our natural inclinations tend to make us resist laboring to fulfill our duties. However, according to Kant, the metaphysical limitations we face as individuals can be transcended to an extent, allowing us to make moral progress as a species-so long as we do not lazily persist in our immaturity. Schelling built upon Kant's notion of freedom to bring out the tragic and heroic dimension of individual moral life, where the tragedy is our doomed but noble struggle to exert moral freedom in a world of natural necessity. Hegel turned these metaphysical notions in a more recognizably Berlinian direction by extending Schelling's account of tragic conflict to conflicts of values. But he identified the ultimate tragic hero as an ethical totality that enacts eternal justice by reconciling such conflicts, while Berlin attempted to repudiate both the notion of a historical totality and the possibility of reconciliation on empirical grounds, even though these are metaphysical claims. Thus, Berlin asserted the absolute, trans-historical necessity of tragic value conflict, while the evidence for this assertion was merely his personal conviction that in his particular time and place, specific values were, as a matter of empirical fact, tragically irreconcilable. In this manner he illicitly portrayed Cold War value pluralists (such as himself) as courageously accepting the tragic inevitability of value conflict, while Marxists, the legatees of Hegel and thus German Idealism, immaturely shrank from this reality by embracing the fantasy of total reconciliation.

J	Accetti, CI				Accetti, Carlo Invernizzi			Repoliticizing Environmentalism: Beyond Technocracy and Populism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						contestability; democracy; global warming; populism; technocracy; types of environmentalism		The mainstreaming of environmental concerns paradoxically obscures their political dimension: as the goals of environmentalism become accepted, they are reduced to administrative problems to be solved in a purely technocratic way. This technocratic environmentalism has fueled a populist backlash that challenges the scientific basis of environmentalism. As a result, contemporary environmentalism appears to be stuck in a depoliticizing opposition between technocracy and populism. A possible way out of this depoliticizing trap consists in recognizing the intrinsic contestability of the core premises on which environmentalism is based, since it is not merely the result of a straightforward application of scientifically provable facts, but also depends on normative principles and value choices. This opens the possibility for an internal pluralization of environmentalism, which shifts emphasis from the depoliticizing struggle between technocratic environmentalism and populist anti-environmentalism to the inherently political rivalry between different types of environmentalism.

A Family Affair: Populism, Technocracy, and Political Epistemology	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						populism; technocracy; democracy; democratic theory; bad intentions; na&#239; ve technocratic realism; citizen-technocrats; participation; political epistemology	LEADERS	Jeffrey Friedman's Power Without Knowledge provides not only a critique of technocracy but a compelling story about the intimate relationship between three of today's most important political phenomena: populism, technocracy, and democracy. In contrast to many recent accounts that treat populism as a backlash against technocracy, Friedman's theory suggests that populism is a lineal descendent of technocracy, with which it shares substantial intellectual DNA. Friedman's implicit theory of populism helps to explain many of its core features, including its political stances, emotionality, and hostility to mediating institutions, in interpretively charitable ways. Central to Friedman's analysis is the importance of political epistemology, which supplies key connective tissue between the three phenomena. The relations between technocracy, democracy, and populism revealed by Friedman's theory generate both enlightening and disturbing implications for democratic theory.

J	Hay, C; Benoit, C				Hay, Colin; Benoit, Cyril			Brexit, Positional Populism, and the Declining Appeal of Valence Politics	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Brexit; populism; valence politics; valence issues; positional politics; positional issues; positional populism; post-neoliberalism; political economy; public opinion	PARTY; NATIONALISM; REFERENDUM; BRITAIN; VOTE	A factor that may account for the largely unanticipated victory of Brexit in 2016 is the difference in engagement, mobilization, and, ultimately, turnout between those for whom the question of Brexit was a valence issue (a dry and almost technical question of determining the policies by which uncontroversial shared ends can be achieved) and those for whom it was a positional issue (a question of raw, almost visceral, political preference). The declining appeal of valence politics may reveal a phenomenon that goes beyond Brexit and Britain: a change in the nature and character of contemporary electoral competition that may help to explain the newly resurgent populism characteristic of Western liberal democracies.

J	DeCanio, SJ				DeCanio, Stephen J.			What Is It Like to Be a Social Scientist?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Copenhagen interpretation; epistemology; free will; intentionality; ontology; physicalism; quantum mechanics; randomness; Alexander Wendt	QUANTUM PHYSICS; C-60	Alexander Wendt's Quantum Mind and Social Science is an effort to establish foundations of social science based on the ontology of modern physics. The quantum revolution has deservedly had repercussions in many sciences, but it is unwise to ground social science on physical theories, which are subject to constant revision. Additionally, despite its empirical success, there is no agreed-upon interpretation of quantum theory. Finally, even if there were, the random indeterminacy intrinsic to the quantum world cannot account for the intentionality of human action. Intentional agents act for reasons, not at random; nor are the reasons chosen at random.

J	Burnett, CM				Burnett, Craig M.			RECONSIDERING THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY OF "POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE"	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						construct validity; political knowledge; public ignorance; voter competence	INFORMATION; IGNORANCE; ELECTIONS	Current measures of political knowledge have limited construct validity, severely restricting our ability to draw from them either empirical or normative conclusions about the public's level of political knowledge. Using a unique survey, I show that respondents' level of political knowledge relative to their knowledge of other subjects is very sensitive to question choice. Indeed, an individual researcher's selection of questions will change the normative implications of the results. The lack of construct validity for measures of political knowledge-one of the foundational pillars of research on political behavior-suggests a desperate need for new, reliable measures of knowledge that fairly assess voter knowledge and, by extension, competence.

J	Maskivker, J				Maskivker, Julia			An Epistemic Justification for the Obligation to Vote	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Condorcet jury theorem; duty to vote; miracle of aggregation; rational ignorance; rational irrationality	POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE; IGNORANCE; DEMOCRACY; VOLUME	Received wisdom in most democracies is that voting should be seen as a political freedom that citizens have a right to exercise at their discretion. But I propose that we have a duty to vote, albeit a duty to vote well: with knowledge and a sense of impartiality. Fulfillment of this obligation would contribute to the epistemic advantages of democracy, and would thereby instantiate the duty to promote and support just institutions.

J	Moore, A				Moore, Alfred			DEMOCRATIC REASON, DEMOCRATIC FAITH, AND THE PROBLEM OF EXPERTISE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Helene Landemore's Democratic Reason develops one important line of research in political epistemology, which we can define as the study of the ways in which distributed knowledge is put together for the purposes of making political decisions. Landemore argues for the epistemic benefits of cognitive diversity in political decision procedures in a condition of epistemic equality-where there are no experts. Given this omission, her approach has undeveloped potential for a second line of research in political epistemology, on the problem of aggregating asymmetrically distributed knowledge, i.e., integrating democratic reason with expertise.

J	Kruglanski, AW; Boyatzi, LM				Kruglanski, Arie W.; Boyatzi, Lauren M.			THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CLOSED AND OPEN MINDEDNESS, RATIONALITY, AND DEMOCRACY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							MOTIVATED SOCIAL COGNITION; BOUNDED RATIONALITY; DECISION-MAKING; LINEAR-MODELS; JUDGMENT; CLOSURE; NEED; PERCEPTION; ACCURACY; STEREOTYPES	Charles Taber and Milton Lodge provide compelling evidence that people's minds may be closed to information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs. This type of inconsistency has often been termed "irrational." However, recent research suggests that being open or closed minded is not an unchanging variable but depends on one's goals, including one's need for closure, which vary from person to person and situation to situation. In this vein, as Taber and Lodge suggest, those who have more political information may, after having been open minded enough to acquire the information, become closed minded by virtue of having acquired it. At the same time, being more open minded to inaccurate information might lead one in the wrong direction; hence, open mindedness does not necessarily enhance the accuracy of one's judgments or the quality of one's decisions. We may need to rethink the concept of an enlightened, well-informed electorate, to the extent that it assumes the unqualified benefits of open mindedness.

J	Sanandaji, T				Sanandaji, Tino			POVERTY AND CAUSALITY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								David Brady argues that low European poverty rates are a result of the welfare state. His finding relies on a relative measure of poverty, according to which the threshold for being poor differs across countries. Using the American poverty threshold as a fixed measure, though, Western Europe has a poverty rate of 18 percent, higher than that of the United States. Moreover, Brady's thesis that welfare-state spending explains cross-country differences in inequality does not take account of the problem of reverse causality. Historically, welfare states developed in homogeneous nations that started out with higher levels of social capital and lower inequality. Scandinavia, for example, had unusually low poverty rates a century ago, and even today Americans with Scandinavian ancestry exhibit a poverty rate no higher than that in Scandinavia. Since poverty, social capital, population homogeneity, and the size of the welfare state relate in multiple ways to each other, we cannot rely on cross-country correlations to isolate the causal effect of the welfare state on poverty rates.

J	Collier, CW				Collier, Charles W.			AN INEFFICIENT TRUTH	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							MARKET; RISK	The Efficient Market Hypothesis often seems to suggest only that most people cannot outguess the financial markets. But the originator of the hypothesis, Eugene Fama, made the stronger claim that people cannot outguess the financial markets because financial-market prices are correct: They incorporate all known information accurately. This view omits the role that human traders' interpretations of information must play if the information is to prompt them to buy or sell. Buyers and sellers disagree about the meaning of current information, so at least half of them must be wrong. Bringing in many more (but equally fallible) people to predict the future does not somehow make their (collective) answer oright.o This is a logical disproof of the Fama hypothesis, but the inherently speculative nature of financial markets makes its empirical falsification (or verification) ambiguous if not impossible. The hypothesis must therefore be considered an unscientific article of faith.

J	Jacquette, D				Jacquette, Dale			A NOTE ON EPISTEMIC NAIVETE IN MARX AND ENGELS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Marx and Engels argue that capitalism must ultimately destroy itself because it contains an internal contradiction: Capitalism requires wage laborers at first to be in competitive isolation from one another, lest their common interests become transparent and they unite collectively to improve their employment conditions. At a certain later stage of capitalism's historical development, however, competition eventually forces capitalists to bring their workers together in common workplaces (factories), where their shared interests can be immediately perceived and mutual grievances directly communicated. The Communist Manifesto's argument for the inevitable downfall of capitalism is epistemically naive in several ways, resting as it does on the idea that material interests are perceivable, and that an awareness of common problems translates automatically into a sense of shared interests powerful enough to motivate coordinated action for the sake of achieving economic-political reform.

J	Bendor, J; Bullock, JG				Bendor, Jonathan; Bullock, John G.			Lethal incompetence: Voters, officials, and systems	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							CORRELATED VOTES; JURY THEOREM; INFORMATION; DELEGATION; IGNORANCE	The study of voter competence has made significant contributions to our understanding of politics, but at this point there are diminishing returns to the endeavor. There is little reason, in theory or in practice, to expect voter competence to improve dramatically enough to make much of a difference, but there is reason to think that officials' competence can vary enough to make large differences. To understand variations in government performance, therefore, we would do better to focus on the abilities and performance of officials, not ordinary citizens.

J	Bishop, GF				Bishop, George F.			A road not taken: Mass belief systems reconsidered	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							POLITICAL-ATTITUDES; PUBLICS; SOPHISTICATION; QUESTION; PANEL	Critics of Converse's agenda-setting 1964 essay underexplored the seemingly technical issue of measurement error. Down this road not taken lie serious questions about the evidence for both of Converse's main theses. First, a thorough reexamination of the exact questions posed to a mass sample of the electorate and to an elite sample of congressional candidates suggests that the mass/elite difference in ideological constraint reported by Converse could be, in significant part, a measurement-error artifact caused by differences in question form. Furthermore, the vagueness and ambiguity of the questions not only calls into question the plausibility of Converse's main thesislack of ideological constraint among the publicbut of his subsidiary thesis: that, measured over time, members of the public had such unstable political opinions that they might best be considered nonattitudes.

J	Pious, RM				Pious, Richard M.			Presidential rhetoric from Wilson to "W": Popular politics meets recalcitrant reality	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								With the publication of Jeffrey Tulis's The Rhetorical Presidency, Woodrow Wilson's contribution to a major transformation in the American presidency-and in American politics-came to be recognized. But while Wilson believed that the danger of presidential demagoguery was overrated, forms of demagoguery that he underestimated have undermined the legitimacy of America's presidential democracy, in both its Wilsonian, plebiscitary form; and in the rule by decree to which presidents sometimes turn when their rhetoric does not suffice. The basic problem that Wilson overlooked is the mismatch between effective rhetoric and what can actually be accomplished, even by the most popular of presidents.

All that is required to uphold the belief in natural law is a kind of metaphysical faith in the notion of human dignity, which provides us with the surest barriers against both unjust positive legislation and totalitarian political systems.

J	Yellin, ME				Yellin, ME			Indirect utility, justice, and equality in the political thought of David Hume	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Differing interpretations of the political thought of David Hume have tended to emphasize either conservative, gradualist elements similar to Burke or rationalist aspects similar to Hobbes. The concept of indirect utility as used by Hume reconciles these two approaches. Indirect utility is best illustrated by Hume's conception of justice, in contrast to his conception of benevolence, which yields direct benefits. This understanding of Hume's consequentialism also helps underscore certain egalitarian aspects of Hume' thought.

J	Palmer, TG				Palmer, TG			What's not wrong with libertarianism: Reply to Friedman	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							RIGHTS	In his critique of modern libertarian thinking, Jeffrey Friedman (1997) argues that libertarian moral theory makes social science irrelevant. However, if its moral claims are hypothetical rather than categorical imperatives, then economics, history, sociology, and other disciplines play a central role in libertarian thought. Limitations on human knowledge necessitate abstractly formulated rules, among which are claims of rights. Further, Friedman's remarks on freedom vest on an erroneous understanding of the role of definitions in philosophy, and his characterization of the "right to do wrong" as a "logical contradiction" reveals a misunderstanding of logic.

J	Sen, A				Sen, A			Rationality, joy and freedom	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In The Joyless Economy, Tibor Scitovsky proposes a model of human behavior that differs substantially from that of standard economic theory. Scitovsky begins with a basic distinction between ''comfort'' and ''stimulation.'' While stimulation is ultimately more satisfying and creative, we frequently fall for the bewitching attractions of comfort, which leads to impoverished lives. Scitovsky's analysis has far-reaching implications not only for the idea of rationality, but for the concept of utility (by making it plural in nature) and, perhaps most importantly, for the importance of freedom (including the freedom to change our preferences).

J	Tambini, D				Tambini, D			Explaining monoculturalism: Beyond Gellner's theory of nationalism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								For Ernest Gellner, nationalism occurs in the modern period because industrial societies, unlike agrarian ones, need homogeneous languages and cultures in order to work efficiently. Thus, states and intellectuals mobilize campaigns of assimilation through public education and the culture industries. Gellner's theory however, fails to explain all forms of nationalism, is overly materialist, and at times relies on dubious functionalist explanations. A more satisfactory theory would take into account the cultural content of nationalism-not only myths, but political culture-as well as phenomena of identity and collective action.

Actions by policymakers unable to admit earlier mistakes compounded the problem throughout the 1980s. Attempts by political decisionmakers to shift blame to the private sector, coupled with a failure to acknowledge the institutional pressures that led congressmen and S & L owners and managers to act as they did, leave taxpayers vulnerable to the repetition of S & L-type crises in other industries.

"Culture Wars" and the Poststructuralist Legacy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						Foucault; culture wars; identity politics; power; poststructuralism		Michel Foucault's philosophy has recently come under sharp criticism across the political spectrum. While right-wing and centrist commentators identify Foucault as the intellectual progenitor of "woke" dogmatism and an irrationalist hostility to science, left-wing critics associate his work with neoliberalism and animosity towards the welfare state. Neither critique is grounded in an accurate understanding of the epistemological motivation of Foucault's project.

J	Rosenberg, P				Rosenberg, Paul			Hegel's Political Philosophy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Hegel; abstract right; agricultural estate; mercantile estate; natural law; procedural rationality; rabble; universal estate; work ethic		The Philosophy of Right presents us with a vision of bureaucratic paternalism that is designed to check the excesses of free markets set in motion by the triumph of natural-law thinking, which abstracted the principles of private property and subjective freedom from the institutions that had tamed them and situated them in a stable context. Against these excesses Hegel pits the agricultural estate, which has not succumbed to natural-law thinking; and a "universal estate" of bureaucrats who are educated in Hegel's philosophy itself, freeing them of the natural-law conflation of human needs with arbitrary and endlessly expanding preferences. Taught by Hegel to look after the needs of the organic whole that is society rather than the gratification of their own preferences, the task of the bureaucrats of the universal estate is to curb the tendency of free markets to produce the social preconditions for an alienated "rabble" to bring down the system.

Harrison was a highly qualified president who demonstrated energetic leadership and political skill, but whose ideological commitment to the Republican party as a quasi-sacred enterprise overrode other important considerations, thereby contributing to one of the greatest economic catastrophes in U.S. history: the Depression of 1893-1897. His ideas about the Republican party were forged in its early years, when it led the political battle against slavery; but when Harrison became president, the party's interests in trade protectionism, veterans' pensions, and silver drove him to support policies that eventually sent the economy into a tailspin from which it took years to recover.

J	Craiutu, A				Craiutu, Aurelian			In Search of the Decent Society: Isaiah Berlin and Raymond Aron on Liberty	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Raymond Aron; Isaiah Berlin; democracy; F; A; Hayek; institutions; liberty; moderation; negative freedom; positive freedom; Cold War liberalism		Jeremy Waldron has argued that Berlin ignored the importance of institutions and constitutions and worked with an impoverished conception of social and political design. Political structures, legal and political institutions, constitutional design, mechanisms of representation and the rule of law: all this remained untouched by Berlin, who seemed, in Waldron's opinion, largely uninterested in the actual political institutions of liberal society. In this essay, I argue that what may be missing in Berlin-close and sustained attention to, and interest in, institutions and social context-can be found in the works of his prominent contemporary, Raymond Aron (1905-1983), who also wrote about liberty during the Cold War. As such, Aron's An Essay on Liberty can and should be read as a complement to Berlin's essay "Two Concepts of Liberty."

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			THE PROBLEM OF EPISTOCRATIC IDENTIFICATION AND THE (POSSIBLY) DYSFUNCTIONAL DIVISION OF EPISTEMIC LABOR	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						democratic theory; division of epistemic labor; epistocracy; financial crisis		How can political actors identify which putative expert is truly expert, given that any putative expert may be wrong about a given policy question; given that experts may therefore disagree with one another; and given that other members of the polity, being non-expert, can neither reliably adjudicate inter-expert disagreement nor detect when a consensus of experts is misguided? This would not be an important question if the problems dealt with by politics were usually simple ones, in the sense that the answer to them is self-evident. But to the extent that political problems are complex, expertise is required to answer them-although if such expertise exists, we are unlikely to know who has it. This conundrum is illustrated by the financial crisis. The consensus views of financial regulators prior to the crisis appear to have been mistaken, in that the regulators not only failed to anticipate a crisis of the type that occurred, but adopted regulations that may have encouraged the concentration of mortgage risk in financial institutions. Similarly, once the crisis broke, academic financial experts, financial regulators, and journalists-who communicate information from one branch of the division of epistemic labor to another-converged on a narrative of the crisis that, once again, may plausibly be described as inaccurate, but that nonetheless has come to shape the understanding of the crisis shared by the rest of the polity.

J	Schmidt, VA				Schmidt, Vivien A.			Theorizing Ideas and Discourse in Political Science: Intersubjectivity, Neo-Institutionalisms, and the Power of Ideas	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						discourse; discursive institutionalism; discursive interaction; ideas; ideational power; intersubjectivity; post-structuralism	DISCURSIVE INSTITUTIONALISM; DYNAMICS; ECONOMY	Oscar Larsson's (2015) essay condemns discursive institutionalism for the sin of subjectivism. In reality, however, discursive institutionalism emphasizes the intersubjective nature of ideas through its theorization of agents' background ideational abilities and foreground discursive abilities. It also avoids relativism by means of Wittgenstein's distinction between experiences of everyday life and pictures of the world. Contrary to Larsson, what truly separates post-structuralism from discursive institutionalism is the respective approaches' theorization of the relationship of power to ideas, with discursive institutionalists mainly focused on persuasive power through ideas, while post-structuralists focus on the structural power in ideas or on coercive power over ideas.

J	Jager, K				Jaeger, Kai			NOT A NEW GOLD STANDARD: EVEN BIG DATA CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						big data; event data; ICEWS; ideational factors; machine coding; Nassim Taleb; peace and conflict studies; Thai conflict; unpredictability	CONFLICT; FORECASTS; THAILAND	Many scholars believe that the proliferation of large-scale datasets will spur scientific advancement and help us to predict the future using sophisticated statistical techniques. Indeed, a team of researchers achieved astonishing success using the world's largest event dataset, produced by the ICEWS project, to predict complex social outcomes such as civil wars and irregular government turnovers. However, the secret of their success lay in transforming epistemically difficult questions into easy ones. Forecasting the onset of civil wars becomes an easy task if one relies on explanatory variables that measure how often newspapers report on tensions, fights, or killings. But news reports on prewar conflicts are just variations of the variable that researchers want to predict; the finding that more conflicts are likely to occur when journalists report about conflicts carries little scientific value. A similar success rate in "predicting" interstate wars can also be achieved by a simple Google News search for country names and conflict-related news shortly just before a conflict is coded as a war. Big data can help researchers to make predictions in simple situations, but there is no evidence that predictions will also succeed in uncertain environments with complex outcomes-such as those characteristic of politics.

J	Pennington, M				Pennington, Mark			Realistic Idealism and Classical Liberalism: Evaluating Free Market Fairness	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							WAL-MART; ECONOMICS; POLICY	In Free Market Fairness, John Tomasi defends classical-liberal principles not because of real-world considerations but on ideal-theoretic grounds. However, what constitutes a sufficiently "ideal" ideal theory is debatable since, as Tomasi shows, regimes that range from laissez faire to heavily interventionist can all be classified as legitimate from the perspective of ideal theory. Conversely, if ideal theory can allow for realistic constraints, as Rawls does, then we should recognize that even under ideal-theoretic conditions, political actors face logistical, epistemic, and motivational challenges that only intensify in the real world, where questions of feasibility become paramount.

J	Ross, L				Ross, Lee			REFLECTIONS ON BIASED ASSIMILATION AND BELIEF POLARIZATION	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							SELF; PERCEPTIONS	Where Taber and Lodge view belief polarization to indicate a "partisan motivation," Lord et al. (1979) believed it to be consistent with a desire for accuracy: A "weak" study articulating an opposing viewpoint might simply sharpen participants' initial belief of the wisdom of their prior beliefs. This polarization, Taber and Lodge show, correlates with political sophistication: The more partisan a participant, the more time spent reading the opinions of the other side-in order to critically refute them. Taber and Lodge attribute such findings to people's personal identification with their beliefs. However, participants may have spent so much time reading opinions of the other side because the arguments are unfamiliar. Further, Lord et al. (1984) were able to induce people to act with "skepticism" toward their own views by simply suggesting that they "consider the other side."

J	Colander, D				Colander, David			HOW ECONOMISTS GOT IT WRONG: A NUANCED ACCOUNT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							EXCESS DEMAND FUNCTIONS; KEYNES	In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, many economists have blamed economics for having failed to warn us. Paul Krugman, for example, in a well-known New York Times Magazine article, suggests that Classical economists were blinded by the beauty of mathematics, and that Keynesian economics is the path of the future. This paper argues that the evolution of economic thinking is much more nuanced than Krugman portrays it, and that instead of embracing what has become known as Keynesian economics, macroeconomists should rather re-embrace the broader Classical economic tradition, of which Keynes was an important part.

J	Kraus, W				Kraus, Wladimir			THE FINANCIAL CRISIS: A CRISIS, TOO, FOR LAW AND ECONOMICS?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Richard A. Posner's two books on the financial crisis focus on possible macroeconomic (Keynesian) causes of it, neglecting legal causes that would have had only microeconomic effects, yet could have been responsible for the crisis. Specifically, Posner accepts too readily the conventional wisdom that banks' leverage levels, hence their capital cushions, were deregulated; this ignores Basel I, Basel II, and the Recourse rule, which internationally and (in the last case) in the United States minutely regulated not only leverage levels but the composition of banks' assets. These regulations penalized banks for making business loans in comparison to mortgage loans, and it further penalized them for keeping mortgage loans rather than selling them for securitization and then buying back the osenioro tranches of the resulting mortgage-backed securities. These regulations may explain the overconcentration of mortgage risk in the banks, and thus the financial crisis.

J	Murakami, MH				Murakami, Michael H.			SOURCES OF MASS POLITICAL DISAGREEMENT: REJOINDER TO MARIETTA	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							IDEOLOGY	Do people tend to disagree over political issues because of conflicting values? Or do they disagree about which policies will most effectively promote shared values? In a previous article, I argued that the issues most people think are most important tend to fall into the latter category. On the issues of greatest importance to the mass public, most citizens agree about the ends that are desirable, but disagree about which policy means would best effectuate those ends. Consequently, disputes about factsdisputes about the actual effects of proposed public policieslie at the heart of the most important divisions in contemporary American public opinion. However, people do not necessarily interpret their political disagreements this way. If they fail to recognize that facts that they see as self-evident are disputed by their opponents, they may see their opponents as having different values, since there could be few other explanations for their opponents' disagreement with them. However, evidence that disagreements about facts are really driving public opinion can be found by using conditional surveys, which ask respondents if they would support a given policy if they believed that it would cause specific negative consequences.

J	Myhill, J				Myhill, John			THE ISLAMIZATION OF ARAB NATIONALISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Unlike all other present-day nationalities, Arab nationality is defined exclusively in terms of a single written language, which encompasses a huge range of mutually incomprehensible speech forms-the better to make the "Arab nationality'' as large as possible, and to establish continuity between today's "Arabs'' and the glorious past of the early Islamic conquerors. The secular version of Arabic nationalism lost its appeal when the Arab countries failed to unite politically and when they were defeated by Israel in 1967. The apparent Islamization of Arabic society since 1967 is actually a response to these failures. When "Arabs'' perceived that secular ideology had failed to achieve their national goals, they turned to Islamism as a different strategy for achieving the same objectives.

An experimental investigation involving two deliberative exercises, one among self-identified liberals and another among self-identified conservatives, showed that participants' views became more extreme after deliberation. Deliberation also increased consensus and significantly reduced diversity of opinion within the two groups. Even anonymous statements of personal opinion became more extreme and homogeneous after deliberation.

J	Bimes, T				Bimes, Terri			The practical origins of the rhetorical presidency	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								As readers of The Rhetorical Presidency might expect, the Framers' remarks at the Constitutional Convention revealed a deep concern about popular political ignorance-and a desire to shield the new government from it. However, when it came to designing the presidency, the Founders seem to have been less intent on insulating sitting presidents from the mass public than on guarding the presidents' selection itself against elite factions that might take advantage of the public's ignorance. The resulting constitutional structure left the actual relationship between the president and the public open-ended. In short order, even the most restrained, patrician presidents took advantage of the opportunity to invoke, and to shape, public opinion-setting the stage for Andrew Jackson's, and his Democratic successors', more aggressive presidential populism.

J	Sheingate, AD				Sheingate, Adam D.			"Publicity" and the progressive-era origins of modern politics	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							KANT	The Rhetorical Presidency places great importance on the transformative power of political ideas. For Tulis, Progressive ideas informed the rhetorical practices of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson-practices that reconstituted the American presidency. They did so, in part, by trading on the ambiguous nature of the concept of "publicity "-which at once evoked liberal ideals of public deliberation and transparency, and modern practices of manipulative communication. In turn, the new practices of publicity revolutionized not only the American, presidency, but American politics as a whole.

J	Fishkin, JS				Fishkin, James S.			Beyond polling alone: The quest for an informed public	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Converse's seminal 1964 article explored three crucial limitations of public opinion as it is revealed in conventional polls: information levels, belief systems, and nonattitudes. These limitations are significant from the standpoint of democratic theory, but it is possible to design forms of public consultation and of social-science research that will reveal what public opinion might be like if these limitations were somehow overcome. Deliberative Polling is an effort to explore the contours of such a counterfactual public opinion-one that is more informed and engaged than is the mass public. Doing so requires going beyond "polling alone".

J	Lupia, A				Lupia, Arthur			How elitism undermines the study of voter competence	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								A form of elitism undermines much writing on voter competence. The elitist move occurs when an author uses a self-serving worldview as the basis for evaluating voters. Such elitism is apparent in widely cited measures of "political knowledge" and in common claims about what voters should know. The elitist move typically limits the credibility and practical relevance of the analysis by leading writers to draw unreliable conclusions about voter competence. I propose a more constructive way of thinking about what voters know. Its chief virtue is its consistency with basic facts about the relationship between information and choice.

J	Wawro, GJ				Wawro, Gregory J.			The rationalizing public?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Rationalization is the adjustment Of one's beliefs about politically relevant information, the better to fit one's political behavior or one's political attitudes. This reverses the usual causal order, in which it is assumed that people start with values, add what little factual information they have, and produce policy, partisan, or ideological "attitudes" as a result. If people actually work backwards from their political behavior to their attitudes, and from their attitudes to their beliefs about "the facts," there are obvious and troubling implications for democratic legitimacy, as well as for the academic study of democratic competence. I confine myself here to exploring some of the empirical evidence for rationalization, and to thinking about how to solve the resulting research problems, bracketing the normative issues.

J	Wrong, DH				Wrong, DH			Is capitalism eternal?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Several scholars have observed that in contrast to "socialism," "capitalism" was not an ideology promoted by a social class or movement but an economy that emerged "spontaneously" from particular historical conditions. Since the decline of the Soviet Union, no new version of socialism has been promulgated, although complaints about the inequalities of capitalism inevitably persist and will certainly continue. Capitalism, if not "eternal," remains a highly probable form of economy under conditions of economic surplus, extensive division of labor, urbanism, and the absence of fully centralized state power. An inevitably wide variation in its forms will certainly endure and in no way amounts to the "end of history," as a few writers have suggested.

Sciabarra contends that Rand war influenced by Hegelian and Marxist themes that dominated Russian thought during its Silver Age, particularly the doctrine of infernal relations. Yet while it is true that key Hegelian and Marxist concepts, such as the dialectics of work and the master-slave relationship, are features of Rand's radical outlook, Sciabarra fails in his major argument that Rand's dialectical method presents an alternative to that of Mane and Hegel.

J	KOHAK, E				KOHAK, E			SPEAKING TO TREES	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								What is the epistemological status of a world within which speaking to trees would appear as an appropriate behavior? It would be a world perceived as a community of autonomous beings worthy of respect. Such a world contrasts with the anthropocentric conception of the world as a value-free reservoir of raw materials, but neither worldview can or should claim descriptive accuracy. Both are equally ''manners of speaking'' and the choice between them must rest on whether they are conducive to ecologically constructive or ecologically destructive behavior. On that basis, speaking to trees is a legitimate, speaking of biomechanisms an illegitimate form of verbal behavior.

The Clash between LGBTQ plus Rights and Religious Free Exercise	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						conscience; equal protection clause; free exercise clause; intolerance; gay rights; tolerance; Andrew Koppelman		Few denials of tolerance are more severe than rejection of the moral worth of another's way of life. In the U.S. today, many traditional religious believers, especially fundamentalist Christians, and many LGBQT+ persons see each other's ways of life as deeply evil in important respects. These gulfs probably cannot be bridged; but public policies can and should seek to accommodate all claims of conscience as far as this can be done without denying anyone meaningful possession of basic rights. By placing religious and moral consciences equally in a constitutionally "preferred position," governments can foster a wider sense that citizens are engaged in a shared enterprise of helping everyone to pursue their distinctive forms of happiness.

J	von Platz, J				von Platz, Jeppe			ABSOLUTE FREEDOM OF CONTRACT: GROTIAN LESSONS FOR LIBERTARIANS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							GROTIUS,HUGO	Libertarians often rely on arguments that subordinate the principle of liberty to the value of its economic consequences. This invites the question of what a pure libertarian theory of justice-one that takes liberty as its overriding concern-would look like. Grotius's political theory provides a template for such a libertarianism, but it also entails uncomfortable commitments that can be avoided only by compromising the principle of liberty. According to Grotius, each person should be free to decide how to act as long as her actions do not violate the equal liberty of others. According to this principle, however, people are free to enter any contract and alienate any rights, permitting even contracts of slavery or the alienation of rights of bodily integrity. Libertarians can escape this commitment to absolute freedom of contract only by adopting ad-hoc amendments to the principle of liberty.

J	Chandler, B				Chandler, Bret			THE "PUBLIC" AND "ITS" IGNORANCE: REPLY TO WISNIEWSKI AND FENSTER	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In their debate about whether Cultural Studies is helpful for understanding public ignorance, Chris Wisniewski and Mark Fenster view ignorance as inevitably plaguing the public in mass democratic society; and they see "the public'' as an abstract entity. However, Pierre Bourdieu's sociology rightly contests these positions. A thorough investigation of the concrete social conditions of political ignorance reveals that ignorance is unevenly dispersed throughout social space and that its relevance depends on social position, such as that of the advantaged and disadvantaged. Such a comprehensive approach to public ignorance is required for advancing political participation among the least advantaged.

J	Lustick, IS				Lustick, Ian S.			TETLOCK AND COUNTERFACTUALS: SAVING METHODOLOGICAL AMBITION FROM EMPIRICAL FINDINGS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In five works spanning a decade, Philip E. Tetlock's interest in counterfactuals has changed. He began with an optimistic desire to make social science more rigorous by identifying best practices in the absence of non-imagined controls for experimentation. Soon, however, he adopted a more pessimistic analysis of the cognitive and psychological barriers facing experts. This shift was brought on by an awareness that experts are not rational Bayesians who continually update their theories to keep up with new information; but instead are affected by political, cognitive, and psychological heuristics, including hindsight bias, cognitive conservatism, and the fundamental attribution error. But techniques of computational simulation-involving the rigorous production of large numbers of counterfactual worlds-make it possible to mitigate both problems that Tetlock identifies: that history, produced only once, is a lousy teacher; and that humans, with their collection of non-Bayesian heuristics, are lousy pupils. Tetlock was wrong to reject this approach as theoretically promising but rhetorically and practically impractical.

J	Converse, PE				Converse, Philip E.			Democratic theory and electoral reality	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Editorial Material								In response to the dozen essays published here, which relate my 1964 paper on "The Nature of Belief Systems in the Mass Publics" to normative requirements of democratic theory, I note, inter alia, a major misinterpretation of my old argument, as well as needed revisions of that argument in the light of intervening data. Then I address the degree to which there may be some long-term secular change in the parameters that I originally laid out. In the final section, I provide a case study of public understanding of factual trends in federal tax policy in recent decades which seems commendably veridical on average. The preferences of the public thereon add up to a remarkably clear popular mandate. But this mandate seems to disappear rather magically in the voting booth, probably due to a combination of limited contextual information on the public side, and considerable skill on the elite side in manipulating apparent political realities.

Constitution according to its original public meaning, for in his view the Constitution, rightly understood, satisfies the appropriate normative criterion for determining when a constitution is legitimate and should be followed. As it turns out, however, even if the Constitution did mean what Barnett says it does, it would not meet his criterion of legitimacy, and therefore should not be followed. Moreover, Barnett is just as guilty of reading certain clauses out of the Constitution as are his critics. Given the lack of a persuasive reason to follow the original Constitution consistently, judges must turn to sources of authority other than the Constitution in deciding constitutional cases.

J	Kersh, R				Kersh, R			Influencing the state: US campaign finance and its discontents	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Among the principal targets of criticism in recent American politics has been the alleged corruption, inequity, overall cost, and regulatory complexity of the US. campaign-finance system. Scholarship has not borne out any of these criticisms, and, if anything, empirical investigation suggests that the current system does a fair job in addressing-as much as this is possible under modern conditions-the problem of public ignorance in mass democracies.

J	Somin, I				Somin, I			Do politicians pander?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review								In Politicians Don't Pander, Lawrence Jacobs and Robert Shapiro show that politicians follow public opinion much less slavishly than conventional wisdom suggests. However, the case studies they themselves rely on show that public opinion constrains policy makers more than they claim. Conversely, to the extent that political leaders are able to ignore the public's wishes, Jacobs and Shapiro do not adequately consider the possibility that this is due in large part to severe voter ignorance of public policy. In urging greater obedience to the popular will, the authors also overlook the danger that increased adherence to the often internally contradictory wishes of the electorate may be impossible or undesirable.

J	Kamath, SJ				Kamath, SJ			Indian development and poverty: Making sense of Sen et al.	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The work of Amartya Sen and his collaborators on Indian economic development compares three Indian states so as to demonstrate the superior performance of interventionist, left-wing governments in West Bengal and Kerala compared to the more typical state of Uttar Pradesh. A careful analysis of the evidence, however, shows that Sen et al. ignore the anti-interventionist implications of their own evidence of corruption in the state of Uttar Pradesh; dramatically overstate the success of leftist governments in West Bengal; and overlook the role of Kerala's culture and its private education system in accounting for its famously high levels of literacy and female independence.

J	von Schriltz, K				von Schriltz, K			Foucault on the prison: Torturing history to punish capitalism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Michel Foucault has been an academic cause celebre for some time, spawning untold thesis papers and dissertations illuminating oppression's invisible fingerprints on history, literature, gender, and government. Yet for all his ceutrality in American higher education, Foucault's boob are not studied so much for their substantative content as for their underlying insights into the forces shaping society. This paper confronts this paradox through a critique of the apotheosis of Foucaultian analysis, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison. Discipline and Punish can be understood as a masterful harnessing of leftist assumptions about capitalism to reconfigure history. The extent to which Foucault distorts history to support his thesis, however, seriously undermines the practical relevance of his brand of social science.

J	Wolff, J				Wolff, J			Freedom, liberty, and property	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								If one values freedom, what sort of regime of property should one favor: libertarianism, socialism, or something else again? Debate on this topic has been hampered by a failure to distinguish freedom and liberty, which are both of great value, but can come into conflict. Furthermore there are many similar concepts-distinct from both liberty and freedom, yet each representing something we rightly value-which may also come into conflict with each other and with freedom and liberty Consequently the question posed above has no easy answer.

J	Horwitz, S				Horwitz, S			Keynes on capitalism: Reply	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Greg Hill's recent article voices the Keynesian complaint that capitalism produces unemployment because there is no mechanism that coordinates decisions to save with decisions to invest. But resources that are not spent on current consumption are either ''invested'' as bank deposits or ''hoarded'' as cash. Deposits are lent out by banks to investors, who are informed by interest rates as to the degree of saving for future consumption that is taking place. And wage/price flexibility, as well as increases in the supply of cash, can avoid declines in real income and employment caused by increased cash holdings.

Rather than seeing the constructive side of rational choice theory, both as an engine of theoretical development and as a source of non-obvious empirical insights about politics, Green and Shapiro depart from the procedure in most sciences, comparing rational choice against an ideal rather than some concrete alternative. Finally, they fail to note the recent emphasis on sophisticated empirical testing of rational choice hypotheses.

J	SUNSTEIN, CR				SUNSTEIN, CR			ON COSTS, BENEFITS, AND REGULATORY SUCCESS - REPLY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Robert Crandall writes as if the regulatory state is a simple failure. In fact, however, from the economic point of view there have been many successes, in the form of regulations whose benefits exceed their costs. Moreover economic criteria are inadequate for evaluating regulatory performance, since even well-aggregated private willingness to pay provides a poor basis for assessing government regulation. It is now necessary to move beyond sterile debates about whether regulation is desirable; nonregulation is not an option, since laissez faire is itself regulatory system. Democratic, economic, and constitutional criteria hold out the promise of much better regulatory tools, in the form of flexible incentives rather than rigid commands.

J	HUDSON, J				HUDSON, J			INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY - MURRAY,CHARLES POLITICAL-PHILOSOPHY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Charles Murray's political philosophy is utilitarian, individualist, and communitarian. The basis for his success in making these components cohere is his account of happiness, inspired by the motivation theory of Abraham Maslow. Murray claims that belonging to a community and self-respect (which on his analysis require a certain social commitment) are constituents of happiness. Hence utilitarians should attribute special value to community. He also argues that active national governments are inimical to the formation and functioning of communities, and that communities are fostered by governments that observe the constraints of liberal individualism.

J	BUCHANAN, JM; FAND, DI				BUCHANAN, JM; FAND, DI			MONETARY MALPRACTICE - INTENT, IMPOTENCE, OR INCOMPETENCE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Monetary policy prior to, during, and following the 1990-1991 recession was the tightest and most restrictive in Over 30 years. Some have suggested that this policy was explicitly designed by the monetary hawks on the Federal Reserve to wring out the residues of inflationary expectations; others, that the central bank could not offset the real, and powerful, negative shocks buffeting the American economy. But a better explanation is that the monetary authorities were passive because they failed to appreciate the treacherous financial weather caused by new capital requirements and the massive bailout of insolvent institutions.

Three pervasive shortcomings are confirmation bias, disconfirmation bias, and motivated reasoning. The emotional state of anxiety can help us overcome these biases given the open-minded, information-rich, reflective deliberation with diverse people it may promote-although mass and social media may hinder this type of deliberation.

CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						behavioral economics; education policy; evidence-based policy; meta-analysis; nudge; nudging; systematic review	NATIONAL CURRICULUM ASSESSMENT; EDUCATION; POLICY; VIEW	"Evidence-based" methods, which most prominently include randomized controlled trials, have gained increasing purchase as the "gold standard" for assessing the effect of public policies. But the enthusiasm for evidence-based research overlooks questions about the reliability and applicability of experimental findings to diverse real-world settings. Perhaps surprisingly, a qualitative study of British educators suggests that they are aware of these limitations and therefore take evidence-based findings with a much larger grain of salt than do policy makers. Their experience suggests that the real world is more heterogeneous than the world imagined by evidence-based policy enthusiasts.

J	van der Ploeg, P; Guerin, L				van der Ploeg, Piet; Guerin, Laurence			Questioning Participation and Solidarity as Goals of Citizenship Education	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						citizenship; civic education; democracy; participation; solidarity; service learning	POLITICAL EFFICACY; CIVIC EDUCATION; LIBERALISM; RIGHTS	According to many governments and educationalists, education should aim to develop dispositions conducive to political participation and solidarity, because democratic citizenship presupposes participation and solidarity. But there are radically different views on the nature of good citizenship. We examine the implications of this dissensus for citizenship education. Education, we contend, should involve and develop autonomy and open-mindedness. We argue that this requires a more critical approach than is possible when political participation and solidarity are conceived of as goals of education.

However, this amounts to saying that Kahneman and his collaborators interpret people's behavior in experimental settings to be inconsistent with the narrow understanding of rationality deployed by orthodox neoclassical economists. Whether this means that people make poor decisions in the real world, however, has not been demonstrated, a fact that calls into doubt the significance of the list of heuristics and biases generated by behavioral economists. Dual-process (System 1/System 2) theory was meant to give theoretical coherence to this list, but its empirical foundation, too, retains the premises of rational choice as an ideal.

J	Strong, M				Strong, Michael			SOME IMPLICATIONS OF HAYEK'S COGNITIVE THEORY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Hayek's oft-neglected cognitive theory, articulated in The Sensory Order, provides a foundation for a theory of innovation that integrates cognition, experience, and the importance of freedom for the creation of entirely new conceptual categories and fundamentally innovative entrepreneurial endeavors. For Hayek, one sees only what one is prepared to see; that is, we can notice sensory and other phenomena only after we have classified the data into often-implicit abstract categories that are mediated to us physiologically. Learning takes places by using received categories while innovation takes place by creating new categories or moving data from one category to another, which is often an attempt to resolve anomalies. The new perceptual awareness required for discovery leads, in turn, to new categorizing and new perceptual horizons. Such innovation often requires not just freedom of imagination, but freedom of action, for one has to be able to try out many different perceptual possibilities.				michael.strong@consciouscapitalism.org						Gieringer Dale H., 1973, REGULATING NEW DRUGS; Hayek FA, 1945, AM ECON REV, V35, P519; Hayek F.

J	Shields, JA				Shields, Jon A.			ALMOST HUMAN: AMBIVALENCE IN THE PRO-CHOICE AND PRO-LIFE MOVEMENTS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							ABORTION; SERVICES	Scholars find that political elites are badly polarized over a large range of policy issues, but they tend to agree that the mass public is much more ambivalent. The abortion war in particular is regarded as one in which millions of ambivalent citizens are caught in the crossfire of polarized activists. Yet even abortion activists struggle to escape the very ambivalent sentiments that plague ordinary Americans. These common sentiments even exert a moderating influence on both movements in ways that are consistent with the preferences of the American public. They also suggest that liberalism may be mired in permanent conflict and ambivalence over the scope of basic human rights.

J	Marietta, M				Marietta, Morgan			VALUE REPRESENTATIONTHE DOMINANCE OF ENDS OVER MEANS IN DEMOCRATIC POLITICS: REPLY TO MURAKAMI	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							CORE BELIEFS; IGNORANCE; HANDS	American democracy is not unconstrained or autonomous, but instead achieves what could be termed value representation. Rather than affording representation on policy issues, elections transmit priorities among competing normative ends, while elite politics address the more complex matching of ends and means within the value boundaries established by voters. This results in neither policy representation nor state autonomy, but instead in a specific and limited form of democratic representation.

J	Somin, I				Somin, Ilya			DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY AND POLITICAL IGNORANCE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							ECONOMY	Advocates of odeliberative democracyo want citizens to actively participate in serious dialogue over political issues, not merely go to the polls every few years. Unfortunately, these ideals don't take into account widespread political ignorance and irrationality. Most voters neither attain the level of knowledge needed to make deliberative democracy work, nor do they rationally evaluate the political information they do possess. The vast size and complexity of modern government make it unlikely that most citizens can ever reach the levels of knowledge and rationality required by deliberative democracy, even if they were better informed than they are at present.

J	Vaughan, GM				Vaughan, Geoffrey M.			INCOMMUNICATIVE ACTION: AN ESOTERIC WARNING ABOUT DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							PUBLIC IGNORANCE; BELIEF SYSTEMS; COMMUNICATION; COMPETENCE; IDEOLOGY; POLITICS; WEBER	Deliberative democracy is a noble project: an attempt to make citizens philosophize. Critics of deliberative democracy usually claim either that the proposed deliberation threatens an existing moral consensus or, instead, that deliberation is impossible amid power imbalances that oppress the weak. But another problem is that combining democracy and deliberation is inherently an attempt to engage publicly in a private activitywhere sensitivity to each interlocutor may require a special form of address. Can this be done? Yes, in some contexts. The tradition of esoteric writing has demonstrated that it is possible to layer one's discourse in such a way that all citizens can partake at a level that suits them. But writing for a public is not really deliberation among equals; it is leadership by the writer of the readers. Genuine dialogue among equals that takes account of their differences is, in contrast, inherently a private affair.

J	Van Duffel, S				Van Duffel, Siegfried			The dependence of libertarianism on the notion of sovereignty: Rejoinder to Morton	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								G. E. Morton tries to defend libertarianism against my claim that it relies on an implausible secularization of ideas of divine sovereignty. But it is not true, as he claims, that morality itself entails human sovereignty: witness the moral theories of divine-command theorists and philosophical consequentialists. Nor is it true that sovereignty can be conceptually transferred from God to equal human individuals, since they would have no legitimate way to legislate over each other, short of a unanimous general will. Nor, finally, does the idea of first possession rescue private property rights, since it is as applicable to animals and children as to adult human beings.				svduffel@gmail.com	Van Duffel, Siegfried/F-2669-2011					Kain P, 2004, ARCH GESCH PHILOS, V86, P257, DOI 10.1515/agph.2004.86.3.257; KILCULLEN J, 2000, WORK 90 DAYS; MAKINEN V, 2003, LATE MEDIEVAL EARLY; Makinen Virpi, 2001, PROPERTY RIGHTS LATE; REATH A, 1994, NOUS, V28, P435, DOI 10.2307/2215474; Van Duffel S, 2004, CRIT REV, V16, P353, DOI 10.1080/08913810408443615; VANDUFFEL S, 2004, PHILOS CONT WORLD, V11, P1	7	0	0	0	0	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0891-3811	1933-8007		CRIT REV	Crit.

J	Wallison, PJ				Wallison, Peter J.			CREDIT-DEFAULT SWAPS ARE NOT TO BLAME	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Though accused by critics of helping to cause the current financial crisis, credit-default swaps are blameless. The accusation is understandable, however, given misunderstandings about how a credit-default swap actually works. A careful look into its mechanism shows that it is not only simpler than thought, but that it is also vital to keeping the financial system strong by enabling financial institutions to better manage their risks. The risk taken on in a credit-default swap (CDS) is no different from the risk of making the underlying loan. CDSs allow risks to be spread more widely instead of being concentrated at vulnerable points, but they do not add to the total amount of risk.				pwallison@aei.org						GIBSON MS, 2007, FINANCE EC DISCUSSIO; MENGLE D, 2007, FIN MARK C FED RES B; OHARROW R, 2008, WASHINGTON POST 1231; ROGOFF B, 2008, BARCLAYS CAPITA 1106; SOROS G, 2008, FINANCIAL TIMES 0403	5	4	4	0	3	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND	0891-3811			CRIT REV	Crit.

J	Eastwood, J				Eastwood, J			The role of ideas in Weber's theory of interests	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Max Weber's understanding of the role of people's interests in determining their behavior has been widely misunderstood, because of a misinterpretation of a famous passage in which he analogizes interests to railway '' switchmen.'' Contrary to this widespread view, Weber does not see material self-interest as the driving force behind human action. Rather, he distinguishes between material and '' ideal '' interests; emphasizes the latter; and, arguably, suggests that even the former are, to a great extent, culturally constructed, not least because they rely on ideas about the way the world is. It, is almost fair to say, then, that the notion that Weber reduces ideas to interests has things completely backwards.

J	DeCanio, S				DeCanio, S			Beyond Marxist state theory: State autonomy in democratic societies	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review								Recent theories of the state often draw attention to states' auonomy from social preferences. This paper suggests that the phenomnon of public ignorance is the primary mechanism responsible for state autonomy in democratic polities. Such theorists as Skocpol and Poulantzus, who do not take account of public ignorance, either uderestimate the stated autonomy or stress causal mechanisms that are necessary but not sufficient conditions for its autonomy. Gramsci's concept of ideological hegemony is promising, even though it is far too insistent on the penetration of ideology of any kind beyond relatively small numbers of political sophisticates.

J	Tetlock, PE				Tetlock, PE			Private truths, public lies.	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Book Review							AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION; PREJUDICE; ATTITUDES	Timur Kuran's Private Truths, Public Lies makes a compelling case that people often misrepresent their private preferences in response to veal or imagined social pressures, that the relative power of competing interest groups to punish opinion deviance and reward conformity determines the patterns and pervasiveness of preference falsification, and that preference falsification helps explain such diverse outcomes as the persistence and sudden collapse of communism and the precarious persistence of racial preferences in the United States and of the caste system in India. Although preference falsification is important and raises questions about the legitimacy of the opinions expressed in opinion polls and elections, it does not seem widespread enough to warrant the conclusion that ordinary people lack the courage necessary to make democracy work.

J	Weinstock, DM				Weinstock, DM			The graying of Berlin	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In Isaiah Berlin,John Gray interprets Berlin as having made value pluralism the basis of an anti-rationalist, "agonistic" liberalism. Gray argues that Berlin's value pluralism actually stands in;tension with his liberalism, and that a whole-hearted affirmation of value pluralism should have led him to reject the claim that liberal institutions are morally superior. But Berlin's pluralism is more moderate than that ascribed to him by Gray in that it does not allow for diminishing the value of liberty beyond a certain point. This version of pluralism is move compatible with the objectivity Gray claims for pluralism than is his own version.

J	Hirschman, AO				Hirschman, AO			Melding the public and private spheres: Taking commensality seriously	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Jan Patocka Memorial Lecture	OCT, 1996	INST HUMAN SCI, VIENNA, AUSTRIA		INST HUMAN SCI			Tibor Scitovsky's The Joyless Economy distinguished the pleasure of moving from discomfort to comfort and the pleasure of replacing boredom with stimulation. I have argued that there are also pleasures distinctive to participating in public life. A third form of pleasure belongs to both the private and the public domain: the common meal leads to individual satiation and, as a result of commensality, has important social and public effects. A good example is the banquet in ancient Greece, closely connected to the lottery-tile basic mechanism of Athenian democracy. Brit the common meal can also lead to the degradation of human relations and political life.			Hirschman, AO (corresponding author), INST ADV STUDY, OLDEN LANE, PRINCETON, NJ 08540 USA.

J	Greenfeld, L				Greenfeld, L			The birth of economic competitiveness: Rejoinder	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In ''The Worth of Nations'' I proposed that nationalism was a major factor in the emergence of the modern, growth-oriented economy. In response to criticisms, I demonstrate here the nationalistic inspiration of seventeenth-century English-or British-economic tracts. Urging a reconsideration of earlier approaches (such as that of W.W. Rostow) to the problem of why-rather than how-the modern economy emerged, I agree with Marx Weber's challenge to the naturalness of our proclivity for constant economic expansion, while departing from his explanation for it.

J	ORDESHOOK, PC				ORDESHOOK, PC			ENGINEERING OR SCIENCE - WHAT IS THE STUDY OF POLITICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Green and Shapiro's argument that rational choice theory is too inattentive to substantive matters is well taken. However, their suggestions for future research are unlikely to generate what they seek: an empirically relevant, coherent theory of political processes and a rational choice paradigm that accommodates other perspectives. To achieve this end, we require a clearer understanding of the practical objectives of our discipline and of the difference between modelling and theorizing about politics, and between science and engineering. Until the ''engineering'' component of the discipline assumes a more central role, research-whether theoretical, empirical, or any combination of the two-will continue to generate an incoherent accumulation of theorems, lemmas, correlations, and ''facts.''

J	Kuspit, D				Kuspit, D			Art and capital: An ironic dialectic	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Martha Woodmansee's The Author, Art, and the Market misunderstands the concept of autonomous art: it does not deny art's instrumental role in life, but rather reconceives this role as essentially psychological. The work of art becomes an emblem of self-control, and as such of great social import. But as Richard Goldthwaite's Wealth and the Demand for Art in Italy suggests, this role is traduced by the tendency of capitalism increasingly to eschew the high art exemplified by the Renaissance when there is money to be made in unchallenging, trashy popular culture.

J	LANE, RE				LANE, RE			THE ROAD NOT TAKEN - FRIENDSHIP, CONSUMERISM, AND HAPPINESS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review							SOCIAL NETWORKS; LIFE STRESS; DEPRESSION; LONELINESS; DISORDERS; BEHAVIOR; DISTRESS; ONSET; WORK; SEX	Since the mid-1960s in advanced and vapidly advancing economies, there has been a rising tide of clinical depression and dysphoria, a decline in mutual trust, and a loosening of social bonds. Most studies show that above a minimal level, income is irrelevant to one's sense of well-being, but companionship and social support increase well-being. Since shopping and consumption are increasingly solitary activities, and watching television is not genuinely sociable, the increased time devoted to these activities may be responsible for rising levels of depression. Advanced societies are likely to increase ''utility'' if they maximize friendship rather than the getting and spending of wealth.

J	KYMLICKA, W				KYMLICKA, W			COMMUNITARIANISM, LIBERALISM, AND SUPERLIBERALISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Although Roberto Unger is sometimes described as a communitarian critic of liberalism, his recent three-volume work on Politics disavows the major tenets of contemporary communitarianism-for example, the ''embedded self,'' the critique of rights, the rejection of universalizing theory. Instead, Unger's aim is to criticize liberalism from the perspective of a ''superliberalism''-a perspective which takes the original liberal desire to emancipate individuals from the chains of social custom and hierarchy and rids it of the stultifying economic and political institutions within which liberals have sought to contain it. Three main components of Unger's theory are analyzed: the idea of ''negative capability,'' or the power of individuals to revise and transcend their social contexts; the idea of an ''empowered democracy,'' which seeks to open up all aspects of society to the collective exercise of negative capability; and the idea of ''immunity rights,'' which seek to protect individuals from the potential risks of radical democracy. I argue that all three underestimate the risks to individual liberty of the over-politicization of social life.

J	GREEN, DG				GREEN, DG			MEDICAL-CARE IN BRITAIN BEFORE THE WELFARE-STATE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In Britain before 1911, the vast majority of the population provided medical care for themselves and had evolved a variety of schemes that checked the power of organized medicine and encouraged a steady improvement in standards. The evidence is that at the end of the nineteenth century about 5-6 percent of the population relied on the poor law, 10-15 percent on free care from charitable institutions, 75 percent on mutual aid, and the remainder paid fees to private doctors.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			The Longing for Total Revolution as Critical but Ideational Genealogy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						antiquarianism; critical genealogy; history of ourselves; history of the present; intellectual history; history of political thought; pearl diving; Bernard Yack		Bernard Yack's The Longing for Total Revolution is not just an important study of an extremely influential strain of post-Kantian philosophy, which according to Yack culminated in both Marx and Nietzsche. It also exemplifies an unusual approach to the history of thought: a form of critical genealogy that, unlike the Nietzschean and Foucauldian variants, seeks intellectual charity by ascribing mistaken ideas not to non-ideational psychological or social sources, but to a web of beliefs that would have obscured from fully rational historical actors the mistakenness of the idea being genealogized. This approach to intellectual history can justify the history of thought on logical grounds that are unavailable to those who attempt to justify it on the basis of the inherent interest of the past or the usefulness of intellectual history in providing resources for present-day use.

J	Brennan, J				Brennan, Jason			PROPAGANDA ABOUT PROPAGANDA	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						ideology; political bias; propaganda; pragmatics; voter ignorance; voter irrationality; Jason Stanley		Jason Stanley's How Propaganda Works intends to offer a novel account of what propaganda is, how it works, and what damage it does inside a democratic culture. The book succeeds in showing that, contrary to the stereotype, propaganda need not be false or misleading. However, Stanley offers contradictory definitions of propaganda, and his theory, which is both over- and under-inclusive, is applied in a dismissive, highly ideological way. In the end, it remains unclear how much damage propaganda does. Voters in modern democracies would be ignorant and irrational even without propaganda.

J	Quill, L				Quill, Lawrence			TECHNOLOGICAL CONSPIRACIES: COMTE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SPIRITUAL DESPOTISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Comte; conspiracies; Internet; technology		While there have been numerous critiques of the ideology of technology, it is useful to situate technology within both a liberal and a conspiratorial framework. The early work of Auguste Comte offers an ideal vehicle for this kind of analysis. Liberalism's embrace of technology is developed in Comte to produce a theory of scientific and technical elites intent on reinventing society and the individual. This "technological conspiracy" reads very much like elements of a Silicon Valley manifesto describing the cyber-utopia of a near tomorrow. For these reasons Comte is relevant to a discussion of conspiracy today.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			FREEDOM HAS NO INTRINSIC VALUE: LIBERALISM AND VOLUNTARISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Deontological (as opposed to consequentialist) liberals treat freedom of action as an end in itself, not a means to other ends. Yet logically, when one makes a deliberate choice, one treats freedom of action as if it were not an end in itself, for one uses this freedom as a means to the ends one hopes to achieve through one's action. The tension between deontology and the logic of choice is reflected in the paradoxical nature of the "right to do wrong"; and in Rawls's unsuccessful attempts to justify to acting agents their interest in such a right, embodied in his conception of agents as "self-validating sources of claims." A self-validating source of claims is akin to God as envisioned by voluntarist theologians such as Ockham. Leibniz's critique of voluntarism, then, is applicable to the Rawlsian subject: like the voluntarist God, she would be unable to act if it were indeed the case that her action validated itself.

J	Taber, CS; Lodge, M				Taber, Charles S.; Lodge, Milton			THE SCOPE AND GENERALITY OF AUTOMATIC AFFECTIVE BIASES IN POLITICAL THINKING: REPLY TO THE SYMPOSIUM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							ACTIVATION; ASSIMILATION; POLARIZATION; PSYCHOLOGY; ATTITUDES; TIME; WILL	Our response to this symposium on our 2006 paper centers on three questions. First, what motivations exist in the political wild, and do our experimental manipulations realistically capture them? We agree that strong accuracy motivations are likely (but not certain) to reduce biases, but we are not at all confident that the real world supplies stronger accuracy motivations than our subjects received. Second, how can we square our findings of stubbornly persistent beliefs and attitudes with the well-established literatures on framing and persuasion, which find political opinion to be more malleable? We argue that our John Q. Public theory of political information accounts for both persistence and persuasion and explains when we should expect one or the other. Citizens will be more responsive to contextual information or persuasive appeals when prior feelings are weak, knowledge is sparse, and information is encountered outside of awareness. Resistance to information or arguments is most likely when prior feelings are strong, attitudes are embedded within dense knowledge networks, and appeals are consciously perceived. Third, is belief persistence driven by feelings and emotions, as we claim, or is it more the result of a conviction that one's priors are accurate? We suggest that the distinctions that stand behind this question are suspect. We see in some of our commentators a tendency to align accuracy motivation, central processing, and cognition on one side of the dual-processing framework, with directional motivation, peripheral processing, and feelings on the other side. On the contrary, we argue that beliefs in the truth of one's priors often result from feelings and wishes and are themselves sources of motivated bias in processing new information. Moreover, directional motivations are also often a source of central processing, so it is not easy to disentangle these processes.

CAUSE AND EFFECT: GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The underlying cause of the financial meltdown was much more mundane than a ocrisis of capitalismo: The real origins lay in mostly obscure housing, tax, and regulatory policies of the U.S. government. The Community Reinvestment Act, the affordable-housing omissiono of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, penalty-free refinancing of home loans, penalty-free defaults on home loans, tax preferences for home-equity borrowing, and reduced capital requirements for banks that held mortgages and mortgage-backed securities combined with each other to create the incentives for both subprime lending and the housing bubble that eventually led to the financial collapse.				pwallison@aei.org						AVERY RB, 2000, EC COMMENTARY FE NOV; BENSTON GJ, 1999, POLICY ANAL CATO I, V354; DEMYANYK Y, 2008, SOCIAL SCI RES  0819; ENGLAND RS, 2002, MORTGAGE BANKIN 0201; HOSSAIN RAK, 2004, 200430 U CONN DEP EC; KROSZNER RS, 2008, CONFR POV POL FOR BO; MASON JR, 2007, MARKET COMMENTA 0226; MCKINLEY V, 1994, REGULATION, V17, P32; MUNNELL AH, 1992, 927 FED RES BANK BOS; Temkin Kenneth, 1999, STUDY GSES SINGLE FA; VLASENKO P, 2008, HOME OWNERSHIP US	11	35	35	0	16	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND	0891-3811			CRIT REV	Crit.

J	Fenster, M				Fenster, Mark			On idiocratic theory: Rejoinder to Wisniewski	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							BELIEF SYSTEMS; MASS PUBLICS; IGNORANCE	One of Murray Edelman's most important insights was that understanding public ignorance about politics and policy requires an analysis of how symbolic communication and popular culture shape public knowledge and opinion. Approaches that simply dismiss the public as ignorant or idiotic make a similar error as those that simply embrace the modern public as capable of engaging in the work of a competent demos, insofar as both simply complex social and cultural processes of meaning-making and comprehension. The problem for those who wish to take Edelman's insight seriously-a problem that Edelman failed to resolve-is precisely how to study and theorize the public as something less than deliberative and knowledgeable, but more than simply ignorant.

J	Mellow, N				Mellow, Nicole			The rhetorical presidency and the partisan echo chamber	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The rise of a partisan Congress can aggravate some of the pathologies of the rhetorical presidency identified by Jeffrey Tulis: reckless policy production, and the resulting public disillusionment with an overpromising government. In some cases, such as the debate over the invasion of Iraq, the unified ranks of the president's party amplify the president's simplistic rhetoric, reducing policy deliberation and aggravating public disappointment when reality turns out to be more complex. Mien combined with divided government, however, partisanship can work to produce deliberative compromises that mitigate these pathologies, as exemplified by the welfare-reform legislation enacted by a Republican Congress under a Democratic president in 1996.

J	Eidlin, F				Eidlin, F			Popper's social-democratic politics and free-market liberalism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Holding unlimited economic freedom to be nearly as dangerous as physical violence, Karl Popper advocated '' piecemeanl '' economic intervention by the state. Jeremy Shearmur's recent book on Popper contends that as the philosopher aged, his views grew closer to classical liberalism than those expressed in The Open Society-consistently with what Shearmur sees as the logic of Popper's arguments. But Popper's philosophy, while recognizing that any project aimed at bringing about social change must be immensely complex and fraught with difficulty, retains grounds for hope about the purposeful use of government to bring about desirable social results.

J	Upham, SP				Upham, SP			Is economics scientific? Is science scientific?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The usefulness Of models that describe the world ties in their simplicity relative to what they model. But simplification entails inaccuracy, so models should be treated as provisional. Nancy Cartwright's account of science as a modeling exercise, in which fundamental laws hold true only in theory-not in reality, given the complexities of the real world-suggests that Rational Choice Theory (RCT) should not be rejected on the traditional basis of its lack of realism: that, after all, is to be expected of any simulacrum model. But when RCT has been extended to domains, such as politics, in which there is no necessary reason to expect systemic pressures against people who depart too far from the model, RCT is a simulacrum without any particular claim to expressing underlying causal laws. This cautions against the tendency to rest content with models and to treat their assumptions as if they were true.

J	Forman-Barzilai, F				Forman-Barzilai, F			Adam Smith as globalization theorist	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In the Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith observed that we live in a fundamentally conflictual world. Although he held that we are creatures who sympathize, he also observed that our sympathy seems to be constrained by geographical limits. Accordingly, traditional theories of cosmopolitanism were implausible; yet, as a moral philosopher, Smith attempted to reconcile his bleak description of the world with his eagerness for international peace. Smith believed that commercial intercourse among self-interested nations would emulate sympathy on a global scale, balancing national wealth and international peace without a coercive apparatus to enforce compliance with international law.

J	Ciepley, D				Ciepley, D			Democracy despite voter ignorance: A weberian reply to Somin and Friedman	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Ilya Somin finds in the public's ignorance of policy issues a reason to reduce the size and scope of government. But one cannot restrict the range of issues that may be raised in a democracy without it ceasing to be a democracy. Jeffrey Friedman argues that, since feedback on the quality of private goons is superior to feedback on the quality of public policies, "privatizing" public decisions might improve their quality However the quality of feedback depends upon the nature of the good, not who provides it; and the absence of reliable feedback on a good may actually justify government involvement, to correct information asymmetries. More fundamentally, voter ignorance of policy issues is a problem only if we assume that the point of democracy is to secure voter control of policy. Max Weber, however advocated democracy as the best available mechanism for securing strong and responsible leadership.

J	Humphries, J				Humphries, J			Cliometrics, child labor, and the industrial revolution	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							BRITAIN; FAMILY	Ten years ago, Clark Nardinelli shocked conventional historians by reinterpreting child labor as a sensible response to the Industrial Revolution. Nardinelli's exculpation of child labor follows from the way in which he deploys neoclassical economic theory. How relevant is his neoclassical model to the early industrial economy, and how realistic is methodological individualism to the decisions that sent young children into the appalling work places of early industrial Britain Rather than seeing neoclassical economics as a substitute for historical judgment, as Nardinelli suggests, I propose that we use it critically to probe the meaning and implications of child labor in its historical context.

J	Mayer, T				Mayer, T			Boettke's Austrian critique of mainstream economics: An empiricist's response	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Many of Boettke's criticisms of formalist economics ave justified. However, he defines formalism so broadly that it becomes practically synonymous with mainstream economics, while his criticisms primarily target the sins of formalist economics move narrowly defined. And since he treats Austrian economics as the only viable alternative to mainstream economics, he incorrectly awards victory to Austrian economics. While Austrian economics has some valuable ideas to contribute to mainstream economics, it has serious deficiencies of its own.

J	Hill, G				Hill, G			Solidarity, objectivity, and the human form of life: Wittgenstein vs. Rorty	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Reason, objectivity, and human nature are note suspect ideas. Among postmodern thinkers, Richard Rorty has advanced an especially for forceful critique of these notions. Drawing partly on Wittgenstein's philosophy of language, Rorty contends that objectivity is no more than a metaphysical name for intersubjective agreement, and that "human nature" is; an empty category, there being nothing beneath history and culture. Wittgenstein himself; however, recognized within the world's many civilizations "the common behavior of mankind," without which Rorty's ethnocentric "solidarity" would be inconceivable. This common form of life-the life of those who speak-encompasses countless human activities that presuppose and are interwoven with the concepts of reason and objectivity.

The only proper political doctrine that is compatible with value pluralism is a modus vivendi that ran rake various forms. But in truth, value pluralism does little to diminish the appeal of liberalism. Under modern conditions, any half-decent modus vivendi will look move like liberalism than Gray supposes.

J	Griswold, CL				Griswold, CL			Happiness, tranquillity, and philosophy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Despite the near universal desire for happiness, relatively little philosophy has been done to determine what ''happiness'' means. In this paper I examine happiness (in the long-term sense), and argue that it is best understood in terms of tranquillity. This is not merely ''contentment,'' Rather, happiness requires reflection-the kind of reflection characteristic of philosophy, Happiness is the product of correctly assessing its conditions, and like any assessment, one ran be mistaken, and thus mistaken about whether one is happy That is, one needs a correct understanding of happiness in order to be happy.

J	Greenfeld, L				Greenfeld, L			The modern religion?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Nationalism is an essentially secular form of consciousness, one that, indeed, sacralizes the secular. This renders the temptation to treat it as a religion problematic. The framework of individual and collective identities in modern societies, nationalism both obscures the importance of the transcendental concerns that lie at the core of great religions and undermines their authority. Though instrumental irt the development of nationalism, religion now exists on its sufferance and serves mainly as a tool for the promotion of nationalist ends, not vice versa.

J	DIERMEIER, D				DIERMEIER, D			RATIONAL CHOICE AND THE ROLE OF THEORY IN POLITICAL-SCIENCE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In their survey of empirical research based on rational choice theory, Don Green and Ian Shapiro point to a list of methodological deficiencies or ''pathologies.'' The main problem with Green and Shapiro's list lies in the standards they use to evaluate the achievements of rational choice theory. These standards are derived from a view of empirical research that is deeply questionable and, in the stated form, inconsistent with both standard insights in contemporary philosophy of science and the established practice in the most successful empirical sciences.

J	Singer, P				Singer, P			Is there a universal moral sense?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								There is now increasing evidence for significant ''moral universals'' - that is, patterns of ethical principles that ave recognized by virtually every human society. James Q. Wilson has assembled an engaging collection of this evidence for the existence of a ''moral sense.'' At least in regard to the universality of the key features of sympathy and a sense of fairness or reciprocity, Wilson is right, Indeed, these features due even more universal than Wilson realizes: they extend to our closest nonhuman relatives as well. Yet the claim that these facts are best accounted for by positing the existence of a ''moral sense'' remains vague. Particularly when we consider what Wilson calls ''the universal aspiration,'' the basis of this tendency in our moral thinking is as likely to lie in our capacity to reason as in our moral sentiments.

J	PRYCHITKO, DL				PRYCHITKO, DL			AFTER DAVIDSON, WHO NEEDS THE AUSTRIANS - REPLY TO DAVIDSON	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Paul Davidson asserts that Post Keynesians could fare just as well without insights from their Austrian colleagues. He's wrong. Radical subjectivists within both schools of thought have something to gain through dialogue, as evidenced by the efforts of Kenneth Boulding, G.L.S. Shackle, and Ludwig Lachmann. Many Austrian and Post Keynesian economists share a common methodological principle of radical subjectivism, which emphasizes nonergodic constructs and systems indeterminacy, and each school can gain from the insights of the other when asking such questions as why capitalism generates recessions and depressions and why capitalism generates any degree of order at all.

J	GARRISON, RW				GARRISON, RW			KEYNESIAN SPLENETICS - FROM SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY TO MACROECONOMICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Underlying the analytical framework of Keynes's General Theory is a comparison of capitalism and socialism in terms of risks and consequent rates of interest, rates of investment and capital accumulation, and levels of employment and output. Keynes's social philosophy and corresponding vision of macroeconomic reality biases his comparison in favor of socialism, or, more precisely, in favor of ''a comprehensive socialisation of investment.'' Recognizing the significant influence of Keynes's early social philosophy on his subsequent macroeconomics-which is firmly established by Allan Meltzer's ''different'' interpretation of Keynes-refocuses criticism of Keynes's analytics, provides a basis for assessing other interpretations of the General Theory, and helps account for the absence of reconciliation among the modern recastings of Keynesian macroeconomics.

J	Ferrari, D				Ferrari, Diogo			Material Heuristics and Attitudes Toward Redistribution	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						material heuristics; material self-interest; self-serving reasoning; heuristics; redistribution	HELP EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY; PUBLIC-OPINION; SOCIAL-CLASS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; INFORMATION; INEQUALITY; PARTISAN; WELFARE; PREFERENCES; DEMAND	According to the material-heuristics hypothesis, people's socioeconomic position affects their perceptions about the socioeconomic environment, including how society distributes opportunities and rewards and to what extent people are responsible for their own economic situation. These perceptions, in turn, affect attitudes toward wealth redistribution. In contrast to the material-heuristics hypothesis are the more familiar material self-interest hypothesis, which relates redistributive attitudes to one's personal interest in gaining or losing from redistribution; and the self-serving reasoning hypothesis, according to which perceptions of how society distributes opportunities and rewards are a consequence rather than a cause of attitudes toward redistribution, which are, in turn, driven by material self-interest. All three hypotheses connect socioeconomic position and attitudes toward redistribution, but only the material-heuristics and the self-serving reasoning arguments account for why perceptions of the causes of wealth and poverty vary across economic groups and why this variation matters for attitudes toward redistribution. Ignoring the role of such perceptions can lead to the simplistic attribution of attitudes toward redistribution to personal self-interest.

J	MacGilvray, E				MacGilvray, Eric			The Spiral of Responsibility and the Pressure to Conflict	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						democratic technocracy; pressure to predict; pressure to conflict; spiral of conviction; spiral of responsibility; technocracy; John Dewey; Walter Lippmann; Max Weber		This essay calls attention to two blind spots in Power Without Knowledge. First, the book has little to say about the role that political institutions can play in promoting effective democratic governance. Drawing on the "mixed government" tradition, I argue that properly designed institutions can correct for the epistemic deficits that Friedman describes by creating what I call the "pressure to conflict." Second and more importantly, the book has nothing to say about the role of responsible leadership in a democratic technocracy. Drawing on Max Weber's analysis of the ethics of responsibility and the ethics of conviction, I argue that responsible leadership can promote judicious technocracy in a dynamic that I call the "spiral of responsibility." The responsible leader recognizes that to recuse oneself from the exercise of technocratic power is to empower the unscrupulous and irresponsible. According to Weber, any theory of politics that fails to embrace the ethics of responsibility will therefore occupy an uneasy middle ground between quietism and enthusiasm. This, I fear, is where Power Without Knowledge may leave us.

J	Beiner, R				Beiner, Ronald			The Plague of Bannonism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Steve Bannon; Donald Trump; alt-right; Catholic right; fascism; ideology; paleoconservatism; Trumpism		Donald Trump?s thinking is too erratic and scattershot to count as a real system of ideas. Steve Bannon?s version of populism seems significantly more focused, more self-conscious, and hence more open to theory-based critical analysis, which this paper attempts to provide. That is not at all to say, however, that Bannon?s ideas achieve intellectual coherence or consistency. Close examination of the defining components of his worldview suggest the opposite. Still, engagement with contemporary right-populism cannot, or should not, avoid Bannon and his attempts to cook up a new ideology.

J	Bailey, JD				Bailey, Jeremy D.			Populism and Presidential Representation	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Constitution; presidency; presidential representation; plebiscitary democracy		Populism raises questions about the extent to which public opinion should be a legitimate foundation for executive power. In the United States, it is often thought, such a foundation was established at the beginning of the twentieth century through the creation of a newly "representative" modern presidency (one that enabled the president to represent the popular will). This new presidency, it is held, acts as an agent of populist majorities to undermine constitutional and legal norms. In fact, however, the argument for presidential representation is a long-standing element of politics in the United States. It is appealed to, recurrently, by what might be called the party of opinion against its natural opponent, the party of law.

J	Dufek, P				Dufek, Pavel			Democracy as Intellectual Taste? Pluralism in Democratic Theory	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						cognitive diversity; deep diversity; democracy; democratic theory; meta-consensus; peer disagreement; public justification	EPISTEMIC DEMOCRACY; POLITICAL-THEORY; DISAGREEMENT; PHILOSOPHY; CONSENSUS; SCIENCE; VOLUME; SMART	The normative and metanormative pluralism that figure among core self-descriptions of democratic theory, which seem incompatible with democratic theorists' practical ambitions, may stem from the internal logic of research traditions in the social sciences and humanities and from the conceptual structure of political theory itself. One way to deal productively with intradisciplinary diversity is to appeal to the idea of a meta-consensus; another is to appeal to the argument from cognitive diversity that fuels recent work on epistemic democracy. For different reasons, both strategies fail, such that a metatheoretical step-aside may be desirable, one that entails modeling democratic theory after the public justification approach.

J	Mendelberg, T				Mendelberg, Tali			From the Folk Theory to Symbolic Politics: Toward a More Realistic Understanding of Voter Behavior	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Christopher Achen; Larry Bartels; Murray Edelman; group identity; social identity; symbolic politics	SELF-INTEREST; INFORMATION; OPPOSITION; ATTITUDES	Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels's Democracy for Realists makes a persuasive case that standard theories of democracy rest on shaky empirical ground, and that optimistically interpreted empirical findings about public competence do not save the day. However, I argue that the solution does not lie with theories of elite competition or accountability to other institutions. Instead, I turn to theories of symbolic politics. These theories capture the empirical reality of how voters engage with politics and make decisions. While they tend to emphasize human irrationality, they also contain the potential for a symbolic kind of rationality that could provide a solid foundation for democratic politics.

J	Landauer, M				Landauer, Matthew			Democracy, Voter Ignorance, and the Limits of Foot Voting	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Ilya Somin; foot voting; democracy; rational ignorance; political ignorance; decentralization; limited government		In Democracy and Political Ignorance, Ilya Somin argues that the supposed informational advantages of "foot voting"-exercising exit options and making market-based choices-over voting at the ballot box tell in favor of decentralizing and limiting government. But the evidence Somin offers for the superiority of "foot voting," based on an analysis of the politics of the Jim Crow-era South, is unpersuasive and internally inconsistent. Second, even if Somin is correct that foot voters have greater incentives to acquire information than ballot-box voters do, this would not in itself be a good reason to favor foot voting. For Somin shows little interest in considering why we might value democratic decision making. Thus, Somin's argument is unlikely to persuade anyone not already committed to the superiority of market-based solutions to social and political problems.

J	Meskill, D				Meskill, David			CONCEPTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF LIBERTY: FROM SMITH AND MILL TO LIBERTARIAN PATERNALISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Isaiah Berlin distinguished between negative liberty, which is freedom from external coercion, and positive liberty, the freedom to master oneself. But the schema is too simple. Adam Smith thought that God had harmoniously arranged the world in such a way that the freedom provided by our negative liberty tended to redound to the public good. Mill, worried about the deleterious effects of public ignorance, accorded elites a prominent role in ensuring that negative liberty would lead to positive results. More recently, libertarian paternalists, such as Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, have argued that research on biases and heuristics demonstrates the need for psychologically informed elites to direct negative liberty toward positive ends by crafting better "choice contexts." In these thinkers one can discern a third version of liberty, where negative liberty is not an end in itself but a means, however insufficient, to positive outcomes.

J	Hochschild, JL				Hochschild, Jennifer L.			SHOULD THE MASS PUBLIC FOLLOW ELITE OPINION? IT DEPENDS ...	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								John Zaller's finding that members of the public usually follow elites' cues may seem normatively disturbing. If true, it might be taken to obviate the need for democracy or to show that elites are manipulating the public. However, as long as the public sometimes fails to follow elites, we can judge cases of public followership according to independent criteria, such as whether the public's occasional rebellions against elite opinion further liberal-democratic or utilitarian purposes. A review of some prominent cases of mass followership of and mass divergence from elite opinion suggests that public opinion that is independent of elite leadership is neither an unmitigated good nor an unmitigated problem for a well-ordered polity.

J	Kam, CD				Kam, Cindy D.			THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VERACITY OF ZALLER'S MODEL	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							STEREOTYPE ACTIVATION; AUTOMATICITY; INFORMATION; COGNITION; NEED; AVAILABILITY; MOTIVATION; ATTITUDES; THINKING; OPINION	Zaller's model of public-opinion formation portrays the average citizen as an automaton who responds unthinkingly to elite cues. That is, once people have received information from political elites, they tend to abide by whatever their respective cue-givers dictate, since rejecting information is more cognitively costly than simply accepting it. Empirical research in psychology on priming supports this view of the citizen as a passive receiver of information. For example, people are likely to be unconsciously influenced by subtle cues and they tend to base their opinions on the accessibility of information in memory. However, some citizens, under certain conditions, may be active processors of information: actively interpreting it, elaborating on its implications, and negotiating its meaning. Whether or not Zaller's model is an accurate representation of the process of public-opinion formation depends substantially upon the inclusiveness of the researcher's views about what constitutes public opinion and how to study its determinants.

J	Mueller, DC				Mueller, Dennis C.			THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF-INTEREST AND PUBLIC INTEREST IN POLITICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In its attempt to prove that voters, politicians, and bureaucrats are motivated by the public interest, Self-Interest and Public Interest in Western Politics overlooks a great deal of public-choice research, to which much has been added during the two decades since it was published. The importance of self-interest at both the micro and macro levels of politics becomes clear once one looks not simply at the "inputs" of a democracy but at its "outputs" as well. The prevalence of interest groups, the dysfunction of the United States tax code, the lobbying by unions for their members' self-interest, the earmarks in the Patriot Act, the numerous cases of corruption in Western democracies, and the dissatisfaction of citizens with their governments' failings all point to the importance of self-interest in politics.

The case for democracy that he attacks is primarily an academic exercise, which makes his argument against that case also an academic exercise. The supposed policy choice that Caplan presents between the market and democracy is not the correct choice, and the notion that economists should be given more voting weight in the democratic decision process is normatively inappropriate.

J	Craiutu, A				Craiutu, A			Guizot's elitist theory of representative government	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In nineteenth-century Europe, democracy was not embraced with the same enthusiasm it now enjoys. Conservative critics questioned central democratic normative principles, while liberals tried to correct the limitations Of actual democratic practice. While accepting the inevitability of democracy, nineteenth-century liberals often resisted the idea that universal suffrage guaranteed the wisdom of the people's choices. Nothing better illustrates this difficult apprenticeship of democracy than the writings of Francois Guizot, whose political thought focuses on the relationship between liberalism and democracy.

The consequence of this approach is to blur basic political categories such as the state, political power, culture, and political creed. Moreover, while Waiter clearly prefers an immigrant society as embodying the practice of toleration move fully than any other regime, he fails to identify either its cultural or its political preconditions.

Cohen	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In Simple Rules for a Complex World, I outlined a set of legal rules that facilitate just and efficient social interactions among individuals. Frederick Schauer's critique of my book ignores the specific implications of my system in favor of a general critique of simplicity that overlooks the dangers to liberty when complex rules confer vast discretion on public figures. He also does not refer to the nonlibertarian features of my system that allow for overcoming holdout positions. These "take and pay" rules explain how a system broadly protective of private property responds to well-known two-person (Able-Infirm) hypotheticals of the sort advanced by G. A. Cohen, which are designed to show how claims of self-ownership lend strong support to egalitarian outcomes.

However, their boredom is much more serious than what the book dealt with, because it is chronic and often incurable. It usually begins with the neglect of destitute children who never learn how to concentrate on learning in school, become unruly and often end up unemployable, and have no better way than violence to release their energies.

J	Steele, DR				Steele, DR			Between immorality and unfeasibility: The market socialist predicament	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The recent proliferation of economically informed writings favoring market socialism exhibits dissonances in this evolving theoretical orientation. The ethical presuppositions of classical socialism have often been inherited by those who now embrace markets under serialism. But precisely because it accepts markets, market socialism may prove incompatible with these sentiments.

J	Xenos, N				Xenos, N			Civic nationalism: Oxymoron?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Recent attempts to distinguish a normatively acceptable ''civic nationalism''-as distinct from an irrationally tainted ''ethnic nationalism''-have failed to take seriously the implications of the transition from the city as the immediate spatial unit of the patria to the more abstract national state that replaced it. The nation-state has required a mythologizing naturalism to legitimate it, thus blurring the distinction between ''civic'' and ''ethnic.'' The urban political experience of the patria is lost to us; cosmopolitan intellectuals should resist the comforting temptation to recover it in the nation, and should recognize civic nationalism for the oxymoron it is.

J	ABELSON, RP				ABELSON, RP			THE SECRET EXISTENCE OF EXPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The rational choice assumption that any chosen behavior can be understood as optimizing material self-interest is not borne out by psychological research. Expressive motives, for example, are prominent in the symbols of politics, in social relationships, and in the arts of persuasion. Moreover, instrumentality is a mindset that is learned (perhaps overlearned), and can be situationally manipulated; because it is valued in our society, it provides a privileged vocabulary for justifying behaviors that may have been performed for other reasons, and encourages the illusory belief in the universality of rational choice.

J	LANE, RE				LANE, RE			WHAT RATIONAL CHOICE EXPLAINS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Rational choice theories have been falsified by experimental tests of economic behavior and have not been supported by analyses of behavior in the market. Politics is an even less fertile field of application for rational choice theories because politics deals with ends as well as means, thus preventing ends-means rationality; voters have par tisan loyalties often ''fixed'' in adolescence; political benefits have no common unit of measurement; ''rational ignorance'' inhibits rational choices; and there is no market like feedback to facilitate learning. Research comparing public and private efficiency does not support rational choice. Ironically, while law and business schools are now employing better microeconomic theories, political scientists are taking up rational choice theory, regardless of the disconfirming evidence.

J	WILSON, JQ				WILSON, JQ			WEALTH AND HAPPINESS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In The Market Experience, Robert Lane restates the central criticism of economic views of human satisfaction-namely, that they define welfare as utility and, in practice if not in theory, use money as the measure of utility, while in reality utility (or welfare) ought to be defined as happiness. In exploring the implications of this noneconomic definition for our assessment of markets, Lane summarizes the evidence about how people assess their own happiness move successfully than he clarifies the meaning of that word. Since increases in income above a certain minimum do not increase happiness, work must be made more meaningful.

J	ELLIS, RJ				ELLIS, RJ			THE CASE FOR CULTURAL THEORY - REPLY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review							MOVEMENT; HISTORY	In an essay in these pages, Jeffrey Friedman charged that Cultural Theory obscures the unity and uniqueness of modern egalitarian individualism, reduces culture to society; ignores history; is only applicable to contemporary, Western politics; provides an unsatisfactory account of preference formation and preference change, and leaves no place for the vitally important debate over what we should prefer. Although some of Friedman's criticisms stem from a misreading or strained reading of Cultural Theory, others raise vitally important questions not only about Cultural Theory but social theory generally. My reply to Friedman offers not just a defense of the particular categorization of cultures used in Cultural Theory, but a defense of the entire enterprise of constructing general social theories that seek to discern transhistorical patterns in the all too evident diversity and contingency of history.

J	FRIEDMAN, J				FRIEDMAN, J			AFTER LIBERTARIANISM - REJOINDER TO NARVESON, MCCLOSKEY, FLEW, AND MACHAN	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Postlibertarianism means abandoning defenses of the intrinsic justice of laissez-faire capitalism, the better to investigate whether the systemic consequences of interfering with capitalism are severe enough to justify laissez-faire. Any sound case for laissez-faire is likely to build on postlibertarian research, for the conviction that laissez-faire, is intrinsically just rests upon unsound philosophical assumptions. Conversely, these assumptions, if sound, would make empirical studies of capitalism by libertarian scholars superfluous. Moreover, postmodern approaches to ''libertarianism '' perpetuate the same assumptions, in the guise of a critique of the rationalist hubris that has supposedly led to the tragedies of the twentieth century. The ''libertarian '' and postmodernist critics of postlibertarianism either ignore the assumptions undergirding their views, or they contend that these assumptions are not necessary when ''freedom'' and ''morality'' are properly defined. The latter contention amounts to an attempt to define the challenge to ''libertarianism'' out of existence.

J	Uscinski, JE; Enders, AM				Uscinski, Joseph E.; Enders, Adam M.			What is a Conspiracy Theory and Why Does it Matter?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						conspiracy theories; post-truth; journalism; fake news; epistemology	MEDIA; POLARIZATION	Growing concern has been expressed that we have entered a "post-truth" era in which each of us willfully believes whatever we choose, aided and abetted by alternative and social media that spin alternative realities for boutique consumption. A prime example of the belief in alternative realities is said to be acceptance of "conspiracy theories"--a term that is often used as a pejorative to indict claims of conspiracy that are so obviously absurd that only the unhinged could believe them. The epistemological standard often involved in this indictment, however-the standard of "obvious" falsity-invites subjectivity in its application, because what is obviously false to one person can be common sense to another. This is not just a truism; considerable research suggests that people's political beliefs, in general, and their acceptance or rejection of conspiracy theories in particular, tends in large part to be determined by partisan, ideological, and other priors.

J	Smith, SB				Smith, Steven B.			Isaiah Berlin and Leo Strauss: Notes Toward a Dialogue	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						behavioralism; Isaiah Berlin; political science; political philosophy; statecraft; Leo Strauss		Berlin and Strauss shared surprisingly compatible views about four matters of great importance. The first is the need for political philosophy, which Berlin traced to value pluralism and Strauss to the inherent incompleteness and contestability of our knowledge of politics, due to its comprehensive nature. Second, Berlin and Strauss each opposed social-scientific positivism: Berlin, because it contradicts human freedom and responsibility; Strauss, because it depends on an untenable and nihilistic distinction between facts and values. Third, both philosophers wished to place, in the ground currently occupied by positivist political science, the study of statecraft, embodied in such figures as Churchill and FDR. Finally, Berlin and Strauss agreed on what characterizes such statesmen: an intuitive, pretheoretical practical judgment of political particulars.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			Populists as Technocrats	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						citizen-technocrats; democratic technocracy; epistemic populism; epistocracy; nationalism; populism; post-truth; pragmatistic technocracy; technocracy; xenophobia; Ross Perot; Donald Trump		An intellectually charitable understanding of populism might begin by recognizing that, since populist citizens tend to be politically uninformed and lacking in higher education, populist ideas are likely to be inarticulate reproductions of the tacit assumptions undergirding non-populist or "mainstream" culture rather than stemming from explicit theoretical constructs, such as an apotheosis of the unity or the will of "the people." What features of our ambient culture, then, could explain the simplistic and combative approach that populists seem to take to politics and policy, their impatience with political debate and deliberation, their willingness to set aside democratic legal forms and political norms, their nationalism, their personalization of politics, their inclination toward conspiracy theorizing, their fondness for fringe sources of information, and their suspicion of political, scientific, and media elites? Using focus group and survey data, we can understand these populist traits as reflections of the culture of "democratic technocracy": a regime in which we, the people, are assumed capable of rendering sound judgments about how to solve our social and economic problems. Whether or not this assumption is warranted, its cultural dominance seems likely to generate the ideas that populist citizens apparently take for granted.

J	Barndt, W				Barndt, Will			Populism in America: Christopher Lasch, Bell Hooks, and the Persistence of Democratic Possibility	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						populism; democratic theory; bell hooks; Christopher Lasch		Debates about "populism" in recent years have used thin understandings of the term, which conceal theoretically richer possibilities.

J	Espejo, PO				Espejo, Paulina Ochoa			The Border Wall as a Populist Challenge	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						borders; border wall; left populism; populism; right populism; Trump; xenophobia; walls; global warming; territory		Most critics of the U.S.-Mexico border wall assume that it represents the xenophobic nationalism typical of right populism. However, the populist message of exclusion is directed not at migrants but at the liberal democrats who compose the traditional mainstream of politics. The wall's populist message is meant to expose a contradiction: liberal democrats do not know how to reconcile borders with their official commitment to universal inclusion. Right populism and left populism, too exploit this contradiction. Liberal democracy could effectively respond to the populist challenge, however, by using the wall's symbolic connection to geography and the environment.

J	Achen, CH; Bartels, LM				Achen, Christopher H.; Bartels, Larry M.			Government for the People: A Reply to the Symposium	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Democracy for Realists; democratic accountability; folk theory of democracy; partisanship; pluralism; political interests; retrospective voting; social identities	KNOWLEDGE	If representative democracy is not about elected officials responding directly to voters' preferences, and if the voters do a poor job of voting their interests in referendums, then what is democracy about? In our view, a satisfactory theory of democracy would focus normatively on the social identities and political interests of citizens rather than on their expressed policy preferences, and empirically on the ability of organized or attentive groups to get those identities and interests effectively recognized and acted on in the governmental process. A group-theoretic version of democratic theory along these lines would dispense with the most important illusions of the conventional folk theory of democracy. However, much hard work remains to clarify how actual democracies make policy and to construct a wise normative standardinspirational but not innocentagainst which they can be judged.

CONSPIRACY THEORIES IN THE UNITED STATES: MORE COMMONPLACE THAN EXTRAORDINARY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						conspiracy theory; ideology; partisanship; political predispositions		In American Conspiracy Theories, Joseph E. Uscinski and Joseph M. Parent provide an important corrective to empirical work suggesting that conspiracy theories are the domain of paranoids. The authors provide convincing evidence that conspiracy endorsement is a motivated-reasoning process that connects conspiracy theories that buttress psychologically threatened identities to the ideological worldviews of those who feel anxious, alienated, or powerless.

J	Shah, R				Shah, Rajiv			MORGAN'S MINIMALISM: AN EPISTEMIC APPROACH TO CONTRACT LAW	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						epistemic capacity of courts; instrumental legal theory; Jonathan Morgan; judicial expertise; legal minimalism; moral promissory theory; right to do wrong	BUSINESS; FREEDOM	Lawyers tend to fall into two categories. Some argue that the law should reflect our moral duties to each other. Seen that way, law is a form of applied ethics, and the social sciences should play only a very limited role in the reasoning of legal scholars. Others argue that the law should be developed consistently with the conclusions of social science, arguing, for example, that the task of the law is to maximize economic efficiency, such that law must conform to economists' conclusions about which rules are the most efficient. Jonathan Morgan rejects both of those approaches. He does not think that the law should mimic our moral duties, but he is also skeptical about the utility of social sciences in predicting the effects of law. He also argues that courts are not institutionally competent to deal with social-science evidence. However, he does not conclude that the social sciences must be rejected by legal scholarship. He himself uses them to establish that law is generally not needed to govern ongoing commercial relationships, that it is required only when such relationships break down, and that courts should focus on resolving such breakdowns as simply and predictably as possible. Based on those considerations, he sketches a minimalist vision of contract law and argues that it is the best we can hope for.

J	Christiano, T				Christiano, Thomas			Voter Ignorance Is Not Necessarily a Problem	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						limited government; Ilya Somin; information shortcuts; intellectual division of labor; heuristics; democracy; democratic theory	DEMOCRACY	Ilya Somin's case for smaller government and "foot voting" rests on at least two questionable assumptions. The first is that voter ignorance is based on rational calculation. This assumption requires arbitrary stipulations about the degree of voter altruism and the low values voters assign to the victory of their candidates. The second is that voter ignorance betokens bad public policy. But there is plenty of evidence to the contrary. How can this be the case? One explanation is that individually ignorant voters are small pieces of a large system that divides intellectual labor through discussions among elites, opinion leaders, and ordinary citizens. This system may entitle voters to trust in the opinions of others, sparing them the need to be well informed.

But none substantially undermine its main thesis: that rational political ignorance and rational irrationality are major problems for democracy that are best addressed by limiting and decentralizing government power. Part I of this reply addresses criticisms of my analysis of the problem of political ignorance and its causes. Part II assesses challenges to my proposed solution.

J	Lister, A				Lister, Andrew			THE "MIRAGE" OF SOCIAL JUSTICE: HAYEK AGAINST (AND FOR) RAWLS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							RIGHTS	There is an odd proximity between Hayek, hero of the libertarian right, and Rawls, theorist of social justice, because, at the level of principle, Hayek was in some important respects a Rawlsian. Although Hayek said that the idea of social justice was nonsense, he argued against only a particular principle of social justice, one that Rawls too rejected, namely distribution according to individual merit. Any attempt to make reward and merit coincide, Hayek argued, would undermine the market's price system, leaving us all poorer and less free. Like Rawls, Hayek held that we should assess social institutions from behind a veil of ignorance, and he thought that doing so pushed us toward egalitarianism. Most of the distance between Hayek and Rawls at the level of policy stems from Hayek's optimism about the operation of markets, his equivocation about the meaning of central concepts, and his appeal to under-argued slippery slopes. Hayek wavered, however, between claiming that private property and markets benefit everyone, compared to the feasible alternatives, and the principle that they maximize the opportunities of a randomly selected member of society, i.e., aggregate opportunity. Contemporary Hayekians claim that capitalism raises the position of the worst off in the long run, in future generations, whereas Rawlsians insist that inequalities between social positions should benefit the worst off now.

J	Robb, R				Robb, Richard			AN EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Imagine, as most economists do, that financial-market participants understand the basic structure of the world: While they cannot predict the future with certainty, they are endowed with knowledge of the possible outcomes of their actions and the probability that each of those outcomes will occur. Given these assumptions, if bankers, regulators, investors, and rating agencies were rational, we may conclude that the financial crisis was caused by poor incentives: These actors must have knowingly jeopardized their institutions and the global economy to pursue private gain. Alternatively, market participants, caught up in the mania of crowds, may have irrationally ignored risks of which they were aware and of which they knew the correct probability. Neither of these explanations for the financial crisis stands up to the evidence, since both explanations assume that the participants knew the U.S. housing market was about to crash. A fresh look at the data five years later suggests that they were ignorant of this fact, and that they acted rationally (or at least reasonably) in light of what they (thought that they) knew. This allows a more nuanced understanding of how financial institutions ended up in bedlam, why credit markets collapsed, and why they took so long to recover.

J	Jammulamadaka, N; Varman, R				Jammulamadaka, Nimruji; Varman, Rahul			IS NGO DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE MISTARGETED? AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL APPROACH	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								An empirical analysis of the relationship between oobjectively assessed needo and the formation of NGOs in Andhra Pradesh, India, suggests that the former is not a significant trigger for the latter. The formation of NGOs appears to be a response to perceptions of need that are so far removed from the local level that they fail to prioritize amongst levels and locations of poverty. In the absence of objective feedback mechanisms, the globaland therefore indiscriminateperspective of international funding sources may help explain the lack of correspondence between need and NGO location, combined with the inevitably limited and blinkered knowledge of regional disparities that can be obtained through local NGOs. This preliminary oepistemologicalo approach to the question of the sub-optimal formation of NGOs is buttressed by consideration of the factors that may bring perception, reality, and organizational responses into better alignment when natural disasters occur, namely the factors that make natural disasters compelling news stories, unlike chronic underdevelopment.

J	Crockett, DA				Crockett, David A.			The layered rhetorical presidency	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The Rhetorical Presidency, with its critique ofRichard Neustadt's Presidential Power, exemplifies the sectarian strife that sometimes marks presidency studies. Yet Tulis's own layered-text metaphor, in which the rhetorical presidency is superimposed upon the earlier constitutional office, also suggests how different approaches to the presidency can build upon each other. To the most foundational approach-the constitutional level of analysis-can be added historical, institutional, organizational, and operational layers. This pyramidal model places Neustadt's operational analysis in art appropriate position: subordinate, but still valuable.

J	Daglier, U; Schneider, TE				Daglier, Uener; Schneider, Thomas E.			John Stuart Mill's "Religion of Humanity" revisited	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								John Stuart Mill's posthumously published Three Essays on Religion have been seen as standing in a problematical relationship with his better-known works, especially On Liberty, which emphasize the negative sides of Mill's approach to religion. The Three Essays are less easy to characterize. A careful reading shows Mill's concern to subject religious views to rational scrutiny, but also to acknowledge the important and largely beneficent role religion has played, and presumably will continue to play, in human affairs. This role will not, Mill predicts, continue to be that of keeping selfish impulses in check. Rather, it will be to inspire people to assist a benevolent but, plainly, less-than-omniscient deity; and, as well, to spark an imaginative identification with an ongoing process of intellectual and moral perfection that transcends our mortal lives.

Whether the rhetorical presidency birthed or simply predated the rhetorical judiciary is open to question. The existence of the rhetorical judiciary is not. Since the publication of The Rhetorical Presidency, judges and their interlocutors have ratified one of the insights that grounded Tulis's question, while challenging another. They have borne out his fear that judges would increasingly respond to attack; his worry about the vacuity of confirmation hearings for those nominated to the Supreme Court, however, has not been similarly confirmed.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			Democratic competence in normative and positive theory: Neglected implications of "the nature of belief systems in mass publics"	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Editorial Material							AMERICAN POLITICAL-DEVELOPMENT; STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL; PARTY IDENTIFICATION; CANDIDATE EVALUATION; POLICY PREFERENCES; ATTITUDE SYSTEMS; OPINION RESEARCH; VOTER IGNORANCE; SURVEY RESPONSE; STATE AUTONOMY	"The Nature of Belief Systems" sets forth a Hobson's choice between rule by the politically ignorant masses and rule by the ideologically constrained-which is to say, the doctrinaire-elites. On the one hand, lacking comprehensive cognitive structures, such as ideological "belief systems," with which to understand politics, most people learn distressingly little about it. On the other hand, a spiral of conviction seems to make it difficult for the highly informed few to see any aspects of politics but those that confirm the cognitive structures that organize their political perceptions. This is a troubling situation for any consequentialist democratic political theory, according to which what is crucial is the electorate's (and subsidiary decision makers) ability to make informed policy judgments, not their possession of willful but uninformed political "attitudes. " Any political theorist who does not take democracy to be an end in itself (regardless of its consequences) should be concerned about Converse's findings.				edcritrev@gmail.com						ABELSON RP, 1988, AM PSYCHOL, V43, P267, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.43.4.267; ABELSON RP, 1976, RATIONALITY SOCIAL S; ABELSON RP, 1967, READINGS ATTITUDE TH; ACHEN CH, 1975, AM POLIT SCI REV, V69, P1218, DOI 10.2307/1955282; Achen Christopher H, 2002, ANN M AM POL SCI ASS; Ackerman B., 2004, DELIBERATION DAY; Aldrich, 1995, WHY PARTIES; ALDRICH JH, 1993, AM J POLIT SCI, V37, P246, DOI 10.2307/2111531; Almond G.A., 1963, CIVIC CULT, DOI DOI 10.1515/9781400874569; Althaus SL, 2006, CRIT REV, V18, P75, DOI 10.1080/08913810608443651; Althaus ScottL., 2003, COLLECTIVE PREFERENC; ALTHAUS SL, 2001, COMMUNICATION US ELE; Anderson J.R., 1983, ARCHITECTURE COGNITI; [Anonymous], 1985, PERSONAL PRESIDENT P; [Anonymous], DEMOCRACY AM; [Anonymous], 1984, STRONG DEMOCRACY; [Anonymous], 1996, STRENGTH PEOPLE IDEA; [Anonymous], 1986, ACTUAL MINDS POSSIBL, DOI DOI 10.4159/9780674029019; [Anonymous], 1996, ACCOUNTING TASTES, DOI DOI 10.4159/9780674020658; [Anonymous], 2002, HEURISTICS BIASES PS, DOI DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511808098; [Anonymous], 1969, 2 CONCEPTS LIBERTY; [Anonymous], 2001, POLITICS MISINFORMAT; [Anonymous], 1970, EXIT VOICE LOYALTY R, DOI DOI 10.3917/RCE.002.0244; [Anonymous], 1989, KNOWLEDGE IS POWER D; Apter David E., 1964, IDEOLOGY DISCONTENT; ASHER H, 1983, POLITICAL SCI STATE; BACHRACH P, 1962, AM POLIT SCI REV, V56, P947, DOI 10.2307/1952796; Bachrach P., 1975, PARTICIPATION POLITI; BAFUMI J, 2003, ANN M MIDW POL SCI A; BAFUMI J, 2004, ANN M AM POL SCI ASS; Baker, 1998, AFFAIRS PARTY POLITI; Balbus ID, 1971, POLIT SOC, V1, P151; BARDES BA, 2007, PUBLIC OPINION MEASU; Barkai Avraham, 1990, NAZI EC IDEOLOGY THE; Bartels L.

J	Bell, DA				Bell, DA			Class, consciousness, and the fall of the bourgeois revolution	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							FRENCH-REVOLUTION; PREREVOLUTIONARY FRANCE; 3RD-CENTURY; ORIGINS	The Mexican vulgate, which long dominated the historiography of the French Revolution, and which was broadly accepted in the social sciences, is no longer sustainable. But newer attempts to frame the issue of class in entirely linguistic terms, producing the claim that France had no bourgeoisie because few people explicitly described themselves as "bourgeois," are not entirely convincing. The Revolution brought into being, and helped to sustain, a new social group: the "state bourgeoisie," which defined itself by its education and by state service, and which was socially cohesive and exclusive. Thus, the Revolution can be seen as "bourgeois" not in the sense of having been caused by a rising bourgeoisie, but in the sense that it caused one to rise.

J	Feallsanach, A				Feallsanach, A			Locke and libertarian property rights	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In his "Freedom, Self-Ownership, and Libertarian Philosophical Diaspora,"Justin Weinberg attempts to show, by using arguments from G.A. Cohen, that philosophical defenses of libertarian natural rights ave doomed to failure, because they ave either circular (by basing libertarianism on the value of "freedom") or invalid (by basing libertarianism on a self-ownership premise that actually leads to some form of egalitarianism). In fact, however a natural-rights libertarianism based on the self-ownership premise is not inconsistent if it holds that the earth is initially unowned, rather than collectively owned by all humanity. Under this thesis, the self-ownership assumption may lead to libertarianism, though other hurdles (such as social-contract theory) stand in the way.

Contrary to Abell's assertions, my book neither champions a postmodern case for self-management, nor does it try to salvage a socialist case for self-management by focusing on Marx's humanism, Self-managed firms require markets, It may be interesting to ask if that saves Mam, or if that also requires postmodernity, but these were not the concerns or arguments of the book.

J	Bender, T				Bender, T			Clients or citizens?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								John McKnight's The Careless Society tellingly exposes the ways the professionalized welfare state creates dependency But McKnight is too quick to condemn this result as the product of professional self-interest, and to posit as the alternative a selfless, republican model of community. He overlooks the more realistic possibility that the pursuit of their interests by social groups empowered to take cave of themselves would better serve those interests, and would simultaneously create a feeling of interdependence and civic responsibility.

J	Weissberg, R				Weissberg, R			The real marketplace of ideas	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							DECISIONS	''The marketplace of ideas'' is a powerful legal and political metaphor-a bulwark of an open, liberal society-that suggests a positivistic debate utilizing reason and evidence. In reality however, the marketplace of ideas often consists of illogic and bad evidence, producing clutter and confusion. The parallel with scientific research is misinformed. Evidence from collective decision-making and small group studies cast grave doubts on the ''marketplace's'' ability to maximize truth.

Yet in society deviance is more often than not condemned. Our apparently contradictory attitudes toward artistic and social deviance are explicable in light of the conservative nature of institutions and the nature of comprehensibility and psychiatry.

First, we dispute the basis for his dismissal of Austrian economics as presented by O'Driscoll and Rizzo. In particular, we reject his claim, dictated entirely by his Post Keynesian perspective, concerning an ''identical axiomatic foundation'' of Austrian and neoclassical economics. Second, we seek to show that Davidson's criticism Of neoclassicism (and by implication of Austrianism) is based on a superficial, incorrect, and outmoded reading of neoclassical economics.

J	ARMENTANO, DT				ARMENTANO, DT			ANTI-ANTITRUST - IDEOLOGY OR ECONOMICS - REPLY TO SCHERER	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								F.M. Scherer has not effectively rebutted my subjectivist criticism of the standard microeconomic welfare model; Scherer's historical reference to what Congress (allegedly) believed is irrelevant to the theoretical concerns raised by subjectivism. Nor does my ''principal'' criticism of antitrust policy rests on ''philosophical foundations''; my principal criticism rests on conventional economic analysis and a detailed economic history of the classic antitrust cases. My conclusion that the electrical equipment conspiracy of the late 1950s had no significant effect on market prices is supported by Ralph Sultan's findings; indeed, it is Scherer who brutally ignores the context and misrepresents the general thrust of Sultan's research. Scherer's comments on OPEC confuse the distinction that I made between private and governmental cartels. Finally, the economic welfare model that Scherer embraces so enthusiastically at the start of his review cannot be so suddenly discarded when I show something inconvenient: namely, that the ''dominant firms'' in the classic antitrust cases did not reduce market output and did not raise market prices. Scherer has not come to grips with my central thesis that antitrust regulation has generally been employed to restrain the competitive market process.

J	Lobis, S				Lobis, Seth			Milton, Mill, and Berlin's History of Monism and Pluralism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						intellectual history; monism; pluralism; Isaiah Berlin; John Milton; John Stuart Mill		Isaiah Berlin makes two brief references to John Milton in the essay he strategically titled "John Stuart Mill and the Ends of Life." The references establish a contrast between Milton and Mill by associating Milton with moral monism and Mill with its opposite, value pluralism. Yet a careful reading of Milton's Areopagitica, cited dismissively in the essay, reveals the inadequacy of Berlin's intellectual-historical account of the two concepts, which he presents as fully distinct and diametrically opposed. Although still heuristically valuable, Berlin's account warrants historiographic revision and refinement, as his treatments of both Milton and Mill make apparent.

J	Bilakovics, S				Bilakovics, Steven			PATERNALISM, INDIVIDUALISM, AND THE POLITICS OF MATURITY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Isaiah Berlin; individualism; paternalism; negative liberty; leveled self		We must, Isaiah Berlin argues, make tragic tradeoffs as we navigate the clash of incommensurable and irreconcilable values and ends of modernity. To deny this is to succumb to a politics of immaturity, and to the totalitarian temptation. The twentieth century taught that to resist final-solution fantasies, we must resist the allure, if not reject the value, of positive liberty, the liberty of self-mastery and self-rule. Two decades in, has the twenty-first century taught a different lesson? Have we learned that negative liberty, liberty from rule, with its antipaternalistic ethic of ultra-individualism, harbors its own politics of immaturity, and a demagogic temptation? I argue that this is the more frequent, if less fatal, threat to human dignity and decency today, and that we therefore ought to rebalance the scales in the tragic tradeoff of positive for negative liberty.

J	Bennett, M				Bennett, Michael			EXPERIMENTS IN DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE AND THEIR LIMITS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						decentralization; epistemic democracy; experiments in living; distributive justice; knowledge problem; liberal egalitarianism; libertarianism; Mark Pennington; moral epistemology; rational ignorance		Mark Pennington argues political systems should be decentralized in order to facilitate experimental learning about distributive justice. Pointing out the problems with Pennington's Hayekian formulation, I reframe his argument as an extension of the Millian idea of "experiments in living." However, the experimental case for decentralization is limited in several ways. Even if decentralization improves our knowledge about justice, it impedes the actual implementation of all conceptions of justice other than libertarianism. I conclude by arguing for the compatibility of egalitarian redistribution with the epistemic virtues of markets pointed out by Hayek.

J	Lane, M				Lane, Melissa			Does Rational Ignorance Imply Smaller Government, or Smarter Democratic Innovation?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						institutional design; rational ignorance; public ignorance; political knowledge; Ilya Somin; democracy; democratic theory	DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY	Ilya Somin argues that in light of the public's rational political ignorance we should make government smaller. But his account of the phenomenon of rational ignorance does not justify his policy prescription of smaller government; on the contrary, it implies that we should revamp the current framework of democratic institutions. This is because, since Somin fails to set out a principled basis on which to value democracy even in the face of rational ignorance, he cannot explain why we should want any democratic government, however small it may be. If rational ignorance is as grave a challenge to democracy as he takes it to be, it would seem to demand either radical institutional innovation or, alternatively, an abandonment of certain democratic principles. By not explaining why we should value citizens' involvement in politics at all, and why we might therefore draw different policy conclusions than he does himself, Somin's book ultimately fails to do full justice to the important questions that it raises.

In fact, however, democracy might logically be expected to be especially responsive only to the people's desires, not their needs. Responses to people's objective needs can be substantially different from responses to their subjective desires. Democratic institutions therefore cannot guarantee (and may even hamper) responsiveness to basic human needs. Democracy, should, at least in principle, thus be confined to the sphere of wants rather than needs.

J	Coronel, JC; Kuklinski, JH				Coronel, Jason C.; Kuklinski, James H.			POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY AT STONY BROOK: A RETROSPECTIVE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							CANDIDATE EVALUATION; INFORMATION; CAMPAIGN; DYNAMICS	During the 1970s and 1980s, political psychologists at the State University of New York at Stony Brook focused political scientists' attention on online processing. Borrowing from the new field of social cognition in psychology, they argued that voters' evaluations of candidates are the products of a summing up of reactions to happenings during a campaign. Voters might not remember the specific events later on, but their running tallies of reactions over the duration of the campaign would ensure that they take the forgotten information into account when entering the voting booth. Later, these same scholars yet again borrowed from (a very changed) psychology, and argued that many people, especially the most politically sophisticated, try to confirm their current political evaluations-for example, by seeking out confirmatory evidence and dismissing evidence that challenges their attitudes. We ask whether online processing and motivated reasoning have the same or different implications for democratic governance, and whether the two empirical perspectives can be reconciled.

J	Phelps, ES				Phelps, Edmund S.			CAPITALISM VS. CORPORATISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								There are, at present, at least two basic forms of market economy: one that tends to be open to innovative ideas; the other that tends to be more oriented to social services. The normative significance of these two "models" of market society-roughly speaking, the American and the Continental models-can best be appreciated by noticing that in the first model entrepreneurship, and participation in the economy more generally, can be major sources of satisfaction for the entrepreneurs and employees, independently of their financial compensation. In the second model, the economy is primarily a means to the end of the goods it produces. Although the second type may be as suited to producing goods as the first type, it has fallen short-for reasons that economists now understand-in generating employee engagement and the satisfactions of exploration and self-realization.

J	Bell, D				Bell, David			Pacific nationalism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review								September 11 may have changed, among other things, our attitude toward national identities. Long revealed by scholars to be deliberate constructions based, in large part, on historical fantasies, national identities were commonly seen by historians and by non-communitarian political theorists as violently divisive atavisms. But nationalism can tame religious conflict by including religious opponents within a larger and ( they may believe) more fundamental identity: that of common nationhood. The study of nationalism may soon come to appreciate its pacifying side.

CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Tetlock's Expert Political judgment is a creative, careful, and mostly convincing study of the predictive accuracy of political experts.

J	Erikson, RS				Erikson, Robert S.			Does public ignorance matter?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							MASS POLITICAL-ATTITUDES	Recent scholarship has attempted to restore the reputation of the American electorate, even though its level of political interest and information has not measurably increased. Scott Althaus's Collective Preferences in Democratic Politics challenges this revisionist optimism, arguing that opinion polls misrepresent the interests of a large segment of society, and that they therefore get too much attention as a guide to policy makers, because those being polled are so ill informed. But Althaus overestimates the degree to which respondent ignorance is responsible for the instability of survey responses; and he is perhaps too critical of polling as the vehicle for transmitting voter interests. His analysis of information effects on political attitudes, however, raises the important question of how public opinion would be different if it were well informed. The answer is, I believe: only minimally different.

J	Ginsberg, B				Ginsberg, Benjamin			Autonomy and duplicity: Reply to Decanio	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								While Samuel DeCanio is correct to maintain that the state has considerable autonomy due to the public's vast ignorance of the government's affairs, he neglects to consider that the public's ignorance also stems from the deceptions of the politically powerful, who withhold and distort, information in a variety of ways. This can take the form of outright lies; anonymous leaks; press and video releases that don't mention the originating group or its interests; giving reporters access to otherwise inaccessible information, so that they, will report favorably on a certain program or event; publicity stunts from groups as far afield as NASA and the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority; or the financing of periodicals that are sympathetic towards one's cause. State autonomy induced by public ignorance may thus be generated by the state itself.				bgin@jhu.edu						BOWLES C, 1973, PROMISES KEEP; BOWMAN K, 2005, AEI STUDIES PUBLIC O; CHAIT J, 2007, NEW REPUBLIC    0507; COCKBURN A, 2003, COUNTERPUNCH    0529; Creel G., 1920, WE ADVERTISED AM; DAVISON W, 1972, PUBLIC OPINION Q, V36; DeCanio S, 2000, CRIT REV, V14, P139, DOI 10.1080/08913810008443555; DeCanio S, 2000, CRIT REV, V14, P215, DOI 10.1080/08913810008443558; Fenton Tom, 2005, BAD NEWS; Fritz B., 2004, ALL PRESIDENTS SPIN; Gerth Jeff, 2005, NY TIMES        1211; Goldberg B., 2002, BIAS; Kurtz H., 2005, WASHINGTON POST 0108; LINDSEY R, 1986, NY TIMES        0527; Massing Michael, 2005, NEW YORK REV BO 1215; Merritt Davis, 2005, KNIGHTFALL KNIGHT RI; MONTOPOLI B, 2005, COLUMBIA J REV  0418; Nietzsche F.

J	Shearmur, J				Shearmur, Jeremy			Popper, political philosophy, and social democracy: Reply to Eidlin	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The later thought of Karl Popper-notably, his ideas about traditions and his "modified essentialism" in the philosophy of natural science-should lead to revisions in the political philosophy set out in The Open Society and Its Enemies. The structural approach allowed for by Popper's modified essentialism, and the delicate nature of traditions, buttress certain issues raised by Friedrich Hayek that pose serious problems for Popper social-democratic approach to politics. Fred Eidlin's review essay on my Political Thought of Karl Popper misses these problems, and in general underestimates the difficulties that unintended consequences pose for any non-utopian theory of politics. Thus, Eidlin uncritically cites Popper's abstract political recognition of unintended consequences and his idealized view of the political process, as if that puts to rest the questions my book asks.

Faculty partisan affiliations in all disciplines: A voter-registration study	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							MEMBERS	The party registration of tenure-track faculty at 11 California universities, ranging from small, private, religiously affiliated institutions to large, public, elite schools, shows that the "one-party campus" conjecture does not extend to all institutions or all departments. At one end of the scale, UC. Berkeley has an adjusted Democrat:Republican ratio of almost 9:1, while Pepperdine University has a ratio of nearly 1:1. Academic field also makes a tremendous difference, with the humanities averaging a 10:1 D:R ratio and business schools averaging 1.3:1, and with departments ranging from sociology (44:1) to management (1.5:1).Across all departments and institutions, the D:R ratio is 5:1, while in the "soft" liberal-arts fields, the ratio is higher than 8: 1. These findings are generally in line with comparable previous studies.

J	Bennett, SE				Bennett, SE			Is the public's ignorance of politics trivial?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review							PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS; VOTER IGNORANCE; CANDIDATE EVALUATION; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; DEMOCRACY; EXPERTISE; OPINION; REJOINDER; IDEOLOGY	Examination Of a comprehensive database of political knowledge, constructed from pooled 1988 and 1992 National Election Studies, refutes criticisms that have sometimes been lodged against standard tests that seem to reveal profound levels of public ignorance, Although most people know something about politics, the typical citizen is poorly informed, and only a small group is very knowledgeable about politics. Differentiating people according to their perceptions of the most important national problem does not reveal pockets of well-informed "issue publics" among the electorate. The NES data also show that knowledge makes a difference in how people feel about government spending for social-welfare programs, and in how well citizens were able to connect their partisanship and ideological proclivities to their votes in the 2000 presidential election.

Kant favored free public discussion as an instrument for the development and expression of autonomous rationality. But a free press embodied in the property rights of the owners of the press may well fail to achieve either Benthamite or Kantian goals. Such goals lead to a personal right to communicate rather than to a corporate right to press freedom.

J	Anderson, RD				Anderson, RD			The place of the media in popular democracy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							NEWS	Does media coverage of politics undermine democratic deliberation? By covering the "horse race" instead of the issues, the media encourage people to believe that politicians place self-interest above the public interest. The media also affect which issues people consider important, and negative advertisements discourage political participation. People learn from the media only because they know so little about politics, Weve democracy deliberative, these media effects would undermine it. But democracy is not a deliberation but a contest that relies on the ability of the media to shape public opinion. The evidence for media effects is strong, but the media cannot be undermining a form of democracy that does not and cannot exist, and they do sustain the form that does.

J	De Long, JB				De Long, JB			Unemployment in America: Rejoinder to Vedder and Gallaway	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In their Out of Work: Government and Unemployment in Twentieth Century America, Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway contend that government intervention in American labor markets has caused unemployment by raising the real price of labor. In my critique of the book, I allowed that while this might sometimes be the case, it is not as important as Vedder and Gallaway claim. Their Reply does not succeed in vindicating their argument, because their wage averages fail to take into account variations in wages within phases of the business cycle; because they fail to take into account the effects of unemployment on potential productivity, distorting their measures of real wages; and because they ignore the vast literature on the subject.

Furthermore, Green and Shapiro adopt an extremely pinched notion of an empirical contribution and an outmoded and idealized view of the scientific method. If their standards were adopted, it would be difficult to allow that anyone in political science has made an empirical contribution, or that political science is a scientific enterprise.

J	SCHOFIELD, N				SCHOFIELD, N			RATIONAL CHOICE AND POLITICAL-ECONOMY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The purpose of rational choice is to provide a grand theoretical framework for designing human institutions. Once theoretical work had shown how markets optimally aggregated preferences, attempts were made to extend the theory from markets to politics. Attempts by Downs and Olson to describe elections and collective action produced relatively poor predictions, but impelled game theorists to generalize preference-based theories to include belief information. A consequence of this change is that the theory is no longer purely axiomatic, but draws on insights about human behavior from other disciplines and empirical analysis of the role institutions play in determining beliefs.

J	TAYLOR, M				TAYLOR, M			BATTERING RAMS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory is a largely valid critique of the rational choice approach to politics. Rational choice theory may be useful tinder some conditions, but a general characterization of these suggests that American political behavior is unpromising terrain. Some forms of behavior cannot without strain be treated as instrumental; some sources of behavior cannot be accomodated by any theory built wholly out of preferences and beliefs. Explaining cooperation, in particular requires attention to normative, expressive, and intrinsic motivations and social identification, and to the conditions in which they ave mobilized.

J	FRIEDMAN, J				FRIEDMAN, J			THE POLITICS OF COMMUNITARIANISM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Taylor, Sandel, Walzer, and MacIntyre waver between granting the community authority over the individual and limiting this authority so severely that communitarianism becomes a dead letter. The reason for this vacillation can be found in the aspiration of each theorist to base liberal values-equality and liberty-on particularism. Communitarians compound liberal formalism by adding to the liberal goal, individual autonomy, the equally abstract aim of grounding autonomy in a communally shared identity. Far from returning political theory to substantive considerations of the good, communitarianism legitimizes really existing liberal politics-the politics of the nation-state.

In the case of Rorty, this has resulted in his being unable to make effective ripostes to left-wing critics of his defense of ''bourgeois liberalism,'' his uncritical endorsement of simplistic arguments for social reform, and his embrace of false prophecies of doom, such as those found in Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Moreover, his disdain for ''theory'' has blinded him to the utility of mid-level theories, such as those of economics, in dealing with concrete social problems.

J	MILLER, D				MILLER, D			PUBLIC-GOODS WITHOUT THE STATE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							REBELLIOUS COLLECTIVE ACTION; FREE-RIDER PROBLEM; PROVISION	The provision of public goods is generally assumed to required compulsion by the state. Individuals may want them, but they have no incentive to contribute voluntarily to their production. David Schmidtz proposes ''assurance contracts'' as a way around the problem of ''wasted'' contributions. However, such contracts do not eliminate the incentive to free ride on public goods. Empirical evidence suggests that enforced contributions may be a more effective way of combatting this problem than assurance contracts. More generally, we need to investigate different kinds of moral motivation to see how they may elicit voluntary contributions of public goods.

J	Moreira, PG				Moreira, Pedro Gois			Laclau's New Postmodern Radicalism: Politics, Democracy, and the Epistemology of Certainty	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						essentialism; foundationalism; Marxism; populism; radicalism; Cold War liberalism; Raymond Aron; Isaiah Berlin; Ernesto Laclau; Karl Popper		A timeless critique holds that the radical is animated by a deep sense of certainty that leads to the worst excesses. By distinguishing essentialist and non-essentialist forms of radicalism, Ernesto Laclau offers a "coalitional" form of radicalism that, in effect, responds to this critique. Laclau deconstructs classical forms of radicalism, such as Marxism, to show how one can use some of their formal components, such as dichotomic rhetoric and a notion of utopia, without assuming that their particular content (e.g., the figure of the proletarian or the socialist utopia) entails the permanent abolition of oppression. Laclau's radicalism enables political actors to build their own radical front by politicizing and creating linkages between issues. Laclau thus avoids the epistemic certainty of classical radicalisms. However, in the interest of politically effective radicalism, he deploys a localized form of certainty that has an ambivalent potential for intolerance and violence.

J	Roberts, DD				Roberts, David D.			Reading Yack while Pondering the Origins of Totalitarianism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						Giovanni Gentile; historical consciousness; Marx; modernity; Nietzsche; totalitarianism; Bernard Yack		In The Longing for Total Revolution, Bernard Yack claims not to account for totalitarianism but simply to unearth a new, specifically modern mindset. Still, the problem of totalitarianism, and whatever connection it might have had with that mindset, lurks throughout his book. Yack convincingly posits a relationship between a troubling new sense of historical embeddedness and novel totalist thinking. But his sense of the range of responses to historicity proves too limited to illuminate the connection between the longing for total revolution and the advent of totalitarianism. Another look at Yack's two culminating figures, Marx and Nietzsche, suggests a more illuminating alternative.

J	Assadi, G				Assadi, Guive			History against Psychology in the Thought of R. G. Collingwood	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						R; G; Collingwood; philosophy of history; intellectual history; Cambridge school; critiques of social science	PHILOSOPHY	R. G. Collingwood is mostly remembered for his theory that historical understanding consists in re-enacting the thoughts of the historical figure whom one is studying. His first recognizable expression of this view followed from an argument about the emptiness of psychological interpretations of religion, and throughout his career Collingwood offered history as re-enactment as an alternative to psychology. Over time, his argument that the psychology of religion could not be relevant to the veracity of religious beliefs was supplanted by the argument that psychology is self-undermining because the psychologist's procedure of attributing beliefs to blind psychic needs could apply just as easily to the psychologist him- or herself. As an alternative to what he took to be the self-defeating psychological position, Collingwood put forward the study of the development of beliefs as the motivations for actions, which led him to his views that "all history is the history of thought" and that, in order to understand an historical event, we must mentally re-enact the thoughts that stood behind it.

Here I argue that our debate has helped clarify an ambivalence in the literature surrounding the ends and means of deliberative democracy. I specify two ways to understand both ends and means, establish their importance in deliberative theory, and show how they can be combined. I conclude by showing how this systemic view incorporates and overcomes several challenges facing modern democracy, such as the necessity of expert authority, the role of partisanship, and the problem of social complexity.

J	Muirhead, R				Muirhead, Russell			THE EPISTEMIC BASIS FOR POLITICAL OPPOSITION: REJOINDER TO MIN	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						dissent; epistemic democracy; Fabienne Peter; Helene Landemore; John Min; majority rule; pure epistemic proceduralism		As Min argues, any defense of democracy must include an epistemic element. But this does not mean that the will of the majority always tends to be right. It means only that we cannot identify in advance a minority that is likelier to get it right than everyone else. This fact is consistent with the possibility, even the likelihood, that the majority will more often be wrong than right. Those who find themselves in the minority should not be cowed into submission by the overall epistemic advantage of democracy: in any given case, a dissenter from the majority view may be right. Likewise, institutions such as parties are crucial in allowing minorities-and majorities-to persevere. Not only parties, but practices of dissent and opposition more broadly, are inseparable from the epistemic case for democracy.

J	Pennington, M				Pennington, Mark			ROBUST POLITICAL ECONOMY REVISITED: RESPONSE TO CRITICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						incentive problem; knowledge problem; non-ideal theory; robust political economy		Robust political economy is the attempt to theorize about political institutions in such a way as to guard against the knowledge and incentive problems that we can expect will threaten the public good in the real world. An implication of this attempt is the need to reason symmetrically about whether a proposed institution is liable to be as prone to failure due to knowledge and incentive problems as the situations it is designed to address. Another implication is that one should be wary of ad hoc institutional or policy proposals, that is, proposals that are not grounded in systematic tendencies to mitigate the knowledge and incentive problems. With these implications in mind, I am not convinced that the alternative institutions, conceptions of the state, and conceptions of social justice defended by my critics meet the test of robustness that, I maintain, can best be met through decentralization of power down to the level of the individual.

NO MAN IS AN ISLAND: SELF-INTEREST, THE PUBLIC INTEREST, AND SOCIOTROPIC VOTING	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							ECONOMIC JUDGMENTS; ELECTIONS; POLITICS; BEHAVIOR; VOTE	Four decades ago, Gerald Kramer showed that economic conditions affect electoral outcomes. Some researchers took this to mean that voters were self-interested, voting their "pocketbooks," while others, such as Leif Lewin, took it to mean that voters were sociotropic, motivated by the public interest-and therefore altruistic. It is important, however, to avoid conflating sociotropic voters with altruistic ones. Voters might be voting in favor of politicians or parties that they think will further the public interest as an indirect route to furthering their own interests, as members of the public. More research, perhaps conducted using novel methodologies, is needed in order to settle the extent to which voters are motivated by self-interest or by the public interest.	[Kiewiet, D.

J	Buturovic, Z				Buturovic, Zeljka			PUTTING POLITICAL EXPERTS TO THE TEST	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							MEDICAL-SCHOOL; STUDENTS	In his remarkably meticulous and even-handed 2005 book, Expert Political Judgment, Philip E. Tetlock establishes that the only thing we can count on in the political experts' predictions is that they will underperform-in some cases significantly-the predictions made by mechanical statistical procedures, including random chance. Experts have many uses and Tetlock does not claim that they have no value. However, Tetlock zeroes in on experts' important political role-as prognosticators. Tetlock does not attempt the impossible by trying to judge experts on their ability to prognosticate the effects of public policies; this would require that Tetlock himself could know what those effects were, and even in retrospect, it isn't that simple. Experts' failure to predict much simpler matters, however, such as GDP growth within a broad range, strongly suggests that technocracy is worse than putting dart-throwing chimps in charge of public policy.				zeljka@psych.columbia.edu	Buturovic, Zeljka/AAD-5516-2019	Buturovic, Zeljka/0000-0002-1826-2362				Bazerman M.H., 2006, JUDGMENT MANAGERIAL; DAWES R, 1996, HOUSE CARDS; DEVAUL RA, 1987, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V257, P47, DOI 10.1001/jama.257.1.47; Friedman J, 2005, CRIT REV, V17, pI; Friedman J, 2006, CRIT REV, V18, pI; GILOVICH TJ, 1993, DO WE KNOW WHAT ISNT; Hoffrage U, 2000, SCIENCE, V290, P2261, DOI 10.1126/science.290.5500.2261; MURAKAMI MH, 2008, CRIT REV, V20, P113; SMITH SR, 1991, ACAD MED, V66, P474, DOI 10.1097/00001888-199108000-00012	9	3	3	0	3	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND	0891-3811			CRIT REV	Crit.

J	Caplan, B				Caplan, Bryan			REPLY TO MY CRITICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Editorial Material							ECONOMISTS; AMERICANS; MYTH	This symposium's objections to my book fall into two main categories: philosophical and empirical. The philosophical objections are largely sophistical. If we took them seriously, they would invalidate far more than my book: We would also have to give up social science and common sense. The empirical objections, in contrast, are often thoughtful and important. The most notable: Kiewiet and Mattozzi's vigorous defense of the American public's free-trade credentials, and Wittman's doubts about the magnitude of the belief gap between economists and the public. But Kiewiet and Mattozzi put too much weight on a single survey question; and the belief gap between economists and the public is much larger than the belief gap between the American public's far left and far right.

J	Shields, JA				Shields, Jon A.			Abortion and deliberation: Rejoinder to Talisse and Maloney	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Talisse and Maloney seem to think that professors, not ordinary citizens, are the key to a more deliberative democracy. Yet these professors fail to appreciate the reasonableness of the pro-life activists and thinkers they disagree with. For example, they falsely charge even the most deliberative groups with resurrecting an obsolete debate and framing conversations in a fallacious way. They further place an unreasonable justificatory burden on pro-life activists and hold them culpable for framing the debate around the ontology of the embryo (even though many prominent pro-choice thinkers prefer this frame). In drawing such a hard line between academics and activists, they also miss what has been an unavoidable partnership between academics and social movements in our imperfect deliberative republic.

J	Ceaser, JW				Ceaser, James W.			Demagoguery, statesmanship, and the American presidency	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Worries about "the rhetorical presidency" ultimately concern the danger of presidential demagoguery. As such, they echo an important theme of the Founders, who erected several barriers to the emergence of the president as demagogue in chief In the ancient sources on which the Founders partly drew, the worry was the popular or pseudo-popular leader who seizes on widespread envies, fears, or hopes in the service of his political career-in contrast to the statesman, who pursues the public good and is, therefore, less interested in how to gain office than in how to use it. Later iterations emphasized the "superstitious," "prejudiced, " or ideological nature of demagogic appeals. Mien Woodrow Wilson proposed that the president should seize the public-policy initiative in the name of the people, he sought to insulate the presidency from charges of demagoguery by arguing that no leader who spoke falsely on behalf of the people could expect to win the office. True adepts of the "progress " of public opinion, hence of the public good, are non-demagogic by definition. Although one is hard pressed to find an American president who can unambiguously be called demagogic, one does find demagoguery among presidential candidates, especially during their campaigns for party nomination.

J	DeCanio, S				DeCanio, Samuel			Mass opinion and American political development	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Despite its origins in explorations of the political and institutional history that had become unfashionable in History departments, the Political Science subfield of American Political Development (APD) has drifted toward the "history-from-below" view against which it was originally a reaction. Perhaps this is a normal tendency in democratic cultures that ground their legitimacy on the will of the people. But it may also be due to a failure of APD scholars to appreciate that even in a (nominally) democratic country such as the United States, the state may acquire autonomy from the public will because of the vast scope of state activity, and the restricted ability of the people to monitor, understand, and control that activity. Philip E. Converse's signal contribution to the public-opinion literature can thus be the starting point for a revision of American political history with an eye to the autonomy that political elites may gain from public ignorance of their actions.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, J			Popper, Weber, and Hayek: The epistemology and politics of ignorance	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Editorial Material							VOTER IGNORANCE; DEMOCRACY	Karl Popper's methodology highlights our scientific ignorance: hence the need to institutionalize open-mindedness through controlled experiments that may falsify our fallible theories about the world. In his endorsement of '' piecemeal social engineering,'' Popper assumes that the social-democratic state and its citizens are capable of detecting social problems, and of assessing the results of policies aimed at solving them, through a process of experimentation analogous to that Of natural science. But we are not only scientifically but politically ignorant: ignorant of the facts that underpin political debate, which are brought to our attention by theories that, as Max Weber emphasized, can be tested only through counterfactual thought experiments, Public-opinion and political-psychology research suggest that human beings are far too unaware, illogical, and doctrinaire to conduct the rigorous theorizing that would be necessary to make piecemeal social engineering work. F A. Hayek realized that the public could not engage, specifically, in piecemeal economic regulation but failed to draw the conclusion that this was due to a specific type of political ignorance: ignorance of economic theory.

J	Van Duffel, S				Van Duffel, S			Libertarian natural rights	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							JOHN-OF-PARIS; SOVEREIGNTY; PROPERTY; DOMINIUM	Non-consequentialist libertarianism usually revolves around the claim that there are only "negative," not "positive," rights. Libertarian negative-rights theories are so patently problematic, though, that it seems that there is a more fundamental notion at work. Some libertarians think this basic idea is freedom or liberty; others, that it is self-ownership. Neither approach is satisfactory.

J	Talisse, RB				Talisse, RB			Rawls on pluralism and stability	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Rawls's political liberalism abandons the traditional political-theory objective of providing a philosophical account of liberal democracy. However, Rawls also aims for a liberal political order endorsed by citizens on grounds deeper than what he calls a "modus vivendi" compromise; he contends that a liberal political order based upon a modus vivendi is unstable. The aspiration for a pluralist and 'freestanding" liberalism is at odds with the goal of a liberalism endorsed as something deeper than a modus vivendi compromise among competing comprehensive doctrines. A liberalism that is supported ''for its own sake" rather than as a compromise must necessarily be based on some conception of the good, of the sort that political liberalism eschews.

J	Bardon, A				Bardon, A			From Nozick to welfare rights: Self-ownership, property, and moral desert	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							JUSTICE	The Kantian moral foundations of Nozickian libertarianism suggest that the claim that self-ownership grounds only negative rights to property should be rejected. The moral foundations of Nozick's libertarianism better support basing property rights on moral desert. It, is neither incoherent nor implausible to say that need can be a basis for desert. By implication, the libertarian contention that persons ought to be respected as persons living self-shaping lives is inconsistent with the libertarian refusal to accept that claims of need can sometimes outweigh claims to property.

J	Muller, JZ				Muller, JZ			Capitalism, socialism, and irony: Understanding Schumpeter in context	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The significance of the major claims of Joseph Schumpeter's best-known work, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, have often been misunderstood by readers unattuned to its ironic mode of presentation. The book reaffirms two themes that were central to. Schumpeter's thought from its very beginning, namely the significance of creative and extraordinary individuals in social processes, and the resentment created by the innovations they introduce. The thesis that socialism would replace capitalism, but that it would bring about few of the advantages imagined by socialists and many disadvantages with which they had not reckoned, was an ironic proposition, which Schumpeter put forth in a manner designed to overcome intellectuals' dogmatic resistance to capitalism.

J	Hill, G				Hill, G			An ultra-Keynesian strikes back: Rejoinder to Horwitz	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							CAPITALISM	In real-world markets, individual intentions cannot be brought into perfect harmony before decisions ave taken. Choices made without this pre-ordering-choices made in ignorance of one another-produce unwanted outcomes. It is this absence of coordination among plans, not centralized banking, that is the primary cause of macroeconomic market failure. Steven Horwitz's free-banking alternative would aggravate the collective-action problems inherent in economies without complete markets.

J	Otterbein, KF				Otterbein, KF			The origins of war	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In War Before Civilization, Lawrence H. Keeley argues that prehistoric as well as primitive mankind was move warlike than has been recognized by most scholars. Such scholars subscribe, according to Keeley, to "the myth of the peaceful savage," the subtitle of Iris book. But Keeley, who leads a long list of Hawks, has replaced this myth with another, the "myth of the warlike savage. " Anthropologists who argue that serious warfare arose only after the rise of the state and civilization understate the extent of serious warfare in prehistory. The evidence for warfare among primates, prehistoric mankind, early agriculturalists, and primitive peoples suggests that the forth lies somewhere between the myth of the peaceful savage and the myth of the warlike savage.

J	Yack, B				Yack, B			The myth of the civic nation	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The idea of a purely civic nationalism has attracted Western scholars, most of whom rightly disdain the myths that sustain ethnonationalist theories of political community. Civic nationalism is particularly attractive to many Americans, whose peculiar national heritage encourages the delusion that their mutual association is bared solely on consciously chosen principles. But this idea misrepresents political reality as surely as the ethnonationalist myths it is designed to combat. And propagating a new political myth is an especially inappropriate way of defending the legacy of Enlightenment liberalism from the dangers posed by the growth of nationalist political passions.

J	Samuels, WJ				Samuels, WJ			Society is a process of mutual coercion, and governance, selectively perceived: Rejoinder	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Robert Higgs misunderstands me as suggesting that there is, in all societies, a mathematically constant level of coercion. My argument is that society and economy are fundamentally structures of coercion and governance, with selective perception being employed to choose which interests government will coercively protect. As a result coercion is ubiquitous - ideological preconceptions and material preferences to the contrary notwithstanding. Libertarianism consists of attractive sentiments but sentiments nonetheless. Higgs is participating in the process of determining the Elses of government, not in its minimization; a valuable process but not the latter one.

J	HODGSON, GM				HODGSON, GM			THE STATE, MONEY, AND SPONTANEOUS ORDER	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In Monetary Evolution, Free Banking, and Economic Order, Stephen Horwitz has provided an excellent review of the profound problems in the neoclassical theory of money and an important statement of the alternative Austrian-school approach. However, Horwitz's ''free banking'' perspective vests on a false dichotomy between intervention and spontaneous order. In using the extreme case of an entirely undesigned evolutionary process to counter the equally extreme proposition that social order can be wholly designed, Horwitz loses sight of the messy world of intermediate realities and possibilities. Even if money has strong spontaneous qualities, the state may play a vital role in the evolution of the financial system.

J	ROTHENBERG, J				ROTHENBERG, J			SOCIAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS IN THE SEARCH FOR SAFETY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In The Search for Safety, Aaron Wildavsky argues that the pervasiveness of uncertainty, the complexity of economy and society, and the trial-and-error strengths of a competitive market system make alleviating damages through market processes superior to a preventive strategy of regulatory anticipation. Close examination of a number of issues that are central to his argument-anticipation vs. resiliency, the effects of wealth on health, the competitive market as an engine for social trial and error, and equity in aggregating benefits and costs across individuals and different probabilistic states - leads to considerable skepticism as to whether Wildavsky's strategy of less government regulation and a more unfettered market would indeed produce greater safety.

J	DOBUZINSKIS, L				DOBUZINSKIS, L			IS PROGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENTALISM AN OXYMORON	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Environmentalism has been a part of the ideological landscape of liberal societies for nearly three decades. Classical liberals have not yet succeeded, however, in articulating a coherent response that would be relevant to politically active environmentalists, as well as to liberals receptive to postmodern ideas. Robert C. Paehlke argues that, conservative liberals being in fact hostile to environmental thinking, moderate progressivism and environmentalism should enter into a close alliance. This paper challenges both assertions. Admittedly, not all currents within contemporary conservative liberalism could play a part in the development of a neoliberal environmentalist movement. One current, however, the skeptical tradition, whose origin can be traced back to the Scottish Englightenment, is remarkably well suited to this task. Progressivism, on the other hand, could end up smothering the environmental movement under the weight of its own certainties.

J	WEALE, A				WEALE, A			NATURE VERSUS THE STATE - MARKETS, STATES, AND ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Is it possible to reconcile a classical liberal approach to economics with a concern for the environment? The contributors to Economics and the Environment: A Reconciliation contend that it is. But they fail to distinguish properly between classical liberalism and a widespread orthodoxy in environmental policy communities in Europe and North America to the effect that economic instruments for environmental policy need more serious attention than they halle hitherto received. Once this orthodoxy is distinguished from classical liberalism, the latter is seen to be implausible. In particular, the classical liberal approach fails to deal with the practical and administrative problems involved in enforcing private property rights solutions to problems of environmental protection, wrongly generalizes from the failures of U. S. environmental policy to the failure of public regulation as such, and fails to take into account the claim that nature should be accorded intrinsic value.

J	Breckman, W				Breckman, Warren			Marx and Romanticism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						intolerance; German Idealism; idealism; Marx; Romanticism		While Marx threw off his attraction to Romanticism when he was still a teenager, scholars have detected various senses in which deep structures of Romantic thought persist in his work. These structures have frequently been taken as contributing factors to Marx's alleged millenarianism, doctrinaire rigidity, and intolerance. The mature Marx does draw on Romantic ideas at crucial moments; but rather than reinforcing an image of Marx as an intolerant ideologue, the Romantic element in his thought, properly construed, suggests theoretical openness and humility before an unmasterable reality.

J	Roundtree, J				Roundtree, Jacob			Marx's Democratization of Hegel's Philosophy of Right	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Hegel; Marx; bureaucracy; democracy; Idealism; organicism; popular sovereignty; representation		In his famous critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Marx criticized Hegel's contention that the general will can be achieved without popular sovereignty. Marx argued that Hegel's first error lay in his Idealist method, which mistook the realities of the family and civil society as mere emanations of the Idea. This methodological error, according to Marx, led Hegel to misunderstand the rational essence of the state as consisting in a "universal" will that is abstracted from the real will of the people itself, allowing Hegel to defend the pursuit of the good of the whole not by popular government but government by a special bureaucratic, "universal" estate, represented in government by civil servants. However, Marx failed to direct the same type of critique against Hegel's assertion that the bureaucracy would have the knowledge of the whole that it would need if it were to effectively regulate civil society in the universal interest.

J	Moggach, D				Moggach, Douglas			Left-Kantian Perfectionism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						freedom; left Kantians; negative freedom; post-Kantian perfectionism; Fichte; Humboldt; Kant; Marx; Schiller; Wolff		The historical context of early post-Kantian debates on politics reveals the emergence of a new type of perfectionist ethics no longer based on the state-sponsored promotion of happiness, as the dominant German tendency in the eighteenth century had been, but on individual freedom. Post-Kantian perfectionism focused on maintaining and enhancing the conditions for rightful interaction among self-defining individuals. Rather than isolating and alienating, Kantian negative freedom enabled a new conception of social interaction based on the idea of right and the progressive extension of rightful relations. Humboldt, Schiller, Fichte, and Marx exemplified this new approach, despite their differences.

Yack rejects this dichotomy in favor of an Aristotelean outlook, and in so doing embraces the opposition between the ancients and the moderns. Neither binary is as oppositional as Yack suggests. There is, however, a more viable distinction to be made between the ancients and the moderns-concerning the role played by teleology-and it better serves the purpose of mapping the historical trajectory of moral and political theorizing. Teleology does not survive modernity, and it is this development that was truly revolutionary.

CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Isaiah Berlin; freedom; positive liberty; inner citadel; moralization; tyranny	BERLIN	Isaiah Berlin's criticisms of positive liberty are often read as mere artefacts of his Cold War context. But are they good criticisms? This article evaluates Berlin's three main worries about positive liberty-the inner-citadel worry, the moralization worry, and the tyranny worry. I find that while they may be reasonable worries to have about any concept of liberty, they are not compelling criticisms of positive liberty in particular.

J	Ban, CN				Ban, Cornel			Beyond Social Science Naturalism: The Case for Ecumenical Interpretivism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						naturalism; interpretivism; holism; international political economy; Mark Bevir; Jason Blakely		The epistemological and methodological wars that bedevil social science often pit those who follow in the footsteps of natural science and those who favor a more holistic, interpretive approach. Into this war-torn landscape, Mark Bevir and Jason Blakley have dropped a plea for interpretive social science that will surely serve as a touchstone for years to come. However, their anti-naturalism is of the methodologically ecumenical kind, with the qualitative toolkit cohabiting with mass surveys, large-N statistics, and other quantitative methods under well-specified conditions. The book's insights therefore dovetail with emerging ecumenical trends in international political economy and even economics.

J	Pettit, P				Pettit, Philip			Democracy Before, In, and After Schumpeter	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Bodin; democracy; Hobbes; James Mill; popular sovereignty; Rousseau; Schumpeter		The classical model of democracy that Schumpeter criticizes is manufactured out of a variety of earlier ideas, not those of any one thinker or even one school of thought. His critique of the central ideals by which he defines the modelthose of the common will and the common goodremains persuasive. People's preferences are too messy and too manipulable to allow us to think that mass democracy can promote those ideals, as he defines them. Should we endorse his purely electoral model of democracy, then, and accept that people do not exercise any control over government? Not necessarily. We can expand democracy to include the constitutional and contestatory constraints that people impose on their rulers. We may hope that people can rely on such democratic controls to ensure that government operates by community standards.

J	Somin, I				Somin, Ilya			WHY POLITICAL IGNORANCE UNDERMINES THE WISDOM OF THE MANY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Helene Landemore's Democratic Reason effectively demonstrates how cognitive diversity may potentially improve the quality of democratic decisions. But in setting out the preconditions that democracy must meet in order for the many to make collectively well-informed decisions, Landemore undermines the case for voter competence more than she strengthens it. The conditions she specifies are highly unlikely to be achieved by any real-world democracy. Widespread voter ignorance and the size and complexity of modern government are severe obstacles to any effort to implement Landemore's vision. Better-informed decision making is more likely to be achieved by allowing a wider range of issues to be decided by "voting with your feet" instead of at the ballot box.

J	Gillespie, MA; Perkins, L				Gillespie, Michael Allen; Perkins, Lucas			POLITICAL ANTI-THEOLOGY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In The Stillborn God, Mark Lilla argues that political theology invariably leads to apocalyptic politics, and that we can avoid this fate only by maintaining a "Great Separation'' between politics and religion, such as the one that Hobbes initiated, but which was overturned by Rousseau and German liberal theology-leading to Nazism. We argue that Hobbes never established such a divide; political theology is far more diverse than Lilla suggests; and liberal German political theology was not a significant source of Nazism. Moreover, liberalism is itself a political theology, suggesting that religion and politics should not, and perhaps cannot, be divided-although they may be reconciled.

J	Bishop, GF				Bishop, George F.			Rational public opinion or its manufacture? Reply to page	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Benjamin Page's thoughtful critique of my book, The Illusion of Public Opinion, strives to reassure readers that all is welldespite the book's extensive documentation of measurement-error artifacts in numerous public opinion surveys. Page's own careful polling practices are not followed outside of elite academic survey centers. Moreover, even in such well-run surveys, the respondents are often ignorant of the issues being probed. The fact that nonrandom reasons of some sort must be determining on-the-spot survey responses may allow us to call the respondents rational in a loose sense. But the responses still don't represent actual opinions about the specific policy issues being probedlet alone well-informed answers. Finally, while Page argues that measurement errors are most likely random, and should cancel out in the aggregate, the miracle of aggregation doesn't occur when the form, wording, and context of questions varies from survey to survey. And even when wording and context are held constant, the respondents' understanding of the same words can vary dramatically or subtly over time, due to new political events and their changing interpretation.

J	Tyrrell, M				Tyrrell, Martin			Homage to ruritania: Nationalism, identity, and diversity	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								National identities have tended to be established by elites who universalize deep cultural conformity to key cultural artefacts such as language and religion. But this approach can provoke intergroup conflict when the official national identity clashes with other social identifications (e. g., religious, ethnic, or regional ones). Research based on the Social Identity Theory of Henri Tajfel and John Turner indicates that collective identities can be easily induced, through "minimal" cues of group membership, suggesting a strong and innate need to identify with larger groups and to share in and contribute to their achievements. Instead of insisting on deep conformity, therefore, national identification might be achieved through the use of simple cultural cues, banal national symbolism, and mass political participation.

J	Fenster, M				Fenster, Mark			Murray Edelman, polemicist of public ignorance	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Murray Edelman's work raised significant theoretical and methodological questions regarding the symbolic nature of politics, and specifically the role played by non-rational beliefs (those that lack real-world grounding) in the shaping of political preferences. According to Edelman, beneath an apparently functional and accountable democratic state lies a symbolic system that renders an ignorant public quiescent. The state, the media, civil society, interpersonal relations, even popular art are part Of a mass spectacle kept afloat by empty symbolic beliefs. However suggestive it is, the weaknesses of Edelman's theoretical and methodological approach, and the relative strengths of more recent research on the politics of cultural symbols, render Edelman work unable to serve as either model or springboard for the contemporary study of political symbols.

J	Ciepley, D				Ciepley, D			Why the state was dropped in the first place: A prequel to Skocpol's "bringing the state back in"	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review								round the time of World War II, just as the American state was acquiring new levels of capacity for autonomous action, the state was dropped from American social science, as part of the reaction to the rise of totalitarianism. All traces of state autonomy, now understood as "state coercion," were expunged from the image of American democracy. In this ideological climate, the "society-centered" frameworks of pluralism and structural-functionalism that Skocpol criticizes swept the field. Skocpol's call for a return to a Weberian understanding of the (potential) autonomy of government administrators may be complemented by a Weberian understanding of the (potential) autonomy of democratic leaders.

J	Boettke, PJ				Boettke, PJ			Formalism and contemporary economics: A reply to Hausman, Heilbroner, and Mayer	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Economic formalism crowds out the analysis of change and adjustments to change under capitalism. The style of, analytical narrative that was practiced by the first generation of neoclassical economists, in contrast, is more productive of genuine economic understanding. Despite Daniel Hausman's challenging argument to the contrary, I maintain that Joseph Stiglitz's work is formalist at its core. While I agree with Robert Heilbroner's critique of contemporary economics, there is a limited sense in which nonformalist economics can rely on universalistic assumptions. And Thomas Mayer has provided useful guidelines for focusing nonformalist analysis on real-world economic problems.

J	Viroli, M				Viroli, M			On civic republicanism: Reply to Xenos and Yack	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Current debates about patriotism and nationalism have so far failed adequately to take into account the historical meaning of republican patriotism. For classical and modern republican theorists, love of country is a charitable love of the republic and of its citizens, It is an attachment to the political values of republican liberty and to the culture based upon them. As such, it is a theoretical alternative to both civic and ethnic nationalism, and it is not at all confined within the bygone experience of city-states.

J	Woodlief, A				Woodlief, A			Unforeseen consequences and pathological self-reinforcement: Why cities decline	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							MODELS	Peter Salins's The Ecology of Housing Destruction and Salins's co-authored work with Gerald Mildner, Scarcity by Design, provide fascinating evidence of the unintentionally harmful effects of urban policies, and their role as catalysts for further harmful policies designed to ameliorate previous harms. The result is a web of counterproductive regulations confronting bewildered policymakers and frustrated citizens. In his The Federal Government and Urban Housing, on the other hand, R. Alien Hays not only misses the existence of these complex policy dynamics, but fails to assess accurately the consequences of the housing policies he favors. His work does, however offer useful insights into the nature of policy decisions.

J	Edgerton, RB				Edgerton, RB			Bringing human nature back in: Autonomy or sociality?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In The Social Cage, Alexandva Maryanski and Jonathan H. Turner challenge the widespread assumption that humans are by nature ''social animals.'' They do so by examining the behavior of great ayes, who, they conclude, prefer freedom and mobility over close social ties. With the coming of post-industrial society, according to Maryanski and Turner, people may now have a chance to regain the autonomy that evolution has equipped them to enjoy. Despite weaknesses, mostly involving the ethnographic record and the assumption that men and women shave the same natural desire for autonomy, the book is a valuable attempt to return a biological perspective to sociological analysis.

J	Simpson, P				Simpson, P			Community in a new libertarianism: Rejoinder	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Proper criticism requires proper targeting. Legutko argues that Iibertarianism destroys communities and that my theory, which combines libertarianism with communitarianism, must therefore be wrong. But the libertarianism Legutko criticizes is not the same as the Iibertarianism for which I argue. He has therefore done nothing to show that my combination of libertarianism and communitarianism is impossible, whether in theory or in practice.

J	WOLFE, A				WOLFE, A			WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO COMPASSION	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Marvin Olasky argues that compassion once meant a reciprocal relationship between those who provided charity and those who received it. This complex relationship has been undermined by the state's monopoly of welfare, which, in the name of compassion, eliminates people's sense of compassion. Olasky's insistence that private and public actions be analyzed in isolation from each other is unrealistic. The real question is what works and what doesn't. Americans need a way to use government to strengthen private institutions such as the family. Then we can find solutions to welfare problems that respond to practical, not moral and theological, concerns.			WOLFE, A (corresponding author), BOSTON UNIV,DEPT SOCIOL,BOSTON,MA 02215, USA.

J	SCHWARTZ, AJ				SCHWARTZ, AJ			ARE CENTRAL BANKS NECESSARY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							POLICY	Two recent studies use history and theory to examine the likely consequences of eliminating government intervention in the provision of money. Such proposals would end the central bank monopoly over note issue and replace it with note issues by competing banks. Supervisory functions of central banks would be dispensed with. Accordingly, the proposals would free banks from all regulations on entry, disclosure, geographical limitations, and the products they may offer to customers.

J	TORR, C				TORR, C			WHAT CAN AUSTRIAN ECONOMISTS LEARN FROM THE POST KEYNESIANS - REPLY TO DAVIDSON	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							EFFECTIVE DEMAND; CONSUMPTION; INVESTMENT	Paul Davidson has argued that there is little common ground between Post Keynesian analysis and the Austrian approach to economics. He claims that Post Keynesians (unlike Austrian economists) place great importance on the role of expectations and do not present a deterministic view of the economic system. In this essay the validity Of such claims is examined.			TORR, C (corresponding author), UNIV S AFRICA,DEPT ECON,PRETORIA,SOUTH AFRICA.

J	Reiss, J				Reiss, Julian			Why Do Experts Disagree?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						epistocracy; expert disagreement; technocracy; value pluralism; spiral of conviction		Jeffrey Friedman's Power Without Knowledge argues forcefully that there are inherent limitations to the predictability of human action, due to a circumstance he calls "ideational heterogeneity." However, our resources for predicting human action somewhat reliably in the light of ideational heterogeneity have not been exhausted yet, and there are no in-principle barriers to progress in tackling the problem. There are, however, other strong reasons to think that disagreement among epistocrats is bound to persist, such that it will be difficult to decide who has "the right answer" to a given technocratic problem. These reasons have to do with competing visions of the good society, fact/value entanglement, and the fragility of the facts of the social sciences.

CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						honor culture; populism; Donald J; Trump; Trumpian Democrats		Donald Trump's victory depended on the defection of hundreds of longstanding Democratic communities. Trump appealed to these communities partly because he behaves like some of their most beloved politicians. Like the president, these politicians are brazen, thin skinned, nepotistic, and offer an older, boss-centered vision of politics. Trump-the anti-establishment outsider-appealed to voters in these communities because he resembles the local insiders. This appeal widens an old fault line inside the Democratic Party.

J	Gunn, P				Gunn, Paul			Against Epistocracy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Jason Brennan; Bryan Caplan; dogmatism; political ignorance; rational ignorance; rational irrationality	POLICY VIEWS; DISAGREEMENT; PROFESSORS; DEMOCRACY; BEHAVIOR; EXPERTS	In Against Democracy, Jason Brennan argues that public ignorance undermines the legitimacy of democracy because, to the extent that ignorant voters make bad policy choices, they harm their own and one another's interests. The solution, he thinks, is epistocracy, which would leave policy decisions largely in the hands of social-scientific experts or voters who pass tests of political knowledge. However, Brennan fails to explain why we should think that these putative experts are sufficiently knowledgeable to avoid making errors as damaging as those made by voters. Given the strong link between political knowledge and ideological dogmatism, as well as the tendency of social scientists to disagree with one another, the case for epistocracy is deeply implausible, at best. Moreover, given that there are important non-instrumental justifications of democracy-justifications of which Brennan appears to be radically ignorant-the epistocratic alternative would be unnecessary even if it were viable.

J	Beattie, P				Beattie, Peter			Theory, Media, and Democracy for Realists	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Christopher Achen; Larry Bartels; Democracy for Realists; information theory; media effects; political ignorance	KNOWLEDGE; NEWS; INFORMATION; IGNORANCE; SYSTEMS	Democracy for Realists delivers a long-overdue attack upon apologetics for American political realities. Achen and Bartels argue that the folk theory of democracy is not an accurate description of democracy in the United States and that without a greater degree of economic and social equality, democracy will remain an unattainable ideal. But their account of the gap between ideal and actual relies too heavily on the innate cognitive limitations and biases (particularly intergroup bias) of our psychology. These are important, but they provide only an incomplete understanding if we do not incorporate a focus on information and ideas. Media-effects research and comparative media studies provide evidence that the ignorance of the U.S. voter is only partly caused by cognitive limitations, and they point the way to a more effective way to bring social psychology into political science.

Getting Real about Realism: Voters Are More Reasonable, and Democracies More Responsive, than Achen and Bartels Suggest	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Christopher Achen; Larry Bartels; Democracy for Realists; group identity; democratic realism; macro-responsiveness; retrospective voting; voter irrationality		Our constitutional system is more sensitive to public sentiment than Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels suggest in Democracy for Realists. Even if our system is not micro-responsivemaintaining fidelity to public opinion, or to campaign promises, in every detail of public policyit is macro-responsive: politicians grasp core public expectations and do their best to meet them. While Achen and Bartels show that group loyalties decisively shape perceptions and expectations, people often revise these perceptions and expectations based on experience. Because we are more than the creatures of groups and parties, democracy works betterand is betterthan the authors suggest.

Abigail Thompson's recent mathematical criticisms of the theorem are incorrect, misleading, or irrelevant to the validity of the theorem. A common thread running through Thompson's objections is a lack of appreciation for how mathematics is used in social science. One element of her critique that has considerable value for the epistemic democracy literature, however, is her discussion of the importance of randomization for the Hong-Page result.

IRRATIONAL, RATIONALIZING, AND BIOLOGICALLY PREDISPOSED CITIZENS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						citizenship; cognitive development; conservatism; ideology; liberalism; motivated reasoning; political cognition		Decades of research demonstrate that most people have little knowledge or understanding of politics. Two recent works suggest that this reflects the limits of human cognitive capacity. Rather than being reasoned, political thinking is mostly preconscious, automatic, and recall driven. Consequently, it is vulnerable to contextual cueing, preexisting biases, and biological and genetic predispositions. However, this research is oriented by an inadequate understanding of cognition.

J	Cowen, N				Cowen, Nick			INTRODUCTION: SYMPOSIUM ON ROBUST POLITICAL ECONOMY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						epistemic challenge; Hayek; incentive problem; knowledge problem; Mark Pennington; Robust Political Economy	PUBLIC CHOICE; SELF-INTEREST; INSTITUTIONS; DEMOCRACY; EAST	Mark Pennington's Robust Political Economy is a systematic exposition of a framework for analyzing institutional performance. The Robust Political Economy framework evaluates institutions according to their ability to solve knowledge and incentive problems. On grounds of robustness, Pennington combines insights from Austrian market-process theory and public-choice theory to defend classical liberalism from several compelling critiques. These include theories of market failure in economics; communitarian, deliberative-democratic, and liberal-egalitarian theories of justice; and concerns with social capital, domestic and international poverty, and ecology.

J	Kaye, ST				Kaye, Simon T.			Democracy Despite Ignorance: Questioning the Veneration of Knowledge in Politics	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						value pluralism; epistemic democracy; voter ignorance; democracy; expertise; democratic theory; franchise limitation; rational irrationality; technocracy; Ilya Somin; political epistemology; rational ignorance; rationalism; knowledge problems		Ilya Somin, like several other political epistemologists, effectively exposes the extent of public ignorance and the ways in which such ignorance may damage democratic outcomes. This underpins his case for a more streamlined state, leaving more to individual "foot voting"-where citizens are better incentivized to choose knowledgeably and rationally. One cannot dispute the fact of deep public ignorance. However, one can question the widespread assumption that ignorance is necessarily ethically significant, always productive of undesirable outcomes, or otherwise implicitly dangerous for democracy. The sheer lack of individual efficacy in mass democracies not only incentivizes ignorance, but also creates conditions wherein such ignorance is individually harmless and unlikely in the aggregate to greatly contribute to one or another outcome. Beyond this, there may be no way to attain meaningful knowledge in the areas where democratic decision making is most fraught. Indeed, ignorance may at times lead to better outcomes than would knowledge. The seemingly unassailable status of democracy itself, and the valuable institutional stability that this status ensures, seem to be founded upon a bedrock of public ignorance as to the real nature of democracy.

J	Page, BI				Page, Benjamin I.			That Same Old Song: Somin on Political Ignorance	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						political ignorance; voter ignorance; collective deliberation; Ilya Somin; wisdom of crowds; miracle of aggregation		Ilya Somin's Democracy and Political Ignorance suffers from the fallacy of composition: It uses individual-level evidence about political behavior to draw inferences about the preferences and actions of the public as a whole. But collective public opinion is more stable, consistent, coherent, and responsive to the best available information, and more reflective of citizens' underlying values and interests, than are the opinions of most individual citizens. Because Somin tends to blame the general public for deficiencies in our political processes, he neglects the distorting roles of such elite-level factors as lies and misleading rhetoric from public officials, collusion between the major parties, and money run amok in our elections. Instead, he seeks solutions in such counterproductive measures as restricting the franchise, delegating decisions to unelected "experts," and decentralizing and downsizing government.

J	Shadd, P				Shadd, Philip			WHY THE FACTS MATTER TO PUBLIC JUSTIFICATION	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						empirical disagreement; political legitimacy; public justification; public reason; unanimity condition		It is often held that disagreement over non-normative facts is less significant to the project of public justification than disagreement over relevant moral norms. But this dismissal of non-normative factual disagreement is unjustifiedan ad hoc attempt to save the ideal of public justification from the endemic actual disagreement that threatens it. Disagreement over norms is relevant to political legitimacy; so, too, is disagreement over facts. I draw two implications from this point. First, inasmuch as accounts of public justification typically involve a unanimity condition, public justification should not be thought a desideratum of political legitimacy. Second, virtuous political praxis will often involve enforcing legislation in spite of unresolved non-normative factual disagreement. That is, with respect to legitimacy, there is nothing morally amiss about such legislation. Clearly these last claims presuppose some basis for legitimacy other than agreement; I will only gesture at what this might be. Assuming that much actual legislation is indeed legitimate, thoughin spite of extant normative and non-normative disagreementI go so far as concluding that such a basis, whatever it is, must exist.				pshadd@gmail.com						[Anonymous], 1979, MORTAL QUESTIONS; [Anonymous], THEORY, P201; Audi Robert, 1997, RELIG PUBLIC SQUARE; Buchanan A, 2002, ETHICS, V112, P689, DOI 10.1086/340313; Buchanan A, 2010, HUMAN RIGHTS LEGITIM; COHEN J, 1998, DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRA; Eberle ChristopherJ., 2002, RELIG CONVICTION LIB; Estlund DM, 2008, DEMOCRATIC AUTHORITY: A PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK, P1; Freeman Samuel, 2006, CONT DEBATES MORAL T; Gaus Gerald., 1996, JUSTIFICATORY LIBERA; Gutmann A., 1996, DEMOCRACY DISAGREEME; Lister A, 2013, BLOOMS RES POL PHIL, P1; Lister A, 2010, POLIT PHILOS ECON, V9, P151, DOI 10.1177/1470594X09345680; Macedo Stephen, 2000, NATURAL LAW PUBLIC R; NAGEL T, 1987, PHILOS PUBLIC AFF, V16, P215; Quong Jonathan, 2005, POLITICS PHILOS EC, V4, P301, DOI DOI 10.1177/1470594X05056606; Rawls J., 2005, POLITICAL LIBERALISM; Schwartzman Micah, 2004, POLITICS PHILOS EC, V3, P191, DOI DOI 10.1177/1470594X04042963; Shue H., 1996, BASIC RIGHTS SUBSIST; WALDRON J, 1987, PHILOS QUART, V37, P127, DOI 10.2307/2220334	20	2	2	0	0	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0891-3811	1933-8007		CRIT REV	Crit.

J	Carens, JH				Carens, Joseph H.			Invitation to a Dialogue	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Libertarians like John Tomasi, who care about social justice, must say more about which economic freedoms matter and why they matter if they hope to persuade liberal egalitarians to adopt their approach. In particular, they must clarify the preconditions of equal freedom and explore more fully the relationship between security and freedom. They must also address questions about collective-action problems and the extent to which the modern corporation should be viewed as an outgrowth and expression of individual freedom. Finally, libertarians (and liberal egalitarians) should engage more fully with recent feminist literature that challenges the ideal of market-centered self-authorship that Tomasi celebrates.

J	Brazeal, G				Brazeal, Gregory			WEBS OF FAITH AS A SOURCE OF REASONABLE DISAGREEMENT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								An individual's beliefs can be seen as rationally related to one another in a kind of web. These beliefs, however, may not form a single, seamless web. There may exist smaller, largely self-contained webs with few or no rational relations to the larger web. Such "webs of faith" make it possible for reasonable deliberators to persist in a disagreement even under ideal deliberative conditions. The possibility of reasonable disagreement challenges the assumption that rationality should lead to consensus and presents an obstacle to the goals of liberal democracy.

J	Mas, I				Mas, Ignacio			WHY ARE BANKS SO SCARCE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES? A REGULATORY AND INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In developing countries, banks are simply not present where the majority of poor people live and work. This imposes burdensome access costs on customers who need to travel to distant branches, so the majority of the population opts out from the formal banking system.

J	Gaus, G				Gaus, Gerald			IS THE PUBIC INCOMPETENT? COMPARED TO WHOM? ABOUT WHAT?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							MINIMUM-WAGE; LABOR-MARKET; EMPLOYMENT; KNOWLEDGE	From Mill to, most recently, Bryan Caplan, political and economic elites have been seen as the solution to the public's ignorance and incompetence. In order to show that elites are actually more competent than the public, however, we would have to find out what type of knowledge is necessary to enact good public policy. The empirical evidence shows that economic experts have a slight advantage over the general public in knowledge of how to achieve policy goals. But, contrary to Caplan, the evidence indicates that economists don't possess significant predictive knowledge, and that general economic laws are of little help in predicting the magnitude of the effects of a specific policy in a multi-variable, complex world. When we adopt a more complex understanding of the reasons behind policy choice, and consider rules and principles in addition to goal pursuit, the slight edge of economic experts evaporates.

J	Maizel, B				Maizel, B			Why talk if we disagree?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								According to a prevailing dogma of our time, real communication is practically impossible between those who have no common '' cultural language.'' Karl Popper disputed this widespread opinion, arguing that, while it is tremendously difficult to communicate with a real (not artificially constructed) intellectual opponent, at the same time it is infinitely fruitful to do so. He also demonstrated how, while arguing ideologically we improve both our own ideas and the collective knowledge of our society.

J	Steele, GR				Steele, GR			Critical thoughts about critical realism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								As microeconomic calculus and macroeconomic estimation superseded earlier approaches to political economy, broad questions about how things are (ontology), how things might be known (epistemology), and how science should proceed (methodology) were neglected. As a corrective, Critical Realism (CR) has been proposed as an alternative to the orthodox deductive-nomological (ODN) tradition; i.e., to mathematical deduction and statistical induction. In their place, retroduction-the use of analogy, metaphor, intuition and ordinary language-is supposed to illuminate root causes by identifying the deep mechanisms that govern events. CR offers guidelines for social science that are Of a most general kind:from initial "premises," retroduction proceeds to hypotheses about deep structures and mechanisms. The initial premises are determined by a desire to understand events that surprise us. However, nothing is thereby excluded, including ODN And since historical processes are revealed neither by assumption nor by the net effects of whatever initial conditions hold, it might be apposite to drop the search for (deep) socio-economic laws and to use whatever evidence is at hand to see whether, and the extent to which, ideal types apply to any given historical sequence.

J	Caplan, B				Caplan, B			Is socialism really "impossible"?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In the 192 os, Austrian-school economists began to argue that in a fully socialized economy, free of competitively generated prices, central planners would have no way to calculate which methods of production would be the most economical. They claimed that this "economic calculation problem" showed that socialism is "impossible." Although many believe that the Austrian position was later vindicated by the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the Austrian school's own methodology disallows such a conclusion. And historical evidence suggests that poor incentives-not lack of economic calculation-were the main source of the economic defects of "really existing socialism.".

J	Ciepley, D				Ciepley, D			Authority in the firm (and the attempt to theorize it away)	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The classical case for market society appeals to the complementary goods of economic liberty and maximum wealth. A market society overgrown with economic firms, however, partly sacrifices liberty for the sake of wealth. This point was accepted by prewar theorists of the economic firm, such as Frank Knight and Ronald Coase, and the attempt to moderate, or compensate for, the constriction of economic liberty was a central struggle of the Progressive Era. Since World War II, however, neoclassical economists have tried to assimilate the firm to the theory of market exchange. Because they have failed, issues Of authority and control have recently reassumed their place at the center of the theory of the firm.				ciepley@alumni.princeton.edu						ALCHIAN AA, 1972, EC FORCES WORK; CIEPLEY D, 2001, THESIS U CHICAGO; Coase Ronald H, 1937, READINGS PRICE THEOR; Edwards Richards., 1979, CONTESTED TERRAIN TR; GROSSMAN SJ, 1986, J POLIT ECON, V94, P691, DOI 10.1086/261404; HART O, 1990, J POLIT ECON, V98, P1119, DOI 10.1086/261729; HART O, 1989, ORG THEORY C BARNARD; Hartz Louis, 1968, EC POLICY DEMOCRATIC; JENSEN MC, 1976, J FINANC ECON, V3, P305, DOI 10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X; Knight F.H., 1935, ETHICS COMPETITION O; Knight FH., 1971, RISK UNCERTAINTY PRO; LARSON JL, 1990, STATE EC KNOWLEDGE A; Lee FS, 1999, RES HIST EC, V17, P23; MAYHEW A, 1998, INTERWAR PLURALISM P; McCloskey D.N., 1985, RHETORIC EC; MEANS G, 1935, SENATE DOCUMENT, V13; Mirowski Phil., 1989, MORE HEAT LIGHT; Mirowski Philip, 2002, MACHINE DREAMS EC BE; Novak William J., 1996, PEOPLES WELFARE LAW; Pocock J.

J	Sharma, SD				Sharma, SD			Bringing politics back in: Rethinking the Asian financial crisis and its aftermath	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								We now have a fairly good understanding of the economic causes of the 1977 Asian financial crisis. There is as yet, however, little understanding of the politics behind the crisis. Not only did various political systems in Asia play a significant role in fomenting the crisis, they have also demonstrated remarkable capacities in dealing with its aftermath. Nowhere is this more evident than in the far-reaching economic reforms implemented by the Kim Dae-Jung administration in South Korea. The key to Korea's success in weathering the crisis lay in the decisive leadership of Kim Dae-Jung and in the "developmental state" structures and institutions he inherited-both of which exemplify the autonomy of a putatively democratic state from societal, especially elite, pressures.

The very sophistication of these technologies defies comprehension; that is, it engenders and exacerbates public ignorance. As a result, democratic surveillance of state power is more enabling myth than fact.				salam@post.harvard.edu						Anderson B., 2006, IMAGINED COMMUNITIES; Bhabha Homi K, 1990, NATION NARRATION, P1, DOI DOI 10.1177/144078338602200206; Brubaker Rogers, 1996, NATL REFRAMED NATION, P83; Cairns Alan, 1995, RECONFIGURATIONS CAN; CHATTERJEE P, 1993, NATION FRAGMENTS; CLOWARD R, 1979, POOR PEOPLES MOVEMEN; Duara P., 1995, RESCUING HIST NATION; Friedman J, 1998, CRIT REV, V12, P397, DOI 10.1080/08913819808443510; Gellner Ernest, 1983, NATIONS NATL, P1; Gladney, 1996, MUSLIM CHINESE ETHNI; Greenfeld Liah, 1993, NATL 5 ROADS MODERNI; Habermas Jurgen, 1994, MULTICULTURALISM EXA; Habermas Jurgen, 1987, THEORY COMMUNICATIVE; Heclo Hugh., 1974, MODERN SOCIAL POLITI; KEATING M, 1998, REMAKING UNION; Migdal Joel, 1994, STATE POWER SOCIAL F; Olson M., 1982, RISE DECLINE NATIONS; Scott J.C., 2008, SEEING STATE; SHEIFER A, 1998, GRABBING HAND; Skocpol T., 1979, STATES SOCIAL REVOLU; Skocpol Theda, 1992, PROTECTING SOLDIERS; Smith Anthony., 1988, ETHNIC ORIGINS NATIO; Somin I, 1998, CRIT REV, V12, P413, DOI 10.1080/08913819808443511; Taylor C., 1994, MULTICULTURALISM POL, P25; YOUNG IM, 2000, EQUALITY	25	0	0	0	1	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0891-3811	1933-8007		CRIT REV	Crit.

However Kymlicka's synthesis ignores the aspects of each theory which make his task impossible. Particularly, his analysis vests upon a misleading picture of communitarian community and an incomplete appreciation of the divergent liberal and communitarian understandings of freedom and pluralism. In the process of demonstrating the incompatibility of these theories, the similarities between communitarianism and nationalism ave explored.

J	DOMBROWSKI, DA				DOMBROWSKI, DA			THE POLITICS OF ETHOLOGY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								While the academic discussion of gender and family issues often adopts the contractarian and consensual approach of liberalism, the work of Stephen R. L. Clark provides an interesting contrast. Clark turns to ethology as a guide to modes of social existence congruent with our evolutionary nature. Although an Aristotelian, Clark is not a sexist in arguing that household life is more important than what moderns call ''political'' life. Clark is premature, however, in accusing liberals who defend the rights of individuals of ignoring the ethological evidence. Liberals need not so emphasize the individual that they destroy the family as the locus of moral education.

This question is addressed by examining the contraction of 1990-1991 and the expansion leading up to it. An overview of the Austrian theory of the business cycle permits the identification of several empirical propositions implied by the theory. Empirical data for several economic variables are examined for consistency with the patterns suggested by the theory. The evidence suggests a muted Austrian cyclical process at work in conjunction with other factors during the time period studied.

J	FLEW, A				FLEW, A			DISSENT FROM THE NEW CONSENSUS - REPLY TO FRIEDMAN	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								This is a rejoinder to some of the contentions of Part II of Jeffrey Friedman's monster article (or mini-book?) about ''The New Consensus.'' After questioning his supposedly ''non-tendentious understanding of Marx,'' it proceeds to deny that what Friedman calls Positive Libertarianism is any more a sort of libertarianism than imaginary or non-existent cows are a kind of cows; and to insist that what Friedman calls morality is light years removed from the dutiful, domestic decencies of what would normally be considered moral conduct. Next it examines Friedman's misunderstandings of option rights, which actually presuppose only the weakest possible claims to equality. Finally it concludes with criticism of his bizarre and perverse assumption that concern about the consequences of our actions has little or nothing rather than almost everything to do with their morality.

J	Pamuk, Z				Pamuk, Zeynep			WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THE PROBLEM OF IGNORANCE?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						democracy; technocracy; expertise; ignorance; social science; prediction		In Power Without Knowledge, Jeffrey Friedman develops a critique of social science to argue that current technocratic practices are prone to predictive failures and unintended consequences. However, he does not provide evidence that the cause he singles out-"ideational heterogeneity"-is in fact a non-negligible source of technocratic limitations, more than or alongside better-known problems such as missing data, measurement issues, interpretive difficulties, and researcher bias. Even if we grant ideational heterogeneity, Friedman's preferred institutional solution of exitocracy does not necessarily follow. His critical epistemology would also be compatible with radical forms of collective action.

J	Wedeen, L				Wedeen, Lisa			Anti-Naturalism and Structure in Interpretive Social Science	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						discourse analysis; feminism; Foucault; hermeneutics; interpretivism; positivism; social structure; social science; Mark Bevir; Jason Blakely	CULTURE	Mark Bevir and Jason Blakely's Interpretive Social Science: An Anti-Naturalist Approach successfully points out the problems with various forms of philosophical naturalism, demonstrating how essentialism, synchrony, and an effort to establish lawlike generalizations bedevil social science on both sides of the interpretive/positivist divide. The authors do an excellent job of identifying the philosophical roots and debates that are tied to the interpretive turn, while offering a thought-provoking critique of Michel Foucault. However, Bevir and Blakely overstate the degree to which Foucault's work succumbs to forms of naturalism more typical of empiricist social science. Although this is certainly a problem in Foucault's work, the book too readily dismisses his important analysis of deep social structures, which cannot be reduced to individuals' ideas. Interpretive Social Science also overlooks relevant debates in feminist theory and existing criticisms of political culturalism, raising questions about the book's intended audience.

J	Bevir, M; Blakely, J				Bevir, Mark; Blakely, Jason			Naturalism and its Inadvertent Defenders	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						interpretive social science; hermeneutics; qualitative methods; quantitative methods; survey research		The interpretive turn in the social sciences, although much discussed, has effectively stalled and even begun to backslide. With the publication of Interpretive Social Science: An Anti-Naturalist Approach, we provide a systematic defense of interpretive inquiry intended to help reinvigorate this mode of study across the human sciences. This defense, unfortunately, needs to be deployed not only against social scientists who unwittingly adopt naturalistic philosophical assumptions, but against interpretivist fellow travelers such as Michel Foucault, who occasionally do the same thing; and even against interpretivists who assume that their philosophical position is secured by using only qualitative methods, and that quantitative methods are inherently unsuitable to interpretivist purposes.

J	Appel, H				Appel, Hilary			Can the EU Stop Eastern Europe';s Illiberal Turn?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						populism; Article 7; EU Accession; European Union; Hungary; illiberalism; Poland		The EU's activation of Article 7 procedures against Hungary and Poland signals that it is beginning to take seriously the illiberal turn in Central Europe. However, the likelihood that the EU can restrain populist and illiberal tendencies in Hungary and Poland in the near future is slim. Despite the efficacy of the EU and other international organizations in promoting liberalism in these countries in the past, similar efforts are hobbled by a lack of political will and by significant bureaucratic hurdles. The impetus to protect the liberal institutions and practices developed after the collapse of communism must come from the combined efforts of additional external actors and, most of all, by strong pressure from below.

J	Gourevitch, A				Gourevitch, Alex			Welcome to the Dark Side: A Classical-Liberal Argument for Economic Democracy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								John Tomasi's Free Market Fairness claims to provide a principled defense of classical-liberal institutions. Respect for the development of our moral powers or "self-authorship," according to Tomasi, requires that we make certain economic liberties basic, including freedom of contract and the right to accumulate property. Yet Tomasi's principles and his institutions are at odds. Tomasi has provided ethical grounds for defending not classical-liberal but radical-democratic, even socialist, economic freedoms. This is most vivid in Tomasi's account of the "liberties of working." He argues that it is not just the choice of work but control of the workplace experience that is a vital part of our self-authorship. If this is true, Tomasi has not given a defense of a robust right to "freedom of contract," but rather of those rights of control over work and property that leftists have long argued for.

J	Gunn, P				Gunn, Paul			DEMOCRACY AND EPISTOCRACY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In Democratic Reason, Helene Landemore argues that deliberation and the aggregation of citizens' dispersed knowledge should tend to produce better consequences than rule by the one or the few. However, she pays insufficient attention to the epistemic processes necessary to realize these democratic goods. In particular, she fails to consider the question of where citizens' beliefs and ideas come from, with the result that the democratic decision mechanisms she focuses on are insufficiently powerful to justify her consequentialist defense of mass decision making. If "the few" are technocratic experts, Landemore supplies little reason to resist their rule on epistemic grounds, for she does not secure a knowledge base for the citizens that might compete with the knowledge that is often attributed to such "experts." Aggregating and deliberating about poor information is no substitute for good information. Her book can therefore be seen as a call for a new phase of epistemic political theory that compares the real-world knowledgeability of ordinary citizens and putative experts, but it does not convincingly deliver on its goal to demonstrate the epistemic superiority of the former.

HEARING THE OPPOSITION: IT STARTS AT THE TOP	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							SELECTIVE EXPOSURE; POLITICAL INFORMATION; MOTIVATED SKEPTICISM; ONLINE GROUPS; POLARIZATION; BIAS; INTERNET; HETEROGENEITY; DISCOURSE; SEEKING	In Hearing the Other Side, Diana Mutz poses a conundrum: The more one is exposed to political disagreement, the more likely one is to withdraw from political engagement. This behavior may result in part from the political polarization of recent decades, but it may also be due to the traditional media, which tend to magnify political competition and portray it as a bitter conflict. The rise of the Internet and social media offered hope that people might more readily encounter the arguments of the other side.

J	Steele, GR				Steele, G. R.			CRITICAL REALISM AND THE ONTOLOGICAL TURN: REJOINDER TO LEWIS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								I agree with Paul Lewis that mathematics has a valuable but not all-encompassing role in economics, that event regularities must be supplemented with a persuasive narrative, and that inferences can inform our understanding of economic behavior. However, Lewis's full-throated defense of critical realism does little to allay my original concerns. It is absurd to maintain, as critical realists do, that mainstream economics has nothing valuable to offer heterodox economists, as their critique of the quantity theory of money tries to demonstrate. More crucially, critical realistsunlike Austrian economistsneglect to provide an epistemological explanation of economic actors' perceptions, which is necessary if we are to bridge critical realism's own division of the social world into the oactual,o oempirical,o and onon-actual real.o.

J	Fuller, S				Fuller, Steve			THINKING THE UNTHINKABLE AS A RADICAL SCIENTIFIC PROJECT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Philip Tetlock underestimates the import of his own Expert Political Judgment. It is much more than a critical scientific evaluation of the accuracy and consistency of political pundits. It also offers a blueprint for challenging expertise more generally-in the name of scientific advancement. "Thinking the unthinkable"-a strategy Tetlock employs when he gets experts to consider counterfactual scenarios that are far from their epistemic comfort zones-has had explosive consequences historically for both knowledge and morality by extending our sense of what is possible. Thinking the unthinkable might also put into question contemporary assumptions about the legitimacy of science.

J	Bhide, A				Bhide, Amar			AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Banks provide a valuable but inherently unstable combination of deposit-taking and lending functions that were successfully held together for several decades after the New Deal by tough banking rules. The weakening of the rules after the 1970s promoted the displacement of traditional relationship-based banking with securitized, arms-length alternatives that encouraged banks to undertake activities about which bankers lacked deep relationship-based knowledge of the risks. Ironically, this risky behavior, encouraged by loosened regulation, was reinforced by progressively tightened securities regulation, which promoted stock-market liquidity but also deprived large banks (and other publicly traded companies) of oversight by investors with oinsiders'o knowledge. Both the underregulation of banking and the overregulation of securities were underpinned by economic theories that favored blind diversification in liquid, anonymous markets, and that ignored the value of relationship-based knowledge and case-by-case due diligence.

J	Dilulio, JJ				Dilulio, John J., Jr.			The hyper-rhetorical presidency	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								During the Bill Clinton and George W Bush administrations, the Executive Office of the President became dominated by West Wing advisers who specialized in campaign politics, media management, and nonstop public communications. With record numbers of presidential appointees requiring no congressional approval, the Bush White House pursued partisan control of cabinet agencies. Even obscure federal bureaus were required to remain "on message." The constitutional derangement about which The Rhetorical Presidency had warned has occurred. No matter who occupies the Oval Office in the future, the hyper-rhetorical presidency is here to stay.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			A "Weapon in the Hands of the People": The rhetorical presidency in historical and conceptual context	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Editorial Material							IGNORANCE; ECONOMICS; STATE	The Tulis thesis becomes even more powerful when the constitutional revolution he describes is put in its Progressive-Era context. The public had long demanded social reforms designed to curb or replace laissez-faire capitalism, which was seen as antithetical to the interests of ordinary working people. But popular demands for social reform went largely unmet until the 1910s. Democratizing political reforms, such as the rhetorical presidency, were designed to facilitate "change" by finally giving the public the power to enact social reforms. The resulting political order has created systemic pressure for policy demagoguery in place of rational deliberation. Mass political mobilization seems to be better achieved by contests of grand principle that pit the well-meaning supporters of obviously needed reforms against "villains and conspirators," than by technical discussions of the possibly counterproductive effects of those reforms.

The character of a nation's parties and other political institutions greatly affects the extent of political participation among even citizens who are well informed and concerned about public affairs. And under appropriate conditions, the mobilization and enthusiastic engagement of the public will actually increase state power.

The myth of the Titanic should be understood as a literal-historical myth with an especially strong literary character and claim to truth; a myth whose interest has not been exhausted by time because it raises perennial existential issues, and more superficially because it reflects the widespread assumption that disaster is readily avoidable, and can be explained only by reference to stupidity or malfeasance.

J	Savodnik, P				Savodnik, P			Ernst Cassirer's theory of myth	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Ernst Cassirer viewed mythical thinking as a first step in our mental representation of the real world, but only a first step. What myth leaves out are the differentiations that lead eventually to science. To the primitive, mythically inclined mind, the world is an undifferentiated whole, the elements of which-including the mind itself-are thought to be concrete and interconnected. This means that there is no distinction between observer and observed, and that the observer sees the representations with which she constructs her picture of reality as direct apprehensions of reality, unmediated by any sensory or cognitive categories. Far as that way of thinking may seem from the modern mindset, we have only to examine commonplace political ideas to find evidence of the implicit assumption of an unmediated connection between the wishes of poltical agents and the results they intend to achieve.

J	Sorens, J				Sorens, J			The failure to converge: Why globalization doesn't cause deregulation	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							IGNORANCE; STATE	Conventional wisdom holds that the rigors of fiscal competition unleashed by globalization are forcing governments to roll back welfare programs, reduce or eliminate taxes on capital, and reduce regulation on mobile assets. In Freer Markets, More Pules, Steven Vogel attacks the latter contention, arguing that regulatory reform has been more often reregulatory than deregulatory, though it is generally undertaken with an eye to increasing market competition. He also maintains that governments have acted autonomously of social interests and market pressures in formulating regulatory reform. While Vogel is mistaken to contend that there has been no net reduction of government control worldwide, his revision of the conventional wisdom requires a fresh look at how susceptible states really are to the global competition for revenue.

J	Maizel, B				Maizel, B			The postmodern identity of Russia - And the West	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In contrast to societies where socialization takes place through the transmission of anonymous and hence overpowering traditions, the typical way of socialization for Western people is through productive dialogue guided by the search for objectivity. Postmodernism, however, fosters a form of dialogue in which people should not look for objective knowledge but should simply register their diverse opinions. Just this type of dialogue has been the norm in Russia for centuries. As a result, Russian cultural and political initiative has been dominated by an all-powerful state. In the West, we now witness a similar process, as the culture of nonjudgmental relativism consolidates its dominance over an increasingly postmodern society.

J	Llosa, AV				Llosa, AV			A capitalist revolution in Latin America?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								While it is true, as Paul Craig Roberts and Karen Lafollete maintain in The Capitalist Revolution in Latin America, that Latin America has begun to break away from its statist tradition, the basic culture of mercantilism, corporatism, and interventionism remains, underpinned by the positivist tradition that has made public policy and legislation a substitute for the rule of law, as reflected in a schema of essential rights. The confusion between a private-enterprise economy and a free economy is at the heart of the failure of Latin America to create a truly competitive, privilege-free, and institutionally adequate economic environment, while the divorce of market economics from the rule of law has led to an authoritarianism that has undermined the transition from a state-led to a private-enterprise economy.

Rather than present competing theories to compare against rational choice, Don Green and Ian Shapiro have merely alluded to alternative explanatory variables such as culture, institutions, and serial norms, without showing either how these factors can be incorporated into a move powerful theory, or how they are inconsistent with rational choice theory. It is likely that any eventual theory of the origin and maintenance of social institutions, norms, and values will have to reserve a central place for rational action.

But we can understand neither the prestige of rational choice theory nor its pathologies unless we see it as a variant of the equilibrium analysis found in physics, economics, and biology. Only such a global perspective on rational choice cheery will reveal its core assumptions and the likely shape of its future in political science. In this light, the growing dominance of rational choice theory in political science is all but inevitable and its pathologies are all but inescapable.

CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							CHIMPANZEES	In Sick Societies, Robert Edgerton argues that the longstanding principle of cultural relativism is misguided.

J	LLOYD, RE				LLOYD, RE			GOVERNMENT-INDUCED MARKET FAILURE - A NOTE ON THE ORIGINS OF FHA MORTGAGE INSURANCE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							PUBLIC CHOICE THEORY; GREAT CONTRACTION	The conventional wisdom regarding the creation of federal housing programs during the Great Depression cites market failure as the key factor leading to government action. A review of the historical record regarding one program in particular, the Federal Housing Administration's insurance of real-estate mortgages, suggests a more complex picture. Amortized loans were not created anew by the FHA but had been developed previously by various financial institutions; their use by national banks was restricted by law. What market failure occurred seems to have been induced, at least in part, by the federal government.			LLOYD, RE (corresponding author), US DEPT STATE,WASHINGTON,DC 20522, USA.

J	GOODHART, CAE				GOODHART, CAE			THE FREE BANKING CHALLENGE TO CENTRAL BANKS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The numerous historical episodes of free banking have invariably ended in the establishment of central banking. Was the failure of free banking due to ''theory,'' ''seignorage'' - the attempt by governments to use central banks for revenue purposes - or to ''crises''? Would a free banking system be stable, free of crises? This is the crux of the theoretical and historical debate.

Both decades were characterized by a policy-induced artificial boom that ended with an inevitable bust. The Federal Reserve had a hand in both episodes, keeping the interest rate artificially low in the first one and keeping Treasury bills artificially risk-free in the second. Comparing the two episodes in terms of Federal Reserve policy, federal government borrowing, and the regulatory environment faced by the banking community accounts for both similarities and differences between the economic realities of the 1990s and those of the 1930s.

J	RUNDE, J				RUNDE, J			DAVIDSON,PAUL AND THE AUSTRIANS - REPLY TO DAVIDSON	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							RUN NON-NEUTRALITY; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; UNCERTAINTY; MONEY	Paul Davidson's critique of O'Driscoll and Rizzo is based on an ''official'' philosophical position that turns on an opposition between knowledge and ignorance (in epistemology) and a corresponding opposition between ergodic and nonergodic processes (in ontology). But Davidson's substantive analysis reveals a very different ''unofficial'' position, based on ''sensible expectations'' and a realist ontology of enduring social structures. While O'Driscoll and Rizzo have the edge on Davidson in terms of their characterization of agents' beliefs, their ontology of event regularities is ultimately the same, and suffers from the same drawbacks, as Davidson's official ontology. The solution to some of these problems may lie in adopting an ontology similar to the one Davidson invokes in his unofficial capacity.

While critics of Berlin are right to note his neglect of Enlightenment constitutionalism, his skeptical liberalism is illuminated by comparative constitutional law, where we see how different constitutional regimes balance different values-such as democracy, liberty, and equality-in different ways that are attuned to the particulars of place and history that both Berlin and critics of liberalism insist are so important.

J	Benson, J				Benson, Jonathan			Exit, Voice and Technocracy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						technocracy; exit mechanism; exitocracy; political epistemology; green political theory; primary public goods; secondary public goods; tertiary public goods	DEMOCRACY; LIMITS; COMPLEXITY; MARKET	In Power Without Knowledge, Jeffrey Friedman develops a critique of technocracy and in doing so makes an epistemic case for exit over voice. He argues that a technocracy that fails to take people's ideational heterogeneity into account is unlikely to possess the knowledge required to solve social problems, and that the alternative of "exitocracy" may, in some cases, overcome these limits. By creating the conditions under which individuals can exit from undesirable social situations, an exitocracy may allow people to escape their social ills without knowing their society-wide causes or solutions. As Friedman recognizes, however, an exitocracy still requires technocratic knowledge, and this paper explores these requirements in further detail. First, it investigates the limits of exit as a solution to social problems, and the extent to which technocratic policies can be substituted for exit. Second, it considers the need for technocratic knowledge in the promotion of exit opportunities, and how this undermines Friedman's defense of exitocracy.

J	Schraub, D				Schraub, David			FINDING THE "SOVEREIGN" IN "SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY": LESSONS FROM BODIN, HOBBES, AND ROUSSEAU	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Bodin; constitutional law; Hobbes; Rousseau; sovereign immunity; sovereignty; James Wilson	CONSTITUTIONALISM; GOVERNMENT	The doctrine of "sovereign immunity" holds that the U.S. government cannot be sued without its consent. This is not found in the Constitution's text; it is justified on philosophical grounds as inherent to being a sovereign state: a sovereign must be able to issue commands free from constraint. The sources of this understanding of sovereignty-Hobbes, Bodin, and others-are, in turn, condemned by opponents of sovereign immunity as absolutists whose doctrines are incompatible with limited, constitutional government. This debate, and thus the usual conception of sovereign immunity, rests on a fundamental mistake. Hobbes and his peers were careful to avoid the conflation of government with sovereignty. "Sovereign" immunity, then, is an imposter doctrine that protects government officials by falsely draping them in the sovereign's cloak. The only sovereign actor, in the American polity, is the people in the act of making or amending the Constitution. Our true, Hobbesian sovereign immunity is nothing more than our unbounded freedom to enact constitutional law.

In response, I argue that due to quantum decoherence, the macroscopic world filters out quantum effects. Moreover, quantum decoherence makes it unlikely that the theory of quantum brains, on which Wendt relies, is true. Finally, while quantum decision theory is a potentially revolutionary field, it has not clearly accounted for alleged anomalies in classical understandings of decision making. However, the logic of quantum decoherence can motivate a new approach to the structure-agent problem.

J	Reich, R				Reich, Rob			Gift Giving and Philanthropy in Market Democracy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Classical liberals and libertarians assign fundamental importance to economic liberties and champion bottom-up approaches to social welfare. They point to the significance, even superiority, of philanthropy in providing for society's most disadvantaged citizens, and they defend rights of inheritance and intergenerational transmission of wealth. So one might think that John Tomasi's "market democracy" would defend gift giving and philanthropy. But market democracy leaves far less room than might be thought for an enthusiastic defense of gift giving and philanthropy, and this distances market democracy more than we might expect from the territory of classical liberalism and libertarianism.

J	Ryan, A				Ryan, Alan			THE PLANNERS AND THE PLANNED	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Much of what makes Hayek so controversial can be found in The Road to Serfdom, the theoretical basis of which is provided by The Counter-Revolution of Science. The first book, a polemic against the planning mentality, did not defend complete laissez faire, but argued that planning disrupts the coordination between prices and supply and demand; that effective planning is thus impossible in a modern industrial society; that it is coercive; and, of course, that it leads to totalitarianism. In The Counter-Revolution of Science, Hayek argued that the planning mentality is the result of the hubristic attempt to reconstruct society along scientific lines. But the likes of Edward Bellamy envisioned a planned but free society, while John Dewey contrasted planning, where people collectively choose their goals, against a planned economy that is coercively imposed. Hayek's welcome strictures against a scientistic society and an overly ambitious social science aside, his binary approach to intellectual history distorted through oversimplification.

J	Monteiro, NP				Monteiro, Nuno P.			WE CAN NEVER STUDY MERELY ONE THING: REFLECTIONS ON SYSTEMS THINKING AND IR	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							UNIPOLARITY	Robert Jervis's System Effects was published just as systems thinking began to decline among political scientists, who were adopting increasingly strict standards of causal identification, privileging experimental and large-N studies. Many politically consequential system effects are not amenable to research designs that meet these standards, yet they must nonetheless be studied if the most important questions of international politics are to be answered. For example, if nuclear weapons are considered in light of their effect on the international system as a whole, it becomes clear that they have obviated the need for a global balance of power by allowing states to counterbalance threats by acquiring nuclear weapons rather than investing in massive conventional balancing efforts. Similarly, systems thinking should inform our understanding of the impact of a unipolar power such as the United States, which has enjoyed an overwhelming preponderance of conventional military power since the fall of the Berlin Wall. A unipolar power is likely to become involved in frequent conflicts because it is not restrained by the presence of a peer competitor.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			MOTIVATED SKEPTICISM OR INEVITABLE CONVICTION? DOGMATISM AND THE STUDY OF POLITICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							BIASED ASSIMILATION; PSYCHOLOGY; ACCOUNTABILITY; COMPLEXITY	Taber and Lodge's 2006 paper provides powerful evidence that one's prior beliefs shape one's reception of new evidence in a manner that can best be described as "inadvertently dogmatic." This is especially true for people who are well informed, which dovetails with findings going back to Converse (1964) showing political beliefs to be ideologically constrained (rigid) among the relatively well informed. What may explain the coincidence of dogmatism and knowledgeability is the very process of learning about politics, which must use theories, schemas, ideologies, or Lippmannesque "stereotypes" to target certain political information as germane by putting it into an interpretive framework. This interpretive process is likely to create for each of us a growing database of information that is congruent with our extant convictions but that excludes incongruent information: in light of the data we have already processed, incongruent information seems increasingly implausible (if not incomprehensible), and is therefore rationally ignored or dismissed. But this does not necessarily mean, as Taber and Lodge follow Robert Abelson in suggesting, that people are "motivated" to be dogmatic rather than being unintentionally closed minded as a result of the plausibility they involuntarily accord to their priors. Recognizing the inadvertent (unmotivated) nature of dogmatism is essential if political science is to take seriously political actors' beliefs-and to assess the gravity of the problem posed by dogmatism.

J	Kling, A				Kling, Arnold			MACROECONOMETRICS: THE SCIENCE OF HUBRIS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Macroeconometric models are built on astonishingly precarious grounds and yet are used by policy makers to project precision and certainty. Econometricians use lagged dependent variables, oadd factors,o and other techniques to make their models more accurateat the expense of the integrity of the models. The reason for the unscientific nature of macroeconometric models is that, unlike the objects of controlled experimentation, real-world events are often unique and non-repeatable. Models that use repeatable events are poorly suited to accurate prediction or historical explanation.

SELF-INTEREST AND PUBLIC INTEREST: THE MOTIVATIONS OF POLITICAL ACTORS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							IDEOLOGY	Self-Interest and Public Interest in Western Politics showed that the public, politicians, and bureaucrats are often public spirited. But this does not invalidate public-choice theory. Public-choice theory is an ideal type, not a claim that self-interest explains all political behavior. Instead, public-choice theory is useful in creating rules and institutions that guard against the worst case, which would be universal self-interestedness in politics. In contrast, the public-interest hypothesis is neither a comprehensive explanation of political behavior nor a sound basis for institutional design.

J	White, LJ				White, Lawrence J.			THE CREDIT-RATING AGENCIES AND THE SUBPRIME DEBACLE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								By means of the high ratings that they awarded to subprime mortgage-backed bonds, the three major rating agenciesMoody's, Standard Poor's, and Fitchplayed a central role in the current financial crisis. Without these ratings, it is doubtful that subprime mortgages would have been issued in such huge amounts, since a major reason for the subprime lending boom was investor demand for high-rated bondsmuch of it generated by regulations that made such bonds mandatory for large institutional investors. And it is even less likely that such bonds would have become concentrated on the balance sheets of the banks, for which they were rewarded by capital regulations that tilted toward high-rated securities. Why, then, were the agencies excessively optimistic in their ratings of subprime mortgage-backed securities? A combination of their fee structure, the complexity of the bonds that they were rating, insufficient historical data, some carelessness, and market pressures proved to be a potent brew. This combination was enabled, however, by seven decades of financial regulation that, beginning in the 1930s, had conferred the force of law upon these agencies' judgments about the creditworthiness of bonds and that, since 1975, had protected the three agencies from competition.

J	Shields, JA				Shields, Jon A.			Christian citizens: The promise and limits of deliberation	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							POLITICS	The media's attentive vigil over America's most militant and outrageous activists in the abortion wars has obscured a massive but quiet effort on the part of evangelicals to engage their opponents in exemplary deliberative discussions about bioethics. For a variety of reasons, activists in the pro-life movement are more committed to carving out civic spaces for such dialogue than are their pro-choice counterparts. This discrepancy, invites investigation into the forces that promote and constrain political movements' interest in deliberation, as well as highlighting the undeniable limits to deliberative ideals.

Blyth emphasizes the need to view markets as "socially embedded," with which we agree-but he appears not to take account of the individual self-interest that is thus embedded. Similarly, he asserts a priori the role of ideas in history, in parallel to the economists he condemns (unfairly)for reading ideas out of history a priori. All of this poorly serves the cause of extracting Polanyi welcome emphasis on social embeddedness and on the empirical from the ideological and methodological certitudes and errors in which The Great Transformation placed them.

J	Berkowitz, P				Berkowitz, P			The demagoguery of democratic theory	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								For all of its blessings, democracy in America displays weaknesses. Democratic theorists both disguise and exacerbate these weaknesses by urging us, as imperatives of democratic justice, to extend the claims of equality to all practices and throughout all spheres of life; and to discount what people actually want in favor of what democratic theorists think that reason tells us people ought to want. Such theorizing encourages the evisceration of virtue, the trivialization of truth, the subjugation of chance, the fear of freedom, and the routinization Of romantic love.

J	Lal, D				Lal, D			The Third World and globalization	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Many in both developed and developing countries fear global economic integration. But developing-country fears of volatile capital flows are unfounded, as are developed-country fears of pauper wages due to low-cost imports. Demands for "ethical trading" are as misplaced as the fears of Third World cultural nationalists that globalization will destroy their valued ways of life.

J	Hejeebu, S; McCloskey, D				Hejeebu, S; McCloskey, D			The reproving of Karl Polanyi	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation has had enormous influence since its publication in 1944. In form, this influence has been salutary: Polanyi targets one of the main weaknesses of modern economics. But in substance, Polanyi's influence has been baneful. Mirroring the methodological blindness he criticizes, Polanyi insists on the all-or-nothing excistence/nonexistence of laissez faire-and on its all-or-nothing goodness/badness.

J	Smith, RM				Smith, RM			America's contents and discontents: Reflections on Michael Sandel's America	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review								Michael Sandel's Democracy's Discontent traces America's woes to an erosion of community and a loss of a sense of collective self-governance. He recommends a more communitarian, republican public philosophy as the cure. His book illuminates many important historical and contemporary issues, particularly the link between systems of political economy and visions of citizenship. His methods ave, however, too impressionistic to support his empirical claims. He particularly neglects the role of civic republicanism in America's history of racial, gender, and religious discrimination, Hence his call for Americans to minimize liberal doctrines of individual rights in favor of communally minded republicanism is not fully persuasive.

J	Breckman, W; Tragardh, L				Breckman, W; Tragardh, L			Nationalism, individualism, and capitalism: Reply	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Reversing the arguments of Anderson, Gellner, and Hobsbawm, Liah Greenfeld contends that it is nationalism that produces economic development. Specifically, she claims that nationalism inspired three seminal economic thinkers: Marx, List, and Smith. However, Greenfeld's ideological preferences lead her to a problematic conception of individualism as nationalism, as well as to flawed treatments of Smith, List, and Marx. Nationalism is better understood as an attempt to address the deepening conflict between the imperative of community and the secular trends of the marketplace, which challenge national sovereignty and democracy.

J	Greenfeld, L				Greenfeld, L			The worth of nations: Some economic implications of nationalism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Accounts that attribute nationalism to capitalism or industrialization fare the problem of nationalism in late-stage capitalist, or as some might say; post-industrial, societies. While increasing social significance has been attributed to economic growth throughout human history, reasons for this are far from self-evident. By looking at arguments mane by Marx, List, and Smith, a new understanding of the relationship between nationalism and economics emerges - one that explains the attribution of social importance to economic development by revealing it as a function of nationalism.

Brock over the junk-bond buyouts of the 1980s missed the mark on a number of points. In reality, neither the buyouts nor their sudden near-cessation contributed materially to the recession of 1990-91. The buyout wave did not end primarily because of new restrictive regulations. The buyouts had no appreciable effect on veal capital formation. And the increased rare of bankruptcies resulting from the buyouts left the economy's overall efficiency unimpaired.

J	Legutko, R				Legutko, R			Libertarianism vs community: Reply to Simpson	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Like many libertarian thinkers, Simpson assumes that the minimal state is culturally neutral. This is false. Libertarianism is a theory opposed to hierarchy at the state level. As such, it also undermines the grounds for hierarchy at the community level. Since communities require some form of hierarchy not only to exist but to generate meaningful culture, libertarianism is inherently nonneutral towards culture. From this it follows that Simpson's idea of a minimal state overseeing various nonliberal communities cannot be realized within the libertarian framework. In its place, I defend republicanism, which makes no pretensions toward cultural neutrality.

These responses stem from demonstrable precommitments to libertarian ideology, suggesting that the debate over FME and LE has profound implications, not only for their practitioners, but for all libertarians and many free-market social scientists.

J	PRYCHITKO, DL				PRYCHITKO, DL			FORMALISM IN AUSTRIAN-SCHOOL WELFARE ECONOMICS - ANOTHER PRETENSE OF KNOWLEDGE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Contemporary Austrian-school economists reject neoclassical welfare theory for being founded on the benchmark of a perfectly competitive general equilibrium, and instead favor a formal theory deemed consistent with the notions of radical subjectivism and disequilibrium analysis. Roy Cordato advances a bold free-market benchmark by which to formally assess social welfare, economic efficiency, and externalities issues. Like all formalist, a priori theory, however, Cordato's reformulation cannot meet its own standards, being theoretically and empirically flawed, and perhaps ideologically suspect.

Beyond that, however, Anderson and Leal's Free Market Environmentalism neglects the classic works in the intellectual tradition to which it is supposed to be a contribution; is unconvincing and inconsistent in the functions it ascribes to the ''environmental entrepreneur''; conflates problems of distribution and scale with the problem of allocation; ignores international dimensions; and misrepresents the debate over ''sustainable development.''

J	Friedman, S				Friedman, Shterna			Early Modern Epistemologies and Religious Intolerance	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						disagreement; fallibilism; religious pluralism; political epistemology; tolerance; toleration; John Calvin; Sebastian Castellio; Desiderius Erasmus; Sebastian Franck		There is a direct relationship between epistemology and one's attitude toward those with whom one disagrees. Those who think that the truth is difficult to ascertain can be expected, other things equal, to tend to tolerate (in the sense of sympathizing with) those with whom they disagree, as the blameless victims of an opaque reality. Those who think that the truth is easy to ascertain can be expected, other things equal, to tend to be intolerant (in the sense of being unsympathetic) toward those with whom they disagree, who perversely refuse to acknowledge what should be clear to any well-intentioned inquirer. However, these tendencies toward tolerant or intolerant attitudes can be offset by other factors; and they do not, in any case, necessarily dictate whether one will favor tolerant or intolerant policies regarding those toward whom one feels tolerant or intolerant. The complex relationship between epistemology, tolerant or intolerant attitudes, and tolerant or intolerant policies is evident in the thought of prominent early-modern Protestant theologians who, under the pressure of rampant and violent religious disagreement, theorized tolerance.

J	Wattenberg, MP				Wattenberg, Martin P.			THE CHANGING NATURE OF MASS BELIEF SYSTEMS: THE RISE OF CONCEPT AND POLICY IDEOLOGUES	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						belief systems; concept ideologues; policy ideologues; levels of conceptualization; political sophistication; Philip E. Converse		The proportion of the American electorate that is "constrained" by ideology has risen dramatically since Philip E. Converse suggested, in the early 1960s, that ideology is the province of only a small fraction of the mass public. In part, the rise of ideological voters has been obscured by the tendency of scholars after Converse to equate them with those who use terms referring to ideological concepts, such as liberal and conservative, in open-ended interviews. These "concept ideologues," however, are not the only members of the public whose political opinions show evidence of ideological constraint. There is also a growing segment of the public, the "policy ideologues," who take positions on three or more policy issues but do not happen to mention ideological concepts. Policy ideologues prove to be as politically knowledgeable as concept ideologues; their attitudes are nearly as constrained across issues and over time; and their policy stances usually "make sense" as liberal or conservative-not surprisingly, as they are almost as willing as concept ideologues to label themselves ideologically, when asked. By 2012, the portion of the public consisting of concept and policy ideologues had reached 42 percent. It declined to 38 percent in 2016, but was still a far cry from the 12 percent of the electorate whom Converse identified as ideologues or near ideologues as of 1956.

Identities for Realists	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Christopher Achen; Larry Bartels; group identity; retrospective voting; social identity		Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels argue, in Democracy for Realists, that voters tend to be not only politically ignorant but irrationally attached to group identities. That they use group identities is not in dispute, but the irrationality of doing so is questionable. The instability and malleability of group identities suggests that they are more than primal, illogical attachments. While Achen and Bartels assume that they must be affective, they may in fact be rational. They may, for example, serve as heuristics for individual interests.				mfiorina@stanford.edu						Bates R.

Medical innovation, however, remains more closed and regimented because of age-old traditions, reinforced by modern funding and regulatory practices that require the costly ex-ante demonstration of efficacy. These practices, which seek to replicate those of the natural sciences, militate against the pluralistic creation and use of medical innovations and suppress ad-hoc, accretive-and potentially life-saving-advances.

Consciousness at the Interface: Wendt, Eastern Wisdom and the Ethics of Intra-Action	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Buddhism; Daoism; entanglement; vitalism; Alexander Wendt; Ludwig Wittgenstein		Drawing on the family resemblance between quantum physics and Eastern wisdom identified by Niels Bohr, this article brings insights from Buddhism and Daoism to the task of enhancing our understanding of the significance of Alexander Wendt's argument for a quantum-based social science. Five areas of overlap between his argument and Eastern wisdom are explored: vitalism and the idea that life goes all the way down; the dependence of consciousness on both subjectivity and relationality; the ethical significance of language; the notion of changing the past; and the importance of leaders. The family resemblances between Wendt's perspective and those available in Daoism and Buddhism are remarkable.	[Fierke, K.

J	Hay, C				Hay, Colin			The Interdependence of Intra- and Inter-Subjectivity in Constructivist Institutionalism	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						constructivism; constructivist institutionalism; interpretivism; inter-subjectivity; intra-subjectivity; subjectivity		Oscar Larsson's sympathetic critique of constructivist institutionalism calls for a clarification of my understanding of subjectivity, inter-subjectivity, and their mutual interdependence. That interdependence lies at the heart of any genuinely constructivist approach, just as the interdependence of structure and agency lies at the heart of any genuinely institutionalist approach. As such, I reject the charge of subjectivism just as I would that of voluntarism. Building on the social ontology of Berger and Luckmann, we can distinguish between subjectivity and intra-subjectivity and proceed to show how the latter implies a notion of inter-subjectivity. An example of the social construction of a political crisis shows that social facts are made and remade through a fusion of inter- and intra-subjectivities.

J	Kuehn, D				Kuehn, Daniel			Piketty and Political Epistemology	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						belief formation; Condorcet Jury Theorem; inequality; Thomas Piketty; political economy; political epistemology	IGNORANCE; KNOWLEDGE	Although Thomas Piketty is largely known for his recent empirical contributions to the study of inequality, his work on epistemology has been substantial. It remains relatively unreferenced in the political epistemology literature both because it has been overshadowed by his work on inequality and because it was written for an audience of economists rather than political scientists. Piketty's work on these themes can be divided into analyses of political belief formation and analyses of the epistemic properties of democratic institutions. Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Piketty's recent book, also reflects his long-standing interest in epistemological questions. The major epistemic claim of that book is that political knowledge is an endogenous phenomenon: policy generates new knowledge over the course of its administration. One of the benefits of the primary policy proposal of Capital, the global wealth tax, is that it will generate new knowledge about wealth inequality.

J	Stilz, A				Stilz, Anna			Is The Free Market Fair?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								While John Tomasi's Free Market Fairness is ambitious, provocative, and does much to reinvigorate debate about economic justice, his argument for market democracy is not compelling. I discuss two objections. First, I offer doubts about whether "thick" economic freedom is a condition of democratic legitimacy. While Tomasi raises the intriguing possibility that liberal commitments may justify a somewhat more expansive list of economic rights than traditionally recognized, he fails to give a well-worked-out account of these rights. Instead, he argues for unfettered economic liberty without adequately connecting it to citizens' self-authorship, or showing how it could feasibly be protected alongside other basic liberties. Second, I argue that a concern for citizens' agency and economic self-authorship should lead us to endorse a social-democratic regime, not a market-democratic one. Market democracy leaves out or heavily revises key aspects of justice as fairness as developed by Rawls, including fair equality of opportunity and the fair value of the political liberties. Moreover, while Tomasi claims that social democracy rests on a perfectionist prioritizing of citizens' status over their agency, I argue that social democracy is best defended on agency-based grounds.

J	Kuehn, D				Kuehn, Daniel			HAYEK'S BUSINESS-CYCLE THEORY: HALF RIGHT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The Great Recession has brought with it a renewed interest in Hayek's business-cycle theory, which holds that loose monetary policy generates an unsustainable boom characterized by a lengthening of the capital structure. Hayek's theory has received robust criticism for decades, although the criticisms have varied in quality. Various empirical disconfirmations pose the most serious challenge. The small empirical literature on the subject generally confirms Hayek's predictions about variations in the capital structure, but has not persuasively linked the capital structure to the business cycle. A better option, then, may be to abandon Hayek's business-cycle theory, preserve his capital theory, and graft it onto a Keynesian or monetarist understanding of the business cycle that is more consistent with modern macroeconomics.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			BEYOND CUES AND POLITICAL ELITES: THE FORGOTTEN ZALLER	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							MOTIVATED SKEPTICISM; AGAIN	Zaller's Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion initially sets out an epistemic view of politics in which the ultimate determinants of political action are ideas about the society in which we act. These ideas are usually mediated to us by others, so Zaller begins the book by describing its topic as the influence of the media on public opinion, and he includes journalists among the political elites who exert this influence (along with politicians, public officials, and experts). But the book eventually reduces journalists to being messengers of politicians' cues to the public. This understanding of the media is built into the book's model of opinion formation, in which cued predispositions are pivotal to the acceptance or rejection of culturally mediated messagesbut are themselves insulated from cultural influence. A cueing model of message reception, however, ignores messages that are differentially persuasive not because of the predispositions they cue but the content they convey. Gauging the heterogeneous persuasiveness of messages requires qualitative content analysis and cultural contextualization, and if this research is to contribute to a general understanding of public opinion, it will have to extend beyond news-media messages to ideational influences carried in high culture, formal education, and the entertainment media. All of these sources of ideas, in turn, may contribute to the shaping of predispositions, as suggested in part by public opinion regarding the Vietnam War.

J	Jervis, R				Jervis, Robert			SYSTEM EFFECTS REVISITED	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							COMPLEXITY	System effects often stand in the way of attempts to come up with simple explanations of politics. Systems are often characterized by nonlinearities, where an effect is more than the sum of the effects of the actions taken by multiple actors. Another system effect is feedback, where the effect of actions is to amplify the problem the actions are intended to solve. There may also be indirect effects, where an incidental aspect of an action becomes more important (to other actors) than the primary intention; contingencies, such that an effect is not inevitable but depends on idiosyncratic or even anti-strategic initial actions; interaction effects, where the behavior of an actor changes the environment of action, so that other actors do not respond as anticipated; and unintended consequences, where the long-term or secondary effects of an action differ from the intended effect. Each of these system effects can frustrate scholarly attempts to understand political behavior using simple models of action, and, even more, can frustrate the attempts of political decision makers to predict the effects of their actions.

J	Kay, J				Kay, John			THE MAP IS NOT THE TERRITORY: MODELS, SCIENTISTS, AND THE STATE OF MODERN MACROECONOMICS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Policy makers and economists alike failed to predict the financial crisis of 2008. Their failure is due not only to the difficulties in predicting events in a complex world, but to the self-referential character of modern macroeconomics. Instead of seeking new empirical insights about economic behavior, macroeconomists have become creators of computer games-content to develop models that are internally consistent but have no necessary connection to the real world. Economic modeling aspires to be scientific in its deductive consistency and rigor. However, even the natural sciences require a good dose of induction, which, in turn, entails varying one's method of study based on the phenomenon one is studying.

J	Steele, GR				Steele, G. R.			NETWORKS, KNOWLEDGE, AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Neural activity and social activity share close parallels, particularly the fact that spontaneous adaptations are paramount in both realms. Environmental pressures require organisms and societies to adapt to new and uncertain situations. Adaptations create, respectively, stronger neural and social networks that may, in turn, make the system more resilient to future uncertainties-but only if the adaptations are beneficial to the system.

J	Lewin, L				Lewin, Leif			COOPERATION FOR THE COMMON GOOD: REPLY TO THE SYMPOSIUM	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The "symmetry assumption" in public-choice theory-the idea that people act just as selfishly in the political sphere as they do in the economic sphere-is a good theory that runs afoul of much of the evidence. The public-choice theorists in this symposium, Munger and Mueller, have thus retreated from claiming that public choice explains most political behavior, with Munger positing it as an ideal type that, in principle, might explain no behavior at all. For example, Berman suggests that even politicians who say and do "anything" to be elected or re-elected may well do so in order to acquire the power they think they need if they are to enact policies that will serve the public good. The normative project of "constitutional political economy" into which the original, empirical version of public choice seems to have evolved may or may not tell us how to structure institutions to prevent greedy actors from using politics as a means to their personal aggrandizement. But that project cannot, even hypothetically, produce the public-choice "findings" of widespread self-interestedness in politics that my book found were nonexistent.

His book is shaped by pro-market and pro-expert biases and anti-democratic attitudes, leading to one-sided and conclusion-driven arguments. His notion that voters are rationally irrational when they hold anti-market and anti-trade beliefs is incoherent, as is his idea that sociotropic voting can be explained as the rational purchase of a good self-image.

J	Hardin, R				Hardin, Russell			Ignorant democracy	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The paradox of mass voting is not, generally speaking, matched by a paradoxical mass attempt to be politically well informed. As Converse underscored, most people are grossly politically ignorant just as they would be if, as rational-ignorance theory holds, they realized that their votes don't matter. Yet many millions of them contradict the theory by voting. This contradiction, and the illogical reasons people offer for voting, suggest that the logic of collective action does not come naturally to people (as teachers of the theory know well). To equate public ignorance with "rational ignorance," then, attributes too much theoretical self-consciousness to people. Even if their ignorance is not based on a grasp of the collective-action problem, however, people's political ignorance is "rational": but it is less a matter of calculating the low benefit likely to flow from one vote in a sea of millions, than of encountering the much higher cost of being well informed as compared to voting. As the high cost of becoming well informed appears likely to grow, it may be advisable to move off of the political agenda issues that have no clear continuum toward which a mostly ignorant median voter may gravitate.

J	Caldwell, B				Caldwell, B			Recovering Popper: For the left?	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								In his biography of Karl Popper, Malachi Hacohen brilliantly reconstructs the development of Popper's ideas through 1946, correcting many errors regarding the sequence of their emergence. In addition he recreates Popper's Vienna and provides insights into Popper's complex personality. A larger goal of Hacohen's narrative is to show the relevance of Popper's philosophical and political thought for the left. Unfortunately this leads him to neglect and distort certain aspects of the story he tells, particularly when it comes to the relationship between Popper and EA. Hayek.

J	Somin, I				Somin, I			Richard Posner's democratic pragmatism and the problem of ignorance	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Review							VOTER	Richard Posner's Law, Pragmatism, and Democracy urges that political and legal decision makers should be guided by what he calls "everyday pragmatism," rather than by "abstract" moral theory. He links his conception of pragmatic government to Schumpeter's unromantic view of democracy. Posner argues that judicial review should be based on a combination of pragmatism and adherence to this limited conception of democracy, rather than sticking closely to ''formalist" theories of adjudication, which demand strict adherence to traditional legal norms. However, Posner consequentialist pragmatism fails to provide an adequate guide to judicial decision making, because it does not give us any criterion for deciding which consequences are desirable, His Schumpeterian theory of democracy, too, is problematic because it does not sufficiently consider the shortcomings exposed in recent scholarship in political science and economics.

J	Beiner, R				Beiner, R			Community versus citizenship: MacIntyre's revolt against the modern state	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Among the theorists commonly associated with the communitarian critique of liberalism of the 1980s (Charles Taylor, Michael Sandel, Michael Walzer, and Alasdair MacIntyre), MacIntyre is the one who offers the most radical set of challenges to ways of thinking that typify contemporary liberalism. But does MacIntyre's thought add up to a fully worked-out political philosophy? The specifically political implications of MacIntyre's contributions to moral philosophy are surprisingly underdeveloped in MacIntyre's most influential writings, notwithstanding the rhetorical force of his polemics against liberalism. Happily, MacIntyre has more recently published works in which his political vision is more clearly spelled out.

This result should make us question either the political relevance of egalitarian ideals or the adequacy of those theories of equality.

J	Horwitz, S				Horwitz, S			Keynes and capitalism one more time: A further reply to hill	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Greg Hill continues to miss my distinction between what is true of free market capitalism and what is true of the interventionist forms of capitalism that characterize Western economies. It is central banking that triggers lower aggregate demand when the public's desire to save grows. If increases in saving occur through the holding of additional private bank liabilities, rather than central-bank created money, banks could adjust their supply of liabilities so as to keep saving and investment equal and avoid reductions in aggregate demand. Hill's alternatives to market-driven financial intermediaries also fail to compare fairly the market and political processes.

First, he fails to consider that the goal of social justice, like the goal of wealth generation, might be promoted by strategies of indirection that do not entail oppressive organization. Second, he underestimates the tendency of the market order itself to generate oppressive organization, and consequently sees advantages in the market order that it may not possess.

Most of the articles in this anthology find that markets often meet the demand for public goods in a variety of cases where existing theory would lead one to expect market failure. Moreover, upon reflection, existing theory reveals itself to be in need of supplementation by a more realistic picture of how flexible markets (and evolving systems of property rights) respond to the demand for public goods and for the means of internalizing externalities.

Some contend that this deal mania, and the junk debt that fueled it, enhanced the nation's economic performance and bolstered its global competitiveness. Viewed in the context of its aftermath, however, the evidence suggests that a decade of junk-debt deals subverted economic performance, weakened the country's economy and rendered it dangerously vulnerable to recession, and inflicted a massive opportunity cost vis-a-vis America's foreign rivals.

J	SELGIN, G				SELGIN, G			THE RATIONALIZATION OF CENTRAL BANKS	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Charles Goodhart's The Evolution of Central Banks represents a rare and welcome attempt to spell out those shortcomings of 'free banking'' that supply a rationale for the establishment of central banks. However, one of Goodhart's principal arguments - that central banks are practically inevitable outgrowths of the ''natural'' tendency for bank reserves to become concentrated in a dominant ''bankers' bank'' - understates the role legal restrictions have played in sponsoring the emergence of bankers' banks, including the Bank of England. Some of Goodhart's other arguments against free banking rest on an exaggerated view of the likelihood of business cycles and financial crises under free banking as compared with central banking.

J	NARVESON, J				NARVESON, J			LIBERTARIANISM, POSTLIBERTARIANISM, AND THE WELFARE-STATE - REPLY TO FRIEDMAN	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Jeffrey Friedman broaches a number of criticisms of Libertarianism as a conceptual basis for opposing the extensive modern welfare state, examining several variants and concluding that they are fundamentally unsupported. He opts for a ''consequentialist'' view of foundations. Nevertheless, he thinks that the modern welfare state is subject to effective critique along such lines. But rational contractarian individualism works and does provide foundations for libertarianism, while ''consequentialism'' is an ill-defined theory that is quite unpromising for the proposed critique; nevertheless, Friedman's empirical and economic critique of the welfare state is valid.

Achen and Larry M. Bartels's call, in Democracy for Realists, for rethinking our model of democracy. In this paper I suggest that the evidence for citizen incompetence is not as clear as we might think; important research shows that we are good group problem solvers even if we are poor solitary truth seekers. I argue that deliberative democracy theory has a better handle on this fundamental fact of human cognition and therefore has a more realistic view of the conditions that might improve citizen competence.

J	Jacobs, T				Jacobs, Thomas			The Dislocated Universe of Laclau and Mouffe: An Introduction to Post-Structuralist Discourse Theory	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Althusser; discourse; Discourse Theory; Gramsci; hegemony; intersubjectivity; Laclau; Marx; Marxism; Mouffe; populism; post-structuralism; psychoanalysis	POPULISM; HEGEMONY; POWER; IDENTITY; POLICY; IDEAS	Post-Structuralist Discourse Theory analyzes political ideas and action from a Marxist direction. However, while classic Marxian sociology is rooted in economic processes that structure society and ideas, Post-Structuralist Discourse Theory emphasizes the absence of any determinative principle. Thus, it radicalizes an ongoing shift in Marxism away from economic essentialism towards indeterminacy, contingency, and openness. The ideological superstructure becomes ever more important at the expense of the economic base; class struggle and relations of production lose analytical and strategic purchase in favor of a complex and integral form of politics; there are no deeper, natural foundations determining how society is organized and structured. Post-Structuralist Discourse Theorists argue that this orientation leads to a more satisfactory analysis of political practice than is possible through positivist research. Assessing this claim requires a survey of the hermetic terminology in which Post-Structuralist Discourse Theorists express their ideasthe discourse, as it were, of Discourse Theoristsexploring their use of sociology, structuralist linguistics, psychoanalysis, and the political theory of populism.

J	Zug, CU				Zug, Charles U.			The Rhetorical Presidency Made Flesh: A Political Science Classic in the Age of Donald Trump	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						American political development; constitutional theory; demagoguery; rhetorical presidency; Jeffrey Tulis	POWER	This article revisits Jeffrey Tulis's The Rhetorical Presidency in the age of Trump, discussing the debates to which it originally responded, its core thesis and empirical evidence, as well as its impact on political science in the last three decades. The article's second half turns to a recent critique of Tulis's thesis by Ann C. Pluta, which manifests many of the misunderstandings that have persisted since The Rhetorical Presidency's original publication. Habits of thought revealed in Pluta's misunderstandings, I argue, are emblematic of the political culture that is amenable to the simplistic yet politically effective appeals characteristic of rhetorical presidents like Donald Trump. Elements of the broader political-science world that are on display in Pluta's article are symptomatic of political pathologies sustained and aggravated by the culture of the polity that political scientists inhabit and purport to studythe culture of the rhetorical presidency.

J	Kuyper, J				Kuyper, Jonathan			Democratic Deliberation in the Modern World: The Systemic Turn	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Simone Chambers; deliberative systems; institutional design; Jane Mansbridge; citizen ignorance; deliberative democracy; John Dryzek; epistemic Democracy		The normative ideals and feasibility of deliberative democracy have come under attack from several directions, as exemplified by a recent book version of a special issue of this journal. Critics have pointed out that the complexity of the modern world, voter ignorance, partisanship, apathy, and the esoteric nature of political communications make it unlikely that deliberation will be successful at creating good outcomes, and that it may in fact be counterproductive since it can polarize opinions. However, these criticisms were aimed at "micro" theories of deliberative democracy. The new "systemic" turn in deliberative democracy avoids these problems by positing a system-wide division of labor in a nation-state: experts and ordinary citizens "check" each other's opinions; partisanship and even ignorance can spur deliberation among citizens; and citizens may remain apathetic about some issues but deliberate about others. So long as the overall level of systemic deliberation increases, instead of decreases, the ideal of deliberation is still relevant in a society as complex as ours.

J	Landemore, H				Landemore, Helene			ON MINIMAL DELIBERATION, PARTISAN ACTIVISM, AND TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO DISAGREE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Mutz argues that there is an inverse correlation between deliberation and participation. However, the validity of this conclusion partly depends on how one defines deliberation and participation. Mutz's definition of deliberation as hearing the other side or cross-cutting exposure is narrower than a minimal conception of deliberation with which deliberative democrats could agree. First, a minimal conception of deliberation would have to revolve around the principle of a reasoned exchange of arguments, as opposed to mere exposure to dissenting views. Second, Mutz's almost exclusive focus on participation as partisan activism gives the impression of an essential tension between participation and deliberation. But another form of civic participation, which I call critical-deliberative involvement, is perfectly compatible with the incentives for reasoned exchange of arguments with others. We should thus encourage people to participate in politics in ways that engage their reasoning faculty, not just their party loyalty. This also requires teaching people how to disagree constructively.

Due to data limitations, Zaller relied on liberal/conservative scales as proxy measures of abstract values. However, measures of values correlate robustly with ideological scales only among the politically aware; the politically unaware do not hold genuine ideological orientations. Consequently, citizens may be better able than Zaller allows to connect values to policies without elite input.

J	Posner, RA				Posner, Richard A.			JERVIS ON COMPLEXITY THEORY	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The correct solution to complex problems, such as those involved in international relations, can generally be discovered ex post but not predicted ex ante. Economics and game theory attempt to model such complexity, but have difficulty taking into account psychological subtleties, the myriad factors that each agent considers when making a decision, and cultural differences. And understanding that one is dealing with a systemthat is, with interacting factors instead of with insulated monadsmay not make the questions any more amenable to prediction, particularly because the more unique an event, the less likely it is to be foreseen. Jervis's analysis of complex systems may therefore be more of a contribution to the historical sciences than to predictive social science.

J	Gleason, LS				Gleason, Laurel S.			REVISITING "THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE": AN EVALUATION OF THE CLAIMS AND CONSEQUENCES OF DELIBERATIVE POLLING	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							PUBLIC-OPINION; DEMOCRACY	Political scientist James Fishkin has devised "deliberative polling" as a means to better informed, more autonomous, and more reflective participant opinion. After a deliberative poll, this improved form of public opinion can be disseminated to the general public and to policy makers so as to influence public opinion (as it is normally construed) and public policy. Close examination of the results of deliberative polling, however, suggests no evidence of a normatively desirable gain in informed, autonomous, or considered opinion-as opposed to minor gains in participants' general political knowledge and in ideological constraint, which is likely attributable to the pre-packaged "expert" views set forth in the briefing materials provided to the participants.

J	Wisniewski, C				Wisniewski, Chris			IGNORANCE AND CULTURE: REJOINDER TO FENSTER AND CHANDLER	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							DEMOCRATIC COMPETENCE; FINANCIAL CRISIS; BELIEF SYSTEMS; POLITICS; FAILURE; POLICY	In the ongoing debate about the impact that studies of public ignorance should have on the study of culture, Mark Fenster and Bret Chandler assume that wider political participation must be our goal, because, to them, political ignorance is a culturally imposed, and therefore removable, obstacle-as if, without the baleful influence of culture, political participants would be well informed. Culture is indeed a primary influence on people's political opinions, so political scientists should indeed study the role it plays in the formation of political beliefs. But such studies should begin with ignorance as people's default position, and should refrain from assuming that the source of ignorance is cultural domination or manipulation.				wisniews19@gmail.com						Acharya VV, 2009, CRIT REV, V21, P195, DOI 10.1080/08913810902952903; Althaus ScottL., 2003, COLLECTIVE PREFERENC; Ang I, 1991, DESPERATELY SEEKING; Bennett SE, 2006, CRIT REV, V18, P105, DOI 10.1080/08913810608443652; Bennett SE, 2008, CRIT REV, V20, P195, DOI 10.1080/08913810802503418; Bhide A, 2009, CRIT REV, V21, P211, DOI 10.1080/08913810902974956; Bourdieu P., 2004, SCI SCI REFLEXIVITY; Chandler B, 2010, CRIT REV, V22, P85, DOI 10.1080/08913811003625497; Colander D, 2009, CRIT REV, V21, P249, DOI 10.1080/08913810902934109; Converse PE, 2006, CRIT REV, V18, P1, DOI 10.1080/08913810608443650; Delli Carpini M.

J	Friedman, J				Friedman, Jeffrey			A CRISIS OF POLITICS, NOT ECONOMICS: COMPLEXITY, IGNORANCE, AND POLICY FAILURE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Editorial Material							FINANCIAL CRISIS	The financial crisis was caused by the complex, constantly growing web of regulations designed to constrain and redirect modern capitalism. This complexity made investors, bankers, and perhaps regulators themselves ignorant of regulations promulgated across decades and in different ofieldso of regulation. These regulations interacted with each other to foster the issuance and securitization of subprime mortgages; their rating as AA or AAA; and previously their concentration on the balance sheets (and off the balance sheets) of many commercial and investment banks. As a practical matter, it was impossible to predict the disastrous outcome of these interacting regulations. This fact calls into question the feasibility of the century-old attempt to create a hybrid capitalism in which regulations are supposed to remedy economic problems as they arise.

CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Bryan Caplan's bold and challenging argument is weak on evidence and uses questionable assumptions. He does not prove that politicians go along with voters' biases, nor that these biases make voters feel good, nor that they cling to these biases tenaciously. And he assumes that the public's disagreements with professional American economists are biases in the sense of being incorrect, even though economists often disagree with each other, and economists in other countries may disagree even with the consensus views of American economists.

J	Quirk, PJ				Quirk, Paul J.			PUTTING EXPERTS IN THEIR PLACE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							IDEOLOGY	Bryan Caplan's The Myth of the Rational Voter turns, in two contrasting ways, on the role of experts. On the one hand, Caplan uses the opinions of economists as a benchmark for identifying error in public opinion, finding such error systematic and pervasive. On the other hand, in considering remedies, he largely discounts the ability of policymakers to use expert advice and their own expertise to resist misguided public pressure. Although Caplan's use of expert opinion as a benchmark, in principle, is acceptable, he overstates what we can conclude from that exercise with his data. There are, however, alternative grounds for a more tentative, yet broadly similar, assessment of the prevalence of error in mass opinion.

J	Meskill, D				Meskill, David			Self-interest properly felt: Democracy's unintended consequences and Tocqueville's solution	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The need to cooperate in countless ways in a democracy raises the fundamental question posed by the prisoner's dilemma: How can self-interested individuals cooperate? Tocqueville recognized this problem and anticipated the most convincing solution to date: Robert Frank's conception of emotions as "commitment devices." Tocqueville's analysis of the miscalculations of modern "individualism," which lead people first into isolation and then into servitude, mirrors the failure of conscious rationality in the prisoner's dilemma. Conversely, Tocqueville emphasizes emotional "habits of the heart" as the key to resisting the blandishments of individualism.

J	Milkis, SM				Milkis, Sidney M.			The rhetorical and administrative presidencies	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The modern presidency emerged not from an effort to escape constitutional propriety, as Tulis argues, but, rather, to emancipate presidents from the localized political parties of the nineteenth century, which had come to be viewed as sites of provincial and corrupt forms of popular rule. As the troubled tenure of George W Bush suggests, contemporary presidents are torn between the public expectation that they stand apart from party politics and act as the chief executive of the administrative state; and their role as party leaders, which links them to political allies in Congress and loyalists in the electorate. In its contribution to the development of a "new" national programmatic party system, the Bush administration reveals the potential for a novel, disturbing meld of party and administration, in which presidents seek to exploit the powers of the modern executive office for partisan gain.

J	Somin, I				Somin, Ilya			Knowledge about ignorance: New directions in the study of political information	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								For decades, scholars have recognized that most citizens have little or no political knowledge, and that it is in fact rational for the average voter to make little or no effort to acquire political information. Rational ignorance is fully compatible with the so-called "paradox of voting" because it will often be rational for citizens to vote, but irrational for them to become well informed. Furthermore, rational ignorance leads not only to inadequate acquisition of political information, but also to ineffective use of the information that citizens do possess. The combination of these two problems has fundamental implications for a variety of issues in public policy and international affairs.

J	Gordon, D				Gordon, D			Calculation and chaos: Reply to Caplan	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Ludwig von Mises argued that (1) economic calculation under socialism is impossible, and that (2) the lack of calculation would entail chaos and starvation. In these pages, Bryan Caplan has accepted the first claim but rejected the second, and has argued further that in real-world attempts to implement socialism, it was the lack of incentives, not the absence of economic calculation, that was responsible for economic chaos. I suggest, against Caplan's interpretation, that by "chaos" Mises meant the lack of calculation, rather than some further state of affairs entailed by this lack. So interpreted, Mises argument escapes the brunt of Caplan's criticisms.

J	Weber, E				Weber, E			The myth of the nation and the creation of the "other"	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								The nation is a mythic construct whose primary component is a shared language (often one that has been manufactured for the purpose). In the context of popular sovereignty, shared language, like other shared traits, brings with it a seemingly irresistible capacity to demonize those who do not share it. This capacity is faithfully enlisted by politicians looking for means of mass mobilization. The democratic nation-state therefore displays xenophobic tendencies; yet the urge to combat these tendencies fixes, as permanent and normative "identities," the very myths-artificial and eminently mutable-that start the process Of xenophobia in the first place.

J	Samuels, WJ				Samuels, WJ			Murray Rothbard's Austrian perspective on the history of economic thought	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Murray Rothbard's Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought demonstrates his mastery of the literature. But his interpretation of the development of economics reflects, and is therefore severely limited by, his Austrian-libertarian perspective. Indeed, Rothbard appropriates the history of economic thought principally to advance his perspective, as seen in his neglect of social control, his identification of his desired economic system with the natural order of things, and especially in his denigratory treatment of Adam Smith-at bottom for not being an Austrian economist and a true libertarian. A partly informed, partly myopic and sometimes useful interpretation, this is the work of an idealogue.

J	Palmer, TG				Palmer, TG			G. A. Cohen on self-ownership, property, and equality	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								G.A. Cohen has produced an influential criticism of libertarianism that posits joint ownership of everything in the would other than labor, with each joint owner having a veto right over any potential use of the world. According to Cohen, in that world rationality would require that wealth be divined equally with no differential accorded to talent, ability, or effort. A closer examination shows that Cohen's argument rests on two central errors of reasoning and does not support his egalitarian conclusions, even granting his assumption of joint ownership. That assumption was rejected by Locke, Pufendorf and other writers on property for reasons that Cohen does not rebut.

J	Inglehart, R				Inglehart, R			The diminishing utility of economic growth: From maximizing security toward maximizing subjective well-being	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Twenty Years ago, Tibor Scitovsky questioned the assumption, embedded in neoclassical economics, that human happiness will be augmented if the level of consumption either rises or becomes more uniform over rime. Evidence from the 1990-1993 World Values Survey suggests that his doubts weve well-founded: although economic gains apparently make a major contribution to subjective well-being as one moves from societies at the subsistence level to those with moderate levels of economic development, further economic growth seems to have little or no impact on subjective wellbeing. This transition seems to reflect a basic cultural change that results in the diminishing marginal utility of economic growth.

J	Neaman, E				Neaman, E			Mutiny on board modernity: Heidegger, Sorel and other Fascist intellectuals	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Zeev Sternhell and Hans Sluga show that fascism and Nazism were part of an early twentieth-century intellectual rebellion against universalism, liberalism, and Enlightenment rationalism. Western technology, values, and political institutions were seen as outmoded, but instead of wanting to return to the traditions of the past, as conservatives wished, these intellectuals thought that fascism could transcend modernity. Sorel, Heidegger, and other fascist modernists offered different radical solutions to what was conceived of as the decadence of liberal Western civilization. It remains an open question whether the discontent with modernity is an intellectual construction or a result of actual defects in modern life itself.

J	HELFGOTT, RB				HELFGOTT, RB			LABOR PROCESS THEORY VS REFORM IN THE WORKPLACE	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article								Critics of the organization of industrial work under capitalism have ranged from the ''human relations'' school to socio-technical systems theorists and, most vociferously, to advocates of labor process theory (LPT). Their practical influence on management was small as long as production was rolling on and profits rolling in. When competition intensified, however, employers started to question old ideas and, abetted by the needs of new computerized technology, began to broaden jobs, allow workers greater discretion in their performance and involve them in shop floor decision making. LPT, however, has not contributed to this evolution toward more satisfying work. This paper explains why this is so by exploring two major shortcomings of LPT. First and foremost is that LPT has ignored the efficiency of the work process, refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of a tradeoff between work ''goodness'' and productivity. As a result, LPT has been unable to propose economically viable alternatives to existing job design and work organization. Second, LPT has identified management's goal in organizing work as gaining control of the process, when, in fact, it has been to make the process as economically efficient as possible. Thus, LPT could not see that, under changed circumstances, management might decentralize control toward the shop floor, if that might promote efficiency. LPT's founder, Harry Braverman, and his disciples believed that is was impossible to reform work under capitalism, but experience shows otherwise.

J	DECANIO, SJ				DECANIO, SJ			CARBON RIGHTS AND ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT	CRITICAL REVIEW			English	Article							COASE THEOREM; LOCK-IN; CLIMATE; POLICY	Even in the absence of complete scientific consensus on the magnitude, timing, and regional distribution of the effects of global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions, it is worthwhile to examine potential policy responses to the prospect of climate change. An internalization of the greenhouse externality based on property rights in carbon emissions offers the potential to promote rather than retard worldwide economic development. As the world economy moves in a market-oriented direction, the arbitrary wealth transfers associated with a carbon-rights distribution plan would dissipate within the time span required for planetary climate management. Thus, the present world situation may provide a new opportunity to reconcile the imperatives of global environmental protection and the promotion of sustained economic growth.
