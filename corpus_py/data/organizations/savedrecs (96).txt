The livelihood of the flock holders can be enhanced by the technical and institutional interventions. In this study, effect of bio-economic traits including age (Ag), live body weight (Bw), milk production (Mp), order of lactation (Or), prolificacy (Pf), favorable mark (Fm) and breed (Br) on market value of live goat was investigated. Study revealed that magnitude of difference in various traits of breeds ranged from 200 to 800%. It was observed that extent of variation in bio-economic traits of descript breeds was comparatively lower in case of both categories of dairy and meat goat. Non-descript breeds of the goat animals including dairy and meat goat fetched higher price over the descript breeds. Multiple regression analysis was applied to identify the potential economic traits of the breed. Mp and Bw had a direct and significant influence on the market value of the dairy goat. Similarly, Bw influenced the market value of meat goat positively while Ag was found to have adverse influence. Economic traits namely Mp, Fm and Bw of the live goat animals were observed as significant characteristics affecting the market value directly. These characteristics may be important for obtaining price premium. Institutional and technical interventions to enhance the milk productivity and gain in body weight of the live goat animals may be a strategic approach to benefit this sector.	[Yogi, R. K.; Verma, N.

Experience: Information Dimensions Affecting Employees' Perceptions Towards Being Well Informed	ACM JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION QUALITY			English	Article						Information quality dimensions; information quality perceived; Total Quality Management (TQM)		Information is a strategic company resource, but there is no consensus in the literature regarding the set of dimensions to be considered when measuring the quality of the information. Most measures of information quality depend on user perception. Using multiple correlation analysis, we obtain a model that allows us to explain how information quality dimensions influence information consumers' overall feeling of being well informed. A set of dimensions that any measure of information quality should at least include is proposed. This exploratory study reports the results of a research survey among managers of companies committed to quality management within the framework of a Total Quality Management (TQM) model, which is an information-intensive management model.

J	Barbos, A				Barbos, Andrei			INFORMATION ACQUISITION AND INNOVATION UNDER COMPETITIVE PRESSURE	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							STRATEGIC EXPERIMENTATION; MARKET; MODEL; GROWTH; GAMES; INVESTMENT; INCENTIVES; BUBBLES; PRODUCT	This paper studies information acquisition under competitive pressure and proposes a model to examine the relationship between product market competition and the level of innovative activity in an industry. Our paper offers theoretical support for recent empirical results that point to an inverted-U shape relationship between competition and innovation. The model presents an optimal timing decision problem where a firm endowed with an idea trades the benefits of waiting for additional information on whether this idea can be converted into a successful project against the cost of delaying innovation: a given firm's profit following innovation is decreasing in the number of firms that invested at earlier dates. By recognizing that a firm can intensify its innovative activity on two dimensions, a risk dimension and a quantitative dimension, we show that firms solve this trade-off precisely so as to generate the inverted-U shape relationship. The dynamic setup of our model offers insights not just in the cross-section on the relationship between competition and innovation, but also intertemporally on the optimal timing of innovation at firm level.

It is included in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). To assure long-term conservation of the species, the number of individuals needs to be increased creating a consistent and viable population. Accordingly, relocation for reintroduction programs is being planned. However, this could lead to the introduction of infectious diseases. Thus, knowledge on the health status of the Apennine chamois is important for the management of this species. In the absence of existing data, retrospective investigation is useful. A serological retrospective survey on 119 Apennine chamois, captured for routine marking or reintroduction operations from 1990 to 2008 at the National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio, and Molise (PNALM), was performed to detect antibodies against pestiviruses, bovine parainfluenza 3 virus (PI-3), bluetongue virus (BTV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), Brucella spp., Chlamydophila spp., Coxiella burnetti, and Leptospira spp. Serums were negative for PI-3, BTV, BHV-1, Brucella spp., Chlamydophila spp., C. burnetti, and Leptospira spp., while three animals in 1992 and five in 2008 were positive for pestivirus antibodies. Although the number of samples per year was often limited, inference to evaluate the infectious status of the overall population in the PNALM was attempted. Better planning of sampling activities and a specific surveillance program for infectious diseases are needed, especially in a small and limited population like the Apennine chamois, in which reintroduction programs are considered strategic for conservation and risk factors, like sharing of grazing with wild and domestic animals, exist.

J	Subedi, DB				Subedi, D. B.			Security Dimension of Post-conflict Recovery: Nepal's Experience in Disarmament and Demobilisation of People's Liberation Army Fighters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Disarmament; Demobilisation; Ex-combatants; Maoist; Post-conflict recovery; Peacebuilding; Nepal	FORMER COMBATANTS; CIVIL-WAR; REINTEGRATION	Disarmament and demobilisation of ex-combatants often involve politicised sequence of activities, and, in turn, they can affect national and local politics and the peace process in question in one way or other. Understanding the interface between transitional politics, and disarmament and demobilisation of ex-combatants is, therefore, vital to explore scope and limitation of how ex-combatants are managed as part of post-conflict recovery in a post-conflict society. Building on this proposition, this paper investigates the impacts of transitional politics to disarmament and demobilisation (D&D) of the Maoist ex-combatants as part of management of the Maoist arms and armies in Nepal. Analysing how a consensus-based political culture between major political parties, including the Maoists, which was a driving force behind the peace negotiation, deteriorated over time, and further exploring strategic needs and interests of key political actors towards D&D, this paper shows that disarmament of the Maoists People's Liberation Army followed a "blanket disarmament" approach which had limitations to fully disarm the force. Similarly, demobilisation process appeared to be encampment of the force rather than complete demobilisation. This paper warns that faulty disarmament and demobilisation in Nepal can have serious security implications in future.

The capability framework defines a logical sequence of skill building based on the experiences of sustainability leaders that can speed learning for companies with less mature programs. Business improvement projects are designed to incrementally expand the span of concern from company objectives, to value chain viability, and ultimately to societal needs, while broadening the base of information and engaging a wider set of stakeholder views. The UNEP/SETAC sponsored pilot tests of the LCM CMM in Cameroon, Uganda, South Africa, India, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The results from the pilot conducted by Secretaria Distrital de Ambiente (SDA) and a network of 22 companies in Bogota, Colombia, are presented to illustrate how the capability approach can be applied and highlight lessons learned to promote further dissemination of life cycle practices. The companies were able to apply the concepts to develop accurate, representative assessments of organizational maturity and to identify reasonable improvement projects that delivered some financial value in the short term, addressed a management system gap identified in the maturity assessment, and could be completed within the schedule deadline of the contract (6 to 9 months). The projects included an LCA of cleaning products, collaboration among three companies to find a better solution for managing a waste stream of coffee "silver skins," a streamlined assessment of acrylic products, an LCA of disposable polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) cups, and a qualitative screening of operations of a transit company. The paper discusses how the results of the studies were used to identify specific improvement projects tailored to the specific needs and priorities of each company. The pilot projects showed that the capability maturity approach had intuitive appeal and the companies were able to apply the concepts to their organizations with limited technical support and identify an appropriate improvement project with LC relevance. This suggests there should be less emphasis on LCA as a tool to identify projects and more as a method to gain insights for effective implementation of business-relevant projects. One key question is how to sustain the energy and ongoing improvements fostered by this pilot program.

Spatial-temporal variations in carbon dioxide levels in Ibadan, Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH			English	Article						Ibadan; Nigeria; urban environment; carbon dioxide; human activities	CLIMATE; CORE	Growing evidence suggests how global background levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are increasing and this impacts environmental quality and human and ecological health. Data from less developed countries are sparse. We determined spatial and temporal variations in concentrations of CO2 in selected locations in Ibadan, Nigeria with identifiable prominent outdoor sources. Activity driven areas in north and south-west areas were identified and marked with a global positioning system. Waste management practices and activities generating CO2 were documented and described using a technician observation checklist. CO2 levels were measured using a portable TELAIRE 7001 attached to HOBO U12 data loggers across seasons. Mean CO2 levels were compared over seasons, i.e. rainy season months and the dry season months. While CO2 levels recorded outdoors in study areas were comparable to available international data, routine monitoring is recommended to further characterize concurrent pollutants in fossil fuel combustion emissions with known deleterious health effects.

Intellectual Capital as the Essence of Sustainable Corporate Performance	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Human capital; intellectual capital; performance; relational capital; spiritual capital	WORKPLACE SPIRITUALITY	The term 'intellectual capital' (IC) may sound unfamiliar to the wider public. However, IC has started to cast greater attention in the corporate world. IC refers to intangible asset which is closely related with the development of strategic decision and corporate performance. With endless challenging business environment and complicated electronic transactions, IC is argued to act as a vital essence for a business to innovate which then drives business sustainability. The ultimate purpose of this study was to investigate whether IC is acknowledged and managed towards improving performance, be it financial or non-financial performance. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was distributed to the head of internal audit of Malaysian public listed companies. Questions tapping on core IC components including human capital, structural capital, relational capital and spiritual capital were included. Data were analysed using inference analysis methods, including ANOVA, t-test and regression. Findings revealed that IC does exist, but not much of IC management is sought in the companies, although the practice is in place. The results also demonstrate that relational capital emerged as the most influential IC component on corporate performance, while human capital ranked the last. This is an obvious indication that IC is well in fact has developed within Malaysian companies and become an important source for business performance.	[Abdullah, D. F.; Sofian, S.; Bajuri, N.

J	Buess, M				Buess, Michael			Accountable and Under Control? Explaining Governments' Selection of Management Board Representatives	JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES			English	Article							EUROPEAN-COMMISSION; REGULATORY AGENCIES; INDEPENDENCE; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGES; AUTONOMY; MODES	The role of national representatives on the management boards (MBs) of European Union agencies (EUAs) is crucial in two respects. From a democratic point of view, national MB representatives' accountability may constitute a possible additional source of legitimacy for these technocratic bodies. From the perspective of European integration, their relationship with national institutions tells us about the status of EUAs and the extent to which their MBs constitute an intergovernmental control tool in the hands of the Member States. Contrary to their formal design, the collected data suggest that MBs have a rather supranational, technocratic character. With regard to their contribution to EUAs' democratic accountability, although the general level of accountability is high, the findings are more diverse. However, rather than reflecting control intentions by the Member States, different levels of accountability can best be explained by functional and institutional rather than strategic factors.

J	Johnson, M; Paulusma, D; van Leeuwen, EJ				Johnson, Matthew; Paulusma, Daniel; van Leeuwen, Erik Jan			Algorithms for diversity and clustering in social networks through dot product graphs	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Social network; d-Dot product graph; Independent set; Clique	EMBEDDINGS; MODELS	In this paper, we investigate a graph-theoretical model of social networks. The dot product model assumes that two individuals are connected in the social network if their attributes or opinions are similar. In the model, a d-dimensional vector a(v) represents the extent to which individual v has each of a set of d attributes or opinions. Then two individuals u and v are assumed to be friends, that is, they are connected in the graph model, if and only if a(u) . a(v) >= t, for some fixed, positive threshold t. The resulting graph is called a d-dot product graph. We consider diversity and clustering in social networks by using a d-dot product graph model for the network. Diversity is considered through the size of the largest independent set of the graph, and clustering through the size of the largest clique. We present both positive and negative results on the potential of this model. We obtain a tight result for the diversity problem, namely that it is polynomial-time solvable for d = 2, but NP-hard for d >= 3. We show that the clustering problem is polynomial-time solvable for d = 2. To our knowledge, these results are also the first on the computational complexity of combinatorial optimization problems on dot product graphs. We also give new insights into the structure of dot product graphs. We also consider the situation when two individuals u and v are connected if and only if their preferences are not antithetical, that is, if and only if a(u) . a(v) >= 0, and the situation when two individuals u and v are connected if and only if their preferences are neither antithetical nor "orthogonal", that is, if and only if a(u) . a(v) >= 0. For these two cases we prove that the diversity problem is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed d and that the clustering problem is polynomial-time solvable for d <= 3. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Resnick, EN				Resnick, Evan N.			I Will Follow: Smart Power and the Management of Wartime Alliances	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article						War; Hard Power; Alliances; Soft Power; Smart Power		This paper employs the concept of smart power to construct an analytical framework for assessing wartime alliance management. It makes two arguments. First, wartime sources of soft power differ from those obtaining during peacetime. Second, the coerciveness with which an alliance leader wields hard power towards actual or prospective allies should vary inversely with the amount of soft power it possesses. The smart power framework illuminates three types of alliance management failure. The paper's key contentions are illustrated with examples furnished from the record of US alliance leadership since World War II.

J	Ali, MK; Akhtar, K; Jahanzaib, M				Ali, Muhammad Khurram; Akhtar, Khalid; Jahanzaib, Mirza			A Hybrid Multidimensional Approach to Select a Country for Global Cement Plant Location	MEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Decision Analysis; Multi Criteria Decision Making; Global Facility Location; Global Cement Plant Location Problem; Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process		The globalization and saturated domestic markets force international firms to gradually expand their businesses across the borders to capture potential emerging markets. The decision to select a country for a new cement plant location demands analysis of a large number of factors. It is a multifaceted problem which requires investigation and prioritization of factors in a hierarchical way.This paper uses an FAHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) based procedure proposing a practical framework for solution of the GCPLP (Global Cement Plant Location Problem). It deals with real world ambiguities and handles a broader spectrum of influencing factors. The criteria for selection of a country for a new cement plant installation are prioritized from the FAHP based evaluation made by experts. Different global databases including the World Bank are used for the fuzzy ratings of the alternatives. It has been learnt in this particular problem that cement specific and cost related factors are the most sensitive while legal regulations and economic conditions are relatively less sensitive for the decision makers. Therefore, the countries having strong lime stone reserves, cheaper fuel costs and good internal marketing positions are higher in ranking.

J	Bhandari, RB; Owen, C; Trist, C				Bhandari, Roshan Bhakta; Owen, Christine; Trist, Cain			Incident Management Approaches above the Incident Management Team Level in Australia	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						incident management team; information systems; stakeholder relationships; state operations centre; strategic emergency management	EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT; KATRINA	This paper discusses incident management strategies widely used above the incident management team (IMT) level in the four Australian States namely, Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and Queensland. It begins with an overview of how incident management approaches above the IMT might differ from the local IMT level. By exploring this difference, this paper provides an insight into how emergency management personnel working above or beyond the local IMT level often deal with large scale multiple emergency events and require an understanding of broader problems that they might confront in the future. Then, it provides an outline of how strategic emergency management objectives are addressed in the state level arrangements in aforementioned jurisdictions. Specifically, this includes response orientations, state level emergency management facilities, long term thinking, the management of stakeholder relationships, leadership, and organisational adaptation and capacity building. Later, some of the challenges associated with incident management above the IMT level are discussed. Finally, the paper concludes by discussing the implications of this study to the emergency management sector.

INTERACTIVITY OF WEBGIS FOR THE SIMULATION OF LAND DEVELOPMENT	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						GIS; WEBGIS; simulations; land use planning		In the definition of scenarios as key components underlying the decisions on city's and territory's transformation processes stands the comprehension of the interactions between multiple aspects that influence that dynamics. The spatial data knowledge and the development of new ICT solutions which can guide the planner towards strategic, reliable and shared decisions are essential. It is proposed a methodology in which to specialize the special approach established in previous projects developed by extending and implementing GIS technology Geographic Information System towards online interoperability. The control of the effects of changes in land use in environmental quality, particularly in the water resources management, can thus become operational in the network through the application of innovative tools able to meet the new challenges of urban regeneration.

A similarly destructive M(w)9.0 earthquake hit east-coast Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, on March 11, 2011. The governments of both countries took rapid, effective emergency response measures, gaining invaluable experience and learning precious lessons. To compare detailed emergency responses during these earthquakes and share lessons, this paper uses timeline analysis focusing on the levels of the two earthquakes, summarizing key emergency response measures focusing on emergency command center setup and operation, rescue force deployment and dispatch, emergency victim housing and resettlement, and public information reporting and release based on a time sequence. It also comparatively analyzes and sorts their implementation and timing and studies the similarities and differences of the two earthquakes. This paper also analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of emergency response measures taken by both nations, considering the background of emergency management systems to share experiences and provide references on future disaster emergency response work to improve abilities and progress in earthquake response.

In China, local governments are obligated to protect residents against earthquakes that have a magnitude of M(s)6.0. The ways in which local governments perform these obligations differ, however, due to obstacles such as inadequate disaster planning, a lack of public earthquake awareness, and a shortage of qualified emergency managers. When an earthquake hits, the hazards that residents are unaware of may arise concurrently, putting thousands lives and millions of acres of property in danger. In short, the response capacity of local governments is crucial to an earthquake's aftermath. To enhance the capacity of local government response to earthquake emergencies, the National Earthquake Response Support Service (NERSS) of China started work on training programs years ago. With the cooperation with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Japanese scientists in the last five years, based on lessons learned from China's historical earthquakes and disasters, the authors have created the prototype for an earthquake disaster management curriculum, which it has then been demonstrated and continuously improved. This paper reviews the prototype curriculum and its development methodology, presents demonstrative deliveries of the curriculum, and discusses training effectiveness and further improvements. Applying an international emergency management framework and related experience, focusing on local government capacity building, the demonstrative trainings have been proved to be beneficial to local government response activities and the latest amendment to earthquake preplanning in China. Future systematic tracking research of training effectiveness is proposed to keep curriculum updating and appropriate as times change.

In this paper, we explain flash crashes as the result of actions made by rational agents. We argue that the advancement of information technology (IT), which has long been associated with competitive advantages, may cause ambiguities with respect to the game form that give rise to a hypergame. We employ hypergame theory to demonstrate that a market crash constitutes an equilibrium state if players misperceive the true game. Once the ambiguity is resolved, prices readjust to the appropriate level, creating the characteristic flash-crash effect. By analyzing the interaction with herd behavior, we find that flash crashes may be an unavoidable systemic problem of modern financial markets.

J	Broccardo, L				Broccardo, Laura			The Balance Scorecard Implementation in the Italian Health Care System: Some Evidences from Literature and a Case Study Analysis	JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BSC; performance; hospital; management; health	MANAGEMENT	In the last few years, in the healthcare organizations, it has become crucial not only to manage the costs, but also to understand the relationship between quality and cost. Indeed, a variety of stakeholder groups are putting increasing pressure on providers for measured performance; they are demanding data on quality and patient satisfaction, although simultaneously pressing for lower costs (Griffith and King 2000). It is clear how the balanced scorecard is (BSC) important to manage, strategically, the quality and the costs in the health care system, but it is also important to underline that this tool has to be adapted to these kinds of organizations among its classical use. Consequently, the main goals of this article are: (a) to make a complete literature review of the papers with case studies published on the topic of BSC in Italian health care system during the period 1992-2012, using international databases to understand the use of this strategic management tool; and (b) to conduct an empirical analysis based on an Italian hospital case study, with particular attention to the BSC adoption, to understand the connected issues of the use of this tool. By this analysis, it emerges that there is a gap in the literature of empirical case studies, so the case study analyzed contributes to fill this gap. Further research can include the comparison of the Italian situation with other foreign countries.

Negotiating subcontract conditions in the Australian construction industry	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						contract negotiation; subcontract conditions; integrative negotiation; project performance and value		Strategic negotiation of subcontracts appears to contain many benefits regarding cost savings, quality improvement, better project time management, and project value enhancement. The primary purpose of the study presented in this paper is to investigate the current and prospective concepts of negotiable subcontract conditions in the Australian construction industry that can alleviate elongated negotiations and attain a win/win result for both contractor and subcontractor. The study first discussed legislative regulations and opinions concerning subcontract negotiation through extensive review on academic literature and Australian Standards including AS 4903 General conditions of subcontract for design and construct and AS 4300 General conditions of contract for design and construct. The study was further developed in the form of a survey, collecting data from 71 respondents (i.e., contractors and subcontractors) from the Queensland, New South Wales and Northern Territory construction industries in Australia. Cronbach's alpha assessed the reliability of survey responses. The research then statistically analyzed not only critical negotiation factors contributing to project performance based on Fisher's exact test but also significant differences between contractors' and subcontractors' viewpoints to subcontract negotiation by ANOVA testing. The survey results revealed that contractors and subcontractors attain different opinions regarding the fairness of subcontract conditions; however, both parties believed that there were genuine opportunities to improve project performance and value via the negotiation of subcontract conditions using an integrative approach.

J	Dockner, EJ; Loffler, C				Dockner, Engelbert J.; Loeffler, Clemens			RIVALRY RESTRAINT AS EQUILIBRIUM BEHAVIOR	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							DYNAMIC DUOPOLISTIC COMPETITION; MANAGERIAL INCENTIVES; STRATEGIC DELEGATION; STICKY PRICES; OLIGOPOLY; FIRM; CAPABILITIES; ADVANTAGE; INTENSITY; CREATION	Rivalry restraint has received a lot of attention as a theory of profits in recent research on business strategy. Its economic rationale is explained as the consequences of either exogenous or endogenous anticompetitive forces present in different industries. In this paper, we use a dynamic oligopolistic industry model and show that rivalry restraint emerges as equilibrium behavior among firm owners who delegate decisions to managers. In the corresponding two-stage game, managers choose optimal production rates in a dynamic Cournot market and owners set incentives for managers, acting sequentially rational. Equilibrium incentives correspond to rivalry restraint, that is, managers are less aggressive in the product market with lower outputs and increasing profits for all firms in the industry.

The decision-making process in business has received extensive academic attention in recent decades. One of the first-order strategic decisions for an entrepreneur is where to locate the new business. The emergence of the multi-criteria decision analysis paradigm allowed several criteria to be considered when making a decision, which surpassed the previous single criterion decision paradigm. The Electre methodology pioneered this new paradigm and, among the evolutions of the Electre method, version IV is perhaps the least used. This paper aims to show a methodology to aid decision making for entrepreneurs, in particular the location decision. Thus, this study shows an example, an empirical application of Electre IV for locating a business, with the ultimate goal of providing companies with a ranking of alternatives to consider, such that it provides a competitive advantage if the choice agrees with the first positions of the final ranking.

J	Majlessi, M; Vaezi, A; Rabori, MM				Majlessi, Monireh; Vaezi, Aida; Rabori, Mohsen Mehdipour			Strategic management of solid waste in Tehran: a case study in District no. 1	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Solid waste management; SWOT; Strategic management		Background: Successful waste management programs are linked to internal factors, SW (strength and weakness points), and external factors, OT (opportunities and threats), and at the macro level are grounds for sustainable development. Studies may be related to David's study which presented a method to quantify strength, weakness, opportunity, threats (SWOT) analysis. Methods: In this study, designed to investigate recycling and managing dry residues in District 1, threat factors were studied and internal factors evaluation (IFE) and external factors evaluation (EFE) matrixes were scored. Tehran Municipality District 1 has 10 subdistricts and 26 neighborhoods. The dry residues from Municipality District 1 that currently weigh approximately 2678 tons per day. Results: Results showed that WO strategies for improving weaknesses and employing opportunities available in District 1 are ideal. After constructing the Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM), WO strategies were prioritized. Conclusion: The evaluation matrix of internal and external factors in the city of Tehran indicated that waste management has weak internal factors. Meanwhile, evaluation points of external factors showed that, in the current situation, SWOT could achieve good results. Waste management systems are involved with different multi-disciplinary factors; therefore, trends in the development of waste treatment technologies have been led by various social, economic, and environmental drivers in Tehran.

J	Murray, M; Ziegler, F				Murray, Michael; Ziegler, Friederike			The narrative psychology of community health workers	JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						community health promotion; community health psychology; critical health psychology; narratives; qualitative methods	IDENTITY; STORIES; VALUES; BIG	Community health psychology is an approach which promotes community mobilisation as a means of enhancing community capacity and well-being and challenging health inequalities. Much of the research on this approach has been at the more strategic and policy level with less reference to the everyday experiences of community workers who are actively involved in promoting various forms of community change. This article considers the narrative accounts of a sample of 12 community workers who were interviewed about their lives. Their accounts were analysed in terms of narrative content. This revealed the tensions in their everyday practice as they attempted to overcome community divisions and management demands for evidence. Common to all accounts was a commitment to social justice. These findings are discussed with reference to opportunities and challenges in the practice of community work.

Water hyacinth hotspots in the Ugandan waters of Lake Victoria in 1994-2012: implications for management	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE			English	Article						biomass; infestation; inshore; nutrients; proliferation	BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; INDICATORS; WASTEWATER; PHOSPHORUS; INVASIONS; NITROGEN; IMPACTS	Water hyacinth invaded Lake Victoria in the 1980s and, by 1998, had attained peak coverage of approximately 2 000 ha in the Ugandan waters of the lake. Control interventions, especially via biological means, significantly reduced the weed's coverage to non-nuisance levels (<10 ha) by 1999. Although resurgence was noticed in 2001, total coverage never reached the infestation levels attained between 1994 and 1998. By March 2012, infestations still occurred in hotspot bays, including MacDonald (52.1 ha, SE 3.0), Fielding (38.0 ha, SE 1.4), Bunjako (33.7 ha, SE 1.9), Murchison (17.1 ha, SE 0.9), Lwera (8.5 ha, SE 0.3), Napoleon Gulf (2.9 ha, SE 0.3) and Berkeley (2.1 ha, SE 0.1), in addition to some bays of the Ssesse Islands (47.8 ha, SE 0.5) and on the Kagera River. These hotspots were characterised by shelter from offshore winds and ample macronutrients (NO3-N > 13.8 mu g l(-1), SE 1.6; SRP > 17.2 mu g l(-1), SE 3.2) in the water column. Control efforts, mainly the use of biological control agents on a large scale, manual and mechanical removal at strategic sites, plus a reduction in nutrient loading, should therefore target the identified hotspot bays of the lake.

J	Aniello, L; Querzoni, L; Baldoni, R				Aniello, Leonardo; Querzoni, Leonardo; Baldoni, Roberto			High frequency batch-oriented computations over large sliding time windows	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Event processing; Batch processing; Time window based computations; Data analytics; Big data		Today's business workflows are very likely to include batch computations that periodically analyze subsets of data within specific time ranges to provide strategic information for stakeholders and other interested parties. The frequency of these batch computations provides an effective measure of data analytics freshness available to decision makers. Nevertheless, the typical amounts of data to elaborate in a batch are so large that a computation can take very long. Considering that usually a new batch starts when the previous one has completed, the frequency of such batches can thus be very low. In this paper we propose a model for batch processing based on overlapping sliding time windows that allows to increase the frequency of batches. The model is well suited to scenarios (e.g., financial, security etc.) characterized by large data volumes, observation windows in the order of hours (or days) and frequent updates (order of seconds). The model introduces multiple metrics whose aim is reducing the latency between the end of a computation time window and the availability of results, increasing thus the frequency of the batches. These metrics specifically take into account the organization of input data to minimize its impact on such latency. The model is then instantiated on the well-known Hadoop platform, a batch processing engine based on the MapReduce paradigm, and a set of strategies for efficiently arranging input data is described and evaluated.

J	Clarke, DL				Clarke, D. L.			Trauma quality improvement: The Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service experience with the development of a comprehensive structure to facilitate quality improvement in rural trauma and acute care in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; OF-CARE; ERROR; IMPLEMENTATION; DISTRICT; OUTCOMES; PROGRAM; AUDIT	Improving the delivery of efficient and effective surgical care in rural South Africa is a mammoth task bedevilled by conflict between the stakeholders, who include rural doctors, surgeons, ancillary staff, researchers, educators and administrators. Management training is not part of most medical school curricula, yet as they progress in their careers, many clinicians are required to manage a healthcare system and find the shift from caring for individual patients to managing a complex system difficult. Conflict arises when management-type interventions are imposed in a top-down manner on surgical staff suspicious of an unfamiliar field of study. Another area of conflict concerns the place of surgical research. Researchers are often accused of not being sufficiently focused on or concerned about the tasks of service delivery This article provides an overview of management theory and describes a comprehensive management structure that integrates a model for healthcare systems with a strategic planning process, strategic planning tools and appropriate quality metrics, and shows how the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, successfully used this structure to facilitate and contextualise a diverse number of quality improvement programmes and research initiatives in the realm of rural acute surgery and trauma. We have found this structure to be useful, and hope that it may be applied to other acute healthcare systems.	[Clarke, D.

J	Ognjenovic, K				Ognjenovic, Kosovka			On-the-Job Training and Human Resource Management: How to Improve Competitive Advantage of an Organization?	ORGANIZACIJA			English	Article						training; human resource management; competitiveness; organization; employees		Background: In this paper, the effects of four groups of factors on organizational performance are examined. Those are human resource management (HRM) policies and practices, financial and business indicators, location, and firm characteristics. A review of selected literature confirmed that a similar set of factors, through its positive effects on boosting organizational performance, may significantly improve competitive advantage of firms. Methods: An empirical analysis using firm-level data is conducted on the sample of enterprises operating in Serbia. A microeconometric approach is employed in order to specify and estimate empirical models. Two statistical models are applied. The ordered probit model is used for investigating organizational performance and the standard binary probit model for examining the decision of a firm to integrate the human resource development (HRD) department into its organizational structure. The goodness of fit measures confirmed the statistical reliability of estimated models. Results: Estimation results revealed that optimization of the number of employees, sales and revenues, firm age, increased market demand and competitive environment, as well as the 'right decisions' of the top management have significantly positive effects on boosting organizational performance. Significance of on-the-job training for boosting organizational performance was not empirically supported. In the same group of factors are firm size, industry and region. An auxiliary model shown that large-and medium-sized firms, firms with high level of revenues, privately owned, foreign and those located in or near to the capital city are more likely to have HRD departments. Conclusions: This paper provides a survey of the theoretical literature and explains empirical findings that are relevant for understanding to what extent on-the-job training, managing human resource, as well as some other internal and external organizational and financial factors are important for enhancing competitive advantage of firms.

In response to the growing demand for affordable housing, the Chinese Government has developed a specific housing policy to enable families to purchase properties from the private sector. The pricing mechanism of such housing is completely based on the family affordability and the profit margin of developers. To ensure the provision of housing for low and middle-income families, the future trend of affordable housing prices has become a concern for developers, consumers and may adversely influence the implementation of the current national housing policy. In this paper a systematic analysis of affordable housing development and its pricing structure is undertaken for the city of Shenzhen. As information pertaining to the factors influencing house prices is imperfect, a Grey model, which requires a limited amount of data to reflect unknown behavior, is constructed to provide a forecast for affordable house pricing. The analysis indicates that the government should adjust their current affordable housing policy to accommodate the forecasted upward trend in house prices.	[Sing, Chun Pong; Love, Peter E.

A primary concern was the institutional capacity to manage non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Research took place during 2010 (analysis of official documents, semi-structured interviews with key informants, and case studies in four clinics). Walt and Gilson's framework (1994) for policy analysis was used: content, actors, context, and process. Problems of integration and coordination have compounded funding pressures. Despite its importance in Tunisian healthcare, primary health is ill-equipped to manage NCDs. With limited funds, and no referral or health information system, staff morale in the public sector was low. Private healthcare has been the main development filling the void. This study highlights major gaps in the implementation of a comprehensive approach to NCDs, which is an urgent task across the region. In strategic planning, research on the health system is vital; but the capacity within Ministries of Health to use research has first to be built, with a commitment to grounding policy change in evidence.

This was with a view to providing appropriate recommendation to improving the services rendered to subscribers. Primary data were collected from four GSM network operators, two CDMA network operators and three telecommunications service vendors in Nigeria. Findings revealed the existence of strategic technology alliances such as licensing, joint venture, turnkey, venture capital, franchising, merger and acquisition. Benefits derived from the strategic alliances in decreasing order were improved network coverage, decrease in call drops, decrease in signal down time and decrease in tariff of data and voice services. Furthermore, the allies enjoyed increased turnover when they engaged in strategic technology alliance. The study concluded that a well-structured strategic technology alliance relationship among telecommunications firms can bring about better services for sustainable development in the country.

The study area was divided into two management zones by employing Fuzzy c-means cluster analysis. A field experiment was conducted in Split plot design. Irrigation treatments allocated to the main plots in January 2012 included: Irrigation at evapotranspiration (ETc) of 100% (I1 approximate to 3130.54 mm/ha/annum), 90% (I2 approximate to 2817.49 mm/ha/annum), 80% (I3 approximate to 2504.41 mm/ha/annum), and 70% (I4 approximate to 2191.38 mm/ha/annum). The fertilizer levels (N:P2O5:K2O kg/ha/year) allocated to sub plots included: F1 - low (126:92:300), F2 - medium (234:138:400) and F3 - high (342:184:500). After retrofitting of variable rate irrigation (VRI) system on to the center pivot in May 2012, fertilizer levels formed main treatments and irrigation levels formed sub-treatments. The highest yield in both the harvests was obtained by irrigation at 80% ETc. Across the two management zones and two harvests made in September and October 2012, medium fertilizer level (@ 234:138:400 kg/ha/year of N:P2O5:K2O) resulted in higher alfalfa yield than the other two fertilizer levels. VRI showed benefits only in September 2012 harvest. In this harvest, adoption of VRI at 70% ETc in MZ1 and 80% ETc in MZ2 resulted in water saving of 30 and 20%, respectively. The following conclusions can be drawn from this study: 1. Variable rate application of irrigation water for the two management zones resulted in water saving of up to 30% in one out of two harvests. 2. Variable rate application of fertilizers was not effective and uniform rate application of fertilizers @ 234:138:400 kg/ha/year of N:P2O5:K2O resulted in higher alfalfa yield in both the management zones.

The shape of this pattern depends on intrinsic properties of the housing units themselves as well as on accessibility, environmental quality and the capacity and quality of previously constructed housing stock. How do households make their choices and distribute themselves among such diverse housing areas? The aim of this investigation is to put the factors that could define the choice structure of households by focusing on two different-size cities in Turkey: the Istanbul Metropolitan Area (IMA), where the housing choice is expected to dependent upon economic behavior of households, and Bandirma (BND), a medium-size city, where the housing market is relatively weaker and the choice structure is expected to dependent upon the limited opportunities of supply. The investigation results show that households' socio-economic characteristics dominate the choice structure in the IMA parallel to the expectation. Housing properties have a more notable impact on the choice structure in BND that acknowledged the relative limitation of the housing market.

J	Alptekin, GI				Alptekin, Gulfem Isiklar			Strategic pricing model based on genetic algorithm: The case of electronic publishing market	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Pricing decision; game theory; competitive market model; genetic algorithm; channel management; electronic book; dual channel	GAME-THEORY	The electronic-book (e-book) is one of the new technological changes that has significantly influenced the publishing industry in the last century. This has forced publishers to reconsider their distribution channels, since the Internet has provided a new means with which to serve readers. In this paper, a strategic market analysis is proposed from the perspective of a traditional publisher that needs to decide whether to switch to e-publishing business. The analysis model determines the publishing market equilibrium in three different market scenarios. Besides, it shows the impact of readers' choices and price sensitivities on the publishers' profits. The proposed decision support model has its basis on game theory and it is built in an oligopoly setting to reflect the severe market competition. The readers' utilities and demands are modeled using the multinomial logit (MNL) model. Although the first scenario possesses a global optimum solution, in the remaining two market scenarios genetic algorithms (GAs) are used in order to find the solutions of the oligopolies. Numerical applications reveal the industry equilibrium point, where the sum of the profits of all publishers in the market is maximum.

Current usage of network contracts in Italy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH			English	Article						tourism networks; contractual networks; SME cooperation; strategic alliance; place brand; destination management; Italy	DESTINATION BRAND; MANAGEMENT; ALLIANCE; BUSINESS	This study aims to understand the benefits contractual inter-firm networks offer to existing territorial tourism systems in Italy. Preference has been given to a qualitative approach. Data collection was based on document analysis (i.e. information reported in written contracts as well as text and images published on web sites) and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Results indicate that usage of a relatively new legal mechanism (the network contract) designed to form stable interorganisational networks is increasing in the tourism sector. These networks help promote existing territorial tourism systems in different ways and to different extents. In some cases, alliances create and promote a tourism proposal that enhances the territorial offer, while in other situations alliances succeed in identifying and communicating a specific territorial area previously left unmanaged.

J	Bhaskar, BP				Bhaskar, Bhaskara Phaneendra			Landscape planning for agridevelopment at regional scale: an example from cotton growing Yavatmal district, Maharashtra, India	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						landscape planning; cotton; Yavatmal district; shrink - swell soils	SUITABILITY; CROP; GIS	The basaltic landscape planning on the hot semiarid ecosystem in cotton growing Yavatmal district, Maharashtra tends to concentrate on 52 per cent of total cultivated area with 43 per cent of rural families living below poverty line posing major problem for environmental protection and resource management. Concepts of sustainable development at regional level planning suggested that there is a growing concern for the landscape community to develop a strategic regional agricultural planning perspective in order to assist landscape planning goals. These challenges were explored with particular reference to the cotton growing Yavatmal district in Maharashtra through baseline land resource / agronomic surveys and assessing the production potential of regional rural landscapes for crop planning. Landscape analysis, premised on the geopedological and elevation constructs, culminated in a spatial coverage of hills and ridges (12.6 per cent of total area) in northern and central parts whereas plateaus (29.3 per cent) in association with isolated hills, mesas and butte and escarpments (17.7 per cent), pediplains (28.8 per cent) and plains (8.1 per cent) in south western parts of the district. The arability and suitability analysis showed that 25.04 per cent of area is evaluated as suitable for cotton under dryland conditions with fertilizer dose from 123 kg/ha to 141.56 kg/ha of nitrogen and 64 to 83kg/ha of phosphorus and 51 to 69 kg/ha of potassium in the region. Regional level analysis revealed spatially variable soil typologies dominated by vertisols and vertic intergrades. An exploration and brief account of integration of landscape planning was discussed with some reflections on the experience and highlighting some of the problems and potentials of this approach within the regional context.

J	Bhattacharjee, D; Prakash, A; Mohanty, RP				Bhattacharjee, Debabrata; Prakash, Anand; Mohanty, Rajendra Prasad			Strategic collaboration management between Indian oil marketing and auto-service companies An empirical study	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Structural equation modelling; Collaboration; Supply chain management; Strategic management; Auto-service companies; Oil marketing	SUPPLY CHAIN COLLABORATION; CAPABILITIES	Purpose - The downstream oil marketing companies (OMCs) have an opportunity to compensate their huge under-recovery by increasing non-fuel revenues through strategic planning for collaboration with organized companies (OCs) of auto-servicing sector, who are experiencing a surge in the demand for auto-servicing. The purpose of this paper is to explore the business need for strategic collaboration and empirically validate the building mechanism for collaborative capacities between the two sectors (OMCs and OCs). Design/methodology/approach - The paper is designed to explore the implementation of collaboration using needs analysis, exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling process for building collaborative capacities between the two sectors. Findings - Although alignment is a necessary condition before allowing for a valid collaboration between the two sectors, the external alignment process is highly significant for implementing collaboration unlike the internal alignment process. Research limitations/implications - Methodological limitations include the use of convenience sampling and anonymous survey-based research. Practical implications - Selecting the "right" identified factors for collaboration is unquestionably one of the most important topics in the collaboration literature, which holds vast practical implications. Originality/value - This study provides practical and theoretical insights for implementing collaboration based on empirical results.

The methodology is action research. This is because the model proposed and tested is the result of reflection and resolution of critical organizational issues, applied in a company's public electricity sector. The approach proposed in this paper consists in structuring the processes and tools related to the management of R&D driven innovation (R&D+i) and aligned with business strategy. These processes include the adoption of procedures and tools to manage structured and integrated decision-making flows involved in the innovation process, aiming at full alignment with business goals and objectives.

J	Charlebois, S; von Massow, M				Charlebois, Sylvain; von Massow, Michael			The effectiveness of co-opetition in a live case study approach Increasing knowledge of an industry while helping others in a competitive MBA classroom environment	JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Graduate education; Live case study	COOPETITION; INNOVATION; SKILLS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the introduction of the concept of co-opetition in an MBA classroom through the use of a live case study competition. As part of a capstone course at the University of Guelph, teams of three to four MBA students were required to work with a corporate partner in the food industry during a five-day intensive workshop. After spending one week analyzing and working on a plan, students were asked to compete in the MBA Boardroom Challenge, which is held on the last day of the course at the corporate partner's headquarters. During the course of the week, while developing their plans, teams could choose to interact and met on two occasions with the corporate partner as a class to ask questions. This meant that teams operated in both a cooperative and competitive context during the course. While presentations were academically evaluated by the instructor, scholarships were offered to the winning team by the company using another set of criteria. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of blending cooperation and competition in a graduate business classroom and finds that the introduction of co-opetition enhanced outcomes for both students and partners. The limitations of this process are considered, and future research directions are suggested. Design/methodology/approach - This project, the focus of this paper, was in partial fulfillment of a capstone strategic management course for the University of Glebe's MBA program in Spring 2013. For this iteration, Longo's Brothers, a well-established food distribution company, was brought in as the case study. The mandate of the course was to set a strategic view of Longo's and Grocery Gateway (a division of Longo's), a Canadian-based food e-distributor owned and operated by Longo's Brothers. The concept of co-opetition and its application was introduced as part of the course. Findings - Longo's Brothers provided an ideal environment for a live case study. It was open, available end engaged at all levels. Its status as a family-owned business offered a unique perspective on the food industry as well. Students benefited from the company's openness to share sensitive information with the group, and were able to ask information on finances, marketing, human resources and the organizational structure of the company. The level of cooperation was more than adequate for a MBA-level course. But students faced a few challenges. Research limitations/implications - The unpredictable nature of the entire process did not allow for measurement of knowledge acquirement and skill development. This is something such a course should address in future iterations. Future research could usefully explore a number of research questions around this area; namely, how live case studies might enable MBA students to better understand the element of co-opetition in their industry, while going through the interplay between theory and the practical application of theory over time. Also to be assessed is the choice of an incentive for the winning team and the overall effectiveness of doing so. The impact of this crucial elements on the course needs to be measured over a greater length of time. Practical implications - Live case studies may be integrated into multiple courses, however, they require a lot of work on the part of the instructor, particularly when dealing with a company to negotiate an incentive and leverage the competitive environment. Setting up and maintaining relationships with collaborative corporate partners for the program takes significant time and effort, and the schedule of inputs into the students' learning may not synchronize with the normal pattern of teaching. Whether this type of course can be sustained within a normal university environment is a moot point. Social implications - While presentations were evaluated academically by the instructor, scholarships were offered to the winning team by the company using another set of criteria. Criteria for grading are readily available to students at the start of the course, as per the University Senate bylaws. However, criteria used by the corporate partner are not disclosed, not even to the instructor. In fact, for the Longo's Brothers project, the winning team failed to receive the highest grade. The winning team received the third highest grade of all seven teams competing. Originality/value - The element of co-opetition in a MBA classroom seems to elevate the quality of projects, but more evidence need to be gathered to reinforce this hypothesis. It is believed that university courses cannot fully negotiate the emotional turmoil or complexity that live case studies encompass with conventional models of evaluation.

J	Chimhundu, R; Kong, E; Gururajan, R				Chimhundu, Ranga; Kong, Eric; Gururajan, Raj			Category captain arrangements in grocery retail marketing	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Marketing; Asia Pacific; Grocery retail; Power; Category captain; Consumer goods	POWER; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine shelf management practices of grocery retail chains and their category captains (CCs) in the marketing of consumer packaged goods. Design/methodology/approach - This is a qualitative, exploratory study that is set in a duopoly retail environment in the Asia-Pacific region. The study employed 18 in-depth interviews with executives and managers of two umbrella retail organisations and their suppliers/manufacturers. The method of data analysis employed was content analysis. Findings - Despite CC input in merchandising decisions, it is the retail chains that have the final say on shelf matters. There is no risk of strategic loss of power in employing CCs to manage store product categories on behalf of, or in partnership with retailers provided the retail chains closely monitor the activities and decisions/recommendations of the captains. Research limitations/implications - The paper is developed from data obtained from the grocery retail industry of one economy. Future research would need to extend this study to other economies with similar as well as different conditions. Practical implications - The research offers reassurance to grocery retail practitioners who may be contemplating lessening the burden of managing all their store categories by themselves and switching to CC arrangements. The reassurance is that the reported risk associated with loss of power is manageable. Originality/value - The paper has created a typology termed the "category captain arrangement/grocery retail concentration matrix" and specific directions for further research.

J	dos Santos, JC; da Silva, MM				Correia dos Santos, Joao; Mira da Silva, Miguel			Mapping Critical Success Factors for IT Outsourcing: The Providers' Perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cognitive Mapping; Critical Success Factor; Customization; IT Outsourcing; Pricing Management; Service Catalogue; Service Design; Standardization	GOVERNANCE; MAPS	During the last decades, IT Outsourcing gained considerable management attention and is considered a strategic decision used to promote success on its variable dimensions, like: cost reduction, quality improvement, access to new technologies, among others. The existing literature presents many studies on IT Outsourcing. However, there are few studies from the provider's perspective. Therefore, the objective is to focus on providers' critical success factors and their relationships in IT Outsourcing contracts. To analyse this subject a qualitative approach based on cognitive mapping process was applied. Cognitive or causal maps are widely employed in problem-structuring, since they permit a rich representation of ideas, through the modelling of a complex network of actions. This approach is innovative compared to the traditional quantitative methods used. As a result, authors were able to map a network of means and ends and in parallel were found new success factors like service standardization, price flexibility, cost management and service catalogue, which allowed obtaining new insights into the structure of today's IT Outsourcing contracts.

J	Essig, M; Glas, AH; Gutsmiedl, J				Essig, Michael; Glas, Andreas H.; Gutsmiedl, Josef			Procurement of a supply information system Lessons learned from the purchase of an inventory management system for C-parts	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						C-parts management; IT-based procurement; Procurement instrument; Stakeholder decision-making	SOFTWARE SELECTION; ERP; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; QUALITY	Purpose - Given the high importance of information systems for procurement, surprisingly there have been little efforts to analyze the process and the relevant reasons for the procurement decision of such systems from a stakeholder perspective. The purpose of this paper is to explore these aspects in the context of low-value (C-)parts. Design/methodology/approach - Research is based on a case study in a pre-fabricator company in Germany and analyzes the process to procure a system for sourcing low-value parts. Findings - As a finding, the procurement process and decision attributes have been integrated into a framework which supports corporate decision-making considering the procurement reasons of all involved stakeholders (internal departments, external customers and suppliers). Research limitations/implications - Research is based on case study analysis. Findings are specific to case companies and the environment in which they operate. The framework should be tested further in different contexts. Practical implications - The developed decision frame supports the evaluation of different sourcing information systems, including clearly measurable criteria but also qualitative or company-strategic decision attributes. Originality/value - The combination of financial and other perspectives (operations, information technology (IT)-administration, system users, etc.), is used to evolve a robust ex-ante instrument for supporting buying decisions for procurement information systems. The case description also illustrates the findings and develops new insights about stakeholders and buying groups decision-making for information systems.

J	Fombad, M				Fombad, Madeleine			Knowledge management a competitive edge for law firms in Botswana in the changing business environment	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Background: Law firms in Botswana offer a particularly interesting context to explore the effects of transition in the knowledge economy. Acquiring and leveraging knowledge effectively in law firms through knowledge management can result in competitive advantage; yet the adoption of this approach remains in its infancy. Objectives: This article investigates the factors that will motivate the adoption of knowledge management in law firms in Botswana, and creates an awareness of the potential benefits of knowledge management in these firms. Method: The article uses both quantitative and qualitative research methods and the survey research design. A survey was performed on all 115 registered law firms and 217 lawyers in Botswana. Interviews were conducted with selected lawyers for more insight. Results: Several changes in the legal environment have motivated law firms to adopt knowledge management. Furthermore, lawyers appreciate the potential benefits of knowledge management. Conclusion: With the rise of the knowledge-based economy, coupled with the pressures faced by the legal industry in recent years, law firms in Botswana can no longer afford to rely on the traditional methods of managing knowledge. Knowledge management will, therefore, enhance the cost effectiveness of these firms. Strategic knowledge management certainly helps to prepare law firms in Botswana to be alive to the fact that the systematic harnessing of legal knowledge is no longer a luxury, but an absolute necessity in the knowledge economy. It will also provide an enabling business environment for private sector development and growth and, therefore, facilitate Botswana's drive towards the knowledge-based economy.

The research included both a quantitative and a qualitative phase. Analysis of the organisational characteristics revealed that generally speaking the organisations we researched are learning-oriented and that the factors of vision, planning and information are the main determinants. The management practices found in the organisations were evidence of an environment and an infrastructure favourable to learning; in addition, these companies had people who were capable of developing their activities in a satisfactory manner.

J	Gupta, MC; Bridgman, S; Sahi, GK				Gupta, Mahesh; Bridgman, Stewart, Jr.; Sahi, Gurjeet			Application of TOC-based framework to improve market orientation in a non-profit organization	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						market orientation; internal market orientation; theory of constraints; non-profit organizations; healthcare industry		The theory of constraints (TOC) is a relatively new management philosophy, especially to the marketing function, which recognizes that system constraints limit the performance of a system and that proposes a unique methodology (a process of five focusing steps (FFS) to manage system constraints) and set of measures (throughput, inventory, and operating expenses). We show how Mental Health Services (termed as the MHS institute) was able to apply the said framework to systematically improve the degree of market orientation (MO) and thereby, significantly impact business performance measured in terms of billable products/services provided while ensuring stakeholders', for example, employees' and customers', satisfaction. This paper discusses an application of the TOC-based framework to improve MO, both external and internal, in a not-for-profit psychosocial rehabilitation MHS institute. TOC measures encourage the MHS institute's employees across functional areas to work together and find innovative ways of increasing flow of customers instead of cutting or containing costs. The TOC methodology, using the FFS-based improvement process, reveals multiple physical and policy constraints within the MHS institute, and their successful resolution improves revenues, customer care, employee satisfaction, and importantly constraint resource utilization. However, empirical research is needed to develop strong theory explaining the (mediation/moderation) relationship between MO and TOC. Furthermore, there is a need to introduce Evaporating Clouds to initiate new acceptable process improvement ideas. Most of the recommendations in the paper require little or no net costs to implement. We show how MO of other community mental health centers and health delivery systems can be improved by using the proposed TOC-based framework.

Due to technological advances, organisations have porous boundaries and collaborate externally to innovate. Even within, deployment of cross-functional teams has sidestepped traditional hierarchies. The study establishes the need for and helps to; map the entire social network and sub-networks within organisations that fulfil requirements conducive to innovation.

J	Hallavo, V; Kuula, M; Putkiranta, A				Hallavo, Ville; Kuula, Markku; Putkiranta, Antero			Strategic roles of service sites: application of Ferdows's model	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Benchmarking; Service operations; Roles	PRODUCT LIFE-CYCLES; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; WORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the applicability to the service business of general models used in the manufacturing environment. This is done by applying Ferdows's model, "the strategic role of the plant", in two cases. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses the case approach. One case (IBM Nordic) is based on an interview, while the other case (Google) relies on secondary data. In each case the operations are mapped on Ferdows's model. Findings - The cases indicate that the same kind of roles can be found in the service business as in traditional manufacturing environments, and that these roles are widely used. However, for communicative purposes, the model was terminologically slightly modified. Research limitations/implications - Although this study presents the findings of only two cases, the knowledge of material available from public sources leads us to believe that these findings are universal. The model is easy to communicate in the service sector and is thus a very valuable tool. Originality/value - Models used in the traditional manufacturing and operations management environment have not yet been fully discovered by, nor sufficiently applied in, the service sector. Academics and practitioners are busy trying to create new models in this sector, without noticing that the "old" tools are still usable. Benchmarking against the models used in other sectors might be a worthwhile exercise.

J	Hilb, M; Casas, T				Hilb, Michael; Casas, Tomas			Towards a construct of entrepreneurial strategising: the case of private equity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING			English	Article						strategic entrepreneurship; entrepreneurial mindset; behavioural entrepreneurship; theoretical construct; private equity; strategizing; venturing		The obvious relevance of entrepreneurship in value creation has set off an intense debate in academia over how strategic management and entrepreneurship relate to each other culminating in the concept of 'strategic entrepreneurship'. As a result, the term 'strategic entrepreneurship', albeit widely used and defined, remains a theoretical concept indicating little more than a potential relationship between the two fields. Such debate, therefore, although fruitful for and typical of dynamic research fields in the process of transformation, may not be as useful for theoretical advancement as practice-informed approaches to theoretical model construction. We thus adopt such an approach by choosing as a starting point a setting in which strategic and entrepreneurial forces meet: the management of private equity funded firms. At the heart of our contribution lies the development of a new theoretical construct, entrepreneurial strategising, which is embedded in the relevant streams of both the strategy and entrepreneurship literature and, to a lesser extent, of behaviourist economics and the statistical notion of uncertainty. Specifically, entrepreneurial strategising refers to the dynamic capability of an organisation to employ discrete strategic and entrepreneurial mindsets; that is, mental models used by decision-takers situationally and, in some instances, simultaneously.

This paper focuses on the optimal carbon taxation policy levied by countries and the impact on firms' optimal production decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a two-stage game theory model to analyze the impact of carbon tariff and tax. Numerical simulation is used to supplement the theoretical analysis. Findings: Results derived from the paper indicate that the demand in an unstable market is significantly affected by environmental damage level. Carbon tariff is a policy-oriented tax while the carbon tax is a market-oriented one. Comprehensive carbon taxation policy benefit developed countries and basic policy is more suitable for developing countries. Research limitations/implications: In this research, we do not consider random demand and asymmetric information, which may not well suited the reality. Originality/value: This work provides a different perspective in analyzing the impact of carbon tax and tariff. It is the first study to consider two consuming market and the strategic game between two countries. Different international status of countries considered in the paper is also a unique point.

This paper presents the challenges faced by the Chinese cosmetics industry in achieving strategic transformation by exploring how firms innovate strategically to compete based on their typology. The constituents of strategic innovation were analysed by 19 types of strategic innovation. Miles and Snow business-level strategy typology was extended to analyse the choices among defenders, analysers, and prospectors. MANOVA was used to analyse data. Results indicated that different types of firms focus on different types of strategic innovations. Prospectors focus on strategic innovation that improves new market creation, defenders on the improvement of product and service value, and analysers on competitive disruption. This research improves the understanding of strategic innovation in the Chinese cosmetics industry based on the typology of firms as a tool of strategic transformation.

The PTC initiated computerised decision support systems and developed a range of electronic service products to sustain rational prescribing. However, knowledge about which determinants have supported or hindered the sustainability of this type of healthcare organisation is limited. ObjectiveThis study aims to identify and explore determinants that support or challenge the development and sustainability of the PTC organisation, as well as investigate the key elements of their implementation efforts. MethodsAn in-depth interview study among key informants involved in the establishment of the PTC organisation was conducted. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. ResultsFindings suggest that determinants enabling the development and expansion of this organisation include the presence of innovative characteristics among the PTC leadership and the ability of leaders to nurture visionary innovation in others, as well as the instigation of informal social networks and to identify end-user needs. Challenges included an ambiguous relationship to the pharmaceutical industry, an underestimation of the innovation-system fit and to undertake systematic evaluation of created impact by the organisation. Although prescriber use of electronic service products and adherence to an essential drug list increased over time, it remains difficult to identify methods required for demonstrating patient effects. ConclusionWhereas some determinants enabled the successful expansion of the PTC organisation, others served to substantially hinder it. The determinants identified can pave the way for systematic investigations into organisational change and development research in the pharmaceutical field. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Koskinen, KU				Koskinen, Kaj Untamo			Identity change in organizations: a philosophical exposition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Change management; Interaction; Corporate identity; Language; Meaning	SOCIAL IDENTITY; NARRATIVE APPROACH; STRATEGIC CHANGE; SENSEMAKING; IMAGE	Purpose - This paper aims to describe how organization's identity changes in the course of time. Focus is on project-based companies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper first highlights the concept of process thinking. Then follow descriptions of notions of identity and identity change as change processes. After that, three different identity change processes - negotiation of meaning, lauguaging and interaction - are illustrated. And after that follows the main content of the paper, namely, descriptions of identity changes in organizations. These descriptions focus on two approaches: "Unintentional identity change" and "Intentional identity change". Findings - Identity provides organizations with powerful understanding of theories of who they are. These understandings guide subsequent resource allocation decisions. Identity change in an organization can be categorized into unintentional and intentional identity changes. Unintentional identity changes takes place through the previously mentioned three processes. Instead, intentional identity change takes place through strategy planning. Practical implications - Finding a viable view through which organizations can understand how their identities chance in the course of time is a very important issue. Therefore, in this paper, the authors have sought to offer a brief illustration of this area. Originality/value - In the literature, rather, a lot of attention has been focused on how identities are constructed, and what is their role, for example, in the companies' strategic management and marketing. However, less attention has been paid to how identities are involved in organizations' change processes. That is why the goal of this paper is to address that lack by studying identity change in organizations.

PREDICTION OF FIRMS FINANCIAL DISTRESS: THE CASE OF THE GREEK FISH-FARMING INDUSTRY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Greek fish-farming industry; financial ratios; profitability; activity; liquidity; financial distress	NEURAL-NETWORKS; BANKRUPTCY; GROWTH; RATIOS; SIZE; MANAGEMENT; INTERNET; FAILURE; MODEL; AGE	The economic crisis in recent years has brought significant challenges in almost all business and shown that exogenous factors act as catalysts in markets. As a consequence of such a result, there is a need to highlight the importance of creating predictability models for analysing potential future behaviour, namely creating models for assessing potential economic impact that contribute a lot in avoiding firms financial default. Our study is focused in describing previous models for predicting firms bankruptcy. We use factors such as profitability, activity, liquidity, age, size, growth rate and capital structure, as the most significant ratios affecting the distress event in the Greek fish-farming industry and the impact of each ratio in prediction models. We propose a model in which indicators used are critical for firms financial viability. The aim of this study is to find signals of firms financial distress activity as well as actions need to be taken to avoid it, in order to provide the management with certain strategic movements to carry out to avoid potential failure.

Design/methodology/approach - In two experiments involving US and Chinese managers, respectively, the study looks into situations wherein a party's power is lower, equal or higher, all relative to the other party, and there is high versus low mutual commitment between the two parties. The effects of relative power and mutual commitment on influence strategies are also compared between US and Chinese managers. Findings - There is no significant difference between low and equal power with regard to choice of influence strategies. However, moving from a low/equal power to a high-power position, a party's use of integrative (non-mediated) communications decreased significantly, whereas the use of coercive (mediated) communications increased significantly. The results also show that the effect of relative power is greater when mutual commitment is low than when mutual commitment is high. Finally, there is evidence that the effect of power is stronger for the Americans, whereas the effect of commitment is stronger for the Chinese. Originality/value - The paper offers a finer account of power relations wherein a party's power is lower than, equal to or higher than that of the other party and explores the moderating effect role of national culture on the linkages from relative power and relationship commitment to influence strategy use.

Educator Abuwen Toffler said once, the illiterates in the future may not be the people not able to read and write, but not capable to know how to learn. Serving as educational institutions cultivating medical students' learning ability, colleges and universities should not only instruct specific professional knowledge and skills, but also develop medical students' self-learning ability. In this research, we built a teaching system which can help to restore medical students' self-learning processes and analyze their learning outcomes and behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system in supporting medical students' self-learning, an experiment was conducted in 116 medical students from two grades. The results indicated that problems in self-learning process through this system was consistent with problems raised from traditional classroom teaching. Moreover, the experimental group (using this system) acted better than control group (using traditional classroom teaching) to some extent. Thus, this system can not only help medical students to develop their self-learning ability, but also enhances the ability of teachers to target medical students' questions quickly, improving the efficiency of answering questions in class.

Pedagogy Rules: Open Mindset in Adopting Fit-for-Purpose Educational Tools in Teaching Dispersed Medical Students	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						pedagogy; education technology; reflective practice; learning organisation theory; learning environment; alignment; rural medical education		Students in the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia (RCSWA) spend one year of clinical study learning in small groups while embedded in rural or remote communities. This aims to increase the locally trained rural medical workforce. Their learning environment, the clinical context of their learning, and their rural doctor-teachers all contrast with the more traditional learning setting in city hospitals. The RCSWA has succeeded in its outcomes for students and in rural medical workforce impact; it has grown from 4 pilot sites to 14 in 12 years. This reflective piece assimilates observations of the formation of the RCSWA pedagogy and of the strategic alignment of education technologies with learning environment and pedagogy over a seven-year period. Internal and external influences, driving change in the RCSWA, were considered from three observer perspectives in a naturalistic setting. Flexibility in both education technologies and organizational governance enabled education management to actively follow pedagogy. Peter Senge's learning organization (LO) theory was overlaid on the strategies for change response in the RCSWA; these aligned with those of known LOs as well with LO disciplines and the archetypal systems thinking. We contend that the successful RCSWA paradigm is that of an LO.	[Maley, Moira A.

Developing a quality management system implementation process for a medical device manufacturer	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Manufacturing strategy process; ISO 13485:2003; Medical device manufacturer; Process approach; RDC No. 59:2000	STRATEGY FORMULATION PROCESSES; PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT; CERTIFICATION; PRIORITIES; DESIGN	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a quality management system (QMS) implementation process for a medical devices manufacturer, which are covered by ISO 13485: 2007 and RDC No. 59: 2000 and based on operations strategy content definitions. Design/methodology/approach - The research strategy is based on the Cambridge approach which is supported by action research techniques for producing "application" processes. This research strategy is also known as the "Process Approach" or "the Engineering Approach" and was developed in the mid-1990s by researchers from the "Institute for Manufacturing" (IFM/University of Cambridge). Findings - The results reveal how real conditions "shape" implementation, indicating solutions for integrating procedures for performance and control indicators that represent manufacturing strategy objectives. The regulatory framework and the manufacturing environment offer these real conditions. The operations strategy that is underlying implementation shows how to reconcile regulation and strategy through its content. Research limitations/implications - The developed process can be improved by increasing the number of test cases until they bring no new contributions for its evolution. However, because it is a long-term and complex implementation process, the present research was concluded with a full understanding of process development. Practical implications - The QMS implementation process based on the Cambridge Engineering approach creates several opportunities for discussing QMS design requirements, but also in testing procedures for quality policy deployment. Learning by doing is a practical contribution of the process as a participative component effectively applied in different moments at the mentioned workshops - WSH. The logical organization of the QMS implementation process shows causalities among manufacturing strategy, QMS and performance measurements, creating strategic coherence among the connected elements. Originality/value - Although many studies had approached the QMS implementation, few of them actually addressed the system integration with the business strategic objectives. None of the studies to date related the implementation to the ISO 13485: 2003 and the RDC No. 59.

J	Mothe, S; Ballangrud, BOB; Stensaker, B				Mothe, Svein; Ballangrud, Brit Olaug Bolken; Stensaker, Bjorn			The values and visions of the professional department head: not so different from the past?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Leadership; Values; Norway; Visions; Academic leaders; Norwegian higher education	STRATEGIC CHANGE; SENSEMAKING	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze how appointed leaders in Norwegian higher education perceive their role and influence, and their discretion as academic leaders. Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies strategic, cultural and political perspectives on leadership to investigate the understanding and perceptions held by academic leaders regarding their own work. The study applied a qualitative strategy based on a cross-sectional design. The findings are based on semi-structured interviews with 18 purposefully selected academic leaders. Findings - The findings reveal that appointed academic leaders are struggling with traditions and cultures and current governing structures and funding mechanisms on the other. The paper argues that this dilemma limits the potential for academic leaders to instigate change and that leadership perhaps has been overemphasized as a factor driving transformation of higher education. Originality/value - The paper suggests the heated debates in Norway about whether academic leaders should be elected or appointed has limited relevance for understanding how academic leadership is performed in the actual daily work of leaders. The paper suggest that the current interest in selection of leaders perhaps should be downplayed in favor of a perspective focussing on the cultural factors framing current leadership practices.

Different locations, access and working environment may compromise any standardization of setup's and operations. Multi-site teams based on geographic strategic locations, adds complexity to trainning, communication, supervising and monitoring processes. Logistics and information systems assume relevant rolls to consolidate global performance. Beside efficiency, effectiveness productivity and flexibility, field teams need skills on autonomy responsibility and proactivity. This lecture also explores the needed adaptation of most part of available literature, normally based on production sites, as also of Lean-Kaizen principles to the fact that services can not be stocked, quality is normally more difficult to measure and customer is normally present when and where service is produced.

J	Mpwanya, MF; van Heerden, CH				Mpwanya, Musenga F.; van Heerden, Cornelius H. (Neels)			Perceptions of managers regarding supply chain cost reduction in the South African mobile phone industry	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article							OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY; OPERATORS	Background: Many industries, including the mobile phone industry, experience a surge in supply chain (SC) costs in the provision of products and services to their customers. Despite this, only a few studies have been conducted on SC cost reduction in South Africa and globally. Objective: This study seeks to understand the perceptions of managers regarding cost reduction in the South African mobile phone SC. Method: A qualitative case study was conducted, involving eight willing managers and using semi-structured interviews, observation and documents. Interviews transcripts were analysed thematically with the help of Atlas.ti and a threefold process was followed, comprising data reduction, data display and data interpretation and conclusion drawing. Results: The findings suggest that mobile phone companies should consolidate their strategic relationships and be efficient, in order to effectively reduce costs in the South African mobile phone SC. To achieve this, whilst South African mobile network operators have to share more and more infrastructure and outsource their operations, other mobile phone companies should re-engineer their operational processes and their reduce costs across the SC. Conclusion: The knowledge generated from this study should assist South African mobile phone companies to reduce their SC costs and address high-priced mobile services. On the other hand, this study should assist regulating authorities (the Department of Communications and the Independent Communication Authority of South Africa) to gain insights into the challenges faced by the mobile phone industry in South Africa and, therefore, to make appropriate and adequate mobile telecommunication policies.

J	Narayanamurthy, G; Gurumurthy, A				Narayanamurthy, Gopalakrishnan; Gurumurthy, Anand			A case study on downstream supply chain of an Indian alcoholic beverage manufacturer Some insights for the global business	JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Case study; Supply chain management; India; Alcoholic beverage industry; Distribution channels; Downstream supply chain	DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; STRATEGIES; SELECTION; INDUSTRY; GREEN; MODEL	Purpose - This study aims to understand the structure of downstream network from a supply chain ( SC) perspective using a case of an Indian alcoholic beverage manufacturing company. In the SC literature, many researchers and practitioners have studied the design of upstream supplier network. Very few studies have documented the design of downstream network comprising distributors, warehouses, retailers, etc. and current study attempts to contribute to this limited literature. In addition, this study also tries to understand the influence of downstream SC, if any, on top management strategies. Finally, it assesses the SC quality using the standard set of factors and provides insights for its improvement. Design/methodology/approach - Single case study approach has been utilized to understand the configuration of downstream SC. A distillery in southern part of India which distributes a variety of liquor products across the market has been chosen for this study. Different data collection approaches have been adopted to understand the distribution channels prevailing in the market. In addition to the internal documents, semi-structured interviews were conducted with salesmen employed by the distillery for different group of outlets, top management of the distillery, outlet owners and counter sales person. Findings - Different distribution channels constituting the downstream SC network of the industry in the market studied have been identified to be retails and bars, institutions, clubs, modern trade, maximum retail price and Mysore Sales International Limited. Each of the distribution channels has clearly defined their boundaries for reaching different segment of consumers. Significant influence of the existing distribution channels on strategic decisions such as new product development and pricing were noticed. Interesting inferences were obtained on the relationships existing between the distilleries and different distribution channels. Insights were also gathered on the regulatory role played by the government between the manufacturers and distributors. Few marketing and promotional strategies adopted by companies to strengthen their downstream relationships with distribution channels and, in turn, with consumers have also been discussed. The quality of alcoholic beverage SC has been assessed and was found to perform on par with the set standards of quality in robustness factors and enabling factors. Training factor needs to be further improved by providing salesmen with exposure to best practices. Effort also needs to be taken to improve in the complicating factors, i. e. the testability and time. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to the experience of a single alcoholic beverage manufacturer in the Karnataka state in India. SC of alcoholic beverage industry in India varies across states and depends on State Government regulations. Hence, the obtained results and inferences cannot be generalized across the industries and geographies. Future studies can be carried out in different locations across the country to understand the structure and dynamics of downstream SC in this industry. Scope also exists to study how the deficiencies identified in the SC can be improved and how alcoholic beverage firms entering India adapt to the prevailing SC structure. Comparative study of downstream SC of different industries can also be conducted. Practical implications - Academicians and practitioners can consider this paper as a source to understand the configuration of downstream SC of alcoholic beverage industry. More than that, this study provides a counter-intuitive inference for researchers and practitioners that choice of distribution channels have influence on the strategic decisions such as pricing and product development. Therefore, it becomes necessary to factor in the target distribution channel at the product design phase itself. This study may also help in performing a comparative study of downstream SC -especially the distribution network of different industries and identify best practices that can be adopted across the industries. Application of the standard set of factors from the food SC quality assessment literature have been demonstrated in this study to assess the downstream SC of the alcoholic beverage industry studied. In addition, this study provides several insights by detailing the structure of the SC for other alcoholic beverage manufacturers who are planning to enter Indian market. Originality/value - According to author's knowledge, it is believed that this is the first study to report the configuration of downstream SC of the alcoholic beverage industry specifically from India apart from describing their influence on strategic decisions of the company.

J	Nejad, AE; Kuzgunkaya, O				Nejad, Alireza Ebrahim; Kuzgunkaya, Onur			On the value of response time characteristics in robust design of supply flow	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Congestion; Disruption management; Response time; Robustness; Strategic stock; Volume flexibility	CONTINGENCY STRATEGIES; DISRUPTION RISK; RAMP-UP; CHAIN	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a decision-making tool achieving robust supply flow by incorporating strategic stock and contingent sourcing in mitigating minor and major disruptions. Design/methodology/approach - The authors consider a firm with two suppliers where the main supplier is cost-effective but prone to disruptions and the back-up supplier is reliable but expensive due to built-in volume flexibility. In order to incorporate the randomness associated with disruptions and the available capacity during response time in the decision-making stage, the authors present a multi-stage robust optimization (RO) model. The design problem is to determine optimal strategic stock level and response speed of volume-flexible back-up supplier in order to achieve a robust supply flow. Findings - The results show that the quality of optimal solution is improved by considering the randomness associated with available capacity. In addition, incorporating congestion effects allows identifying the appropriate level of supply chain responsiveness, thus improving the overall performance. Originality/value - The novelty of the proposed model is the consideration of both strategic stock and volume flexibility in maintaining a robust supply performance while incorporating response capability and congestion effects.

Especially the Modality Paper, for agricultural issues released by World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2006, covers some criteria are characterized for classifying the agricultural crops as special. In this context, based on both international criteria and the principles mentioned above some agricultural crops such as especially tea and hazelnut and tobacco, cotton, olive, wheat etc. having important effects on national and regional development in Turkey would be specified as SAC. So, in Turkey, beside the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, it is required that the development of Spatial Data Model (SDM) for administration SAC lands as well. In this thesis, the tea crop having strategic position on agricultural development and growing under state guarantee in Turkey assumed to specify as SAC and development of SDM for tea farming as a case study. And also it is emphasized that development of Tea Agricultural Land Administration Model (TALAM) and the requirements on Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for spatial data management of tea agricultural lands. In addition to this, as a result of this study, it is aimed to development of the Land Administration Domain Model - Tea Agricultural Model (LADM-TAM) for sustainable tea agriculture and tea growing and integration this model to Turkish National Geographical Information System (TUCBS).

J	Park, BI; Min, H; Sung, SK				Park, Byung-In; Min, Hokey; Sung, Souk-Kyung			A game-theoretic approach to determining the preferential berthing charges of ocean carriers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT LOGISTICS			English	Article						berthing charge; maritime logistics; port pricing; game theory	NETWORK DESIGN; ALLIANCES	In response to uncertain global economy, many port authorities postponed their investment plans for improving or expanding the port infrastructure. As such, the utilisation of the existing port facilities and the assurance of needed port finances have become the crucial issues for port survival and competitiveness. To address those issues, many ports attempted to formulate port pricing strategy in such a way that it attracts more carriers/shippers, while recovering costs associated with port investment, operation and maintenance. One critical element of port pricing includes a berthing charge. Considering a strategic significance of berthing charge to port competitiveness, this paper develops a mathematical model based on game theory that helps port authorities determine the optimal berthing charge. To validate the rigor and usefulness of the proposed game-theoretic model, we applied it to solve actual berthing charge problems encountered by one of the leading container ports in Korea.

Pattern of manufacturing strategy implementation and implications on manufacturing levers and manufacturing outputs and business performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						manufacturing strategy implementation; manufacturing outputs; manufacturing decisions/levers; packaging product manufacturing industry		The strategic implementation of manufacturing improves competence of manufacturing function (Lawson, 2002) and develops capability in different areas of manufacturing system or levers or decisions such as human resource, production planning and control, organisation structure and control, process technology, sourcing and facilities. This study explores the manufacturing strategy implementation (MSI) in Indian product packaging industry (IPPMC) using three constructs namely manufacturing as competitive force, functional integration of manufacturing, strategic planning and communication. The recognition of manufacturing competency can be judged through improvement in the manufacturing output and business performance. This research proposes a comprehensive framework for linking and exploring the pattern of MSI, differences in manufacturing decisions/levers, manufacturing outputs and business performance of a firm. This is achieved by classifying the plants in four groups based on the increasing level of manufacturing strategy implementation using cluster analysis. The paper also highlights managerial implications, limitations and future scope of research.	[Patil, Pradip P.; Narkhede, B.

J	Santiago, A				Santiago, Andrea			Inertia as inhibiting competitiveness in Philippine family businesses	JOURNAL OF FAMILY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Family business; Impact of family dynamics on management behaviours; Organizational changes; Governance; Strategic planning; Succession planning		Purpose - The failure to innovate has been recognized as one of the prime causes of business failure. In addition to this, the purpose of this paper is to explore whether it is the failure to act or inertia that can also explain the inability of family businesses to move forward. Design/methodology/approach - This research documented the experiences of five family businesses in the Philippines that were unable to sustain their business operations. Only five families were identified since it was difficult to trace the business owners of businesses that failed, and once identified, not all were willing to discuss the reason for their business failure. Findings - The cases showed that business decline actually results from the failure of family members to address the challenges brought about the change in the different life cycle dimensions. In hindsight, arresting a downward trend necessitates varied strategic approaches. While some family members may felt incapable of introducing innovation in their business, the failure to act, by itself, was a guarantee of business failure. Research limitations/implications - The research was limited to five family businesses in the Philippines. It is possible that there may be many other reasons for family business failure based on the experiences of other families. Unfortunately, many business families in the Philippines are tight-lipped about failure, even if there are lessons to be learned. Practical implications - This paper brings attention to the need of family business owners to be more proactive in meeting the changing needs of their family business. Formula that worked before may not be appropriate at a different time. Originality/value - Research has shown that there are many reasons for family business failure. This paper shows the importance of transcending the feeling of inertia so that family members can be more proactive in meeting the challenges that they are bound to face as their families, their products, their businesses, and the industries they are in, move from one stage of the life cycle to another.

In this study, we used a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in combination with the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm (SUFI-2) to simulate the water resource components (blue and green water) in the data scarce Kohnak watershed (in southwest Iran) based on river discharges. The simulation was performed for the period from 1992 to 2009 by considering the first three years as warm up. Due to imperfect incomplete climate data, two solution methods, (1) combining CRU data with observed climate data, and (2) integrating expert knowledge in defining uncertainty parameter ranges in the calibrating period, were used to increase the model accuracy prediction. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were also performed to improve the model performance. Simulated water resources components of blue water flow, green water storage, and green water flow were evaluated at the subbasin scale. The results showed that with the applied solution methods, SWAT could satisfactorily predict discharge flows and water resource components in the Kohnak watershed. The spatial variabilities of blue and green waters were a function of the spatial variability of precipitation, soil depth, land cover type and slope. Both the blue and green water flows decreased from upstream to downstream. The green water storage was larger in the middle and lower subbasin. It indicates that these regions have relatively sufficient precipitation and green water resources, which are beneficial for the development of rain fed agriculture. This study showed that in data scarce watersheds, a SWAT model in combination with expert knowledge can be used as a suitable tool for water component prediction.

Yet their strategic contribution and the value they add remain unrecognised. Research purpose: The main objective of this research was to explore the extent to which HR practitioners are currently allowed to display HR competencies in the workplace, and whether any significant differences exist between perceived HR competencies, based on the respondents' demographic characteristics. Motivation for the study: Limited empirical research exists on the extent to which HR practitioners are allowed to display key competencies in the South African workplace. Research approach, design, and method: A quantitative research approach was followed. A Human Resource Management Professional Competence Questionnaire was administered to HR practitioners and managers (N = 481). Main findings: The results showed that HR competencies are poorly applied in selected South African workplaces. The competencies that were indicated as having the poorest application were talent management, HR metrics, HR business knowledge, and innovation. The white ethic group experienced a poorer application of all human research management (HRM) competencies compared to the black African ethnic group. Practical/managerial implications: The findings of the research highlighted the need for management to evaluate the current application of HR practices in the workplace and also the extent to which HR professionals are involved as strategic business partners. Contribution/value-add: This research highlights the need for the current application of HR competencies in South African workplaces to be improved.

J	Seresht, NG; Fayek, AR				Seresht, Nima Gerami; Fayek, Aminah Robinson			Career paths of tradespeople in the construction industry	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						construction industry; career paths; labour supply; human resource management; industry sectors; Alberta; chi-square; statistical correlation		Skilled labour shortages have been projected for Alberta's construction industry. As the career paths tradespeople follow significantly affect future supplies of skilled labour, this study explored the career paths of tradespeople in the provincial construction industry. Three major characteristics of the career paths of tradespeople were analyzed: first industry career stage, number of years spent in each stage, and number of projects worked on during each stage. Sector-based comparisons discovered that tradespeople in the industrial/pipeline sector progressed more quickly through some career stages. Analysis also revealed that in general, switching industry sectors during a career stage lengthens the duration of that stage. We also explored which factors affect construction tradespeople's career paths using a chi-square correlation test. Intergenerational differences were observed; a correlation between educational level and highest industry career stage was detected. Study findings will support the development of labour projections, educational programming, and human resources strategies.

J	Sewdass, N; du Toit, ASA				Sewdass, N.; du Toit, A. S. A.			Competitive intelligence in emerging economies: A comparative study between Brazil and South Africa	TD-THE JOURNAL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article						competitive intelligence; competitiveness; emerging economies; global economy; competitors; knowledge economy		Competitive intelligence (CI) has long been recognised as a strategic management tool that could enhance competitiveness. CI is expected to play an essential developmental role in emerging economies. The need to enhance companies' competitiveness has grown rapidly. CI is essential, and will increasingly be a challenge in the years to come, especially for emerging economies. This article will compare CI activities in South Africa with CI activities in Brazil. Companies in these two countries have faced increased environmental uncertainty and increasingly there is a need to compete. A questionnaire survey methodology was used where questionnaires were administered to CI experts in organisations in South Africa and Brazil. The findings of the study revealed that only a limited number of organisations in Brazil and South Africa recognise the importance of a CI unit. It was also interesting to note that the CI function is more mature in South Africa than in Brazil. As Brazil and South Africa become more integrated into the global economy, it stands to reason that the global economy will have more of an impact on the countries' economies. To this end it has become more crucial to monitor global events and trends and it is very important for both countries to develop a CI culture.

J	Siano, A; Palazzo, M				Siano, Alfonso; Palazzo, Maria			Tetra Pak Italy's ingredient branding: an exploratory case of strategic communication	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Communications; Communication management; Stakeholder analysis; Italy; Tetra Pak	ALLIANCES; STAKEHOLDERS; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on the role ingredient branding (IB) plays in shaping the strategic communications created by public relations/corporate communication departments of large organizations when managing crises. Design/methodology/approach - Starting from a literature review on strategic communication and IB the role of this activity is studied within the Italian context. In order to reach the aim of the paper, primary and secondary sources were exploited generating qualitative and quantitative data. The primary data were gathered though in-depth interviews with key management personnel while the secondary data were sourced from reports made available by Tetra Pak Italy. Findings - The study confirmed the contribution of the strategic proactive role played by Tetra Pak Italy managers of External Relations and Marketing Departments and the communication agency manager during a challenging period of crisis for the company. The main implication of the paper lies in the analysis of the important strategic work implemented by the external consultant of communication together with the External Relations and Marketing managers as members of the dominant coalition. Originality/value - The paper analyses a Tetra Pak Italy case study, as an exploratory case that could demonstrate how strategic communication - based on an IB campaign - is of fundamental importance during a period of crisis. Moreover, the research studied how proactive and effective the role played by the communication consultant and managers of External Relations and Marketing Departments was as a determinant of resulting outcomes.

It has been realised that customer lifetime models are industry dependent. The analysis of customer lifetime value is done with different customer value models. Recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) model is traditional used for market segmentation to detect patterns customers/buyers. In this research paper, a new customer centric analytical model has been proposed for an automobile industry. The paper explores new dimensions in the proposed model to determine the customer value and further by using data mining approach helps the management to build new strategic customer relationship model. The data mining technique association rule mining, direct hashing and pruning is used to generate rules and market patterns for the market management which in turn facilitates in effective and efficient decision making.

Critical moments in police-citizen reconciliation	POLICING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICE STRATEGIES & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Restoration; Police; Conflict transformation; Critical moments; Reconciliation; Relationship maintenance	RELATIONSHIP QUALITY; COMMUNITY; IDENTITY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the interaction of police and citizen representatives during critical moments in reconciliation processes through a relational model. Design/methodology/approach - Based on 26 in-depth interviews with key actors in three different cases of media-salient police-citizen group conflict, the interactions in the run-up to, during and after five moments that were critical in the transformation from conflict to cooperation, were analyzed. In focussing on the role of the intergroup relationship in conflict interaction, the applicability of relationship-value, compatibility and security in defining this relationship were explored. Findings - Although interactions during critical moments differed along the specific conflict contexts, three chronological stages could be deduced. In the first stage, interactions were tensed and emotional. During the second stage, repressing this insecurity through the exchange of value and compatibility signals was important. In the third stage, the transformation toward friendlier, cooperative dialogue and a less tensed atmosphere was made. Emotional expression, information sharing and emphasizing compatibility seemed particularly important in (re) defining and negotiating police-citizen relationships. Research limitations/implications - In analysis, the authors had to rely on limited and retrospective accounts of interactions and attitudes and its indivertible errors. Originality/value - This is one of very few studies that analyses police-involved post conflict interactions with a relational model. With regard to the importance of strong police-citizen relationships, the results should be of value to any operational police worker and specifically those who are involved in operational or strategic conflict-management and communication.

J	Tilaki, MJM; Hedayati, M				Tilaki, Mohammad Javad Maghsoodi; Hedayati, Massoomeh			Exploring barriers to the implementation of city development strategies (CDS) in Iranian cities A qualitative debate	JOURNAL OF PLACE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Iran; CDS; Strategic planning; Urban planning; Comprehensive plans		Purpose - The purpose of this article is to explore the barriers to the implementation of city development strategy (CDS) to achieve the goals in Iranian cities which have experienced rapid uncontrolled growth in recent decades. As comprehensive planning method has failed to tackle the challenges facing the cities, various recommendations have been made to employ the CDS as a successful method based on strategic urban planning to develop Iranian cities. Design/methodology/approach - This study is qualitatively conducted based on the primary and secondary data in which the primary data were obtained from 11 semi-structured interviews, while the secondary data were collected through a review of international theoretical studies, Iranian experimental research and reports. Findings - The findings of this study indicate five major barriers to the implementation of the Iranian urban planning process based on the CDS. These comprise the centralization of urban planning structure, coordination and relationship of agencies, financial resources, related laws and regulations and public participation. Originality/value - This study develops a compelling argument that what is missing from research on CDS is an examination of the potential barriers of CDS implementation, particularly in Iranian cities.

J	Truong, N; Nguyen, D; Hartley, N				Truong, Nguyen; Nguyen, Doan; Hartley, Nicole			Consumer social identity: cool and single or caring and attached	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						social identity; gender; ethnicity; congruency; media representation	ADVERTISING APPEALS; SELF-CONCEPT; MORAL IDENTITY; PRODUCT; CULTURE; DISTINCTIVENESS; GENDER; IMPACT; REPRESENTATION; SEPARATENESS	This research examines identity-based brand judgments by exploring consumers' preferences for the media environment and their ensuing perceptions of social identity congruence between themselves and media characters. Using lab experiments, we provide evidence that consumers regard brands differently when media characters are presented in a social environment versus an isolated environment, and that such variance is dependent on a consumer's key salient social identity dimensions: gender and ethnicity. Specifically, our evidence indicates that male and Western consumers prefer an isolated environment, whereas female and Asian consumers prefer a social environment. This preference translates to brand preferences and in some instances purchase intention. Further, when the branded product is identified as private, females and Asian consumers retain their preferences. This suggests that images of being cool and single in an isolated environment or caring and attached in a social environment should be tailored wisely for specific market segments.

J	Tsai, SP				Tsai, Shu-Pei			Dynamic marketing capabilities and radical innovation commercialisation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						radical innovation; commercialisation performance; dynamic marketing capabilities; innovative corporate culture	RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS; PERFORMANCE; CULTURE; ANTECEDENTS; CUSTOMER; MODEL; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; CONSEQUENCES; ADVANTAGE	Innovation research tends to deem marketing management does not occupy salient place of strategic significance in innovation policy formulation. More recently, strategic marketing scholars have begun to highlight marketing capabilities as an integral part to general dynamic capabilities to facilitate radical innovation commercialisation. However, comprehensive frameworks are still required in substantiating the strategic conduciveness of specific dynamic marketing capabilities to radical innovation commercialisation in the international technology-intensive sector. The current study develops and validates the radical innovation commercialisation model that reconfigures relevant theoretical conceptualisations and empirical verifications to narrow this gap. As the model reveals, innovative corporate culture drives radical innovation commercialisation of international technology-intensive firms directly as well as through the mediation of dynamic marketing capabilities. Most noteworthy, the mediated impact is proven almost equivalent to the direct impact, illustrative of the strategic role of dynamic marketing capabilities in facilitating radical innovation commercialisation for international technology-intensive firms.

J	Turner, C; Turner, KD				Turner, Craig; Turner, Kyle			Bringing Reality to "Real Options": An Experiential Exercise	JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS			English	Article						experiential exercise; gain context; loss context; pedagogy; risk		Issues surrounding the contextual environment in which strategic decisions are made are difficult concepts to grasp, particularly for undergraduate students with little business experience. They are also problematic for graduate students that have not been called on to make such decisions within their career. The authors propose an exercise that blends many elements of decision making under uncertainty and risk. Students are placed in an environment in which their own choice may differ from that of the team, but in which the team's performance will have explicit implications on their individual performance and rewards. The exercise incorporates team dynamics and problem-solving capabilities in a temporally and competitively constrained environment.

J	Weng, X				Weng, Xi			Dynamic pricing in the presence of individual learning	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY			English	Article						Learning; Experimentation; Strategic pricing; Exponential bandit; Good news case; Bad news case	STRATEGIC EXPERIMENTATION; UNCERTAINTY; CHOICE	This paper studies price dynamics in a setting in which a monopolist sells a new experience good over time to many buyers, and the seller can neither price discriminate among the buyers nor commit to a price rule. Buyers learn from their own experiences about the effectiveness of the product. Individual learning generates ex post heterogeneity, which affects the buyers' purchasing decisions, the monopolist's pricing strategy, and efficiency. When learning occurs through good news signals, buyers receive a rent because of the possible advantageous belief caused by short-lived deviations. If a good news signal arrives, the price can instantaneously increase or decrease depending on the arrival time of this signal. The equilibrium is inefficient because the monopolist's incentive to exploit known buyers leads to inefficient early termination of exploration.

This paper seeks to elaborate on the status quo of Chinese PV industry and, including the trait of low carbon, the development in China and the risks existed in Chinese PV industry. Then, a simulation of risks in the development of Chinese PV industry is done by employing evolutionary game and system dynamics. Finally, several resolutions are put forward to tackle these risks: 1) merging and re-organisation; 2) optimising incentive policies; 3) strategic alliance; 4) shifting market focus from Europe to Asian-Pacific region and domestic market; 5) adjusting industrial structure.

J	Xu, H; Giunchiglia, F				Xu, Hao; Giunchiglia, Fausto			SKO Types: an entity-based scientific knowledge objects metadata schema	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Semantic annotation; Entity oriented; Metadata schema; Scientific knowledge object		Purpose - This paper aims to propose an entity-based scientific metadata schema, i.e. Scientific Knowledge Object (SKO) Types. During the past 50 years, many metadata schemas have been developed in a variety of disciplines. However, current scientific metadata schemas focus on describing data, but not entities. They are descriptive, but few of them are structural and administrative. Design/methodology/approach - To describe entities in scientific knowledge, the theory of SKO Types is proposed. SKO Types is an entity-based theory for representing and linking SKOs. It defines entities, relationships between entities and attributes of each entity in the scientific domain. Findings - In scientific knowledge management, SKO Types serves as the basis for relating entities, entity components, aggregated entities, relationships and attributes to various tasks, e.g. linked entity, rhetorical structuring, strategic reading, semantic annotating, etc., that users may perform when consulting ubiquitous SKOs. Originality/value - SKO Types can be widely applied in various digital libraries and scientific knowledge management systems, while for the existing legacy of scientific publications and their associated metadata schemas.

Developing a Roadmapping System for Knowledge Management in an Organisation	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES			English	Article						Action research; Clinical inquiry; Information systems; Knowledge management; Technology roadmapping		This study aims to develop a roadmapping system that can be used as a knowledge management tool for any organization. The study employed a structured action research to test the implementation of the proposed roadmapping system in a real industrial environment. An internal facilitator collected data through a clinical inquiry approach. The output is a roadmapping system for knowledge management for an organisation, which enhances strategic capability. It also helps to capture and handle the complexities of business strategies in a simple way or that is easy to understand. The proposed roadmapping system was only tested on one firm. Pending further research, these findings should not be generalised. The proposed roadmapping system improves the capability of an organisation to plan and implement its strategies. The proposed system can be used for strategic planning and knowledge management - it allows managers to "kill two birds with one stone." Unlike conventional technology roadmapping (TRM) research that focuses more on the hard aspects of technical and economic elements, this study explores the soft aspects of knowledge management for improving the strategic capability of an organisation. This research has extended the traditional boundary of TRM to include effective information systems.	[Yee, C. L.; Teoh, K. G.

Strategic agility and smart manufacturing will continue to prevail in this and the upcoming decade. Time-based technologies, addressed in this paper, will pave the way for and will become the main pillars of the next generation intelligent manufacturing. In this study we investigate the synergistic impact of four time-based technologies on manufacturing competitive priorities. The analyses in this study are based on data collected from a sample of 122 companies in three industrial sectors in the USA. The results indicate that these four time-based technologies have a positive impact on the four dimensions of manufacturing competitive priorities of cost, quality, flexibility, and responsiveness. The implications of our study are discussed and suggestions for future research are offered.

J	Ahn, MJ				Ahn, Mark			Enhancing Corporate Governance in High-Growth Entrepreneurial Firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Governance; high growth companies; board of directors; advisory boards; entrepreneurship	TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS; AGENCY PROBLEMS; DIRECTORS; BOARD; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT	This study explores how new ventures access advice to achieve high growth and sustainable performance. A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources.

Leaf-feeding larvae attack crucifer and vegetable crops in greenhouses and fields. Here, we have studied a synthetic feeding deterrent, 1-allyloxy-4-propoxybenzene, and a botanical deterrent, neem (an extract from seeds of Azadirachta indica A. de Jussieu (Meliaceae)), in leaf disc choice bioassays with T. ni. We tested the two deterrents and the combination, and we found that the blend exhibits synergy between the two deterrents. We also tested the deterrents in assays with whole cabbage plants in ventilated enclosures and found that 1-allyloxy-4-propoxybenzene evaporated and, therefore, in that context addition of 1-allyloxy-4-propoxybenzene to neem did not enhance deterrence against T. ni.

Properties owned by General Directorate of Foundations (GDF) and by registered/fused foundations are known as foundation properties. According to current Foundations Law numbered 5737, like abolished Foundations Law numbered 2762, all duties, powers and responsibilities of foundation properties have been assigned to GDF. Based on Foundations Law, foundation properties have been evaluated via various land valuation methods. Foundations Law and GDF's Strategic Plan aim at increasing the income derived from foundation properties via good management of foundations and its properties.

A Methodology for Speeding up MVM for Regular, Toeplitz and Bisymmetric Toeplitz Matrices	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Matrix vector multiplication; Toeplitz; Data reuse; Memory management; SIMD; Data cache		The Matrix Vector Multiplication algorithm is an important kernel in most varied domains and application areas and the performance of its implementations highly depends on the memory utilization and data locality. In this paper, a new methodology for MVM including different types of matrices, i.e. Regular, Toeplitz and Bisymmetric Toeplitz, is presented in detail. This methodology achieves higher execution speed than the software state of the art library, ATLAS (speedup from 1.2 up to 4.4), and other conventional software implementations, for both general (SIMD unit is used) and embedded processors. This is achieved by fully and simultaneously exploiting the combination of software and hardware parameters as one problem and not separately.

In this work, we address the problem of reorganization in a distributed problem solving model as a typical multi-agent system application. We look into adaptation of concepts and theories from social organization theory. In particular, we get insights from Schwaninger's model of Intelligent Human Organizations. To this goal, we implement and utilize a multi-level organizational control model which uses a strategic management and an operative management layer to exert organizational control and also to make interactions between these two levels of control possible. Experimental evaluations are performed using a modified model of pursuit game. The results indicate that the proposed model allows the system to stay ahead of the organizational change, resulting in performance improvements, despite the additional costs associated to reorganization.

Updating the manager's toolbox: Mapping spatio-temporal trends in freshwater fishing	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Geocoding; License-based wildlife-associated recreation; Licenses; Freshwater fishing; Angler recruitment	HUMAN DIMENSIONS; RECREATION; PARTICIPATION; HEALTH; IMPACT	Wildlife-associated recreation is culturally and economically important, yet relative participation in the United States is declining. To address concerns of recreation managers, we present an innovative way to assess temporal trends and the spatial distribution of licensees in conjunction with demographic, economic, biophysical and social datasets. Geocoding license-based wildlife-associated recreation (i.e., fishing and hunting) provides a cost-effective strategy for monitoring spatio-temporal changes and learning about a community. We demonstrate this approach by calculating the retention, recruitment and loss of licensed freshwater recreational anglers in North Carolina between 2008 and 2010, and examining the demographic profile of areas with the greatest loss of anglers from 2008 to 2010. We describe how geocoding licenses can help assess the sustainability of a recreational fishery and the quality of fishing resources. Tracking trends in license purchases can provide recreation managers with insight to make informed decisions in recruitment strategies, and avert overuse or overcrowding. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS Geocoding of license information provides a cost-effective, widely-available technology to monitor spatial and temporal changes of licensed wildlife-associated recreationists. Changes in the spatial distribution of licensed anglers through time can provide insight into where recruitment and retention (e.g., outreach and advertising) are most needed. joining license data to biophysical, demographic and socioeconomic data in a spatial context can provide managers stronger information for strategic planning and investment (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Organizations and Governments are also actively launching KM projects to meet increasing needs of high quality and responsiveness. This interest has contributed to the development of various aspects of KM, but has also underscored a lack of e r ective methods, as evidenced by the sheer number of proposed approaches, along with a lingering scepticism about their relevance in practice. In this article, we argue for the necessity for a more global and high level analysis for orienting KM strategic planning and propose di r erent steps to go about it. We used an action research approach in the context of Quebec's e r orts in planning a global and integrated KM strategy for managing its water related knowledge. This research project shows that the proposed auditing approach provided a useful guide to identify critical issues and projects in KM planning, particularly in a complex and large- scale governmental environment.

J	Deserti, A				Deserti, Alessandro			Shaping the Identity of Italian Fashion Brands: The Role of Design between Tangible and Intangible	FASHION PRACTICE-THE JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVE PROCESS & THE FASHION INDUSTRY			English	Article						Italian fashion brands; brand identity management; brand design; design management		The aim of this article is to discuss the importance of managing the tangible and the intangible dimensions of brands as a whole, introducing a design perspective on branding in the fashion sector, and highlighting the opportunity of dynamically connecting the operative and the strategic levels of the brand identity management. The article focuses on Italian fashion brands, analyzed as paradigmatic cases and compared to the practices of other industrial sectors, to draw insights on the specificity of the fashion sectors. The article hypothesizes that design can play a relevant role in the construction and the management of brand identity, assuming both a generative and an interpretative perspective. In this frame, the design function should develop the capacity of building an overall strategic coherence of the elements of expression of the brands, overcoming some of the limitations and inefficiencies of established practices. In particular, the article highlights how in the case of Italian fashion brands the tangible dimension is in many cases inextricably connected to the manufacturing and craftsmanship background of the companies, that becomes one of the drivers and the constraints that the designer might assume to express the identity of the brand. This hypothesis is discussed by: (i) building background knowledge through a literature review in the fields of design and brand management, highlighting the limits of the current practices and introducing the knowledge that underpins the new integrated perspective; (ii) analyzing different cases of Italian fashion brands, to derive empirical evidence and key findings; (iii) commenting on the findings and connecting the theoretical framework with the empirical evidence coming from the cases, to build new knowledge and to stimulate future studies.

J	Thoren, K				Thoren, Kent			Towards an instrument for measuring strategic motives for corporate ventures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION			English	Article						strategy; corporate entrepreneurship; motives; intrapreneurship; corporate ventures; SMEs	ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PERFORMANCE; OPPORTUNITY; ENVIRONMENT; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; FIRMS	This article proposes that corporate entrepreneurship and strategy can be linked in a means-ends relationship if it is possible to determine the motives behind individual corporate ventures. To facilitate future empirical investigations, it develops an instrument for measuring such motives, and tests this instrument on a sample of 274 ventures in small and medium-sized enterprises. The findings confirm that most of the ventures examined are linked to strategic concerns. Moreover, the instrument design provides dimensions for motives rather than categories, because dimensions can be more freely evaluated and combined in future research, for instance in the form of venture motive profiles. The dimensions, obtained through factor analysis, are orientation in regard to sought effects (improving business or gaining competence), posture (offensive versus defensive) and adaptive style (proactive versus reactive). Researchers can benefit from the instrument in empirical work, and their findings can in turn be of value for both practitioners and policy makers.

Forgiveness in Vertical Relationships: Incentive and Termination Effects	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						relational contracts; forgiveness; vertical relationships; shadow of the future; formal contracts	INTERNET PORTAL ALLIANCES; TRANSACTION COST; IMPLICIT CONTRACTS; PRISONERS-DILEMMA; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; CONTROL RIGHTS; TRUST; COOPERATION; GOVERNANCE; INFORMATION	Two types of contractual solutions have been proposed for resolving incentive conflicts in vertical relationships: formal and relational (i.e., enforceable or not by third parties). Much is known about the optimal structure of formal contracts, but relatively little is known about the structure of relational contracts. We study a core feature of the latter: the conditions leading to continuation of the relationship, whose prospect gives relational contracts their force. We build a formal model of a vertical relationship between two parties that endogenizes the choice of the minimum performance necessary for continuation as a function of the values of contractibles, noncontractibles, and outside options. The model highlights a basic trade-off between providing strong incentives for the present (incentive effect) and safeguarding relationships for the future (termination effect). The stable relationships that follow from a more forgiving contract are more important under certain conditions (when a lot of value is jointly created by exchange partners, i.e., high contractible value, high noncontractible value, or unattractive outside options); however, strong incentives from a less forgiving contract are more important under other conditions (when a formal contract is insufficient and a relational contract is most important, i.e., high noncontractible relative to contractible value). We discuss implications for the choice of governance of interorganizational relationships.

J	Wang, X; Yang, J; Li, ZT; Li, HD				Wang, Xiao; Yang, Jing; Li, Zetao; Li, Handong			The energy-efficient group key management protocol for strategic mobile scenario of MANETs	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						MANETs; Group key management; Strategic mobile scenario; Mobile management model	AD-HOC NETWORKS; REPUTATION; ALGORITHM	Network security and its energy efficiency are facing tougher challenges for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) due to emerging purposive strategic internal attacks conducted by smart malicious nodes and unavoidable external attacks. Most of the current works investigated the group key management for scalability and efficiency performance in MANETs to defend the external attacks, while some works envisioned the intrusion detection system or trust management to defend the internal attacks. However, fewer related protocols or algorithms could combine them well to enhance dual security performance as well as energy efficiency in MANETs. To this end, we have proposed a novel group key management protocol with high energy efficiency for the strategic mobile scenario of MANETs, which is provided with three functions to address the issues of improving security and energy efficiency performance: (1) designing a self-organized group establishing algorithm for strategy mobile application scenarios to ensure stable groups in spite of users' mobility with reducing the cost of rekeying operation, (2) proposing a lightweight contributory key agreement and authentication mechanism based on the group Diffie-Hellman protocol for enhancing global security, and (3) researching a strategic mobile management mechanism based on the Prufer codec method handling the effect of mobility impacts to enhance the multicast energy efficiency and provide secret communication among roaming users in MANETs.

We have involved only property development professionals as participants in the experiment who have experience with the context. We have also extended the experiment into three different negotiation games distinguished by the availability of information to the participants: a negotiation game with incomplete information, asymmetric information, and complete information. We have found in this experiment that the availability of information could affect the plausibility to reach an agreement, particularly due to a restricted communication setting. This study also provides evidences that it is in the negotiators' concern to reach an agreement with a fair outcome, which is defined here as the equilibrium, regardless the availability of the information to them.

Data Analytics in the Hardwood Industry: The Impact of Automation and Optimization on Profits, Quality, and the Environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ANALYTICS			English	Article						Forest Industry; Green Information Systems; Optimization; Visualization		Numerous innovative technologies are available to assist the struggling hardwood lumber industry adapt to changing market demands and environmental concerns. However, most mill owners do not utilize automated lumber systems because they do not realize how substantial volume and value gains can be. Thus, there is a need to quantify improved efficiencies while also providing reliable information about how these measures translate into profitability for the mill. This study highlights new hardwood sawmill technologies, specifically in the areas of information systems and visualization technologies, and assesses the environmental impacts alongside the practicality of widespread application. Results from on-site testing were combined with other research in the field, concluding that properly applying visualization, optimization, and information technologies across the manufacturing process can significantly improve overall yield values. Combining engineering technologies with IS and strategic supply chain management leads to reduced waste and increased profits, benefiting local economies and forest resources across the globe.

J	Ippolito, A; Viggiani, V				Ippolito, Adelaide; Viggiani, Vincenzo			Positioning matrix of economic efficiency and complexity: a case study in a university hospital	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						university hospital; positioning matrix; complexity; efficiency; strategic planning	MARKET SHARE	At the end of 2010, the Federico II University Hospital in Naples, Italy, initiated a series of discussions aimed at designing and applying a positioning matrix to its departments. This analysis was developed to create a tool able to extract meaningful information both to increase knowledge about individual departments and to inform the choices of general management during strategic planning. The name given to this tool was the positioning matrix of economic efficiency and complexity. In the matrix, the x-axis measures the ratio between revenues and costs, whereas the y-axis measures the index of complexity, thus showing "profitability" while bearing in mind the complexity of activities. By using the positioning matrix, it was possible to conduct a critical analysis of the characteristics of the Federico II University Hospital and to extract useful information for general management to use during strategic planning at the end of 2010 when defining medium-term objectives.

Building Information Modeling using Hardware Genetic Algorithms with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building Information Modeling; Field Programmable Gate Arrays; Genetic Algorithm (GA); Parallel Architecture; Speed Gain; Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC); VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL)	DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION	Genetic algorithms (GAs) have found many applications in various fields such as physics, signal processing, artificial intelligence and recently construction engineering management. For a long time, GAs are usually criticized to be time-consuming, making it unpractical for real-time applications. This paper presents a new technique which can be used: (1) to automate construction activities, and (2) to improve building information modeling which has become an attractive research topic around the world. Different from the generic GA techniques employed in the literature, this paper proposes a new GA using hardware with field-programmable gate arrays. The proposed technique is shown to improve speed and lessen computational power. Hardware implementation of GA using static random access memory-based field-programmable gate arrays with synthesizable very hardware description language coding is introduced. Detailed analyses on the field-programmable gate arrays are given which show that it is suitable for real-time applications. As a result, GA is modified so that it can be implemented in series and parallel which can greatly improve computational hardware performance. Configuration of parallelization is available with a peripheral component interconnect interface, which further helps to form a fast optimization tool for real-time applications. The ultimate goal of this paper is thus to design an effective GA technique which can be employed to support building information modeling and to effectively automate critical processes in construction projects.

J	Milanes-Montero, P; Stone, C; Perez-Calderon, E				Milanes-Montero, Patricia; Stone, Chris; Perez-Calderon, Esteban			ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTING IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY: AN INTERNATIONAL ANALYSIS	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						environmental disclosure; hotels; performance; sustainability	DISCLOSURE; EXPLORATION; PERFORMANCE; LEGITIMACY	The hotel industry constitutes a major sector of the wider tourism industry and, in common with other industries, hospitality operations inevitably entail environmental impacts. Requirements for corporate financial reporting are commonplace, but public disclosure of the environmental effects of organizations' economic actions - referred to as environmental reporting - while generally only a voluntary commitment offers a potentially valuable contribution towards assessing the industry's global impacts. However, relatively little research has been published into environmental disclosure within the hospitality industry, and to address this lack of knowledge this paper examines that produced by the three hundred largest international hotel companies employing a content analysis methodology. Cluster analysis distinguishes hotel companies according to how they disclose (website, report, or both), the types and form of data disclosed, and other indicators including external certifications. A Logistic regression is used to examine correlations between these and the hotel chains' size, and culture (European, Anglo-Saxon, Asiatic, South American, African, Islamic), and each company's listing status. Study findings indicate the existence of a range of levels of commitment to environmental reporting within the sample studied, and the influence of corporative characteristics on the likelihood of environmental disclosure. In general, only the largest hospitality industry chains evince a comprehensive commitment to environmental reporting, their actions indicating strategic positioning in this respect compared with the more marketing-centric policies pursued by other hotel chains. A further finding of note is that European hotel chains are more likely than Anglo-Saxon or Asiatic ones to undertake environmental disclosure.

Intercell interference emerges as the key capacity-limiting factor in such dense networks, restricting the reusability of spectral resources. Therefore, advanced interference mitigation techniques relying on multi-cell cooperation have attracted significant attention from the wireless industry and academia. This paper discusses interference management schemes for multi-tiered spectrum access in next-generation HetNets. A novel scheme based on full system cognition and base station cooperation is proposed as an enabler for high-capacity HetNets. In addition, practical implementation and operational challenges are investigated.

J	Amasaka, K				Amasaka, Kakuro			New JIT, New Management Technology Principle	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						New JIT; advanced TDS; TPS and TMS; Toyota	CAE MODEL; RELIABILITY; DESIGN	The aim of this paper is to reassess the way management technology was carried out in the manufacturing industry and establish "New JIT, New Management Technology Principle". New JIT contains hardware and software systems as the next generation technical principles for accelerating the optimization of work process cycles of all the divisions. The first item, the hardware system, consists of the Total Development System (TDS), the Total Production System (TPS), and the Total Marketing System (TMS), which are the three core elements required for establishing new management technology principles for sales, R&D, design, engineering, and production, among others. For the second item, the strategic quality management system, the author is proposing "Science TQM, New Quality Management Principle" incorporating "Science SQC, New Quality Control Principle". To realize manufacturing that places top priority on customers with a good Quality, Cost, and Delivery (QCD) in a rapidly changing technical environment, the author proposes a high linkage model, employing a structured "inte-grated triple management technologies system - Advanced TDS, Advanced TPS, and Advanced TMS" for expanding "uniform quality worldwide and production at optimum locations".

EXIT DETERRENCE	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							EQUILIBRIUM; COMPETITION; NUMBER; PRICE; SEARCH	This paper is the first to provide a general context whereby potential entry can lead incumbent firms to permanently reduce the intensity of competition in a market. All previous results found that potential entry would lead to lower prices and greater competition. Examining markets where entry occurs by the acquisition of access rights from an existing incumbent, we demonstrate that, where competitive choices are strategic complements, a more efficient entrant may be unable to acquire those rights from a less efficient incumbent due to the unilateral accommodating behavior of the efficient incumbent. Similarly, such accommodating behavior may deter efficient investment by an incumbent. These results have implications as to how economists view potential entry and its benefits.

This report describes how a PERLC and a PERRC colocated at the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice responded to Los Angeles County Department of Public Health's (DPH's) request to improve emergency communications with limited English-proficient (LEP) populations. Methods/Activity: Activities included an assessment of training needs of the DPH preparedness workforce, a training series on social media and community engagement, and a toolkit of evidence-based findings to improve LEP populations' emergency communications and community resilience. Results/Outcomes: Most respondents to the training needs assessment considered themselves essential personnel during an emergency and stated that they have received proper training. Respondents would like to receive further emergency preparedness training, including additional clarity on their role during an emergency. The majority of participants rated the training series as excellent/very good and agreed that they will be able to apply the course content to their work. The percentage of participants who reported confidence in their knowledge and skills related to each course learning objective increased from the precourse survey to the postcourse survey. Discussion: This article discusses how the colocation of PERRC and PERLC offers efficiencies and expertise to accomplish multicomponent evidence-based requests. The ability to translate research findings quickly into evidence-based training and best practice resources is a strategic benefit to public health practice agencies working on emergency preparedness. Lessons Learned/Next Steps: LA County DPH was able to use knowledge and lessons learned gained from this work to design and prioritize education and training offerings to improve the capacity to effectively engage and communicate with LEP communities before and during public health emergencies.

This study aimed to identify the dimensions that compose the consumer behavior regarding the level of consciousness in the recycling of electronics products. This is a quantitative study, using multivariate analysis techniques such as factor analysis, cluster analysis and discriminant analysis. Data collection was conducted through a survey in loco with the 166 respondents. Five dimensions, which explain the practice of recycling of e-waste, were identified: strategic actions of firms, benefits generated by recycling, barriers to the practice of recycling, the presence of recycling points and recycling motivation. From the dimensions found, the subjects were divided into two groups, those that are more likely and those who are less likely to contribute to the recycling of e-waste with high discrimination power. It was concluded that awareness about e-waste is understood in different ways and that, despite the contribution be seen as socially acceptable as is rarely practiced.				fernandopcmm@gmail.com; sofiasbf@gmail.com; samassaini@gmail.com	Ferraz, Sofia/ABH-5965-2020				CARPANEZ J, SAIBA QUE FAZER HORA; CELINSKI T.

J	Fisch, JH; Ross, JM				Fisch, Jan Hendrik; Ross, Jan-Michael			Timing Product Replacements under Uncertainty-The Importance of Material-Price Fluctuations for the Success of Products That Are Based on New Materials	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; REAL OPTIONS; MATERIAL SUBSTITUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; INNOVATION; MARKET; INVESTMENT; ENTRY	Being first to market with new products is one of the most enduring pieces of strategic advice handed to managers. This view also emphasizes the importance of launching new products that are based on new materials as soon as possible. However, when the input costs of products that embody new materials are uncertain because of volatile material prices, the advantage of being an early mover comes along with the risk of paying unexpectedly high material prices. Real-option theory suggests delaying material substitution under uncertainty even if the new material enables superior product performance. Firms who have created the flexibility to switch between alternative inputs can benefit from responding to opportunities or threats that arise from changes in the environment. The current study formalizes this logic in a switching-option model and tests it on a sample of material substitution projects from the manufacturing sector. Our findings shed light on how input-cost fluctuations influence the timing-performance relationship and bring into question the common advice to launch new products as soon as possible. Instead, our results suggest that firms who align the timing of market launch to trends and fluctuations of material prices improve their competitive positions. These insights suggest novel ways for new product development (NPD) managers how to successfully use external information at the back-end of the NPD process and how to compete in an era defined by volatile material prices and technological change.

This kind of pollution is generated by all kinds of means of transport. One of its peculiarities is the repercussion it has on people, unlike the other types of pollution, i.e.: water pollution, air pollution, soil pollution, which can affect, to a certain extent, the entire environment. The phonic pollution is considered to be the most widely spread type. The numerous surveys made on different samples in urban areas place phonic pollution, or generically called "noise", at the top of the list of annoyances or disturbances. The main polluter is the road transport. Even since 2006, Romania has started to monitor phonic pollution as a result of road transport. The measure was taken in order to comply with the European Union regulations. The present paper presents acoustic strategic mapping using a Geographic Information System and GIS type database. There is a need to map noise to minimize the negative impact on the environment of the small vehicles, as well as of the heavy traffic.

J	Koivu, M; Pennanen, T				Koivu, Matti; Pennanen, Teemu			Return Dynamics of Index-Linked Bond Portfolios	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Bond returns are known to exhibit mean reversion, auto-correlation, and other dynamic properties that differentiate them from stock returns. Index-linked bonds bring in further characteristics that complicate the task of modeling returns over time. Such models are essential, however, in strategic portfolio analysis and quantitative risk management. This article shows that the modeling of index-linked bond portfolios can be reduced to statistical modeling of the portfolio's yield to maturity and the underlying index. For these quantities, many well-established models already exist. Using historical data from 12 different markets, the authors show that the two risk factors consistently explain more than 98% of monthly return variations over the past decade, including the recent financial crisis.

Zambrano			A new dimension in urban planning: the Big Data as a source for shared indicators of discomfort.	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANNING PRACTICE			English	Article								The web has been used for years as a means of expression for the local communities in highlighting their problems, needs and hopes, often in the form of organized group discussions and fora. The enormous amount of information currently available, Big Data, is already used for business purposes in the private sector, but has never been truly available to decision makers who operate in urban planning and would represent an invaluable help for those communities that undertake the path of self-construction of their Community Strategic Frameworks. This paper elaborates methodological and operational proposals to identify sequences of words and common occurrences in sets of documents that would help understanding the problems of the communities on a geographically-located basis, creating the search engine "Social Debate" and devising new indicators for indices of disadvantage. Such tool could drastically change the perspective of public participation and planning practice and improve the quality of local public policies and decision making processes.

Goal Orientation and Preparation Process in Online Reverse Auctions: A Comparative Investigation Taking a Transaction Cost Economics Lens	TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL			English	Article						Online reverse auctions; transaction cost economics (TCE); industrial buyer behavior; strategic sourcing; goal orientation; preparation process	ELECTRONIC COMMERCE; SUPPLIER SELECTION; SERVICE PROVIDERS; INDUSTRIAL BUYERS; E-BUSINESS; INFORMATION; LOGISTICS; IMPACT; MODEL; STRATEGIES	While online reverse auctions (ORAs) have become a popular tool to conduct business-to-business procurement, academic research and practical guidance are still limited in delineating salient differences to offline procurement, specifically as these pertain to the corporate buyer's goal orientation and preparation process preceding the negotiations. This article focuses on these fundamental dimensions characterizing the strategic sourcing approach, and contrasts their pursuit in ORAs and offline procurement. We consider a multi-item request for quotation (RFQ) and investigate the dimensions of price competitiveness and risk reduction as part of a buyer's goal orientation, and the aspects of information search and extent of analysis as part of the buyer's preparation process. Drawing on tenets from transaction cost economics, complemented with the literature in industrial buyer behavior, we theorize that the goal of price competitiveness is pursued to a greater degree in ORAs, whereas the goal of risk reduction is pursued to a greater degree in offline procurement. Furthermore, we suggest that both information search and extent of analysis are greater in ORAs than in offline procurement. These contentions are tested with data collected from 825 procurement professionals. Various robustness checks and exploratory extensions taking into account contingency factors are conducted. Our primary contributions lie in the provision of a theoretically grounded framework contrasting ORAs to offline procurement along the dimensions of a buyer's goal orientation and preparation process, and the empirical test with a large-scale survey focusing on the unique context of multi-item RFQ.s. Insights for academic theory and managerial practice are discussed.

J	Trevor, J; Brown, W				Trevor, Jonathan; Brown, William			The Limits on Pay as a Strategic Tool: Obstacles to Alignment in Non-Union Environments	BRITISH JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS			English	Article							HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY	Strategic human resource management literature emphasizes the potential of pay to secure strategically desirable employee outcomes for the employer. Strategic pay, in contrast with pluralist models of pay determination, assumes an absence of collective bargaining constraints. This article analyses the process of determination of non-unionized managerial, professional and technical pay in seven leading consumer goods firms that claim to use pay as a strategic tool. It demonstrates that implemented pay practice is often remote from what is aspired to strategically. Despite the absence of collective bargaining constraints, there remain unavoidable obstacles to the ability of management to implement pay systems aligned to strategic goals. These constraints impose fundamental limitations on the use of pay as a strategic tool.

Osaka University has been proactive in discussions about the relationship between nanotechnology and society as part of graduate and continuing education programs. These programs are intended to fulfill the social accountability obligation of scientists and corporations involved in R&D, and to deepen their understanding of the relationship between science and society. To meet those aims, the program has covered themes relating to overall public engagement relating to nanotechnology governance, such as risk management of nanomaterials, international standardization for nanotechnology, nanomeasurement, intellectual property management in an open innovation environment, and interactive communication with society.

We show how key risk management activities can be embedded within a carefully developed risk construct that offers both theoretical and practical content. We support our work using data from a large sample survey and evidence how risk can accumulate in a project; show which risk mitigation strategies are likely to be used in practice and over which risk areas of the risk construct; and report a new finding concerning the strategic responses to technical failure in projects.

Free housing for declining populations: Optimizing the provision ofartificial breeding structures	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION			English	Article						Artificial warrens; European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus; Food availability; Habitat management; Predator limitation by fencing; Reproduction; Restockings	RABBIT ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS; EUROPEAN WILD RABBIT; DONANA-NATIONAL-PARK; NEST-BOX; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; LIFE-HISTORIES; SITE SELECTION; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT	The improvement of habitat quality and reproductive success through the implementation of artificial breeding structures is one of the most widespread in situ conservation strategies applied to the recovery of declining wildlife populations. Several past studies have monitored the use of artificial breeding structures in the wild, but virtually none of them have investigated which demographic and environmental factors actually determine their effectiveness in facilitating reproductive success. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify those factors influencing breeding success in artificial structures. With this purpose we surveyed a declining population of a keystone species of Mediterranean ecosystems, namely the European wild rabbit. In Donana National Park, we sampled during the course of two years the breeding success of wild rabbits from 47 artificial warrens, experimentally provided under different demographic and environmental conditions. In order to determine the relative importance of such factors, we applied an AIC model selection procedure to alternative biological hypothesis groups, postulating that breeding success in artificial structures would primarily depend on population density, food availability and/or predator limitation. We found that the efficiency of artificial warrens in facilitating rabbit reproductive success can vary, with an increase associated with greater pasture availability. Predator limitation by fencing also positively affected rabbit reproduction, but only in combination with high pasture availability. On their own, fencing treatment and population reinforcements had low and null effectiveness facilitating reproduction, respectively, as well as entailing significant economic and biological costs. The best way to improve breeding success in artificial structures, therefore, was through their strategic placement in potential high-quality habitats, i.e. with suitable pasture availability. We suggest that vegetation management can effectively increase carrying capacity and consequently the target species' reproductive success, especially in fast breeding species like the European wild rabbit. The provision of artificial breeding structures for conservation purposes may significantly benefit from the elaboration of concurrent experimental studies similar to the present research, which can help establish useful guidelines for optimizing future conservation efforts.

Combined reverse engineering and CAD approach for mould modelling in casting simulation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CAST METALS RESEARCH			English	Article						Reverse engineering; Sand casting; 3D CAD modelling; FEM; Mesh	NUMERICAL-SIMULATION	Casting process simulation is nowadays established as a strategic tool in process optimisation to improve product quality. However, sometimes the required three-dimensional mathematical model of the casting is not available, because the original drawings are not-up-to date and parts are subjected to design changes. In these cases, reverse engineering (RE) is the most suitable method to reconstruct the geometrical model of the casting. In this paper, a RE-based procedure is proposed to obtain the three-dimensional CAD model of a casting from its physical equipment. The proposed procedure involves four phases: pre-digitising, digitising of equipment parts, surface reconstruction, and three-dimensional CAD modelling. An aeronautical part fabricated by sand casting is selected as case study to verify the feasibility of this approach. Outcomes prove that the RE methodology is adequate to virtually reconstruct the geometry of each single part of the equipment as well as the whole geometry of the assembled mould.

J	Shepherd, RK; Pryke, SD				Shepherd, Richard K.; Pryke, Stephen D.			Regional rail planning; a study of the importance of 'steering' and 'pragmatism' in stakeholder networks	EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Social network analysis; Railways; Regional planning; SNA with semi-structured interviews; Policy networks; Strategic management; Steering; Pragmatism		This paper investigates the significance of networks in regional rail planning and how these networks can help regional planners meet the needs of local stakeholders. The research question focuses on the identification of the relative importance of three core factors in regional planning - communicative discourse, steering and environment. A case study of the Highlands and Islands region of Scotland was studied, with qualitative data analysed by triangulation through semi-structured interviews and social network analysis (SNA). Investigation revealed a loose network of communicative discourse supported by a dense network of key individuals. Communicative discourse was found to be guided by the direct relationships shared between regional stakeholders. These direct relationships established the trust, permanence and confidentiality underlying the collaborative planning exhibited in the region. Direct relationships were found to guide discourse primarily through a process of conflict resolution emphasising pragmatism and respect for the relationships established by others. This was found more likely in sparsely populated regions where steering by an individual or group is more common and accepted. Acceptance of steering within a spirit of inclusion and local legitimacy serves to facilitate social networks in planning in a way unavailable in more urbanised and smaller, less coordinated community environments. Research in this area is likely to prove increasingly relevant in the context of the divergence between Scottish and English planning policy, and suggestions are made with regard both to policy-makers and those seeking to establish practical models for policy networks.

Morton			A series of unfortunate events: how the battle to save an urban wetland was both won and lost	TD-THE JOURNAL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article						urban wetlands; EIAs; eco-crusaders; public participation		Many urban wetlands in South Africa are either lost or degraded in the name of development. Of those remaining, most are less than pristine, even canalised, dredged, drained or filled. This is partly because urban wetlands are often found in strategic locations, and, as such are considered prime development land. A typical example is that of the Libradene Wetland, in Boksburg, Gauteng, which was partially destroyed by an attempt to construct a petrol station on it. This study explores how and why the fate of this particular wetland was sealed. The study explored the roles of the developer, the professionals in the paid services of the developer and various government officials. Although construction in the wetland eventually ceased, no one has been brought to book and no rehabilitation has taken place. The study concluded that although South African wetlands are well protected by legislation [the National Environmental Management Act (107 of 1998); the Environmental Conservation Act (73 of 1989) and the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act (43 of 1983)] the assumption is that developers will comply. If they don't, then enforcement is difficult. In this case enforcement was slow, during which time the developer continued building and the result was significant degradation. The study makes a number of recommendations: (i) the fragmented administration of environmental legislation pertaining to wetlands should be consolidated under one government department; (ii) relationships between the respective authorities at all government levels needs strengthening; (iii) public participation processes need to be more robust and (iv) the national wetlands database needs to be used more effectively.

J	Tao, HY; Morris, TF; Bravo-Ureta, BE; Meinert, R				Tao, Haiying; Morris, Thomas F.; Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.; Meinert, Richard			Factors Affecting Manure Applications as Directed by Nutrient Management Plans at Four Connecticut Dairy Farms	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							CONSERVATION PRACTICES; SOIL; ADOPTION; PHOSPHORUS; FERTILIZER; WASTE; YIELD	Distribution of manure on a farm is constrained by strategic, tactical, and operational factors and can be optimized by use of a nutrient management plan (NMP). Variables affecting a farmer's choice to implement manure recommendations can be identified by econometric models. Probit and feasible generalized least squares multiple regression models for panel data were fitted using 4 to 5 yr of field-by-field records of manure applications from four dairy farms in Connecticut. The results of the models showed that the farmers' decisions about manure applications were significantly affected by a common factor: the distance from the manure storage lagoon to the field. Other factors, including field ownership, field size, crop, soil test P, recommended manure application, fertilizer N and P applications, and N and P requirements for crop growth, also significantly affected some of the farmers' decisions about manure distribution. Identification of the factors affecting a farmer's decision is important for NMP planners and policymakers for developing more feasible and adoptable NMPs while minimizing the negative effects of land application of manure. This research illustrates how to use and interpret econometric models to analyze the decisions farmers make when they face two alternatives: a traditional practice or an improved NMP.

A National Rectal Cancer Summit was convened in August 2013 to discuss management of rectal cancer in the New Zealand context, to highlight controversies and discuss domestic priorities for the future. This paper summarises the priorities for treatment, research and policy for rectal cancer services in New Zealand identified as part of the Summit in August. The following priorities were identified: - Access to high-quality information for service planning, review of outcomes, identification of inequities and gaps in provision, and quality improvement - Engagement with the entire sector, including private providers - Focus on equity - Emerging technologies - Harmonisation of best practice - Importance of multidisciplinary team meetings In conclusion, improvements in outcomes for patients with rectal cancer in New Zealand will require significant engagement between policy makers, providers, researchers, and patients in order to ensure equitable access to high quality treatment, and strategic incorporation of emerging technologies into clinical practice. A robust clinical information framework is required in order to facilitate monitoring of quality improvements and to ensure that equitable care is delivered.

Learning in Unknown Reward Games: Application to Sensor Networks	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						potential games; learning in games; distributed optimization	EQUILIBRIA	This paper demonstrates a decentralized method for optimization using game-theoretic multi-agent techniques, applied to a sensor network management problem. Our first major contribution is to show how the marginal contribution utility design is used to construct an unknown-reward potential game formulation of the problem. This formulation exploits the sparse structure of sensor network problems, and allows us to apply a bound to the price of anarchy of the Nash equilibria of the induced game. Furthermore, since the game is a potential game, solutions can be found using multi-agent learning techniques. The techniques we derive use Q-learning to estimate an agent's rewards, while an action adaptation process responds to an agent's opponents' behaviour. However, there are many different algorithmic configurations that could be used to solve these games. Thus, our second major contribution is an extensive evaluation of several action adaptation processes. Specifically, we compare six algorithms across a variety of parameter settings to ascertain the quality of the solutions they produce, their speed of convergence and their robustness to pre-specified parameter choices. Our results show that they each perform similarly across a wide range of parameters. There is, however, a significant effect from moving to a learning policy with sampling probabilities that go to zero too quickly for rewards to be accurately estimated.

J	Dubocage, E; Galindo, G				Dubocage, Emmanuelle; Galindo, Geraldine			Understanding founder-CEO's replacement in venture-backed companies: A theoretical and empirical analysis	EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						CEO's replacement; Venture capitalist; Start-up; Agency theory; Entrenchment theory; Resource-based view; Cognitive governance perspective; Dynamic capabilities approach	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; FIRM; KNOWLEDGE; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; SUCCESSION	This research provides an accurate picture of situations in which founder-CEOs are replaced (or not) by venture capitalists. Our analysis aims to go further than the schematic case of the founder being simply dismissed by investors in a conflictual context. We first review the literature dedicated to this subject in the light of the agency theory (AT) and the resource-based view (RBV). However, the limits of these theoretical frameworks lead us to investigate their extensions: the entrenchment theory (ET), the dynamic capabilities approach (DCA) and the cognitive governance perspective (CGP). In a second phase, in order to decode the replacement process, we designed an exploratory methodology based on qualitative data, thus deepening our understanding of the issues it entails in venture-backed companies. Finally, this field analysis allows us to build a typology of replacement scenarii, with each scenario being interpreted by combining relevant theories to explain all aspects of it. In line with the AT, the ET focuses on the FCs strategy to retain their position. The DCA analyses the CEOs' resources from a dynamic angle, in accordance with the RBV. The CGP is mobilised to characterise a conflict originating in a lack of skills. These results lead us to rethink the role of time and the nature of conflicts in the relationships between FCs and venture capitalists. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gnjidic, V				Gnjidic, Vladimir			RESEARCHING THE DYNAMICS OF MILES AND SNOW'S STRATEGIC TYPOLOGY	MANAGEMENT-JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT ISSUES			English	Article								The research conducted on medium and large companies in the Croatian food and beverage industry confirms the presence of all four strategic types originally set by R.E. Miles and C.C. Snow. The strategic orientation of a company is determined through three periods (past, present, future), identifying also the dominant, holistic strategic type. A questionnaire designed by Conant et al. (1990) is used to reveal company's strategic type. The classification power of the questionnaire is further increased by introducing a quasi-numerical measure. The industry is dominated by the defender (34%) and analyzer (27%) strategic types of the holistic company behavior. The theoretically assumed (dominant) stability of strategic orientation of a company is confirmed with a high proportion of strategic change (44%). The dominant source of strategic change comes from companies applying the defender strategic orientation, while the dominant destination of strategic change is the analyzer strategic type. Within the companies that change their strategic orientation over the three periods, specific forms of strategic changes as well as the share of their presence have been identified.

J	Papa, R; Gargiulo, C; Zucaro, F				Papa, Rocco; Gargiulo, Carmela; Zucaro, Floriana			URBAN SYSTEMS AND ENERGY CONSUMPTIONS A CRITICAL APPROACH	TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Energy consumption; Holistic approach; Urban texture and energy; Urban form		City transformations are also due to the development of new energy sources, which have influenced economy and lifestyles, as well as the physical and functional organization of urban systems. Cities are the key place where it is need to act for the achievement of strategic environmental objectives, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy saving. The hard resolution of these challenges depends on several factors: their multidimensional nature, the change of the economic and settlement development model, and also the complexity of the relationships between the elements that constitute the urban systems and that affect energy consumption. According to this awareness the Project Smart Energy Master for the energy management of territory financed by PON 04A2_00120 R&C Axis II, from 2012 to 2015 has been developed: it is aimed at supporting local authorities in the development of strategies for the reduction of energy consumption through actions designed to change behavior (in terms of use and energy consumption) and to improve the energy efficiency of equipment and infrastructure. With the goal of describing some of the results of the methodological phase of this project, this paper proposes a review of the major studies on the issue of energy consumption at the urban scale in the first section; in the second section the outcomes of the first phase of the development of the comprehension/interpretive model related to the identification of the set of physical/environmental variables at urban scale, that most affect the energy consumption, are described; the third makes a critical review of the reference scientific literature, characterised by a too sectoral approach, compared to the complexity of the topic.

Besides, aspects of organizational culture and knowledge management are equally important for corporate success. All the above areas have a growing number of studies that seek to deepen reflections providing a greater understanding of their environmental relationship. Brazilian human resource management has shown years of late progress, especially due to the prevailing macroeconomic conditions, with no transformation evidences This current study with a theoretical-descriptive qualitative approach through literature analysis, study the integration model proposed by Chen and Huang (2009). The mediating role of knowledge management to strategic human resource practices and innovation performance presented by these authors are compared with national and international literature. The integration conceptual model proposed to apply in the Brazilian context, consider three pillars presented by the Eastern authors, enhanced by cross-checks prospects with intellectual capital approaches, representing the Western authors' contributions. Henceforth, we aim to provide a suitable proposal for this model in the Brazilian organizational context.

Plant community composition and chemical properties of soil samples were compared to investigate the relationship between soil and species diversity, and the richness in Tibetan alpine grasslands. Results showed that species diversity was significantly positively related to soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) in the high alpine grasslands. Margalef's species richness index was also significantly positively related to SOM, TN, AN, and TP. Most soil chemical properties showed significantly positive correlation with species diversity and Margalef's richness index. Our results suggested that higher plant species richness index and diversity occurred in more fertile soil habitats in high altitude natural grassland community. In practice, fertilization management for the restoration of degraded grassland should be conducted with reference to the nutrient levels of natural grassland without the additional artificial fertilizer and with higher species-diversity and richness index.

J	Baldwin, K; Mahon, R				Baldwin, Kimberly; Mahon, Robin			A PARTICIPATORY GIS FOR MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING IN THE GRENADINE ISLANDS	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES			English	Article						Participatory GIS (PGIS); marine spatial planning (MSP); transboundary Grenadine Islands		Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a strategic way of improving decision-making and delivering an ecosystem approach to managing human activities in the marine environment. Notwithstanding the central role of human agency in these approaches, it is recognised that many times marine management has not been effective in part due to a failure to use all available sources of information and knowledge, particularly the local knowledge of the resources' users. The transboundary Grenadine Islands, which rely heavily on the marine environment for livelihoods, provide an example of a complex system where there is a high diversity of uses and all available information is needed for effective management. We illustrate how a participatory GIS approach can be applied as a sound basis for practically incorporating an ecosystem approach within marine spatial planning initiatives. Key benefits include effective data management, increased spatial understanding and the definition of critical areas across the Grenada Bank. We found the application of a PGIS approach to support spatially-based ecosystem-level analyses of the Grenada Bank to be conducted and presented in ways that could be expected to increase stakeholder understanding of information generated thus supporting marine governance.

J	Kelefouras, V; Kritikakou, A; Goutis, C				Kelefouras, Vasilios; Kritikakou, Angeliki; Goutis, Costas			A methodology for speeding up edge and line detection algorithms focusing on memory architecture utilization	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Data reuse; Data cache; Assosiativity; FPGA; Memory management; Tiling; Canny; Hough	OPTIMIZATION; TRANSFORM	In this paper, a new methodology for speeding up edge and line detection algorithms is presented, achieving improved performance over the state of the art software library OpenCV (speedup from 1.35 up to 2.22) and other conventional implementations, in both general and embedded processors, by reducing the number of load/store and arithmetic instructions, the number of data cache accesses and data cache misses in memory hierarchy and the algorithm memory size. This is achieved by fully exploiting the combination of the software and hardware parameters which are considered simultaneously as one problem and not separately. Furthermore, the edge and line detection algorithms have been simplified for a computer vision application in a Virtex-5 Xilinx FPGA using Microblaze soft processor (detection and measurement of flow fronts in a microfluid device); it achieves speedup up to 660 times in comparison with conventional software implementations.

The success of these massive courses is based on involving students to acquire knowledge and skills in a wider community by learning from others and using active learning practices. MOOC providers also help universities to support the mission of transferring knowledge to society in any kind of area, supporting lifelong learning and adopting some kind of internationalization strategy. This is an ongoing trend where 17 of top 30 universities in the world's adopted MOOC courses. Open learning is a strategic and valuable trend in knowledge society. Opportunities appear in the Anglo and Latin American market, while problems associated with the high drop-out rate, the sustainability, and the feasibility of skill certification should be addressed.

J	Wu, CI				Wu, Chun-I			Expanding the Knowledge Capability of Suppliers through Supplier Development Programs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Capability Enhancing; Center-satellite supply chain; Knowledge creation; SECI modes and ba; Supplier development	CHAIN; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; TOYOTA; TRUST; FIRM	As firms increasingly outsource to focus on their core competencies, effective supplier development has become a major strategic decision in order to maintain a network of competent suppliers. Supplier development can be seen as a capability-enhancing activity that an organization undertakes to improve its suppliers' performance. This study conceptualizes supplier development as a knowledge-intensive and collaborative program, and explores how knowledge creation processes can be facilitated through different supplier development activities. A qualitative inquiry with a thematic analysis that focuses on five companies that are the suppliers of the largest motorcycle firm in Taiwan is presented in order to identify how different supplier development activities facilitate the knowledge creation process through the SECI modes and ba. The results show that these supplier development activities facilitate different types of knowledge conversion processes that can expand the knowledge capability of suppliers in a so-called center-satellite supply chain.

J	Agbo, M				Agbo, Maxime			Strategic exploitation with learning and heterogeneous beliefs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Learning; Beliefs; Optimism; Riskiness	INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS; UNCERTAINTY; RESOURCE; GROWTH; IRREVERSIBILITY; EQUILIBRIUM; COMMONS	We study the effect of learning with heterogeneous beliefs on the exploitation of a renewable common-pool resource. To that end, we extend the Great Fish War model of Levhari and Mirman (1980) to a learning environment in which several agents interact strategically and learn about the distribution of the stochastic evolution of the resource. We find that the effect of anticipation of learning with heterogeneous beliefs is twofold. First, the anticipation of learning makes future payoffs more uncertain, which induces the agents to decrease present exploitation due to the precautionary motive. Second, under heterogeneity of beliefs, there is a differential informational externality that induces the agents to increase or decrease present exploitation. We also perform a comparative analysis on the Cournot-Nash equilibrium with learning by studying the effect of optimism and riskiness on resource exploitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Stafford, J; Newport, D; Grimes, R				Stafford, Jason; Newport, David; Grimes, Ronan			A Compact Modeling Approach to Enhance Collaborative Design of Thermal-Fluid Systems	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING			English	Article							DELPHI; WORLD	This paper presents an approach for reducing detailed numerical models of electronic equipment into compact thermal-fluid models. These compact models have been created using network analogies representing mass, momentum and energy transport to reduce computational demand, preserve manufacturer intellectual property, and enable software independent exchange of information between supplier and integrator. A strategic approach is demonstrated for a steady state case from reduction to model integration within a global environment. The compact model is robust to boundary condition variation by developing a boundary condition response matrix for the network layout. A practical example of electronic equipment cooled naturally in air is presented. Solution times were reduced from similar to 10(0) to similar to 10(-3) CPU hours when using the compact model. Nodal information was predicted with O(10%) accuracy compared to detailed solutions. For parametric design studies, the reduced model can provide 1800 solutions in the same time required to run a single detailed numerical simulation. The information generated by the reduction process also enhances collaborative design by providing the equipment integrator with ordered initial conditions for the equipment in the optimization of the global design. Sensitivity of the compact model to spatial variations on the boundary node faces has also been assessed. Overall, the compact modeling approach developed extends the use of compact models beyond preliminary design and into detailed phases of the product design lifecycle.

J	Ushijima, T; Schaede, U				Ushijima, Tatsuo; Schaede, Ulrike			The market for corporate subsidiaries in Japan: An empirical study of trades among listed firms	JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES			English	Article						Subsidiary; Acquisition; Divestiture; Strategic repositioning; Japan	ASSET SALES; MERGERS; PERFORMANCE; ACQUISITIONS; GAINS; DIVERSIFICATION; LIQUIDITY; RETURNS; COSTS	We investigate trades of wholly- or partially-owned subsidiaries between firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) for the years 1996-2010, to explore the economic impact in terms of strategic refocusing, stock market valuation and performance effects. By pairing both sides to each deal, we show differences in firm characteristics, returns, and subsequent performance of buying and selling firms. Unlike mergers between whole firms, most subsidiary deals straddled different industries. Most sellers were larger, more diversified and less profitable than buyers. Our event study reveals that abnormal returns were positive for buyers yet insignificantly different from zero for sellers. However, subsidiary sales in the core business earned negative returns, the more so the larger the deal. An analysis of ex-post operating results shows that the performance of sellers often declined after the trade, in particular for firms that divested a core-related subsidiary. We conclude that subsidiary trades in Japan in this period contributed importantly to strategic repositioning and a more efficient use of corporate assets. J. Japanese Int. Economies 31(2014)36-52.

J	Chiu, TF				Chiu, Tzu-Fu			A proposed IPC-based clustering method for exploiting expert knowledge and its application to strategic planning	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						IPC-based clustering; link analysis; patent data; strategic planning; thin-film solar cell	VECTOR-SPACE MODEL; PATENT RETRIEVAL; VALIDATION; INFORMATION; ALGORITHMS; LINK	In order to exploit the professional knowledge of the patent office examiners (implied in the IPC assignment) in the clustering process, a modified method (IPC-based clustering) has been proposed and applied to strategic planning. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparison with two existing methods: K-Means and TwoStep of SPSS Clementine using the DB index and Dunn index. Afterwards, the IPC-based clustering (accompanied by link analysis) was applied to a practical domain (strategic planning) using the patent data of thin-film solar cell, so as to understand the possibility of implementing it in the management areas. According to the experimental results, the technical topics have been identified, and suggested strategies for companies have been generated for assisting the decision-making of top management. Finally, in future work the proposed method will be employed to other kinds of patent data to test its performance and applied to other practical domains to examine its feasibility in different management areas.

J	Metcalfe, L; Lapenta, A				Metcalfe, Les; Lapenta, Antonio			Partnerships as strategic choices in public management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Partnerships; Strategic management; Power-role analysis; Strategic choice; Public management		Partnerships are not new phenomena in public administration. However, there is now a more explicit recognition that managing public policy networks involves partnerships within and across policy fields and linking interdependent levels of government nationally and internationally. The aim of this paper is to widen the scope of strategic choice in designing partnerships in public management by developing an alternative approach: the Power-Role Analysis. As the term suggests, Power-Role Analysis uses distinctions between types of power and the roles and relationships corresponding with them to clarify and define different forms of partnership. Power-role analysis provides a basis for considering systematically the problems that arise in managing partnerships of different kinds. It also gives guidance for establishing congruence between forms of partnerships and the results to be expected from selecting one form rather than another. The Power-Role analysis is afterwards performed, its focus being two empirical cases.

J	Rebille, Y; Richefort, L				Rebille, Yann; Richefort, Lionel			Equilibrium existence and uniqueness in network games with additive preferences	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Network game; Additive preferences; Complementarity problem; P-matrix	ECONOMICS	A directed network game of imperfect strategic substitutes with heterogeneous players is analyzed. We consider concave additive separable utility functions that encompass the quasi-linear ones. It is found that pure strategy Nash equilibria verify a non-linear complementarity problem. By requiring appropriate concavity in the utility functions, the existence of an equilibrium point is shown and equilibrium uniqueness is established with a P-matrix. For this reason, it appears that previous findings on network structure and sparsity hold for many more games. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, we aimed to investigate the frequency of certain factors which interfere in the work of the employees, such as: health problems / illnesses, existence of a sick family member, financial problems, work environment, psychological / emotional and sleep problems. The research was conducted in a manufacturing industry located in the Valley of Paraiba, where a form was applied to a sample of 125 employees. The results were that among the factors surveyed, sleep is what most affects employees' productivity, followed by working environment, and the factor that interferes less being the emotional one. It was observed that seniority interferes with the sleep quality. Thus, it is recognized that sleep interferes with workers' productivity, and it is considered a factor that impacts on their productivity.	[Tavares, Renata da S.

Hence, this explorative study elaborates how to manage financial analysts' perception and valuation through strategic innovation communication. By following a holistic research design, six best practicing companies are examined by means of case studies in order to investigate how they successfully address analysts. Additionally, the perspective and information demands of 18 analysts are explored in an online survey. Based on the idea of addressing the cognitive structures that guide analysts' innovation perception, we identified success factors of innovation communication for financial analysts and the capital market which are an integrated content approach regarding innovation input, process and outcome as well as an instrument mix. Surprisingly, the analyst's innovation perception is also driven by comprehensive innovation demonstrations and stories highlighting the necessity of strategic innovation communication for the capital market.

Open burning and open detonation PM10 mass emission factor measurements with optical remote sensing	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							STATIONARY SHORT-TERM; PARTICULATE; DUST	Emission factors (EFs) of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 10 mu m (PM10) from the open burning/open detonation (OB/OD) of energetic materials were measured using a hybrid-optical remote sensing (hybrid-ORS) method. This method is based on the measurement of range-resolved PM backscattering values with a micropulse light detection and ranging (LIDAR; MPL) device. Field measurements were completed during March 2010 at Tooele Army Depot, Utah, which is an arid continental site. PM10 EFs were quantified for OB of M1 propellant and OD of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). EFs from this study are compared with previous OB/OD measurements reported in the literature that have been determined with point measurements either in enclosed or ambient environments, and with concurrent airborne point measurements. PM10 mass EFs, determined with the hybrid-ORS method, were 7.8x10(-3) kg PM10/kg M1 from OB of M1 propellant, and 0.20 kg PM10/kg TNT from OD of TNT. Compared with previous results reported in the literature, the hybrid-ORS method EFs were 13% larger for OB and 174% larger for OD. Compared with the concurrent airborne measurements, EF values from the hybrid-ORS method were 37% larger for OB and 54% larger for OD. For TNT, no statistically significant differences were observed for the EFs measured during the detonation of 22.7 and 45.4 kg of TNT, supporting that the total amount of detonated mass in this mass range does not have an effect on the EFs for OD of TNT. Implications: Particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere affects the health of humans and ecosystems, visibility, and climate. Fugitive PM emissions are not well characterized because of spatial and temporal ubiquity and heterogeneity. The hybrid-ORS method is appropriate for quantifying fugitive PM emission factors (EFs) because it captures the spatial and temporal dispersion of ground level and elevated plumes in real time, without requiring numerous point measurement devices. The method can be applied to provide an opportunity to reduce the uncertainty of fugitive PM EFs and readily update PM emissions in National Emission Inventories for a range of fugitive PM sources.

J	Yang, J; Kim, W				Yang, Joonhyuk; Kim, Wonjoon			Seasonality in the Non-U.S. Motion Picture Industry: A Case of South Korea	JOURNAL OF MEDIA ECONOMICS			English	Article							WORD-OF-MOUTH; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; CULTURAL DISCOUNT; HOLLYWOOD MOVIES; PRODUCT SALES; FILM-CRITICS; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; SUCCESS; PREDICTABILITY	In the international motion picture market, when making strategic decisions about the timing of release, it is important to consider the product's country of origin as well as demand seasonality because of their cultural orientation. However, the fluctuation patterns of underlying demand for international market have not been distinguished from that of U.S. domestic market. Here, we analyze patterns of the decay effect, which represents the diminishing attractiveness of a movie over the product life cycle, and the seasonality of underlying demand for Hollywood and non-U.S. local movies in a non-U.S. market. We find a positive effect of U.S. holidays on the seasonality of underlying demand for Hollywood movies in the non-U.S. movie market, and a negative effect for non-U.S. local movies. The authors also find that the decay effect for Hollywood movies in the non-U.S. market is greater than that for non-U.S. local movies. These findings contribute to our understanding of the effect of country of origin on product life cycle and the seasonality of underlying demand, especially in movie-importing countries where local and Hollywood movies compete.

J	Al-Alawneh, MK				Al-Alawneh, Muhammad K.			EXAMINING E-EARNING BARRIERS AS PERCEIVED BY FACULTY MEMBERS OF ENGINEERING COLLEGES IN THE JORDANIAN UNIVERSITIES	TURKISH ONLINE JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION			English	Article						E-learning barriers; higher education; engineering faculty members; Jordan	EDUCATION	Employing computer's technology that includes e-learning system in the field of Engineering is a vital issue which needs to be discussed. Therefore, this study purposed to examine e-learning barriers as perceived by faculty members of engineering in three major universities in Jordan (Yarmouk University, Jordan University of Science and Technology, and Al-Balqaa Applied University) in the second semester of 2012. The study's instrument was distributed to collect the data from a sample of 176 faculty members who are involved in delivering online courses through web-based management tool. The finding of the study shows that, overall, the three barriers domains were high. However, the results show that online degree experience and the gender of participants' variables were no significant. Based on the results, the study suggested that institutions of higher education should set a vision and a strategic plan to encourage faculty members to offer online courses and provide them with training and professional development to follow up with technology.

J	Amine, LS; Khan, GM				Amine, Lyn Suzanne; Khan, Golam Mostafa			Saudi telecom: an example of accelerated internationalization	JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING			English	Article						Internationalization; Saudi Arabia; RBV; M&A; Telecommunications	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; FIRM; STRATEGY; MODEL; MNES	Purpose - A new case study of accelerated internationalization (AI) shows that in only two years, Saudi telecom (STC) entered markets across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Managerial analysis identifies reasons for success while questioning strategic choices and their implications. Theory-driven analysis reviews STC's experience in light of selected theories and frameworks. This case is also intended for teaching purposes. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Responding to Welch et al.'s call, the authors use "interpretive sense-making" and "contextualized explanation" and highlight environmental context in the case study development. The authors review case-based research, explain data collection problems, present managerial and theoretical analyses of the case, discuss the findings relative to the literature, and suggest directions for research. Findings - Case analysis reveals STC's focus on global portfolio development as a driver of AI. Theoretical analysis confirms the psychic distance construct and its paradox, as well as the notion of epochs of internationalization while warning that the path and stages models of internationalization are at odds with AI. The authors call for a contingency view of the resource-based view as a function of context. Research limitations/implications - Limitations arise from the use of secondary data for case development because direct access to this Saudi company was not feasible. Practical implications - AI is popular among wealthy Gulf telecoms ambitious for growth. Regional competition in the Gulf is characterized by copycat and follow-the-leader strategies which preclude elaboration of unique, inimitable or non-substitutable assets, resources or capabilities. Originality/value - This innovative approach to case development provides a rich database for probing analyses of managerial and theoretical implications of AI in a Gulf-based company.

J	Annuar, HA				Annuar, Hairul Azlan			Independent non-executive directors strategic role - some evidence from Malaysia	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Corporate governance; Independent directors		Purpose - The overall purpose of the research presented is to ascertain whether independent non-executive directors (INEDs) in Malaysian publicly listed companies (PLCs) are involved in corporate strategy. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach, consisting of a series of interviews with board members, was chosen. The sampling frame was made as large as possible and, for the purpose of this study, consisted of board members who sit on PLCs of the main board and Malaysian-owned. Findings - The findings reveal that INEDs in Malaysia may display the same types of involvement in the formulation phase as their counterparts in UK, which McNulty and Pettigrew (1999) categorised as taking strategic decisions, shaping strategic decisions and shaping the context, conduct and content of strategy. The findings also show that the three phases of strategy are linked and that INEDs' behaviour during evaluation may be moderated by the strategy's success or failure and by their involvement in the earlier phases. Research limitations/implications - This research utilised interviews. Generalisations may be an issue when interviews are used as the method of inquiry. Also, the sample is not random, as access to many directors depended on recommendations. In addition, respondents were consciously selected to obtain various board positions that include independent and non-independent directors. Practical implications - Findings from this research suggest that the involvement of INEDs in different phases of corporate strategy is an indication that INEDs are no longer focusing much on policing the management. Although control is still a major issue on the board agenda, their strategic involvement may suggest that INEDs are adequately meeting their responsibilities of providing long-term direction to their companies and also suggests that INEDs are in a position to support the Chair effectively. Their active involvement is likely to result in successful strategic formalization and conclusion.

J	Bierbooms, J; van Oers, H; Bongers, I				Bierbooms, Joyce; van Oers, Hans; Bongers, Inge			An evaluation of the development of a marketing strategy in mental healthcare delivery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Marketing strategy; Mental healthcare; Portfolio analysis		Background: Budget restrictions and increasing market forces within the Dutch mental healthcare sector have been forcing mental healthcare providers to manifest the added value of their quality of care. This calls for the development of the marketing skills of a mental healthcare provider, which can still be considered a relatively new activity within this sector. Methods: In a case study at a mental healthcare provider in the Netherlands we evaluated the professional growth from 2009 onwards of strategic marketing in mental healthcare. A document analysis, log analysis, and interview were used as evaluation methods to identify the use of instruments in the area of strategic marketing and to identify the underlying processes and effects. Results: The results show that several initiatives have been undertaken in the field of marketing. Portfolio analyses proved to be dominant. In addition, organizational strategies had been described, though these were not a direct result of the analyses. The next step for mental healthcare providers is the development of a sound marketing strategy in line with the organizational objectives. Conclusions: The extent to which mental healthcare providers utilize instruments in strategic marketing is growing. The first steps are visible. Further maturity in this field is required however to anticipate changes that are expected in the mental healthcare market.

J	Bin Hasbollah, HR; Baldry, D				Bin Hasbollah, Hasif; Baldry, David			Conserving cultural values of heritage buildings from the facilities management perspective in Malaysia	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Malaysia; Facilities management; Cultural values; Cultural values of heritage building; Heritage building		Purpose - The paper describes how expert views were elicited in developing a conceptual framework of conserving cultural values of heritage buildings (CVHB) from the facilities management perspective (fm). It proposes the manifestation of fm perspective of people, place, process, and technology as a tool to sustain the physical condition and integrity of a HB and its CV according to fm dimension before a HB is endorsed as a heritage. The linkages between fm and CVHB will help to produce a guideline for conserving CVHB from fm perspective (CVHBfm) at the initial phase of conservation in Malaysia. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The study opted for an exploratory approach; three expert interviews were conducted from three levels of conservation practitioners drawn from strategic, tactical, and operational levels. A matrix thematic was used to manifest the qualitative variables in mapping the conceptual framework. The respondents will provide views and linkages between eight criteria of CVHB (social, economic, political, historic, aesthetical, scientific, age, andecological) and fm dimension (people, place, process, and technology) in conserving a HB at the preliminary phase of conservation. The responses from these respondents will provide insights into how fm perspective manifest and epistemological construct with CVHB variables that will be integrated in a case study method for further investigation inquiry. Findings - In this paper, the study indicates an fm perspective of people, place, process, and technology, associates and epistemological constructed with CVHB criteria of social, historic, aesthetical, and scientific in sustaining the physical condition and integrity of CVHB from fm dimension in Malaysia. The respondents from three levels of conservation practitioners (strategic, tactical, and operational) have explained and elaborated briefly the connotation between CVHB and fm in mapping the framework. It also provides insights into how fm dimension manifests with those CVHB variables in conserving a HB before it is endorsed as a heritage at the initial stage of conservation. Originality/value - Moving from this exploratory study, further research will be undertaken. In-depth interviews will be carried out with a rigorous emphasis on fm and eight criteria of CVHB with a greater number of experts on HB conservation from strategic, tactical, and operational levels in Malaysia. Documents suggested during the initial study such as The National Heritage Act 2005 (Malaysia) and UNESCO's outstanding universal values (OUV) will be analysed and framed in mapping the conceptual framework. Further investigation will assist Malaysia in advancing the application of fm perspective to enhance the conservation of HB and its CV by highlighting the role of fm as a robust tool in sustaining the integrity HB in Malaysia.

Surprisingly, we find similar practices in both countries, but we also identify differences related to national culture, the economic situation, the information used and the embedding of strategic aspects in management accounting. Furthermore, we show that differences between industries surpass cross-country heterogeneity and we present institutional isomorphism as a suitable theoretical framework to explain our findings against the backdrop of globalisation.

J	Bytheway, A; Venter, IM				Bytheway, Andy; Venter, Isabella M.			Strategies for information management in education: Some international experience	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SYSTEMS SUCCESS; TECHNOLOGY; ALIGNMENT	Background: Recent analysis of the management of information and communications technologies in South African education suggests strongly that there is only limited strategic thinking that might guide policy-makers, school principals, teachers, learners and suppliers of educational technologies. It is clear that here in South Africa, as elsewhere, the actual practice of technology-mediated education is driven more by the available technologies than by actual learner needs, good management principles and the wider national imperative. There might be lessons to be learned from experience elsewhere. Objectives: This article reports and analyses conversation with eight international educators in Europe, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. All are managing the impact of technology in different ways (reactive and pro-active), at different levels (pre-primary through to senior citizen), in different roles (teachers, administrators and senior managers) and in different contexts (schools and universities). Method: Open-ended conversations with educators and educational administrators in developed countries were recorded, transcribed and analysed. The qualitative analysis of the content was done in the style of 'open coding' and 'selective coding' using a qualitative content analysis tool. Results: Whilst technology is still seen to drive much thinking, it is found that that success is not derived from the technology, but from a full and proper understanding of the needs and aspirations of those who are directly involved in educational processes, and by means of a managerial focus that properly recognises the context within which an institution exists. Conclusion: Whilst this result might be expected, the detailed analysis of the findings further reveals the need to manage investments in educational technologies at different levels and in different ways.

The proposed supply chains follow the rules of origin as wholly obtained, substantially transformation, and third country processing criteria. These supply chain can be used to take non-tariff benefits according to the rules of origin. In order to evaluate the validity of the proposed supply chain, we construct profit models and show optimal sales prices can maximize net profits. The profit model encompasses the structure of supply chain which enables decision-makers to make a strategic decision on evaluation and selection of efficient FTA. Using the output of profit models, global supply chain planning models are built to maximize profit and customer needs. A case study for a textile company in Korea is provided for illustrating how the proposed supply chain models work.

J	Chen, CM; Zheng, XY; Wu, TY				Chen, Chien-Ming; Zheng, Xinying; Wu, Tsu-Yang			A Complete Hierarchical Key Management Scheme for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							EFFICIENT; LIFETIME	Heterogeneous cluster-based wireless sensor networks (WSN) attracted increasing attention recently. Obviously, the clustering makes the entire networks hierarchical; thus, several kinds of keys are required for hierarchical network topology. However, most existing key management schemes for it place more emphasis on pairwise key management schemes or key predistribution schemes and neglect the property of hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a complete hierarchical key management scheme which only utilizes symmetric cryptographic algorithms and low cost operations for heterogeneous cluster-based WSN. Our scheme considers four kinds of keys, which are an individual key, a cluster key, a master key, and pairwise keys, for each sensor node. Finally, the analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient; thus, it is suitable for heterogeneous cluster-based WSN.

J	Chen, YM; Su, CT				Chen, Yi-Min; Su, Chien-Tai			Brand equity heterogeneity among strategic groups in service franchising	SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL			English	Article						service franchising; brand equity; franchisor; franchisee; strategic group; heterogeneity; agency theory	MOBILITY BARRIERS; GROUP MEMBERSHIP; AGENCY THEORY; PLURAL FORM; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRIES; OWNERSHIP; PRODUCTS; QUALITY	Independent franchisees work cooperatively with service franchisors to strengthen the franchisor's brand name. However, agency theory predicts that franchisor inputs such as brand names and operational routines might be harmed by franchisees' free riding. In addition, previous literature has addressed the issues of strategic group emergence and performance differences between groups in recent decades. Thus, this study builds upon an emerging symbiotic view of franchising behind agency theory and incorporates a strategic groups level of analysis to investigate whether franchisees have strong incentives to maintain standards as franchisor seeking market penetration. By investigating potential brand equity differences among service franchisors for Taiwanese telecommunications service chains, this study found that different strategic groups exist in service franchising chains. From replication testing, the current results demonstrate that service franchising brand equity heterogeneities exist among franchisors within and across strategic groups. Therefore, this study broadens agency theory's explanation of service franchising.

J	Chowdhury, TG; Madhavaram, S; Ratneshwar, S; Standifer, R				Chowdhury, Tilottama; Madhavaram, Sreedhar; Ratneshwar, S.; Standifer, Rhetta			The appropriateness of different modes of strategy from a product-market perspective	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						organizational strategy; strategy modes; product-markets; product-market lifecycle	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; LIFE-CYCLE; BUSINESS STRATEGY; ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; SUCCESS; BRAND; FIRM	Strategy-making is an important yet complex task. The present research examines the issue of strategy mode, that is, the manner or style in which strategy is determined in an organization. Prior researchers have proposed various typologies for strategy modes. However, research into which strategy modes are appropriate to what kinds of firm situations and contexts has been limited. Specifically, there has been no research that explores strategy modes from a marketing environment perspective. Given that research at the intersection of marketing and management disciplines has often produced mutually beneficial, rich insights, we approach strategy modes from a product-market perspective and examine the normative appropriateness of different strategy modes with reference to firms' external and internal environments. The research also explores the relevance and value of combining various strategy modes in regard to different stages of the product-market life cycle. In exploring strategy modes and their combinatory influences from a product-market perspective, we develop specific propositions.

J	Dangol, R; Kos, A				Dangol, Ramesh; Kos, Anthony			Knightian uncertainty and risk A basis for untangling dynamic capabilities from operational capabilities	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dynamic capabilities; Strategic management; Capability-based view	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; FIRM; ACCUMULATION; STRATEGY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new way to distinguish a firm's dynamic capabilities from operational capabilities. Design/methodology/approach - Conceptual paper/literature review. Findings - Current literature on dynamic capabilities posits that dynamic capabilities are those firm capabilities that can induce change in other capabilities, while operational capabilities are static. Distinguishing between these capabilities in this manner is not helpful because changes occur continuously in all capabilities to at least some extent. In addition, empirical studies show that even task-level operational capabilities can change on their own and can induce change in other capabilities. In contrast to focussing on the presence or lack of change to determine if a capability is dynamic or operational, this paper distinguishes between them by determining a priori the expected nature of the outcome. By focussing on the outcomes of change rather than the changes themselves, this paper proposes that capabilities should be considered operational if they produce outcomes that can be predicted using probability distribution while those capabilities that produce outcomes that cannot be predicted using probability distribution should be considered dynamic. Research limitations/implications - Future research on dynamic capabilities should not only investigate whether or not change is occurring, but the outcome of change to understand whether a change is precipitated by dynamic or operational capabilities. Originality/value - Existing dynamic capabilities literature is unclear about how to distinguish between dynamic capabilities from operational capabilities. Previous research attempts to distinguish these capabilities by arguing dynamic capabilities are those firm capabilities that can induce change in other capabilities, while operational capabilities are static and do not induce change. This is not particularly helpful. A clear distinction between dynamic and operational capabilities could facilitate further advancement of the dynamic capability literature; this study makes a rudimentary effort to distinguish between them.

J	Davies, A; John, E; Thomas, A				Davies, Alan; John, Elwyn; Thomas, Andrew			Corporate strategy development via numerical situation analysis	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategic planning; Performance management; Strategic evaluation; Organizational performance; SWOT analysis		Purpose - Using the numerical situation analysis (NSA) technique in the development of corporate strategy provides senior managers with a suitable methodology for the creation of alternative strategic options. Subsequently, it may be used to evaluate those options for possible selection and implementation by the company concerned. In addition, the technique provides a graphic temporal point description of an organisation's strategic situation. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to outline the technique of NSA via a hypothetical example and thereby illustrate its use in practice. Design/methodology/approach - By using a paradigm approach, the paper indicates the correct application of the NSA technique as a means of defining and evaluating alternative strategic options within a manufacturing company. As proposed, the methodology also permits several graphic illustrations of the strategic situation to be drawn, along with a scheme for monitoring the effectiveness of an adopted strategy. Findings - The evolution of the suggested NSA technique and its application to the formulation of strategic options for a manufacturing company are outlined in the paper. In practice, its application in four differing industries has resulted in some caveats regarding its use, and to some provisional conclusions being drawn in respect of its usefulness to senior management. These are recorded in the concluding section of the paper. Research limitations/implications - The design, development and application of NSA proposed in this paper together with the experience of its implementation and use, in practice, highlight a potentially useful extension to existing methods of strategy formulation. The methodology offers senior management a technique, whereby alternative strategic options may be defined and evaluated for possible adoption along with diagrammatic illustrations of an organisation's strategic situation. In addition, the approach allows a selected strategy to be monitored over time for effectiveness, thus providing an early warning mechanism in respect of strategic inutility. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the existing knowledge based on strategy development, evaluation and selection. It also provides a mechanism for monitoring a selected strategy for effectiveness over time and a structured framework for senior management to undertake the strategic planning process. It may when used in practice achieve an improved level of strategic understanding on the part of senior management and thereby stimulate improved corporate performance.

J	Dortland, MVR; Voordijk, H; Dewulf, G				Dortland, Maartje van Reedt; Voordijk, Hans; Dewulf, Geert			Towards phronetic knowledge for strategic planning in corporate real estate management A real options approach	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE			English	Article						Stakeholders; Strategic planning; Corporate real estate; Owner-user perspective; Project flexibility; Real option		Purpose - The objective of this paper is to provide insights about the potential of real option thinking for corporate real estate management (CREM) from the owner-user perspective. A promising approach to classifying and evaluating flexibility in real estate is the real options approach. Most literature on real options look from an investor perspective. Design/methodology/approach - First, a review on real option thinking in the real estate and large engineering projects literature is provided using Flyvbjerg's (2001) typology of knowledge systems. Next, the effects of exercising real options for various stakeholders in CREM is analysed in two case studies. Findings - The literature review shows that little research has been done on conditions and values needed to make real options applicable in the CREM practice of the owner-user of real estate. The case studies show that real options are more valuable to one stakeholder than to another. Practical implications - Based on the knowledge on conditions for and the consequences of exercising real options for various stakeholders, insight can be gained into the applicability of real options to the owner-user of real estate and how real options reasoning fits within this practice. A phronetic type of knowledge is needed that incorporates stakeholders' interests. Originality/value - Creating phronetic knowledge would allow understanding why and how real options are used, or could be used in the future, and heuristics could be developed. In this way, real estate management should become more resilient to changes.

J	Dufour, Y; Steane, P				Dufour, Yvon; Steane, Peter			Creative strategic thinking and sustainable leadership: lessons from Picasso	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY			English	Article								Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at Cubism as a source of insights into creative strategic thinking. Cubism originated in the joint effort by Picasso and Braque. It was a new revolutionary paradigm that overthrew classic principles of representation; dispensing with the idea of a single fixed viewpoint that had dominated art for more than six centuries. The classic idea that there is a single best rational analytical process by which strategy comes to be has been dominating management education and practice for more than six decades. Design/methodology/approach - We use Picasso's drawings and paintings as a metaphor for how leaders can look at strategic problems differently, consider more creative choices, and in acting, create more sustainable companies. Findings - This article argues that problems occur in organisations not because of poor strategic planning and programming but because of a lack of creative strategic thinking. Implication - Picasso's art is often multi-layered, offering perspective upon perspective, from slightly different angles. It forces the viewer to stop, think and reconsider alternative perspectives in the search for meaning. Sustainable leaders must do this every day. We call this "strategy as cubism". Originality/value - Strategic cubism is about thinking creatively in strategic decision-making through the use of alternative information, which adds value to the overall strategic thinking. Leaders use cubism to shape communication between managers to create options and alternatives, rather than close down creativity, to better facilitate strategic choices that are more sustainable.

Using an outline of research factors derived from method engineering and strategic collaboration factors, this article presents an exploratory case study that was conducted within a high tech company to determine themes for managing participation during requirements elicitation. The main empirical contribution of the article is evidence from a thematic analysis of the study that describes how requirements analysts manage and take part in elicitation activities and how potential barriers are overcome. Twenty four strategic collaboration themes and five method engineering themes were found in the participative elicitation process from two projects. The article also makes a conceptual contribution in the form of strategic information systems considerations derived from the participation management themes captured in the case company.

Through offshoring risks associated with inventory holding are hedged. A comparative analysis of in-house and offshored cost profiles as well as critical risk factors that affect firm value are evaluated. The result shows that offshoring led to immediate costs saving, freeing of funds previously held in inventory for other working capital investments as well as profitability for vendors. However, aside financial benefits to partners, it leads to increased stakeholders awareness, shared values, partnerships, teamwork and risk mitigation. It therefore follows that for sustainability of financial benefits of offshoring, concerted effort must be made by partners to ensure that critical drivers of value management are not compromised.

J	Fathalipour, M; Selamat, A; Jung, JJ				Fathalipour, Mahmood; Selamat, Ali; Jung, Jason J.			Ontology-Based, Process-Oriented, and Society-Independent Agent System for Cloud Computing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; METRICS SUITE	IT systems are used to help organizations to manage and automate their processes. However, most of today's systems are not reusable because of mixing the society's knowledge with the process's knowledge. Since the societies' knowledge is different to each other, the applications are not reusable. Hence, this paper address the dependency of the applications on the societies by separately defining process's ontology, the agent's knowledge, the society's ontology, and the society's knowledge. This research introduces an ontology-based, process-oriented, and society-independent agent system which allows all the organizations to utilize it by defining and importing their societies' ontology and some process patterns, which can be instantiated from the process's ontology, into the system. The proposed system can be applied to cloud computing platform. The proposed system has been evaluated from two perspectives, the quality by using the cohesion and the coupling measures for measuring the degree to which the system focuses on solving a particular problem and the applicability by evaluating the manageability and the automatability of the seven processes from three different societies. We believe that our proposed system will improve when we apply some methods to find the best process patterns and perform parallel processes.

Strategic actors from the Virtual Innovation Society network were interviewed to identify critical semantic parameters that address this issue. As a result, this study suggests the characterization of inter-dependent added-values and its performance metrics, under the "managing as designing" approach, as input for managing the externalities, the integration of the articulation between business operations, strategy and information technology, and waste of innovation. In this context, the identification of the main managerial indicators for future command and control of existing innovation network operations under the "managing as designing" approach becomes a new challenge for future research.

J	Gibb, S; Wallace, M				Gibb, Stephen; Wallace, Mhairi			Soul mates or odd couples? Alignment theory and HRD	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Strategy; Values; Alignment; Effectiveness; HRD	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to test and explore alignment theory as a guiding principle for human resource development (HRD) by performing an empirical study. HRD scholars, professionals and others have adopted or assumed alignment theory to help explain HRD effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach - Constructs to measure an organisation's strategic priorities and its HRD practices. A measure of HRD effectiveness was developed. A survey gathered data from 270 employees, managers and HRD staff in a sample of 76 organisations. Findings - The results show that HRD effectiveness does not vary with alignment as predicted. Forms of partial alignment, or the relations of an "odd couple", are more strongly associated with HRD effectiveness than high alignment. Research limitations/implications - The use and integration of both normative measures (Likert scale) and ipsative measures (ranking) is necessary to capture alignment, but this limits the inferential statistics available to test validity and reliability. Qualitative data on case studies would be useful to explore alignment issues in context and depth. Practical implications - Stakeholders in organisations can use the "odd couple" interpretation of alignment as a fresh way to review and explore the opportunities and challenges of managing HRD effectiveness in an era where a narrowing and retrenchment of provisions is occurring and increasing. Originality/value - This study provides evidence which raises questions about alignment theory and policies intended to increase alignment. It suggests in the case of HRD, an alternative perspective that validates partial alignment can support effective HRD provisions.

J	Hopkins, W				Hopkins, Willie			Knowledge sufficiency: when institutional distance is insufficient	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Institutional distance; Knowledge sufficiency	ENTRY MODE; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; STRATEGIES; CHOICE; OWNERSHIP; SERVICE; RISK; FIRM; INTERNATIONALIZATION; SUBSIDIARIES	Purpose - For firms entering a foreign market for the first time, institutional distance can be thought of as being insufficient in the sense that knowledge gap issues associated with large distances are not easily resolved. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of knowledge sufficiency and the implications that this concept holds for assuaging these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The concept of knowledge sufficiency is developed into a practical framework. The framework is comprised of the knowledge that firms accumulate about potential host countries. This accumulated knowledge is disaggregated into components that provide the basic structure of the knowledge sufficiency framework and facilitate a systematic assessment of accumulated knowledge. Findings - Accumulated knowledge about foreign market risk factors that exist in potential host countries is disaggregated into three components. The breadth of knowledge component is designed to help answer the question: what do firms know about foreign market risk factors in potential host countries? The depth of knowledge component is designed to help answer the question: how much do firms know about foreign market risk factors in potential host countries. The quality of knowledge component is designed to answer the question: are firms confident in what they know about foreign market risk factors in potential host countries? Research limitations/implications - There is a tendency for strategic decision makers in firms to feel that they have "deep" knowledge of foreign market risk factors when they may actually have only "surface" knowledge of these factors. The result is likely to be an unwarranted lowering of the risk they perceive to exist in potential host countries. Consequently, the host country selected for entry may not be optimal and the mode of entry may be inappropriate. The issue to be resolved is how to ascertain how much knowledge firms actually possess about these foreign market risk factors. Practical implications - Selecting the "right" foreign market and entering that market in the "right" way is unquestionably one of the most important topics in the international literature and has been extensively studied. However, there is no central repository of finding from these studies that will help firms going international for the first time to systematically assess whether their choice of market and entry mode is optimal. Utilization of the knowledge sufficiency framework will significantly improve firms' chances of entering the "right" foreign markets in the "right" way, which holds practical implications for their initial and long-term performance in these markets. Originality/value - For firms entering a foreign market for the first time, answers to two questions are essential: what foreign market should we enter? How should we enter that foreign market? The extant literature does not provide a framework that allows firms to systematically search for answers to these questions such that, when satisfactorily found, will boost confidence that answers to these two questions are optimized. In addition to filling an important gap in the extant literature, the framework's usefulness as an aid for making internationalization decisions also makes an important contribution to practice.

J	Lee, CM				Lee, Chang-Moo			The Strategic Measures for the Industrial Security of Small and Medium Business	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article								The competitiveness of companies increasingly depends upon whether they possess the cutting-edge or core technology. The technology should be protected from industrial espionage or leakage. A special attention needs to be given to SMB (small and medium business), furthermore, because SMB occupies most of the companies but has serious problems in terms of industrial security. The technology leakages of SMB would account for more than 2/3 of total leakages during last five years. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to analyze the problems of SMB in terms of industrial security and suggest the strategic solutions for SMB in South Korea. The low security awareness and financial difficulties, however, make it difficult for SMB to build the effective security management system which would protect the company from industrial espionage and leakage of its technology. The growing dependence of SMB on network such as internet, in addition, puts the SMB at risk of leaking its technology through hacking or similar ways. It requires new measures to confront and control such a risk. Online security control services and technology deposit system are suggested for such measures.

J	Lee, H				Lee, Hyunjoung			A study on knowledge structure and cognitive mapping of marketing using social network analysis	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Marketing research; marketing research topics; knowledge structure; co-word analysis; actor-network theory; social network analysis; cohesive subgroup; centrality		This research has been undertaken to identify the knowledge structure of the marketing field from 1991 to 2010. For this, 282 keywords extracted from 11,548 papers in international journals related to the marketing field were analyzed with co-word analysis and social network analysis. To investigate the knowledge structure, the following steps were carried out. The first step was to identify the frequency of keywords over a 20-year period (1991-2010). Keywords that consistently represented the marketing field were identified as trust, pricing, consumer behavior, advertising, retailing, market orientation, and customer satisfaction. Keywords from 2000 onward were categorized to represent established research areas. New research topics such as internet, e-commerce, relationship marketing, customer relationship management, b2b, sales management, and corporate social responsibility emerged. The second step investigated sub-research areas in marketing using co-word matrix. As a result, eight cohesive subgroups were identified through community analysis. Each of the groups consisted of keywords related to the group name - Group 1: service performance and recovery, Group 2: brand management, Group 3: marketing modeling and choice model, Group 4: new product diffusion and forecasting, Group 5: distribution channels and pricing, Group 6: customer relationship management and internet marketing, Group 7: channel management, and Group 8: strategic orientation. The third step provided a cognitive map to reflect research development trends in each subgroup research area. Following that map, Groups 3, 4, and 5 were connected to other research areas. Group 6 and 7 were unconstructed areas for which further research is required. In the last step, social network analysis was performed to identify the core keywords using centrality analysis. Keywords with a high degree of centrality - i.e., highly correlated betweenness centrality over the entire 20-year period were marketing strategy, consumer behavior, and trust.

The findings indicate that organisational learning is perceived by respondents to be the most important capability, followed by integration and logistics service capabilities. Logistics services firms are categorised into three strategic groups, namely, intensive capability-oriented firms, logistics service capability-oriented firms, and integrated organisational learning-capability firms. The results provide evidence of performance differences between these strategic groups. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings for international logistics service providers are also discussed.

J	Lone, TA; Khan, RA				Lone, Tariq Ahmad; Khan, Rafi Ahmad			Data Mining: Competitive Tool to Digital Library	DESIDOC JOURNAL OF LIBRARY & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Data mining; information technology; extraction; transformation and loading; Knowledge discovery		The increasing popularity of world wide web is providing an easy and quick alternative to get the required information through the internet which has threatened the existence of traditional libraries. The human capital associated with the management of libraries in the contemporary world is facing the challenge of crafting strategies to continuously augment their services with the help of information technology to provide quality customised services to the end users. To address this challenge libraries can use data mining to extract strategic information from the data captured in the libraries' data ases. The capability of data mining to solve some of the vital problems has encouraged libraries to implement this intelligent tool of data mining. In this paper, an attempt has been made to educate stakeholders on the issues and applications of data mining in libraries.

J	Loock, C; Gravett, S				Loock, Coert; Gravett, Sarah			Towards a governance and management model for teaching schools in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION			English	Article						Teaching schools; teacher training schools; teacher education; school practicum; school governance; public school; private school; lab schools; charter schools		This article reports on a project that was aimed at establishing a model for the governance of teaching schools in South Africa within the framework of the current legal dispensation for the public and the independent schooling sector. The paper mainly addresses the powers and functions of public schools and school governing bodies as defined within the broader framework of The South African Schools Act 84 of 1996, The National Education Policy Act (Act 27 of 1996), and the Employment of Educators Act (Act 76 of 1998). The analysis of these statutes informed the proposal of four possible models for governance of teaching schools. The article recommends two models that fit the mandate of teaching schools as envisioned in the Integrated Strategic Planning Framework for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa, 2011-2025: 1) a model that provides for teaching schools as a school type at national (not provincial) level, and 2) the independent school model.

J	Maity, M				Maity, Moutusy			The Role of Information Quality of a Website: Examining Consumer Information Search through the IS Success Model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTERACTION			English	Article						Information Quality; Information Search; Information Systems Success Model; Online Word-of-Mouth (WOM); Trust	SYSTEMS SUCCESS; ONLINE INFORMATION; COGNITIVE AUTHORITY; WEB; INTERNET; IMPACT; PARTICIPATION; COMMUNITIES; INVOLVEMENT; EXPERIENCE	Understanding the nature of information quality in the context of consumer information search on a website is vital for Information Systems as well as for marketing managers who want to use their websites for strategic purposes. This study brings together the Information Systems (IS) Success Model and consumer information search literature to propose and test a comprehensive model investigating information quality, and extends the IS Success Model. Our model tests antecedents to and consequences of information quality of a website. Findings on data collected from 575 respondents reveal that perceived cost and self efficacy (among others) are significant antecedents to information quality. Findings also reveal that information quality significantly affects online WOM and trust, which has implications for managing users on social media as well as on websites. This study adds to the literature on IS and on consumer information search, and offers practical guidelines for managers.

J	Maksin, MN				Maksin, Marija N.			Planning system for sustainable territorial development in Serbia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						sustainable territorial development; spatial planning; sector planning; strategic environmental assessment; coordination and integration		The aim of this article is to research the problems in the development and practices of the planning system in the sustainable territorial development of a transition country (Serbia). Research is based upon the analysis and assessment of how integrated and supported is the legal framework, governance system and strategic planning (general strategies, spatial, environmental and sector planning) in the sustainable territorial development of Serbia. The paper also analyses the role and possibilities for the implementation of strategic environmental assessment as a support instrument (control and coordination) of strategic planning. The main findings are that in a country undergoing transition, such as Serbia at the beginning of the 21st century, there are many cases of hastened, uncoordinated and uncritical adoption of numerous laws and planning documents based on legal heritage and EU development documents, without real reforms of the planning and management system, and without adequate political will to provide mechanisms for the implementation of sustainable territorial development. Recommendations have been given in this article, and priorities singled out for improving the system of strategic planning and facilitating support for sustainable territorial development in a country undergoing transition.

J	Mofokeng, M; Luke, R				Mofokeng, Moitswadi; Luke, Rose			An investigation into the effectiveness of public entities' procurement practices	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The delivery of services through the procurement of goods and services requires proper strategic leadership and management processes. Inappropriate planning, under-spending of budgets and ineffective procurement form part of the root causes of poor service delivery, as this restricts the movement of resources to the right places. This study identified the leading procurement practices as: procurement strategy and leadership, the procurement process, human resource management, procurement information systems, supplier management and procurement performance management. These practices were then tested in public entities, mainly in Gauteng Province, South Africa, to determine the extent to which they are applied. The study found that there is a major divide between the perception of the level of application of the leading practices and actual implementation. Processes, skills, performance management, information technology (IT) systems and supplier management are applied inadequately or inappropriately. Most entities thus show a poor understanding of customer needs and there seems to be a general lack of customer focus.

J	Mohanty, RP; Augustin, P				Mohanty, Rajendra Prasad; Augustin, Prince			Business strategy of automotive and farm equipment sector of the Mahindra & Mahindra Group of India	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Collaboration; Innovation; Creativity; Mergers and acquisitions; Automotive; Greiner curve		Purpose - This paper traces the historical evolution and growth trajectory of the automotive and farm equipment sector, which is a very significant entity of the Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) group. The purpose of this paper is to understand and provide a pragmatic framework through which the authors can see what were the internal and external factors and the spirit of the contemporary times that led to the changes in the nature of the group. Design/methodology/approach - The "Greiner curve" model has been applied to interpret the evolutionary growth of the group and strategic trajectory explaining characteristics in its different phases. Findings - M&M initially went through its share of learning and grew through pragmatic and, orchestrated entrepreneurial risk. The group made a very successful transition from a proprietorship model to a professionally managed group. It is found that rapid growth has been possible through innovation led collaboration. The group is increasingly organizing its innovation activities around the development of responses to specific challenges. Research limitations/implications - This study suffers from methodological limitations associated with a stage model that the estimated length of the time the organizations will stay in a phase is not known. It is unclear whether passage through all stages is necessary; or whether, in some circumstances, one or more stages may be omitted, and if variations in sequencing can occur. The data for the initial years was not available in primary form and the paper had to depend entirely on the secondary sources. Practical implications - Various strategies adopted by the group from time to time have practical implications for Indian economy. The group has faced many challenges, but challenge-led collaborationdriven approach represents a new type of innovation process that contrasts with other methods of business strategies and provides a sharper focus for managerial and technical issues and brings together stakeholders with diverse interests, expertise and perspectives. Originality/value - This study is a unique attempt in India to trace the evolution of the strategic interventions in the context of a major business group, which is considered to be a symbolic representation of Indian economic history. The paper has got both academic as well as managerial utility.

J	North, N; Park, E				North, N.; Park, E.			Potential for a Web-Based Tool to Confirm and Update Health Management and Leadership Competencies. Experiences of a Pilot Survey in New Zealand 2012	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health management; health leadership; competencies; web-based survey; pilot study		Objective: To determine the acceptability and utility of regular surveys of the health management workforce in order to describe the profile of health managers, to identify which health management competencies were important in New Zealand and to self-assess proficiency. Design: Based on a literature review, 27 competencies were identified across three broad domains, Analytical, Interpersonal and Technical. A web-based survey in which participants responded to the listed competencies was administered. Setting: Members of the professional association for health managers in New Zealand were eligible. Main outcome measures: A 7-point Likert-type scale was used to rate listed competencies for importance to participant's roles, and to assess their proficiency in each competency. Results: The respondents (n=46, response rate 30%) were predominantly in senior management levels, experienced and qualified in health management. The competencies rated most important were: Analytical (decision-making, results management, strategic thinking, problem-solving, managing quality, flexibility, political skills, analytical skills); Interpersonal (teams, leadership, communication and collaboration/partnership); and Technical (budget-related). Participants' mean self-assessed proficiency in the 27 competencies were also mainly in the interpersonal and analytical domains. Respondents supported both regular assessment of competencies and use of a short web-based survey format, though not all supported the particular tool used in the pilot. Conclusions: Feedback on the pilot was positive. Regularly surveying health managers using web-based questionnaires to confirm and up-date competencies would remedy the dearth in knowledge and provide the information educational and training institutions require to ensure qualifications are relevant, and to inform employer-based professional development.

J	Ntayi, JM; Mugume, E				Ntayi, Joseph Mpeera; Mugume, Ephraim			A taxonomy of strategic sourcing for defense forces in sub-Saharan Africa	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Ethics; Supply chain management; Developing countries; Strategic sourcing		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a taxonomy of strategic sourcing using the defense forces from a developing world context as a testing ground. This study builds upon the current resource-based conceptualization of strategic sourcing as a construct to introduce the institutional orientation. Design/methodology/approach - This study adopts a descriptive and analytical research design of cross-sectional nature to collect data from a sample of 120 respondents to examine the taxonomy of strategic sourcing for defense forces in sub-Saharan Africa. Data were collected using an interviewee administered questionnaire and analysed using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The conceptualization of strategic sourcing is presented using a CFA. Findings - Findings reveal that strategic sourcing is a multidimensional construct composed of: information sharing and risk management, strategic purchasing, institutions for sourcing, internal integration and performance assessment, supplier management and sourcing professionalism and ethics. Research limitations/implications - The study used cross-sectional research design which limits monitoring behaviour over time. Cross-sectional data do not allow control in the analysis for residual heterogeneity. Additionally, all item scales adapted in this study were developed in either manufacturing or profit-oriented sector. Originality/value - A taxonomy for strategic sourcing within the defense forces is presented. This study is based on the observation that despite increased research, there remains a certain level of confusion surrounding the conceptualization of "strategic sourcing". Researchers attach a startling diversity of definitions and measures to the strategic sourcing concept. Its conceptualization and stability remains an important task for scholars to undertake. Besides, much research in strategic sourcing, are conceptual frameworks identifying key elements and procedures or processes to implement strategic sourcing with sparse empirical studies. The results of the study will be used for further research on strategic sourcing in the defense forces in sub-Saharan Africa.

J	Omri, W; Becuwe, A; Mathe, JC				Omri, Waleed; Becuwe, Audrey; Mathe, Jean-Charles			Ownership structure and innovative behavior Testing the mediatory role of board composition	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING IN EMERGING ECONOMIES			English	Article						Ownership structure; Structural equation modelling; Innovative behaviour; Board composition	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MULTIVARIATE SKEWNESS; INTERNAL GOVERNANCE; DIRECTORS; MANAGEMENT; KURTOSIS; IMPACT; WORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to expand understanding of the determinants of adoption innovation in SME context by empirically examining the effect of corporate governance structure on manager's innovative behavior. This was done through exploring whether ownership structure affects managers' innovative behavior and if so, whether the effect is mediated by board composition. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of 197 managers within Tunisian SMEs, hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling and especially using covariance structure analysis (or LISREL method) with Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) 18.0 software and maximum likelihood estimation method. Findings - The paper found that ownership structure is significantly associated with manager's innovative behavior. Further analysis arising from introducing outsiders' representation on the board as a mediating variable reveals that the relationship is fully mediated by this variable. Practical implications - This study gives insights to policy makers who are interested in improving board efficacy in emerging economies such as Tunisia. Indeed, the study results should encourage nominating committees and seniors to reflect warily on an effective structuring of board composition by ensuring a certain priority for innovation activities in the firm. Originality/value - This paper extends the understanding of how ownership structure shapes strategic decisions such as innovation in emerging markets. In addition, it fills the literature void by introducing the board composition as a mediating concept between ownership structure and innovative behavior, which was neglected by previous researchers.

Consistent with the recent "positive view", spin-offs can be considered as a "proactive strategic choice" to foster innovation, develop new activities, being different from past strategic initiatives and, more generally, not being strictly connected to the corporate strategy of the firm. In order to investigate the relation between divestiture decisions and innovation, we conduct an explorative case study in the pharmaceutical industry to show how spin-offs can help firms to explore new opportunities for innovation, search for new funding and push to create the basis for future development.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT RECREATION AND TOURISM			English	Article						Sport; brand; television; technology; marketing	JOB-SATISFACTION; EDUCATION; GENDER; DETERMINANTS; RETENTION; WORKERS	This paper explores the world of sport marketing in relation to changing contextual factors taking place necessitating a shift in marketing strategy and practice. Using a systemic and structuration oriented perspective, it examines the emerging concepts of the post-television world, a post-brand paradigm, and the concept of total marketing. The discussion will focus on key drivers of change in an emerging post-television world: digital technologies, lifestyles, youth culture, individuals-within-communities, wiki-worlds, and consumer backlash. Implications for sport marketers and potential future research emerging from important strategic challenges (brand changes, the important element of content, and metrics for success) are provided as a way to understand how past principles can and are used in such a context.

J	Salim, N; Mohamed, B				Salim, Nurbaidura; Mohamed, Badaruddin			The Relationship between Socio-Demographic Characteristics and Snorkeling Satisfaction in Pulau Payar Marine Park, Kedah	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Socio-demographic characteristics; snorkeling; visitor satisfaction; Marine Park		Due to its popularity and lucrative business opportunity, snorkeling has become the predominant activity in many marine parks. Continuous growth in the number of tourists and mass tourism has resulted in uncontrolled number of tourists, sometimes to pass over the carrying capacity of the site. Due to the lack of control and enforcement, many tour boat operators are seen bringing snorkelers to small fragile sites at the same time frame. Such situation has resulted in reduced quality of tourist experience and satisfaction level as they need to cram in with others at the designated snorkeling areas. This study analyzes the influence of tourist demographic profile on the satisfaction level with snorkeling experience in the Pulau Payar Marine Park, a small coral island in Malaysia. A total of 259 snorkelers answered the survey that forms the basis of this paper. The results tested using t-tests and ANOVA, show significant differences between satisfaction level and respondents' socio-demographic characteristics. Findings of the study indicated that only origin and education level positively associated with visitor satisfaction. Several issues, such as limiting the numbers of boats to be allowed at the site and facilities management such as toilets, changing rooms and solid waste management were among issues need to be considered by the Marine Park Department, in order to protect the island and its sustainability. This study highlights the importance of site management, in environmentally sensitive areas, for marine park managers and tour operators toward developing strategic marketing mixes for the different market segments.

Seawater desalination as an option to alleviate water scarcity in South Africa: the need for a strategic approach to planning and environmental decision-making	JOURNAL OF WATER REUSE AND DESALINATION			English	Article						environmental impacts; informed decision-making; national water policy; seawater reverse osmosis; Strategic Environmental Assessment		In the last decade, seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) has come to be seen by policy-makers as a novel technology that will significantly advance water security in South African coastal regions. Water purveyors, from the private sector, local/district municipalities and provincial authorities, are undertaking studies to explore the feasibility of SWRO to meet growing demand and relieve mounting pressure on current bulk water supply infrastructure. With this in mind, it is suggested that national strategic planning should be introduced to present the opportunities and constraints of the desalination option within the national water and energy policy. In absence of this, piece-meal decisions will be made at local authority levels and the construction of SWRO plants will be determined by regional circumstances (e.g. drought) as opposed to national water policy agenda. This paper explores the value of such a strategy by considering the drivers of SWRO in South Africa, the risk of unplanned large-scale SWRO implementation (with a focus on environmental impacts) and the initial steps that could be taken toward a Strategic Environmental Assessment for SWRO in South Africa.

J	Scupola, A				Scupola, Ada			The relation between innovation sources and ICT roles in facility management organizations	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Facilities management; Services; Ambidexterity; ICT; Information and communication technologies; Strategic orientation; Open innovation; Exploration; Exploitation; Innovation sources		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present research findings on the relation between internal/ external sources of innovation and information and communication technology (ICT) as a supporter/ enabler of facilities management (FM) organizations, as well as on the strategic orientation towards open innovation of FM organizations. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a qualitative research approach. The data collection includes qualitative semi-structured interviews with key FM managers and directors and secondary material such as company brochures, reports and information provided on the participating companies' websites. Findings - The results show that the FM organizations in the study sample are starting to develop and engage in open FM service innovations, even though they still mostly conduct closed innovation activities. The findings show that FM organizations mostly take an ambidextrous strategic orientation towards FM service innovations, while they also embrace an exploration approach. Concerning the role of ICT in FM service innovations, the study shows that in the explorative organizations, ICT was mostly an enabler, while in the ambidextrous organizations, ICT mostly supported and enabled the innovations in question. Only in two innovation instances was ICT identified as having a utility role. Practical implications - The findings of this study challenge researchers and managers to rethink how and why a strategic orientation towards innovation, the sources of innovation and the role of ICT might affect service innovation in FM organizations. One important implication for FM managers and researchers is the importance that the government might have as an external source in fostering FM service innovations, especially in light of changing environmental requirements, such as energy consumption. FM managers should also consider how they could use ICT to improve and innovate FM services and service delivery and the kind of sources (external/internal) they should use to carry out this task. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the empirical and theoretical understanding of the sources of innovation and ICT as a supporter/enabler, as well as the strategic orientation towards innovation in FM organizations.

J	Seppa, R				Seppa, Raul			Implication of inside-debt: signalling for bankruptcy probabilities within small firms	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Capital structure; Small firms; Inside-debt; Probability of bankruptcy	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; CAPITAL STRUCTURE; FINANCIAL RATIOS; SMALL BUSINESSES; AGENCY COSTS; ADJUSTMENT; ECONOMICS; COMPANIES; BEHAVIOR; EQUITY	Purpose - Small privately held firms extensively use debt provided by principal owners and households (inside-debt) as an alternative capital source to straight equity capital. The purpose of the research study is to investigate inside-debt-bankruptcy relations. Design/methodology/approach - Inside-debt-bankruptcy relation is tested on three prominent bankruptcy prediction models using correlation and logit regression analysis. Sample consists of 314 Estonian small firms. Financial reports of 2007 are modelled against bankruptcies declared in 2009. Findings - Results imply that users of inside-debt are less profitable; they have weaker liquidity position and less retained earnings. Leverage is not found to be significant determinant between inside-debt users and non-users. Fundamental finding of the study suggests that the use of inside-debt is significantly and positively related to bankruptcy probability. While inside-debt carries no risk elements per se, findings are robust to indicate that the use of inside-debt has significant power to signal for increasing bankruptcy risk and as such, reducing information asymmetry of small firms. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to single country data. Bankruptcy data fall to the period of economical recession. It is suggested to repeat the study in a normal economical situation and to extend sample size over different countries. Practical implications - Findings contribute to the understanding of firms' financial risk, firm behaviour and capital structure development.

This study investigates the impact of temporal elements on career selection decisions, thus advancing our understanding of both career decision making and the impact of timing on decision making. We investigate the influence of timing and duration of experience with career options on career selection decisions in an archival study using medical residents' rotation schedules. We also investigate factors that mitigate the influence of timing on career selection decisions by examining the interaction of timing with the duration of experience and the diversity of options that an individual experiences. Conditional logit results indicate that decisions often based on career and individual attributes are significantly influenced by the timing and duration of options even when controlling for option attributes. Additionally, significant interactions between timing and diversity of experience and timing and duration of experience revealed boundary conditions for timing. Individuals were more likely to select later-appearing career options when they appeared for a greater duration or when they experienced a greater diversity of options in their schedule. Results illustrate that schedules over which individuals have no control can influence consequential decisions.

British healthcare institutes stand to gain significantly from this, but currently lack significant presence and experience in the international sphere. We conducted a qualitative case study analysis of Moorfields Eye Hospital Dubai and Imperial College Diabetes Centre, Abu Dhabi, the only two British institutes to have internationalized thus far, to identify key strategic factors for successful overseas expansion. This involved a literature review, semi-structured interviews with top management personnel, and review of official documentation from each institute. Analysis of our findings led to the creation of the Drivers Region Management strategic considerations model, integrating the key factors identified, as a means of systematically guiding decision-making for future internationalization attempts. This will be further refined with stakeholder input and comparison with other countries, with the ultimate aim of developing a generalizable tool for British healthcare institutes.

Preventive evaluation of mould production cost in aluminium casting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Injection moulding; Aluminium; Mould production; Cost estimation; Geometrical indicators	TOOL; STEP	Preventive evaluation of costs is strategic for the whole manufacturing industry and especially for companies whose manufacturing technology is based on expensive machinery, tools and fixtures, such as injection moulding of aluminium. Preventive evaluation of production costs and time is even more relevant for the mould producer, in order to quickly prepare commercial offers with an acceptable degree of accuracy. In this paper, the application of a parametric approach for the evaluation of the labour content in the production of mould for injection moulding of aluminium automotive components is presented. The approach is based on simple geometrical features of the part to be produced derived from their 3D model using the basic tools of CAD systems. The data acquired from a specialized mould production company was analysed by factor analysis in order to determine the structure of the labour content and then parametric modelling was applied. The results evidenced an acceptable degree of accuracy of the estimate combined with an exceptional ease of application.

J	Stenstrom, C; Parida, A				Stenstrom, Christer; Parida, Aditya			Measuring performance of linear assets considering their spatial extension	JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Performance measurement; Maintenance; eMaintenance; Dependability; Linear assets; Railways		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how performance of linear assets can be analysed and displayed, considering both the technical asset and the user context, to simplify cognitive tasks of planning and decision making. Design/methodology/approach - Linear, or continuous assets, such as roads, railways, electrical grids and pipelines, are large, geographically spread out technical systems. Linear assets are comprised of system, subsystem and component levels. Thus, asset managers are involved with each level of the linear asset; asset management has strategic, tactical and operational levels. A methodology is developed to link together the technical and organisational levels and to measure asset performance considering their spatial extension. Geographical location and time are used as independent variables. Findings - For performance measurement of linear assets, it is found that the spatial extension is an equally generic dimension as time is for technical assets in general. Furthermore, as linear assets actually are combinations of linear and point assets; separate analysis of these assets is a prerequisite. Asset performance has been studied in a case study in terms failures and cost; the results indicate that the methodology visualise poor, as well as good, performance in an easy to interpret manner. Besides, the results indicate that other parameters related to dependability can be presented in a similar way. Practical implications - This study highlights the importance of including the spatial or geographical extension of linear assets in infrastructure managers' performance measurement. It is believed that the methodology can make planning and decision making more effective by pointing out improvement areas in technical assets, in a way that is appealing to both technicians and managers. Social implications - As infrastructure managers are improving their analysis and visualisation of performance, the public's interest of following the information increases, which in turn contributes to the connection between infrastructure managers and the public. Originality/value - The presented methodology and case study analysed performance in function of both the technical and organisational levels, including the spatial component. It is believed that the methodology for analysing and visualising performance of linear assets is distinctive.

JOURNAL ON EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIBILITY IN EDUCATION AND SCIENCE			English	Article						Tacit knowledge; artificial intelligence; strategic management; experiential learning; neural network	SKILL	In the paper we first examine students' ability to use tacit knowledge. We conducted the experiment to test whether the students are able to transfer and use tacit knowledge they obtained in the basic course of Strategic management. As tacit knowledge is difficult to transfer to another person we used course design with several experiential techniques to increase the students' abilities in the field of Strategic management. For the evaluation experiment we chose to play a board game "Power Grid", where we tested whether the students were able to use knowledge they had been taught in the basic course. As the result we found out low students' ability to use tacit knowledge. Despite the fact that in the basic course where they obtained the knowledge we used experiential techniques. Used techniques force students to acquire a skill and therefore, they also acquire corresponding understanding that defies articulation i.e. tacit knowledge. According to the result of the experiment, we propose the business game with the artificial intelligence as a teaching tool which can be further discussed as a tool for teaching specific tacit knowledge in the paper.

J	Tamosiunas, A				Tamosiunas, Andrius			The model for evaluation of corporate strategic changes in the context of climate change: plywood manufacture	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product competitiveness; carbon emissions trading scheme; strategic changes; climate change; all-round evaluation; business development; evaluation	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; PERFORMANCE; MOMENTUM; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; INERTIA	The paper presents the model for evaluation of corporate management measures aimed at solving tasks related to climate change challenges (UN 1998; EP 2009; EC 2013) faced by enterprises and inevitably leading to corporate strategic changes. In a detailed yet concise manner, the paper analyses the model for evaluation of corporate strategic changes and specifies techniques for its application focusing on the following proposed criteria: the market share; financial capacity; business development potential; product competitiveness; and productivity. The paper reveals the benefit of the use of the proposed model for corporate strategic changes. Greater possibilities are created to rationalise the process of corporate strategic changes and the use as well as development of human, material and financial potentials, which lead to greater competitiveness of an enterprise. The model guides to directions and actions to be taken in order to continue increasing effectiveness of an enterprise in the context of climate change objectives. The evaluation model suggested by the author is also analysed according to flexibility of proposed techniques, the characteristics of which can be modified and adjusted depending on specifics of the changing business environment. This allows ensuring and promoting competitiveness of an enterprise while pursuing the climate change challenges (UN 1998; EP 2009; EC 2013) set for businesses.

J	Thurlby, R; Warren, K				Thurlby, Robert; Warren, Kim			Understanding and managing the threat of disruptive events to the critical national infrastructure	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Modelling; Utilities; Critical national infrastructure; Disruption; Risk and resilience; Simulation		Purpose - This paper aims to describe a high-level model portraying the relationships between operational, investment, commercial and regulatory pressures, and reports the early findings from testing alternative strategies, both over the long-and short-term. Concern about the vulnerability of utility networks (electricity, gas and water) and other infrastructures, including transport and telecommunications, to environmental, terrorist and other threats has increased in recent years. This has been motivated both by a perceived increase in such threats and by recognition that the commercial pressures and regulation of companies operating these infrastructures could unintentionally have increased that risk. Powerful simulation tools already help utility operators develop asset investment polices to improve both the performance and resilience of their networks, while others have helped increase their capability to respond efficiently when disruptive events occur. However, these tools need to be further developed to increase understanding of how the interdependencies between operational, investment, commercial and regulatory pressures influence and eventually define the strategic policies available to these organisations and what the long- run consequences will be for the resilience of these systems and hence for service continuity. Design/methodology/approach - Use of system dynamics methods and tools to develop a new approach to strategy and policy development for risk management for organisations operating the critical national infrastructure. Findings - System dynamics is a valid approach to address the problem of understanding risk and developing risk mitigation and management strategies for organisations operating the critical national infrastructure. To develop policies that will effectively manage and mitigate risk in the critical national infrastructure, it is essential to identify and model the interactions and interdependencies between the organisational, investment, commercial and regulatory factors. Research limitations/implications - The research has developed a proof-of-concept model and set of simulation tools which produce good results using test data from one type of organisation operating in the critical national infrastructure. The model has not been tested using data from other types of organisations. Similarly, the software written in the model has not been tested in operational conditions and further testing will be required. Practical implications - The model at the moment can only be applied to single organisation. The interactions between organisations are not in scope. Originality/value - Although some work in the field using simulation tools and methods has been done in the USA, the use of system dynamics and its application to the specific situation on the UK and Europe is new. The model uses earlier work which applied system dynamics to the subject of asset investment planning, but is a major step forward from this work. Risk and resilience is one of the major challenges facing operators of the critical national structure. This work will be of potential value to all these organisations.

This article reports on a study conducted with the aim of determining the relationship between marketing intelligence (MI) and strategic marketing in South African organisations. A quantitative survey was conducted among 166 South African marketing decision-makers. The findings suggest a substantial gap between the importance and availability of key types of MI. Marketing decision-makers found the traditional MI and marketing tools of great value in supporting marketing decision-making, but the value of several of the newer MI tools and technologies was less clear. An analysis of MI practices suggested that MI quality and particularly information and communication technology (ICT) support for MI are areas requiring further attention.

J	Wang, CF				Wang, Chi-Feng			International diversification and firm performance: the moderating effects of corporate governance	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						international diversification; corporate governance; performance; managerial compensation; board composition	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BOARD COMPOSITION; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; PRODUCT DIVERSIFICATION; EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION; STRATEGIC CONTROL; MULTINATIONALITY; INVESTMENT; DIRECTORS; AGENCY	In spite of plentiful research on the international diversification-performance relationship, the link between the arrangement of governance systems and the performance of internationally diversified firms is under-explored. Drawing on complementary theoretical perspectives, this study examines the moderating effect of corporate governance on the relationship between international diversification and firm performance. The results show that firms experience superior performance in international diversification when they pay higher levels of managerial compensation, have a larger proportion of independent board members, and separate the roles of CEO and board chairman. This study contributes by showing that firms might alleviate challenges in managing international transactions, and thus improve the performance outcome of their foreign operations, through implementing better arrangements of corporate governance.

J	Weinstein, A				Weinstein, Art			Segmenting B2B technology markets via psychographics: an exploratory study	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						segmentation; psychographics; firmographics; target marketing; business markets; technology companies	SEGMENTATION PRACTICES	This article examines how marketing executives employ psychographics as part of their target marketing strategy in business technology markets. In spite of the increased attention in the recent business-to-business segmentation literature, psychographics is not used as a major segmentation dimension (only one in five companies used this base). Psychographic thinking without formal analysis, however, was a commonly used strategy evidenced by 59% of the companies. While there was no difference in target marketing success found between formal and informal psychographics, both approaches fared significantly better than firms not bringing a psychographic mindset to their segmentation strategy. Firmographic and demographic variables did not impact the use of organizational psychographics. Motivation, relationship and risk variables were used by marketing managers as psychographic inputs. Implications for management practice and a research agenda for segmentation scholars are presented.

J	Woods, M; Miles, MP				Woods, Megan; Miles, Morgan			Collaborative development of enterprise policy A process model for developing evidence-based policy recommendations using community focused strategic conversations and SERVQUAL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Entrepreneurs; Small firms; Service quality; Government; Stakeholder analysis	SMALL BUSINESS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP	Purpose - The aim of this paper is to integrate an augmented version of the Thompson et al. model of enterprise policy, delivery, practice and research with services marketing models including SERVQUAL and strategic conversations; and demonstrate a practical application of the analysed through the application of N-Vivo qualitative data classification software to create more satisfying enterprise policy recommendations that better reflect the voices of SMEs and other stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - A five-stage iterative process model to integrate stakeholder input into enterprise policy recommendations is developed through integrating services marketing theory and the Thompson et al. model into a field study of community conversations hosted by the Tasmanian Department of Economic Development, Tourism and the Arts, Regional Development Australia's Tasmanian committee, and local governments. Findings - The five-stage iterative model leverages strategic conversations, analysis (through N-Vivo), comments and revisions, recommendation co-creation, and policy assessment using SERQUAL to craft more satisfying policy recommendations. Research limitations/implications - The first limitation was the time and costs associated with conducting the community consultation workshops and analysing the data. The second limitation was the inability to craft policy quickly in response to a changing environment due to the time taken to collect and transcribe the data, undertake the analysis, and develop and report policy recommendations. The third limitation was the complexity of coordinating three levels of government, which took time and effort because each level had different interests and time frames and were at times distracted by other priorities. Originality/value - This paper contributes to better enterprise policy by providing a process model developed using both theory and a field study to illustrate how policy makers can co-develop policy that is more satisfying to policy stakeholders.

Since the birth of China's modern hotel industry in the late 1970s, state-owned hotels have dominated the industry throughout the country in terms of the total number of rooms. As state-owned assets, the evolution of this special lodging sector has been significantly affected by Chinese government policies. This study first provides a comprehensive review of how government policies have affected China's state-owned hotels in the past and then discusses the most recent hotel-related government policies and their impact on a number of critical strategic issues, including ownership shifting, growth of domestic groups and brand development. The future development trends of China's state-owned hotels are also provided.

It extends the PC transparent computing to mobile terminals. Since resources contain different kinds of operating systems and user data that are stored in a remote server, how to manage the network resources is essential. In this paper, we apply the technologies of quick emulator (QEMU) virtualization and mobile agent for mobile transparent computing (MTC) to devise a method of managing shared resources and services management (SRSM). It has three layers: a user layer, a manage layer, and a resource layer. A mobile virtual terminal in the user layer and virtual resource management in the manage layer cooperate to maintain the SRSM function accurately according to the user's requirements. An example of SRSM is used to validate this method. Experiment results show that the strategy is effective and stable.

J	Yuan, XN; Kim, S; Dai, WW; Arnulf, JK				Yuan, Xina; Kim, SangYong; Dai, Wanwen; Arnulf, Jan Ketil			How FIEs may sustain competitive advantage in China Adapting marketing strategy by the use of Guanxi	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive advantage; Strategic orientation; Entry mode; Competition type; Marketing capability	LEARNING ORIENTATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; EMERGING MARKETS; CAPABILITIES; BUSINESS; IMPACT; TRANSITION; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that the Guanxi characteristics in Chinese business culture may add to the understanding of foreign invested enterprise's (FIE) successful marketing in China Design/methodology/approach - The authors surveyed the entry mode of 296 FIEs in China and examined their way of adapting marketing strategy to local culture. The authors used a conceptual model hypothesizing a system of variables that the authors subsequently tested using structural equation modeling. Findings - Market orientation was insufficient to obtain marketing capability in China. FIE marketing capability in China was dependent on Guanxi and learning orientation, showing the need for contextualization of marketing approaches. Research limitations/implications - This paper enriches previous research on marketing and makes a contribution to the existing literature on practical management in China It is also relevant for marketing in other markets in transition. Practical implications - FIEs may develop these capabilities on their own or succeed trough partnering in China. The study also points at similar mechanisms in other emerging markets and economies in transition from previous socialist economies. Originality/value - The authors attempt to explore the main factors driving the marketing capabilities of FIEs in China. Few articles have shown how foreign companies may adopt Guanxi orientation to do this, which is the object of the present study.

J	Zampetakis, LA				Zampetakis, Leonidas			Sales force management practices in organizations with a supportive climate towards creativity	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						sales force management; organizational creativity; exploratory SEM	WORK-ENVIRONMENT; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION	In this research paper, the author draws on the theoretical insights of the organizational creativity and marketing literatures, and empirically examines the link between creative working environments and human resource management practices in the sales force. A questionnaire survey from a random sample of 168 sales managers from different industries was used. Exploratory structural equation modeling and independent t-tests were used for the analyses. Results provide evidence that companies with working environments that support creativity place greater importance in the implementation of general sales force management practices, namely (1) selection and placement, (2) training, (3) performance appraisal, and (4) pay and bonus systems compared to firms with less supporting environments toward creativity.

J	Zimmer, B; Cardinal, JSL; Yannou, B; Le Cardinal, G; Piette, F				Zimmer, Benjamin; Cardinal, Julie Stal-Le; Yannou, Bernard; Le Cardinal, Gilles; Piette, Francois			A methodology for the development of innovation clusters: application in the healthcare sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						innovation cluster; innovation management; healthcare; project owner; conflict resolution; cluster development; value creation; industrial policy		For more than ten years, the French State and administrative regions have pursued economic development policies that stimulate all forms of innovation and encourage strategic market alliances of the economic stakeholders of a region. These 'cluster' policies aim to create ecosystems that are conducive to innovation and promote the emergence of collaborative organisations. Among these innovation clusters, we are concerned with those in the healthcare field pertaining to ageing and autonomy. Business models and action plans for these collaborative organisations are neither easy to define nor easy to stabilise and reinforce, because of the diversity of stakeholders with multiple expectations involved. This paper presents an application of the FAcT-Mirror method in the Sol'iage (http://www.soliage.com/english-version/) innovation cluster during its development stage. We demonstrate that the FAcT-Mirror method is particularly efficient and effective during the process of transformation from the emerging stage (stage of intention) to the development stage (stage of action) for a healthcare cluster to collectively produce common tools (definitions, strategy, working groups, and action plans).

J	Erickson, GS; Rothberg, HN				Erickson, G.; Rothberg, Helen			Alternative Metrics for Assessing Knowledge Assets	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge management; intellectual capital; strategy; Tobin's q	CAPABILITIES; FIRM	This paper analyzes two different approaches to assessing the knowledge assets of multiple firms in a given industry. Typically, in evaluating knowledge management (KM) results by measuring intellectual capital (IC), studies in the field have looked specifically at individual firms or a small cluster of organisations. Measuring a large number of firms has proven more of a challenge even though the discipline has some established metrics to do so, principally those using some variation of Tobin's q. In moving such methodologies forward, we look at two variations on Tobin's q for assessing KM requirements in an industry and the relative level of KM success in member firms. We contrast different industries with apparently different KM circumstances, allowing some deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our two metrics. These results will be of interest to those studying KM and IC as they provide guidance in evaluating performance (as well as the need to invest in order to keep up with industry top performers). For the same reason, the results and methodology will inform practitioners taking a strategic approach to knowledge investment, giving them a way to assess relative standing within and across industries. KM strategies can and should differ, and these metrics provide guidance for such decisions.

J	Harrod, S				Harrod, Steven			A Method for Robust Strategic Railway Dispatch Applied to a Single Track Line	TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL			English	Article						Timetabling; integer programming; network capacity; railways		A method is presented for global optimization of a dispatch plan assuming perfect information over a given time horizon. An example problem is solved for the North American case of a single dominant high-speed train sharing a network with a majority flow of slower trains. Initial dispatch priority and speed changes to selected trains consume network capacity; but incremental speed increases of these trains, combined with appropriate dispatch strategies, are beneficial to the network as a whole. Further, specific siding enhancements demonstrate measureable improvements in network flow.

Institutions and channels of supply and communication have disappeared or become unreliable; we are literally managing in chaos, and traditional notions of strategy, planning, and implementation must be (temporarily, it is to be hoped) discarded. This presentation draws on classic management theory, newer ideas, and experiences from technology companies to outline principles for managing for survival in times of chaos. It introduces new management cycles as alternatives to Fayol's classic management cycle, and a corresponding taxonomy of organizational situations, including stable, chaos, edge of chaos, and disaster. It aims for a clear synthesis suitable for management education and training.

Analyzing ownership effects on IPO performance	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						initial public offering; ownership; issue price premium; signalling theory; aggregated ownership	INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS; LONG-RUN PERFORMANCE; OPERATING PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE-OWNERSHIP; VENTURE CAPITALISTS; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; CANADIAN EVIDENCE; RISK-TAKING; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	This study revisits current practice that ownership holding at IPO has a homogeneous impact on IPO performance. Using signalling theory, we develop and test a conceptual model explaining the relationships between the aggregated ownership structure and IPO price premium. We argue that aggregated ownership has a direct effect on issue price premium, and offer specific hypotheses on the effect of the shares sold during the offering by each type of owner on IPO performance. We use archival data from a sample of US firms that issued IPOs between 1996 and 2000 and find a significant direct effect of ownership configuration, namely, heterogeneity in effect of each ownership type on IPO performance as well as interaction effects between different ownership types.

J	Zhao, YF; Harding, N				Zhao, Yifan; Harding, Noel			Improving the Interpretation of Complex Audit Evidence: The Beneficial Role of Order Effects	ABACUS-A JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING FINANCE AND BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						Audit; Belief functions; Business risk auditing; Evidence evaluation; Evidentiary triangulation; Order effects; Strategic systems auditing		A principal element of business risk (or strategic systems) auditing is the goal of evaluating the degree of concordance between management representations and expectations derived from an understanding of the business environment. Peecher etal. (2007) argue that an effective means by which auditors may achieve this goal is through a process of evidentiary triangulation. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether the order with which auditors evaluate business environment, information systems and financial statement representations evidence has the potential, as suggested by belief function theory, to improve the effectiveness with which they interpret the complex interrelationships between these three sources of evidence. Analyzing judgements made by practicing auditors in an experimental setting, our results reveal that, when faced with negative business environment evidence that is in conflict with positive information systems and financial statement representations evidence, auditors assess the risk of material misstatement to be higher when they are presented with the critically important business environment evidence last, rather than, as is traditionally the case, first. There is, however, some evidence to suggest that the positive order effects may be attenuated by the requirement to document reasons underlying the judgements made. The results raise a number of practical and theoretical issues that give direction to future research in this important area.

J	Cuhadar, S; Tuglu, A; Gurdal, G				Cuhadar, Sami; Tuglu, Ayhan; Gurdal, Gultekin			New Electronic Resources Management System for the ANKOS Consortium	JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP			English	Article						Electronic resources management system; Electronic information resources; Evaluation of databases; Anatolian University Libraries Consortium		The Anatolian University Libraries Consortium (ANKOS), which was originally established to coordinate university libraries' electronic serials purchases, today plays an active role in selecting, providing access to, managing and evaluating electronic information resources in Turkey. A substantial volume of subscriptions and purchases of e-journal, e-book and e-reference resources is conducted through ANKOS. In order to measure the usage rate of these resources, to conduct cost analyses and to use the findings in strategic planning cycles of both the institutions and the consortium, a New Electronic Resources Management System (ERM) has been developed by ANKOS. In this study, the authors explain how the new system was developed, its technical features, data entry and collection, the system's contribution to the collection of institution and usage statistics, and its impact on strategic planning. Available statistical facts are also provided to illustrate the development and the impact of the new ERM system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Influence of Management and Environment on Local Health Department Organizational Structure and Adaptation: A Longitudinal Network Analysis	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						network analysis; performance improvement; public health informatics; public health systems	PUBLIC-HEALTH; TRANSACTIVE MEMORY; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	Objective: The nation's 2862 local health departments (LHDs) are the primary means for assuring public health services for all populations. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of organizational network analysis on management decisions in LHDs and to demonstrate the technique's ability to detect organizational adaptation over time. Design and Setting: We conducted a longitudinal network analysis in a full-service LHD with 113 employees serving about 187 000 persons. Network survey data were collected from employees at 3 times: months 0, 8, and 34. At time 1 the initial analysis was presented to LHD managers as an intervention with information on evidence-based management strategies to address the findings. At times 2 and 3 interviews documented managers' decision making and events in the task environment. Results: Response rates for the 3 network analyses were 90%, 97%, and 83%. Postintervention (time 2) results showed beneficial changes in network measures of communication and integration. Screening and case identification increased for chlamydia and for gonorrhea. Outbreak mitigation was accelerated by cross-divisional teaming. Network measurements at time 3 showed LHD adaptation to H1N1 and budget constraints with increased centralization. Task redundancy increased dramatically after National Incident Management System training. Conclusions: Organizational network analysis supports LHD management with empirical evidence that can be translated into strategic decisions about communication, allocation of resources, and addressing knowledge gaps. Specific population health outcomes were traced directly to management decisions based on network evidence. The technique can help managers improve how LHDs function as organizations and contribute to our understanding of public health systems.

Subsequently we determine each subsidiary's host-country fit and test for within country differences in using local training and skill practices. We find the extent of continuing vocational education and training and the extent to which training on the job is important to vary with host-country fit in Germany, while in Switzerland, as predicted, we find no such relations.

Such an approach, while worthwhile, does not provide a consistent foundation for data collection, analysis, or reporting to enable data-driven decision making. We describe a framework consisting of (1) data specification and collection, (2) predictive modeling, and (3) reporting for managing service provider risks associated with the execution of strategic outsourcing (SO) contracts and show how such a framework has been leveraged at IBM for managing financial risks associated with IBM's SO business. In particular, we provide details on the construction of quantitative models for proactive risk management and discuss the decision process driven by the model results.

Strategic groundwater resources planning in arid regions	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Arid region; Aridity index; Groundwater; Management; Risk; Strategy; Wadi		A strategic approach is presented for future groundwater reservoir planning in arid regions where the evaluation of groundwater resources is restricted by scarcity of rainfall, data paucity, restrictive and unrepresentative methodologies, weak economies, almost nonexisting management and optimization programs, frequent groundwater quality variables along short distances, etc. This paper explains the necessary steps in preparing an effective strategic planning program that is expected to provide all the necessary data for identifying alternative solution scenarios especially in arid regions. It is shown on the basis of available scarce data that the risk model of these factors appears as the logarithmic normal probability distribution. The basic decision variables in groundwater storage and recharge planning are furnished with application to Wadi Fatimah in the western central part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia along the Red Sea coast. The approach given in this paper provides a basic example for future groundwater reservoir strategic use and management studies in the Kingdom in particular and in any part of the arid regions of the world, in general.

Comparative impact of conventional and strategic worm management schemes in sheep flocks of arid Rajasthan	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Arid; Gastrointestinal nematodes; Rajasthan; Sheep; Worm management schemes	GASTROINTESTINAL NEMATODES; ANTHELMINTIC RESISTANCE; PARASITE CONTROL; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; GOATS; FARM	A study on comparative impact (in terms of worm profile and flock performance) of two schemes of worm management in naturally infected sheep flocks was made in arid Rajasthan. During the period from May 2004 to March 2012, sheep (8415) were monitored for gastrointestinal strongyles by examining 24,310 faecal samples as well as for production performance of flock. The monthly incidence and intensity of strongyle nematodes remained almost similar among flocks given either strategic (one drench / annum) or conventional (3 drenches / annum) anthelmintic treatment. The epidemiological profile exhibited higher magnitude of infection only during monsoon (June-October). The data on flock performance exhibited that reduction in anthelmintic frequency in strategic scheme as against conventional scheme had no adverse effect on flock performance and yields better financial return to farmers. The result reflected the value and success of single drench schedule (strategic scheme) for the effective management of predominant gastrointestinal nematodes in field flocks of arid Rajasthan which is based on systematically gathered epidemiological information.

J	Dang, JF; Hong, IH				Dang, Jr-Fong; Hong, I-Hsuan			The equilibrium quantity and production strategy in a fuzzy random decision environment: Game approach and case study in glass substrates industries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Fuzzy random variable; Game theory; Equilibrium quantity; Entropy; Case study	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL; MANAGEMENT; DEMAND; MARKET	This paper develops a two-stage Cournot production game that integrates strategic and operational planning under the fuzzy random environment, which to our best knowledge has not appeared in the literature. At the strategic level, two competing decision-makers determine the upper bound of a production quantity under a high-production strategy and the lower bound of the production quantity under a low-production strategy. Then at the operational level, the two competitors determine the range-type production quantity that is assumed to be a triangular fuzzy number represented by the apex and the entropies rather than a crisp value. The apex of a fuzzy equilibrium quantity can be obtained by the conventional Cournot game as the membership value is equal to one. A fuzzy random decision can be represented by entropies derived from the fuzzy random profit function of each firm in a specific production strategy. A case study of two leading firms in the glass substrates industry demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model. The finding that both firms would tend to adopt the common strategy coincides with observed real-world behavior. We conclude that our proposed method can provide decision-makers with a simple mathematical foundation for determining production quantity under a production strategy in a fuzzy random environment.

J	Fulford, R				Fulford, Richard			The Sales Process of Information Systems: Implications for Project Execution and Business Benefits	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						qualitative research; project management; strategic management	ENTERPRISE; ISSUES; IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; VALUATION; DECISION; MODEL	This inductive case study research examines the sales cycle of eight information systems (IS) providers situated in Australia, Hong Kong, Europe, and the United States. The study found that the IS sales cycle provides a restrictive covenant for ensuing projects with contractual constraints, having consequences for fundamental project factors such as benefits, scope, and cost. The process also impedes solution design, schedule, extent of customizations, and training. There are many implications for improvements to practice, in particular there should be more focus placed upon business benefits and increased awareness of life cycle cost during the sales process.

We consider two aspects: convergence of spectral density of moving average and autoregressive approximations when the covariances are known and when they are estimated. Under certain mild conditions on the spectral density and the covariance sequence, it is shown that the spectral densities of both approximations converge in L-2 as the order of approximation increases. It is also shown that the spectral density of AR approximations converges at the origin under the same conditions. Under additional regularity assumptions, we show that similar results hold for approximations from empirical covariance estimates. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Strategic choice and employment relations in Qantas and Jetstar	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES			English	Article						Australia; aviation; business level strategies; employee relations	AIRLINE INDUSTRY; ROAD	This paper examines the strategic choices made by Qantas Airways, a full-cost legacy airline, and its low-cost carrier, Jetstar, regarding employment relations in the context of increasingly competitive market pressures. Initially these airlines pursued divergent employment relations strategies. As the external environment became more turbulent, these employment strategies began to converge. Both airlines have adopted a hybrid approach to employment relations which is crucial in determining whether the Qantas group can survive the current turbulence in the aviation industry which threatens to the long-term viability of the airline. This research identifies the strategic role that employment relation strategies play in establishing a sustainable business model for airlines that are comprised of both a legacy and low-cost airline.

J	Amador-Jimenez, L; Amin, MSR				Amador-Jimenez, Luis; Amin, Md Shohel Reza			Simulating Freight Traffic between Atlantic Canada and Quebec to Support Pavement Management on New Brunswick's Regional Highways	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Pavement management; Deterioration; Decision making; Planning; Economic factors; Simulation; Canada; Pavement; Deterioration; Management; Decision making; Planning; Spatial; Economics	TRANSPORTATION; MODELS	Traffic loading for pavement deterioration should be modeled as a dynamic indicator based on trip distribution derived from spatial economics. The estimation of modal distribution of trips and land development has been the main focus of integrated land use and transport models. However, no connection with transportation asset management has been established. This paper proposes the use of spatial economic simulation to forecast freight-traffic distribution to improve pavement-deterioration modeling. A case study of trade flows between Canada's Atlantic Provinces and Quebec is used to show the pitfall of current management models in estimating rates of deterioration, underfunding maintenance, and rehabilitation strategies. It was found that a total cost of $25 million could maintain adequate levels of condition under the current performance modeling; however, such a budget is inadequate when performance is based on forecasted truck traffic. It was also found that aggregation of pavements in a few homogeneous groups resulted in the inability to prioritize investments considering the economic relevance of the road in the region. This study suggests the use of individual deterioration models for strategic roads. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

However such administrative regions might not be optimal for the construction of regional price indexes. When producing housing price indexes, we often encounter problems with insufficient number of observations. One way to remedy this problem is to estimate a quarterly index instead of a monthly index. Another possible way to mitigate the thin markets problem is to construct indexes for geographically aggregated regions. However, the literature that discusses methods of dealing with the problem of thin markets and especially geographical aggregation is very rare. The goal of this paper is to construct a housing price index for a major part of Sweden, and to construct price index series for a number of regions. The number of regions, and how their boundaries should be created in order to construct reliable regional price indexes, is however an open question. We apply traditional hedonic methodology in order to estimate house price indexes for both predefined regions whose boundaries are based on a division of labor markets in Sweden, as well as a division of regions based on statistical cluster analysis. The results from this study suggest that regions should be clustered together based on regional price levels and/or price development as clustering variables. If only geographical proximity is used as clustering variable, our computations show that there is a high risk that we end up with some clusters having large standard errors, which in turn might result in inaccurate indexes.

EXPLORATION OF THE PRESALE PROPERTY MARKET IN CHINA FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Asymmetric information; Presale property; Institutions and regulations	DEVELOPERS	Presales have been used as a major financing mode for real estate development in China. However, there have been limited researches studying the roles of different real estate market players impacting on the efficiency of the property presales, in particular, on the issue of asymmetric information in the market. The paper adopted an institutional approach to study the problems latent in the presale property market. Semi-structured interviews with professionals and industry practitioners were conducted and the findings suggested that the lack of market information, pseudo policy objectives and confusing roles played by major market players are the root of the problems. Restructuring of the institutional arrangement in regard to the financial channels for capital, risk management on developers, custody of the presale proceeds and commitment of the regulatory authorities are necessary in enhancing the market efficiency.

J	Olsson, E; Funk, P; Andersson, A				Olsson, Ella; Funk, Peter; Andersson, Alf			Case-based reasoning applied to geometric measurements for decision support in manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision support systems; Experience reuse; Case-based reasoning; Quality improvement		Measurements from products are continuously collected to allow adjustments in the production line to certify a feasible product quality. Case-based reasoning is a promising methodology for this type of quality assurance. It allows product measurements and its related adjustments to the production line to be stored as cases in a case-based reasoning system. The idea is to describe an event of adjustments based on deviations in geometric measurement points on a product and connect these measurements to their correlated adjustments done to the production line. Experience will implicitly be stored in each case in the form of uniquely weighted measurement points according to their positive influence on adjustments. Methods have been developed in order to find these positive correlations between measurements and adjustments by analysing a set of historical product measurement and their following adjustments. Each case saved in the case base will be "quality assured'' according to this methods and only cases containing strong positive correlations will be used by the system. The correlations will be used to supply each case with its own set individual weights.

Environmental and Organizational Influences on Magnet Hospital Recognition	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR; RURAL HOSPITALS; DETERMINANTS; INNOVATION; ADOPTION; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; MARKET	This article reports on research studying the influence of environmental and organizational factors on the adoption of the magnet hospital concept. Although research has been reported on the adoption of innovations by healthcare organizations, research on factors influencing the adoption of administrative advances remains an important area to investigate. Logistic regression was used to determine both the significance and direction of the association of environmental and organizational factors with innovation adoption. In addition, the size and type of the hospitals in the sample was used as a control variable. It was found for environmental factors that environmental complexity and community resources were associated with innovation adoption and that competition and network externalities were not. For the organizational factors examined, it was found that organizational complexity and control of domain were associated with innovation adoption. Slack resources and external communications were not associated with adoption. The findings from this study contribute to healthcare management research by enhancing the understanding of the innovation adoption process. The results have important implications for both healthcare providers and policy makers.

Rebuilding a Statewide Network of Community Health Centers for the Medically Underserved: A Longitudinal Assessment	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						architecture; facility performance; longitudinal research; occupant needs; medically underserved communities; strategic planning		The Strategic Facility Improvement (SFI) initiative, has resulted in the replacement of 44 outpatient clinics and 28 clinic renovation capital improvement projects across Louisiana's 64 parishes. A total of $ 67.3 million has been invested in this effort to date. The goal of the SFI is to improve the health status of medically underserved patient populations. It remains the sole capital improvement effort of its kind and has been in continuous implementation since 1991. The SFI consists of predesign needs assessment, analysis of alternate site planning options, historic preservation options in the adaptation of noteworthy community civic resources to healthcare uses, and the postoccupancy assessment of completed capital improvements with the aim of learning positive lessons that can be carried into future efforts. It is based on advocacy and guided by a statewide public health agency. The discussion is centered on a status report on a 21-year period and is examined critically from the perspective of key stakeholders.

A truthful representation of the part behaviour is therefore essential. Moreover, variation simulation of non-rigid parts is today performed by finite element analysis (FEA). FEA-based methods demand meshed models that correspond to the final engineering design to calculate the correct stiffness matrix. However, geometrical models in early phases have significantly lower level of detail. Approximate methods are therefore considered as options to better deal with this restriction. In this paper, an approximate non-FEA-based simulation method, based on a mesh morphing approach, has been the subject of a case study to evaluate its acceptance and applicability. It involved a focus group and individual interviews with engineers and project managers from two companies within the automotive industry. The study shows that providing the possibility to perform visualisation activities in the early phases is highly sought after, both on an engineering level and on a management level. Furthermore, a number of application scenarios for this type of approximate method were proposed. The study also identified strengths and risks of visualising the effects of geometrical variation in this way.

J	Yousefi, H				Yousefi, H.			Strategic Planning for Port Development: Improvement of Container Transit from the Iranian Southern Ports Terminals	TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								The author attempts to highlight the significance of the Iranian southern ports development strategy planning which allows for the maximum container transit with minimum resources such as service capacities, human resources, and financial potential in order to expand the Iranian container transit. It should be noted that the strategic objectives, the business strategy and its implementation can be arranged only after the port vision and mission obviously delineated. For the purpose of improving the outcome of the ports operational management, it is recommended to concentrate on new strategies such as exploit of transit corridors for development of the Iranian South Ports. The main part of this paper is dedicated to evaluate the role of container transit from the Iranian south ports terminals from various transport corridors in order to improve Maritime Transport in Iran. The importance of defining the existing and potential competitors at the Persian Gulf and making a comparison between their and our own strengths and weaknesses is of utmost importance. Sometimes, the real business opportunities and threats are placed beyond one's own line of industry and business. It is therefore necessary to make a careful analysis of the port environment. After the port competition and environment have been analyzed, it would be possible to initiate the building of the SWOT analysis for the Iranian Southern Container Terminals such as Khoramshahr, Imam Khomani, Busher, Bandar Abbas and Chabahar port which have suitable strategic position as transit base in the region. The SWOT analysis method is therefore applied aiming at defining the weaknesses and strengths of the economic subjects as well as opportunities and threats coming from the environment. The next segment of this paper is dedicated to consider the role of dry ports and the International North-South Transit Corridor for the purpose of improving the Iranian container trade.

J	Fukuda, R; Ehara, M				Fukuda, Ryoichi; Ehara, Masahiro			Theoretical study of the electronic excitations of free-base porphyrin-Ar-2 van der Waals complexes	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; MOLECULAR-ORBITAL METHODS; CONTINUUM SOLVATION MODELS; VISIBLE ABSORPTION MAXIMA; SYMMETRY-ADAPTED-CLUSTER; LINEAR-RESPONSE METHODS; GAUSSIAN-TYPE BASIS; WAVE-FUNCTION; SAC-CI; EXCITED-STATES	The intermolecular interaction of free-base porphine (FBP)-Ar-2 and free-base tetraazaporphyrin (FBPz)-Ar-2 van der Waals (vdW) complexes was calculated in the ground state and vertical excitations that correspond to the Q- and B-bands using the many-body wavefunction theory of the symmetry-adapted cluster-configuration interaction (SAC-CI) method and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). For the 1(1)B(3u) state of FBP-Ar-2 a blueshift (high-energy shift) of excitation energy was calculated using the SAC-CI method; such a blueshift was not obtained by TDDFT calculations. This calculated blueshift corresponds to the experimentally observed blueshift in the Q(x)-band of FBP for FBP-Ar-n complexes. For FBPz-Ar-2, blueshifts of the Q-band were not obtained using SAC-CI and TDDFT. These behaviors of the energy shift of the Q-bands could not be explained by the point dipole-point dipole interaction model. Large redshifts (low-energy shift) were obtained for the B-band states (2(1)B(3u) and 2(1)B(2u)) of FBP and FBPz. The energy shift showed the inverse sixth-power dependence on the intermolecular distance. The point dipole-point dipole interaction model can describe the redshift of the B-band. For the excited states that exhibit large redshifts, the TDDFT can qualitatively describe the vdW interaction in the excited states by supermolecular calculations. The solvatochromic shifts for FBP and FBPz in an Ar matrix were examined by the linear-response polarizable continuum model and TDDFT. The magnitude of calculated solvatochromic redshifts is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

Analytical Approach to a Two-stage Queuing Network for the Planning of Outfitting Processes in Shipbuilding	JOURNAL OF SHIP PRODUCTION AND DESIGN			English	Article						planning; queuing network; queuing theory; shipbuilding		As an important part of shipbuilding, outfitting can represent a major portion of the material cost as well as the construction time of a vessel. However, as a result of disturbances caused by unexpected delays, system variations, and technological constraints, scheduling of outfitting processes is therefore complex and can lead to major construction delays. To improve the shipbuilding system efficiency in the presence of variation, a two-stage strategic-level outfitting planning model has been developed. The results of the model provide the optimal percentage of outfitting work that should be completed at each stage given the introduction of variation. The model presented can be used as a benchmark for current ship-outfitting management decisions.

ENABLERS OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT ACROSS BORDERS: A STRUCTURAL APPROACH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organization; enabler; knowledge management; SECI; ba; culture; leadership; work style		Although knowledge has been cited as one of the most important strategic assets, the creation and sharing of knowledge at the organizational level is a difficult process that will not proceed without incentives and conscious efforts by management. The complexity of knowledge management (KM) is further compounded by the influence of a wide variety of factors such as leadership, ba, organizational culture, organizational control and individual work styles. Based on a large dataset gathered from a questionnaire survey of a multi-national Japanese pharmaceutical company and its subsidiary in the US, we compare how the aforementioned organizational factors influence KM, expressed through the SECI model of socialization, externalization, combination and internalization. The results of a structural equation modeling path analysis show that a single model of KM should not be applied unilaterally to both organizations, although part of the same company, and instead may need to be adapted to each stage of KM maturity.

With this article, we looked to characterize the typical profile of these enterprises in agreement with the Dunning Model to confirm if this typology is adequate for the characterization of internationalization strategies. We also explored the Theory of the Cultural Dimensions of Hofstede. While doing this, we analyzed which model measures the strategic alignment and is more orientated in terms of: (i) exploration of natural resources and advantages of costs of labor not qualified (resource seeking), advantages; (ii) location and synergies of market (market seeking), investments; (iii) search of strategic assets of the type efficiency seeking (for what they look to rationalize the production and to explore savings of specialization and location), investments; and (iv) type of strategic asset seeking (turned to the acquisition of resources and competences with the objective to develop competitiveness through of the innovation and growth of strategic capacities). We also summarize the referential system that makes possible the development of future inquiries for the delineation of the principal strategies, of the public politics of the National States, and also the financial strategies of these enterprises.

Mature or emerging markets: Competitive duopoly investment decisions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						OR in strategic planning; Project portfolio management; Game theory	DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS; INNOVATION; PORTFOLIO; SELECTION; MODEL	We develop a competitive investment model wherein two competing firms consider investing into two projects targeting, separately, a mature and an emerging market. The returns firms obtain from investments into these markets are assumed to follow an S-shaped curve and depend on both firms' actions. Considering symmetric environments (in terms of investment opportunities), we find that different forms of interactions may arise (e.g., Prisoner's Dilemma and Game of Chicken) and outline corresponding strategies that offer higher returns by exploiting first-mover advantages, cooperation opportunities and aggressive choices. We also discuss the market conditions that can lead to these outcomes. Finally, considering non-symmetric environments, we show that a firm may be better off when its competitor's budget increases.

This paper proposes a predictive channel scanning and switching (PCSS) algorithm that efficiently avoids WiFi interference. In this PCSS algorithm that is based on an IEEE 802.15.4e-2012 multi-channel communication network, each device rapidly senses the interference and switches the channel. This paper evaluates the performance of PCSS by comparing it with existing methods and shows that PCSS is superior.

J	Olson, CL				Olson, Christa Lee			A Canadian Lens on Facilitating Factors for North American Partnerships	JOURNAL OF STUDIES IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION			English	Article						strategic institutional management of internationalization; internationalization of higher education; internationalization of teaching; learning and research; mobility of students and academic staff; international cooperation in higher education; international exchange programs		What does it take to develop and maintain effective international education partnerships between institutions in the Canada, Mexico, and United States? This was a driving question for the qualitative study funded by a Fulbright-Enders-Garcia grant examining the relationship between North American partnerships and campus internationalization. Administrators, professors, and students at four institutions in Quebec, Canada and two institutions in Mexico shared institutional documents and their perspectives on North American partnerships and campus internationalization to help eluminate this relationship. This article features a Canadian lens on what factors contribute to effective partnership development with institutions in Mexico and the United States. The qualitative case study approach yields data on the facilitative institutional documents, administrative structures, and supporting mechanisms that exists within a given institution. Through probing interviews with diverse stakeholders, this approach also yields the human dimensionthat is the factors that facilitate individual efforts to craft and maintain partnerships. The piece features primarily the internal workings at work on one side of the partnership equationin this case within the Canadian institutions. Internationalization champions who are initiating new North American partnerships or seeking to maximize the effectiveness of existing international partnerships are the intended audience. It draws illustrations from the case studies to substantiate the argument that through the combination of visionary leadership, facilitative mechanisms, and competent internationalization leaders who are intentionally collaborating successful partner relationships are established and sustained. It is clearly critical in this global era for institutions to develop international partnerships that advance individual research agendas and student global learning. The issue at hand is how might leaders articulate their vision and organize their institutional structures so that these partnerships contribute as well as they might to advancing student global learning. Drawing elements of good practice from each case, this piece offers a structural model for maximizing partnership engagement.

J	Platonova, EA; Hernandez, SR				Platonova, Elena A.; Hernandez, S. Robert			Innovative Human Resource Practices in US Hospitals: An Empirical Study	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; HR; RETENTION; SETTINGS; QUALITY	Contemporary organizations increasingly recognize human resource (HR) capabilities as a source of sustained competitive advantage; about 80% of an organization's value is attributable to intangible assets, including human assets and capital. Some scholars consider effective human resource management (HRM) the single most important factor affecting organizational performance. This study examined (1) the extent to which HRM strategies were included in organizational strategic planning and (2) the association between the involvement of senior HR professionals in strategic planning and the use of innovative HR practices in U.S. hospitals employing strategic HRM theory. A survey was administered to 168 chief executive officers and HR executives from 85 hospitals during spring 2005. Binary logistic regression was conducted to determine whether HRM involvement was associated with the use of innovative HRM strategies in the hospitals. We found significant associations between HRM strategy inclusion in the strategic planning process and senior HR professionals' involvement in organizational strategic planning and in three innovative HR activities: finding talent in advance for key job openings (odds ratio [OR] = 4.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-7.38), stressing organizational culture and values in the selection process (OR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.01-3.97), and basing individual or team compensation on goal-oriented results (OR = 6.17, 95% CI: 1.17-3.37). Our data indicate that innovative HR practices were underused in some U.S. hospitals despite their potential to improve overall hospital performance.

Moreover, the advent of the web as a main distribution channel imposes to manage heterogeneous types of data and to deal with the issue of finding efficiently the pertinent information becomes more and more important. Several approaches such as semantic annotation, data mining, virtual and interactive visualizations are nowadays available to address these specific issues. However, so far, they have not been jointly exploited in order to take advantage of their respective strong points. In this paper we introduces a novel approach that combines semantic annotation, data mining, virtual queries and interactive visualization techniques aiming to provide the user with a personal information manager capable of dealing with heterogeneous database formats (relational, semantic, etc.). As a proof of the concept and its feasibility, in this paper we present a first prototype of the framework Memoria-Mea, that integrates these different approaches.

J	Elijido-Ten, EO				Elijido-Ten, Evangeline O.			Determinants of strategic performance measurement system disclosures in Australia's Top 100 publicly listed firms	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A strategic performance measurement system (SPMS) enables firms to translate strategies, objectives and targets into an integrated set of financial and non-financial measures covering a range of perspectives. The purpose of this study is to investigate the determinants of SPMS disclosures by examining whether significant relationships exist between voluntary SPMS disclosure practice and various corporate characteristics including profitability, age, size and industry. It also aims to explore whether uncertainty in the business environment arising from the onset of the global financial crisis may affect disclosure decisions. Content analysis of publicly available data is conducted focusing on the Top 100 publicly listed firms in Australia. Logistic regressions are used to test the hypotheses developed based on the predictions from voluntary disclosure and socio-political theories. The results show that firm age, size and industry prominence are significantly related to SPMS disclosures. However, the suggestion that business uncertainty may affect SPMS disclosures is not supported.

J	Fulli-Lemaire, N				Fulli-Lemaire, Nicolas			An inflation-hedging strategy with commodities	JOURNAL OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES			English	Article								Recent academic studies have shown that, since the mid-1990s, the pass-through of exogenous oil shocks into headline inflation has been increasing, while the pass-through into core inflation seems to have ceased. This paper explores the implications for inflation-hedging portfolios for which these recent works have paved the way, in terms of commodity allocation. We proceed by evidencing a link between the headline-to-core inflation spread and tradable commodities. We subsequently intend to exploit this link in two ways: by devising an efficient strategic allocation using core inflation forecasts to determine the commodities' natural weight in the portfolio as dictated by our macro approach, and by testing a tactical allocation strategy which would time the pass-through cycle to dynamically determine the optimal share of commodities in the allocation.

W. Lanchester; Patent management; Priority; Royal Aeronautical Society; Secrecy		During the first decade of the twentieth century, the long cherished ambition of powered flight was finally achieved. For the amateurs who had been exchanging information freely in pursuit of this common goal there appeared the new prospect of a commercial aviation industry, which posed more acutely the dilemma of whether to continue such open exchanges or to seek private profits through trade secrecy and patent protection. The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain espoused an ethos of open communication yet its Journal (established in 1897) encouraged its readers to obtain patent protection. Our paper explores this dilemma and analyses, in particular, the strategic use of publication and patents by the leading aero- and motor-engineer, F. W. Lanchester (1868-1946). With 426 patent applications to his name, not only was Lanchester a prolific patentee; he was also a regular contributor to engineering journals and the author of important works on the theory of aerodynamics and the military deployment of aircraft.

In our optimization approach for TC Chaba that approached the Ryukyu Islands in October 2010, the drag coefficient values are adjusted so that they saturate at extreme conditions, while the first guess increases with increasing wind speed. In addition, the latent heat exchange coefficient values are adjusted so that they significantly increase under extreme conditions relative to the first guess. Consequently, the term of the cost function, which represents the discrepancy between the model results and the observational data, decreases by 4.1-22.4% relative to the existing system after some spin-up cycles. The intensity and location of the TC are brought close to those of the corresponding best track produced at the Japan Meteorological Agency. Our optimization approach has the potential to improve the forecast skill.

J	Kumar, S; Boice, BC; Shepherd, MJ				Kumar, Sameer; Boice, Brooke C.; Shepherd, Mark J.			Risk Assessment and Operational Approaches to Manage Risk in Global Supply Chains	TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL			English	Article								Global supply chains encounter low-occurrence/high-disruption risks that are not addressed adequately by adding inventory. Although many operational risk-management tools exist, these tools and methods have not been synthesized into a comprehensive management system. This article evaluates risk-assessment methodologies and operational approaches to manage risk in global supply chains, and proposes a closed-loop risk-management system with inputs, outputs, and feedback. A focal OEM company's global supply chain is used to analyze the feasibility of proposed risk assessment and an operational business model. A tool for determining supply chain root causes (supply chain failure modes and effects analysis-FMEA), and a tool for supply chain risk assessment (global supply chain risk-management scorecard) are presented. Results of completed supply chain FMEAs and global supply chain risk-management scorecards are reported. Supply chains need scalable risk-management tools to ensure supply continuity during major disruptions while balancing efficiency considerations during normal operations. The proposed management system includes scalable strategic and tactical tools to identify risks, determine root causes, assess change-management capabilities, monitor performance, and evaluate execution of the system.				sameerkumar724@gmail.com					APICS, 2011, SUPPLY CHAIN RISK CH; Bayless D., 2009, APICS MAGAZINE, P47; Blascovich J., 2011, A T KEARNEYS 2011 AS, P1; Carey W.

J	Niworu, SM				Niworu, Salihu Mohammed			Boko Haram Sect: Terrorists or a Manifestation of the Failed Nigerian State	JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW			English	Article						state failure; collapse of values; primitive accumulation; foreign strategic interest; insurgency		The arbitrary, absolute and statist posture of colonialism permeated the Nigerian society even after 50 years of independence. The change of guards from the colonial lords to the indigenous selected Nigerians did not change the operations of the state. State still remain an instrument of coercion, exploitation and domination. Basic necessities of life, the core of national security eluded the masses. The state became insensitive to the physiological needs of its citizens thereby creating an atmosphere that became beneficial for ethnic and religious chauvinism in Nigeria. The failure of the state gave rise to terrorist groups in all regions of the country. These groups includes, the Boko Haram of the North, the Odua people's Congress of the South west, the Niger Delta Militants of South South and the Massop of the South East. This paper therefore examined the terrorism of Boko Haram sect through the instrumentation of interviews, video and audio tapes, Newspapers, magazines, textbook and internet materials. The paper conclude that in as much as Boko Haram sect are terrorists, and a threat to national security, the Nigerian state has also failed in the provision of the basic needs of the people. The paper recommends among other things that national leadership should be sincere in the provision of basic needs of the citizenry and sign diplomatic treaties that are of immense benefit to Nigeria.

History of smoking was obtained using a questionnaire. The percentage of current smokers was 40 % and was the highest (50 %) among men in their forties. The mean Brinkman index (BI, number of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by years of smoking) was 450. The percentage of patients with a BI a parts per thousand yen600 was significantly higher in patients with an AIDS-defining event than in those without an AIDS-defining event. A BI a parts per thousand yen600 was associated with an AIDS-defining event. Reducing smoking appears to be critical to enhancing disease management efforts in Japanese men with HIV.

Strategic Planning for the National Bridge Stock of Iran	CIVIL ENGINEERING INFRASTRUCTURES JOURNAL-CEIJ			English	Article						BMS; Bridge Deterioration; Markovian Process; Multi-Objective Optimization; National Bridge Stock of Iran; Strategic Planning		The National Bridge Stock of Iran consists of about 330,000 bridges, of which around 50% are older than 30 years. Since 2010, Iran Road Maintenance & Transportation Organization has started implementing a comprehensive Bridge Management System in order to manage this aged stock efficiently. To predict future conditions of bridge stock, a heuristic numerical method is presented. This methodology is based on Markovian process to model deterioration of bridge decks and a multi-objective optimization problem to find the best solutions. The optimization problem involves three decision variables regarding management strategies, and has three objectives regarding cost minimization. Constraints of the problem are the percentage of deficient bridges, the percentage of bridges under MR&Rs (Maintenance, Repair and Rehabilitation) and the average value of condition scores. The results show that to avoid future challenges, the annual budget for bridge maintenance should be increased, the current maintenance strategy should be improved as soon as possible, and national manuals and instructions for inspection, condition rating and maintenance should be developed.

J	Tang, HJ				Tang Huajun			A note on the nestedness property for ordered median problems in tree networks	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE & COMPLEXITY			English	Article						Nestedness property; ordered median problem; tree network	LOCATION; SUBTREE	The nestedness property has become an increasingly important means for devising efficient algorithms for network location problems. There have been attempts to explore the nestedness property of network location problems with some special cases of the convex ordered median objectives. However, there is little research on the nestedness property for those problems with the concave ordered median objectives. This paper constructs a tree network T and shows that the nestedness property cannot hold for the concave ordered median problem, which fills a gap in the research on the nestedness property. Finally, the authors pose an open problem on identifying the nestedness property for the continuous strategic ordered median problem.

Competitive Intelligence and Information Quality: A Game-Theoretic Perspective	ACM JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION QUALITY			English	Article						Management; Theory; Reliability; Measurement; Game theory; competitive strategy; knowledge management; competitive intelligence; intelligence information gathering systems; strategic knowledge management		To better understand a competitor's tactical and strategic plans, companies need to take a closer look at competitive intelligence or they risk missing lucrative opportunities. Because of this there is a growing interest in competitive intelligence and intelligence information gathering systems (IIS). This article uses game-theoretic concepts to develop an analytic framework to assess the value of deploying a competitive intelligence gathering information system. Modeling the competitive environment as a game provides a useful approach to study and evaluate competitive strategies given diverse assumptions about the quality of the information known by the players. When determining the value of deploying an IIS, decision makers need to examine three components of the competitive environment: the competitive rules of the game, the state of player knowledge, and the reliability of the information gathered. This framework focuses on competitive environments where the players' state of knowledge (i.e., common versus covert knowledge) and the reliability of the information generated are essential to the decision making process. The article concludes with implications for research and practice.

The electrochemical behaviour of the electrodes was investigated in the absence and presence of UV irradiation. A single oxidation peak at a potential value of about +1 V versus SCE with the characteristics of an irreversible reaction was noticed for PCP electrooxidation. The linear dependence of current versus PCP concentrations was reached in a wide concentration range from 10 to 100 mu M PCP. A series of optimization studies were performed on the pulsed voltammetric parameters. The best electroanalytical performance for PCP detection was obtained in the case of TiO2-CNT-Epoxy electrode under UV irradiation, which informed about the its photoelectrocatalytic activity towards PCP oxidation.

This research evaluates the influence of strategy implementation problems on strategy implementation success and firm performance. This survey was conducted in 60 Indonesian companies and the data were statistically analysed using Structural Equation Modeling Partial Least Square (SEM PLS). The results show significant influence of strategy implementation problems on the degree of successful strategy implementation and perceived firm performance. The seven major obstacles that have impact on poor strategy implementation are: problems related to corporate scorecard, key performance indicators, information technology, competence, performance appraisal, strategy management office, and financial support.

J	Young, MJ; Morris, MW; Scherwin, VM				Young, Maia J.; Morris, Michael W.; Scherwin, Vicki M.			Managerial Mystique: Magical Thinking in Judgments of Managers' Vision, Charisma, and Magnetism	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						mystique; vision; contagion; attribution	PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL-ATTRIBUTES; UNITED-STATES; MENTAL-HEALTH; LEADERSHIP; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; GERMS	Successful businesspeople are often attributed somewhat mystical talents, such as the ability to mesmerize an audience or envision the future. We suggest that this mystique-the way some managers are perceived by observers-arises from the intuitive logic that psychologists and anthropologists call magical thinking. Consistent with this account, Study 1 found that perceptions of a manager's mystique are associated with judgments of his or her charismatic vision and ability to forecast future business trends. The authors hypothesized that mystique arises especially when success is observed in the absence of mechanical causes, such as long hours or hard-won skills. In Study 2, managers who succeeded mysteriously rather than mechanically evoked participants' attributions of foresight and their expectations of success at visionary tasks yet not at administrative tasks. The authors further hypothesized that as mystique is assumed to spread through contagion, observers desire physical contact with managers who are attributed mystique and with these managers' possessions. Study 3 found that managers described as visionary as opposed to diligent are judged to be charismatic and ultimately magnetic. The authors discuss the implications of these judgment patterns for the literatures on perception biases and impression management in organizations.

J	Brandabur, RE				Brandabur, Raluca Ecaterina			Outsourcing - A Management-Marketing Decision	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						crisis management; cloud computing; outsourcing IT; marketing-management decisions		Survival of an organization in an environment increasingly aggressive requires a more constant study of it, followed by careful planning of its activities on the market, accordingly with the organization's mission. In this context, targets and specific modalities for achieving them are expressed by developing and implementing management-marking strategies. Critical economic environment (recession) demands now thoughtful strategic movements, providing a satisfactory market share, constant cash-flow and customer loyalty. The evolution of the Information Technology (IT) allowed for several years the development of IT solutions based on Cloud Computing. The present paper describes how the decision of outsourcing IT using cloud solutions is bounded from benefits in terms of reduced costs for the infrastructure, removes the burden of the infrastructure and networking management for the companies, offers the chance to use multi-tenant applications that are easy to be updated by the application developers and so on.

An example of these difficulties relates to choosing an appropriate medical specialty and among specialists. Owing to the lack of structural healthcare services, there is the need for guidance in selecting the most appropriate diagnosis and medicine for patients with various symptoms or physical disabilities, the need to educate patients on self-treatment procedures, the need to reduce the high cost of treatment and diagnosis, the need to address boring procedures of diagnosis and treatment, the lack of adequate strategic planning due to the absence of valuable information about patients, the problems connected with unnecessary traffic congestion, and many more. Together, these problems create a great opportunity for the expert analysts to ameliorate the healthcare system in these countries by applying new methods, such as using web- based programs and data mining (DM).

Background Nurse managers' styles are fundamental to improving subordinates' performance and achieving goals at health-care institutions. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire developed by Ekvall & Arvonen, considering three leadership domains (Change, Production and Employee relations), was administered to all nurse managers and to their subordinates at a city hospital in north-east Italy. Results The comparison between the leadership styles actually adopted and those preferred by the nurse managers showed that the preferred style always scored higher than the style adopted, the difference reaching statistical significance for Change and Production. The leadership styles preferred by subordinates always scored higher than the styles their nurse managers actually adopted; in the subordinates' opinion, the differences being statistically significant in all three leadership domains. Implication for nursing management The study showed that nurse managers' expectations in relation to their leadership differ from those of their subordinates. These findings should be borne in mind when selecting and training nurse managers and other personnel, and they should influence the hospital's strategic management of nurses.

J	Zhang, JY; Han, Y				Zhang, Juyan; Han, Yi			Testing the rhetoric of China's soft power campaign: a case analysis of its strategic ambiguity in the Six Party Talks over North Korea's nuclear program	ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			English	Article						strategic ambiguity; the Six Party Talks; China; rhetoric	EAST-ASIA; DILEMMAS; METAPHOR	China's soft power campaign has spawned many scholarly studies on it, but few have examined its rhetorical aspect. Through keyword analysis, this research examines strategic ambiguity in China's public affairs rhetoric surrounding the Six Party Talks over North Korea's nuclear program. The two keywords, the Six Party Talks' and da ju' (big picture, overall view), are semantically open and central to China's rhetoric in defining What is it?' and Why is it?' with regard to the talks. Analysis shows that strategic ambiguity contributed to some of China's goals. However, it was not adjusted when it stopped working. Its effectiveness was undercut by certain inconsistent messages, and da ju failed to differentiate between domestic and international political context and was also culturally maladaptive. This research contributes to public diplomacy and public affairs rhetoric research.

J	Chaton, C; Durand-Viel, L				Chaton, Corinne; Durand-Viel, Laure			REAL ASSET VALUATION UNDER IMPERFECT COMPETITION: CAN WE FORGET ABOUT MARKET FUNDAMENTALS?	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article								Real assets are usually valued by computing the stream of profits they can bring to a price-taking firm in a liquid market. This method ignores market fundamentals by assuming that all the relevant information is included in the spot price. Our article analyses the bias resulting from such an approach when the market is imperfectly competitive. We propose a stylised two-period model of the natural gas market with no uncertainty, focusing on strategic interactions between two types of oligopolistic players-pure traders and suppliers with downstream customers-who have access to storage. We show that the true value of storage capacity is not the same for traders and for suppliers. Comparing the latter value with the traditional price-taking valuation reveals a systematic bias that tends to induce underinvestment.

J	Chou, TC; Weng, PD; Wu, TC				Chou, Tzu-Chuan; Weng, Pu-Dong; Wu, Tzong-Chen			Exploring design-fits for the strategic alignment of information systems with business objectives	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article							TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE; IMPLEMENTATION; DISCIPLINE; DIMENSION	Introduction. This paper proposes the development of the concept of design-5 its and theoretical profiles for aligning information systems design and business strategies in terms of March and Smith's four main information technology artefacts: constructs, models, methods and instantiations. Method. The main research strategy adopted is an interpretative, in-depth case study. We selected SaveCom, a Taiwanese telecommunications company, to explore issues related to design-5 its. This research is primarily based on twenty-two interviews with middle and top managers at SaveCom, supported by secondary information. Analysis. The analysis incorporated three major phases of description (relying heavily on verbatim quotes from interviewees), analysis (identifying important factors, themes, and relationships), and interpretation (making sense of meanings in context). Results. The research proposes three mechanisms of design fit: content fit, which offers an alignment between the nature of business strategic requirements and the spirit of information technology design; structural fit, which involves the alignment of the organizational structural conditions and information technology procedures; and social fit, which considers the alignment of human factors and information technology usage design. Conclusions. Design fit is a complex process and effort must be made to understand dynamic and adaptive alignment processes that can aid the execution of information technology strategy.

This interpretative qualitative study adds to the literature by employing an expansive and critical definition of praxis. It looks across multiple educational stakeholders and structures and identifies specific trajectories of critical educational praxis. Findings revealed that critical praxis trajectories consisted of specific tensions and strategic actions that included interpersonal mediation, resource management, and political mobilization. Implications of the three teachers' critical praxis demonstrate ways to navigate constraints and concrete possibilities to create radical changes for greater justice in underserved public schools.(1)	[Lima, Jenifer Crawford] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA		Lima, JC (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.	jenifer.crawford@usc.edu					Adorno Theodor W., 1973, NEGATIVE DIALECTICS; Alfaro C., 2008, IDEOLOGIES ED UNMASK, P231; Bartolome L., 2008, IDEOLOGIES ED UNMASK, V319, pIX; Beyer LE., 2001, J TEACHER ED, V52; Breunig M, 2005, J EXP EDUC, V28, P106, DOI 10.1177/105382590502800205; Brutt-Griffler J, 1999, TESOL QUART, V33, P413, DOI 10.2307/3587672; Christensen L., 2009, TEACHING JOY JUSTICE; Christopher R., 2009, CARPENTERS DAUGHTER; Chubbuck SM, 2008, AM EDUC RES J, V45, P274, DOI 10.3102/0002831207311586; Cieszkowski ADn, 1979, SELECTED WRITINGS AU; Cochran-Smith M., 2004, WALKING ROAD RACE DI; Condon MWF, 1993, EQUITY EXCELLENCE ED, V26, P73; Darder A., 2011, DISSIDENT VOICE ESSA; DOUGLASS F, 1997, NARRATIVE LIFE F DOU; DuBois WEB, 1903, SOULS BLACK FOLK ESS; Duncan-Andrade J., 2008, ART CRITICAL PEDAGOG; Emery WG, 1996, J TEACHER ED, V47; Fendler L., 2003, EDUC RESEARCHER, V32, P16, DOI DOI 10.3102/0013189X032003016; Fernandez-Balboa J-M, 1998, TEACHING ED, V9; Feuerbach Ludwig, 1972, F BROOK SELECTED WRI; Foster M., 1993, EQUITY EXCELLENCE ED, V26, P16; FREIRE P, 1970, HARVARD EDUC REV, V40, P452, DOI 10.17763/haer.40.3.h76250x720j43175; Freire P., 2000, PEDAGOGY OPPRESSED; Fulton KL., 2000, INTERACTIVE FEMINIST; Gillham, 2000, CASE STUDY RES METHO; GIROUX HA, 1983, HARVARD EDUC REV, V53, P257, DOI 10.17763/haer.53.3.a67x4u33g7682734; Gramsci Antonio, 2000, GRAMSCI READER SELEC; Gutierrez KD, 2010, J TEACHER ED, V61; Habermas J., 1990, MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS; Hackman HW, 2005, EQUITY EXCELL EDUC, V38, P103, DOI 10.1080/10665680590935034; Hadden JE, 2000, HARVARD EDUC REV, V70, P524, DOI 10.17763/haer.70.4.ll706u968478xt01; HAMMERSLEY M, 1994, CONTROVERSIES CLASSR; Hegel G.

J	Park, M; Lee, JY				Park, Mihyang; Lee, Jee Yeon			The Role of Information for People Planning for Retirement	LIBRI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION STUDIES			English	Article							SEEKING; BEHAVIOR	This study presents the preliminary findings from research on the Everyday Life Information Seeking behaviours of Korean government officials in their 50s. The main objectives of this study were to characterize the daily life of baby boomers waiting for retirement by understanding their basic information use contexts, and to also identify a range of information seeking and search behaviours. Sixteen people, aged between 50 and 56, participated in this study. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The data was analyzed from four perspectives: 1) information seeking environments; 2) personal context of information seeking; 3) patterns of information searching; 4) recognition of discontinuation of information seeking. The qualitative findings indicate that the participants preferred to use physical materials and their existing social networks as information sources. The study participants generally held unfavourable or uncomfortable views of libraries as their source of information to satisfy their information needs. Nevertheless, the participants expected that libraries, acting as information centres, would be another useful place for their lives if libraries continue to transform. Finally, the study reveals the relationship among environment, context, and interaction with respect to personal information-seeking behaviours based on the analysis. This study should serve as strategic implications for library practitioners to develop the information services and the corresponding library management process in accordance to the potential and powerful evolving user group in a future aged society.

This paper is concerned with pricing strategies for services with substantial facility maintenance costs. To address the problem, a mathematical framework that incorporates service demand and facility deterioration is proposed. The facility and customers constitute a service system driven by Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. The most common log-linear customer demand and Weibull-distributed facility lifetime are also adopted. By examining the linkage between customer demand and facility deterioration in profit model, pricing policies of the service are investigated. Then analytical conditions of customer demand and facility lifetime are derived to achieve a unique optimal pricing policy. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effects of parameter variations on the optimal pricing policy.

J	Maconachie, G; Sappey, J				Maconachie, Glenda; Sappey, Jennifer			Flexing Some Muscle: Strategy and Outcomes in the Queensland Health and Fitness Industry	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS			English	Article						Awards; casual employment; health and fitness; strategic choice		In 1993, contrary to the trend towards enterprise bargaining, and despite an employment environment favouring strong managerial prerogative, a small group of employers in the Queensland commercial health and fitness industry sought industrial regulation through an industry-specific award. A range of factors, including increased competition and unscrupulous profiteers damaging the industry's reputation, triggered the actions as a business strategy. The strategic choices of the employer group, to approach a union to initiate a consent award, are the inverse of behaviours expected under strategic choice theory. This article argues that organizational size, collective employer action, focus on industry rather than organizational outcomes and the traditional industrial relations system providing broader impacts explain their atypical behaviour.

Multicompartment Gravel Bed Flume to Evaluate Swim-Up Success of Salmonid Larvae	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TROUT SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS; ATLANTIC SALMON; ARTIFICIAL REDDS; SURFACE-WATER; SURVIVAL; EMERGENCE; FRY; TEMPERATURE; ALEVINS; STREAM	Swim-up success, the proportion of fry emerging from a gravel redd, is difficult to quantify in the field, and currently available laboratory systems are limited. We used custom-built gravel bed flumes to assess the swim-up success of Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii. Flumes were built with compartments to separate individual egg batches, eggs were buried under gravel, and oxygenated water was supplied to simulate upwelling through the gravel. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and flow were constant between compartments and flumes operating in parallel. Swim-up success was scored both by the emergence of fry relative to the number of eggs placed in the flume (5985% depending on species) and the hatching success (proportion of eggs that hatch and resorb their yolk sac) of a sample from the same clutch reared in a vertical incubator (6284% depending on species). The gravel bed flumes could be used to estimate the swim-up success of salmonid egg clutches from hatchery stocks or fish from the wild or under experimental regimes of relevance to fishery or environmental assessment, including changes in pH, siltation, temperature, toxicants, or events simulating floods or droughts.

This journey is crucial for managers to understand in order to allocate limited resources effectively. In this paper, we employ a qualitative approach and explore this journey as it unfolds during the early phases of the new product development process in 10 cases of discontinuous innovation. We develop a knowledge-conceptualisation framework which not only illustrates the OKC journey as it progresses along a number of empirically derived stages and how these overlap with one another, but also how individual and teams contribute to or interact along these stages to create new knowledge. We thus provide a solid basis for the much-needed theoretical advances in knowledge creation and present specific benchmarks required for managers to facilitate the knowledge-creation process within their organisations.

J	Baker, MJ				Baker, Michael J.			The Marketing Dilemma	EUROMED JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						Marketing; Behavioural change; Social business; Strategic role; Transformational marketing		Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to explore the ongoing and continuing debate regarding the role of marketing in an organisation - profit or not-for-profit, public or private - in a climate where the disciplines' contribution is seen as decreasing in importance. Design/methodology/approach - An eclectic but well-informed summary of some of the key issues involved based on extensive experience as practitioner, consultant, and academic researcher. Findings - Too much emphasis is given to the "Tip of the Marketing Iceberg - advertising/promotion/public relations - and what marketers 'do' to customers with insufficient consideration of its strategic role as the interface between an organisation and its customers that creates 'mutually satisfying exchange relationships (Baker, 1976).' "In other words marketing is, or should be, a force for good and, because of its understanding of consumption and human behaviour, has the potential to make a major transformational contribution to achieving the goals of social business, including sustainability, environmental protection and enhanced human welfare. Originality/value - Too many marketers, academics and practitioners alike, are so closely involved with specific problems and issues that they cannot see the wood for the trees and reflect on the real challenges faced by the marketing profession as a whole. It is argued that we all need to move away from the prevailing marketing management school of thought and "promotional" marketing and concentrate instead on the fundamental issues of improving welfare through the adoption of transformational marketing and an emphasis on social business.

J	Barom, MN				Barom, Mohd Nizam			CONCEPTUALIZING A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN ISLAMIC ECONOMICS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING			English	Article						Strategic or instrumental theory; Social responsibility; Ethics; Transformative paradigm		In developing Islamic economics as a discipline, its proponents have emphasized on religious and ethical postulations of its economic agents as the essential micro-foundation towards the realization of its normative goals. Nevertheless, recent debates have highlighted the growing frustration on the failure of Islamic finance in addressing ethical and socially responsible issues beyond the legal realm of Shari'ah-compliance. Likewise, the survey of the literature concerning the multiple aspects to individuals' motivations for the support towards Islamic finance has also revealed mixed results. While the religious aspect has been shown to be a primary concern among the users of Islamic financial services in numerous studies, economic consideration remains an essential component in such decisions and in many instances overwhelmed the normative dimension. Based on these observations, perhaps it is wise to reflect the applicability of Islamic economic theory in the context of the contemporary reality of the Muslim society. In the transitional state where the economic dimension remains as a dominant factor in individuals' decisions, the crucial challenge is to reconcile self-interest motives with the social interest. One of the prospective means to reduce the potential conflict between the two can be found in the literature of strategic or instrumental theory of ethics. This paper seeks to discuss this issue from an Islamic perspective within the transformative paradigm of Islamic economics. The strategic framework of social responsibility is outlined based on a synthesis of the normative and positive dimensions of human instincts, the notion of falah, the moral and price filters of market and the theory of instrumental ethics. The paper argues that a strategic understanding of social responsibility issues and commitment is not in conflict with Islamic teachings. Nevertheless, it should not be taken as a theory independent of its normative foundation as normally construed in the Western literature. Instead, the strategic theory in Islamic perspective should be seen as complementary in nature with the normative underpinnings as the core, providing additional incentive and motivation for individuals to address social responsibility issues. Additionally, it has also been argued that these normative goals can be facilitated by the presence of an appropriate socio-economic environment. Recognizing that the notions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and socially responsible investing (SRI) have been often celebrated as a force to tame the vigor of egoistic orientation under Western capitalism, 'similar institutions' can also be introduced in the context of an Islamic economy. This should provide additional economic incentive for businesses to address broader social, ethical, and environmental issues, and reinforce further the strategic understanding of social responsibility and its practice among individuals, businesses and the society as a whole.

J	Brauer, M; Heitmann, M				Brauer, Matthias; Heitmann, Mark			Antecedents and temporal dynamics of strategic divergence in multinational corporations: Evidence from Europe	JOURNAL OF WORLD BUSINESS			English	Article						Strategic divergence; Intraorganizational evolutionary process of strategy formation; Strategic intent in multi-national; corporations	BUSINESS EXIT; TIME; IMPLEMENTATION; SPECIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; CONSISTENCY; FLEXIBILITY; MANAGEMENT; TESTS; MODEL	Coordinating consistent strategy implementation has been identified a key challenge for multi-national corporations. Based on intraorganizational evolutionary models of strategy formation, this paper thus empirically investigates the antecedents and temporal dynamics of strategic divergence. Strategic divergence is the deviation of a firm's resource allocation decisions with its articulated concept of corporate strategy. Large-scale empirical analysis of 11,406 resource allocation decisions of twenty-five publicly listed, multi-national and multi-business European firms indicates that decision type, operational and divisional manager involvement in decision making and structural context changes exert a significant influence on strategic divergence. Importantly, results further suggest that firms' levels of strategic divergence tend to increase over time and that the antecedents of strategic divergence have a differential impact as time passes.

J	Chainey, S; Chapman, J				Chainey, Spencer; Chapman, John			A problem-oriented approach to the production of strategic intelligence assessments	POLICING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICE STRATEGIES & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Policing; Intelligence-led policing; Problem-oriented policing; Decision making; Strategic assessment; Identifying priorities; Analysis; United Kingdom		Purpose - The strategic intelligence assessment (SIA) plays an important role in contemporary intelligence-led policing by helping to identify strategic priorities for policing activity, crime reduction and improvements in community safety. Originally defined in the UK's National Intelligence Model, the SIA is produced annually by all local UK police districts as well as other agencies in the UK and internationally that have adopted intelligence-led principles. The purpose of this paper is to critique the two most common approaches to its production, structuring its content following a "crime-type" template or an assessment that is based on previous strategic priorities. Design/methodology/approach - The paper's critique is based on reviewing one hundred SIAs from police forces and Community Safety Partnerships in the UK and through speaking to practitioners on their experiences in using these intelligence products to determine strategic priorities. Findings - The paper identifies weaknesses in both, arguing that neither tends to generate strategic intelligence products that are fit for the purpose for effective decision making, and in particular in helping to harness support from local government partners to address persistent and causal factors. As an alternative the study introduce a problem-oriented approach to the production of strategic intelligence, with an assessment made in relation to place (locations and temporal features), offending and offender management, and victimisation and vulnerability. Originality/value - The paper illustrates that the problem-oriented approach leads to the production of a SIA that is more cross-cutting in its analysis of crime and community safety issues, and more naturally leads to the identification of strategic priorities that focus on addressing causal issues.

J	Chard, CR; Hyatt, C; Foster, WM				Chard, Chris R.; Hyatt, Craig; Foster, William M.			Assets and obstacles: an analysis of OUA hockey from the coaches' perspective	SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Value dynamics; OUA hockey; Management; Assets; Coaching; Canada	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; CAPABILITIES; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; FIRM	Canada are routinely ignored by consumers and the media. The authors' goal was to better understand the context in which Ontario university hockey struggles and to address the theoretical question of how best to examine and evaluate the problems of sport-specific organizations. Using the Value Dynamics Framework (VDF), the purpose of this paper was to examine whether or not this framework fits well with the realities facing not-for-profit OUA hockey teams, and if not, to create a framework specific to these teams. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 of the 19 (77 percent) OUA hockey coaches during the 2010/2011 hockey season. The interview guide was drawn from the VDF elements and enabled the researchers to understand not-for-profit organizational assets, including physical, financial, employee/supplier, customer, and organizational. Findings - This paper offers empirical insights about the assets and obstacles facing the OUA hockey league and its teams. For example, players, coaches, affiliation with universities, and the hockey product are noted assets. Obstacles for strategic growth include arenas, suppliers, media attention, financial sustainability, parity with other leagues in Canada, and leadership. The VDF proved a useful foil to suggest that something is needed that more accurately represents sport management-specific situations. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this study is that it lacks generalizability. Although motivated to better understand not-for-profit sport in general, the authors' model is specific to OUA men's hockey teams. However, their OUA hockey team-specific revised VDF does provide insights into the assets available to coaches, and also acknowledges the corresponding challenges or obstacles surrounding the asset classes in the context of OUA hockey. Practical implications - This paper provides an approach towards making a more generalizable not-for-profit sport model that could help explain the success (or lack of success) of such organizations. Originality/value - This study addresses a need to develop a framework to examine and evaluate not-for-profit sport-specific organizations, such as the teams in the OUA.

J	Dello Stritto, G; Schiraldi, MM				Dello Stritto, Giulia; Schiraldi, Massimiliano M.			A Strategy Oriented Framework for Food and Beverage E-Supply Chain Management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Logistics Framework; E-Commerce Strategy; Consumer Goods Distribution; Food & Beverage		Several authors have emphasized the importance of analysing the impact of e-business, e-commerce and online-shopping on supply chain and operations management; however, it seems that to date no one has suggested a comprehensive framework that could help identify and support supply chain design decisions for companies about to enter the online-business in the consumer goods retail trade, encompassing the business drivers at a strategic level. This paper aims to bridge the gap between theoretical taxonomies or abstract models and the concrete supply chain design problems encountered by logistics managers who need to take their Food & Beverage retail company into the internet business while also preserving a consistent alignment with their current company strategy. Some insights on this area are presented along with a field study approach and a proposal of a 6-phase framework to jointly manage all the relevant strategic and functional aspects of supply networks.

J	Deng, L; Shangguan, ZP				Deng, Lei; Shangguan, Zhou-ping			Carbon storage dynamics through forest restoration from 1999 to 2009 in China: A case study in Shaanxi province	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Carbon storage; carbon density; carbon accumulation rate; forest management; forest inventory data	GREEN PROGRAM; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; LAND-USE; BIOMASS; INVENTORY; GRAIN; SEQUESTRATION; VEGETATION; IMPACTS; DENSITY	Shaanxi province is one of the most important forest provinces in northern China. In 1999 the national government implemented the Grain for Green Program followed in 2000 by the Natural Forest Protection Program. Being able to confidently estimate carbon sequestration dynamics is a first step in determining how to increase sequestration levels. The study investigated the carbon storage dynamics of live forest biomass, depending on the relevant forest inventory data and empirical factors (wood density, root/shoot ratio, biomass expansion factor and carbon fraction). It showed that: (1) the carbon storage and carbon density of the forest vegetation of Shaanxi were 0.29 Pg and 46.3 Mg ha(-1) in 2009, respectively, values which had increased by 52.6% and 32.4% in 2009 compared with 1999. From 1999 to 2009, the carbon accumulation rate was 0.83 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). In 2009, carbon densities of the different forest types varied from 18.8 Mg ha(-1) to 188.1 Mg ha(-1); (2) the carbon storage of the immature forests (including young, middle-aged and premature) was 192.3 Tg, which accounted for 67.5% of total carbon storage. In the decade after China carried out its natural restoration, afforestation and reforestation programs the benefits of forest carbon sequestration were obvious. With appropriate management the forests of Shaanxi have great carbon sequestration potential.

J	Diers, D; Eling, M; Linde, M				Diers, Dorothea; Eling, Martin; Linde, Marc			Modeling parameter risk in premium risk in multi-year internal models	JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE			English	Article						Non-life insurance; Value-based management; Internal risk models; Solvency II; Parameter risk; Insurance; Insurance premiums		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the importance of modeling parameter risk in premium risk, especially when data are scarce and a multi-year projection horizon is considered. Internal risk models often integrate both process and parameter risks in modeling reserve risk, whereas parameter risk is typically omitted in premium risk, the modeling of which considers only process risk. Design/methodology/approach - The authors present a variety of methods for modeling parameter risk (asymptotic normality, bootstrap, Bayesian) with different statistical properties. They then integrate these different modeling approaches in an internal risk model and compare their results with those from modeling approaches that measure only process risk in premium risk. Findings - The authors show that parameter risk is substantial, especially when a multi-year projection horizon is considered and when there is only limited historical data available for parameterization (as is often the case in practice). The authors' results also demonstrate that parameter risk substantially influences risk-based capital and strategic management decisions, such as reinsurance. Practical implications - The authors' findings emphasize that it is necessary to integrate parameter risk in risk modeling. Their findings are thus not only of interest to academics, but of high relevance to practitioners and regulators working toward appropriate risk modeling in an enterprise risk management and solvency context. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, there are no model approaches or studies on parameter uncertainty for projection periods of not just one, but several, accident years; however, consideration of multiple years is crucial when thinking strategically about enterprise risk management.

J	Gadman, LJ				Gadman, Leslie John			Open source leadership Leading and managing community led programmes to support strategies for next generation broadband implementations across Europe	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Leadership; Knowledge management; Change management; Business strategy; Behavioural sciences; Dynamic organizations	INNOVATION; COMMITMENT; RESOURCE	Purpose - The study had three main aims. To better understand and explain commitment dynamics using a commitment based analytical model. To show that commitment is an essential foundation of synergistic interactions which drive the speed of response to environmental change. To explain why and under what circumstances people in social networks become committed to a common cause. How this leads to authentic identity creation and how both lead successful outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The fieldwork for the study was qualitative and interpretive in nature and used semi-structured interviews to collect the data. As a consequence, the approach was mindful of issues of reflexivity wherein it is acknowledged that the researcher-respondent are conjoined in a sense-making process which is unavoidable and inevitable. It proceeded in three phases: sampling of the case, data gathering, and data analysis. One case was selected in order to increase the depth of the analysis, acquire and report experience with the gathering of new and unfamiliar data. Findings - The findings suggest that commitment based community networks are primarily driven by concerns. The study shows that in order to shift the concerns of a culture, community network leaders must clearly articulate and gain "buy in" to the concerns to be addressed. They must create and maintain a clear focus and develop a shared sense of commitment among participants. The research reveals a complex interaction between the commitment drivers and the successful outcomes of the project especially the unfolding and alteration of commitments in time and through time at the strategic, transforming and operating levels as circumstances change. Research limitations/implications - Being qualitative and interpretive in nature, the approach is limited by issues of reflexivity wherein it is acknowledged that the researcher-respondent are conjoined in a sense-making process. While this is unavoidable and inevitable, the findings from this study have implications for research into the impact of community based networking strategies on strategic management because so much strategic planning in business is preoccupied by public reputation. Practical implications - In taking the position that personal and corporate identity is neither wholly the result of total commitment nor wholly the result of recognition-based identity, the practical implications require a deeper consideration of the challenges surrounding collaborative community models. Because language is used loosely, requests can be made ambiguously and commitments frivolously. The inevitable result is a total breakdown in trust. Originality/value - This work is highly original because it points to the obvious which few leaders and managers appear to take into account. In those cases where the power of language and commitment are considered, the results are highly positive.

Building on transaction cost economics, we predict that the stock market should react negatively to increases in the policy instability in the host country, and that the entry mode should moderate the relationship between policy instability and the stock market reaction to international projects. To test these predictions, we first use the event study methodology to estimate the abnormal returns obtained by firms expanding abroad, and then run several multiple linear regression models to estimate the effects of the policy risk and the mode of entry chosen on these abnormal returns. Our results show that the stock market has not reacted negatively to those international projects carried out in conditions of policy instability. Investors only value policy instability negatively when the entry mode is a total acquisition.

Design/methodology/approach - A knowledge-stock analysis is performed to assess major trends of the JOCM. A bibliometric study is then conducted thanks to citation and co-citation analysis about the documents which are the most cited by the articles published in the JOCM (between 1995 and 2011). Findings - Through the results of their analysis, the authors: describe the growing stock of knowledge of the JOCM over time; identify the documents having the strongest influence on the JOCM articles; and pinpoint the evolution of the intellectual structure of the journal. Research limitations/implications - Although the sample of retained articles seems representative of the JOCM publication efforts, the data set presents some limitations. There are also some limits inherent to the research design and to the bibliometric methods. The intention of the present research is to give a quantitative overview of the intellectual evolution of the journal. Practical implications - Grasping the intellectual development of the JOCM enables researchers and practitioners to better understand how issues are being approached by authors who publish in this journal.

Since these systems are currently not applying strategic information and decision support, contemporary systems do not cope with requirements from the sustainability discussion. Early identification of cause-and-effect-relationships is vitally important to be able to anticipate environmental impacts of decisions and, thus, to intervene in time. Otherwise the potential for acting precautious would remain unemployed. A resource-friendly design of business processes and their energy-and material-efficient control additionally demands for sustainability-oriented organizational structures as well as incentives for all stakeholders involved. The authors strive for developing a new generation of CEMIS that copes with strategic sustainability aspects. They present the results from a survey that prioritizes the requirements the authors have gained from former inquiries, workshops and expert interviews. As a direct result of the survey, first implications for architectural concepts are presented.

The Trend of Governmental Support from Post-Graduated Iranian Students in Medical Fields to Study Abroad	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Scholarship; Abroad; Post-graduate; Iran	DOCTORAL EDUCATION	Background: To explore the trend and composition of post-graduate Iranian students who received governmental scholarship during the last two decades. Method: Detailed information about the awarded scholarships and also about the number of post graduate students in clinical and basic sciences in domestic universities were collected from the related offices within the ministry of health and medical education and their trends were triangulated. Results: A sharp drop was observed in the number of awarded scholarships, from 263 in 1992 to 46 in 2009. In the beginning, almost all of scholarships fully supported students for a whole academic course; while in recent years most of scholarships supported students for a short fellowship or complementary course (more than 80%). Students studied in a wide range of colleges within 30 countries; more than 50% in Europe. Although one third of students studied in UK in the first years, only 4% of students selected this country in recent years. conversely, the number of scholarships to Germany and sweden have increased more than 10 and 3 times during this period. In parallel, the capacity of domestic universities for training of post-graduate students has been expanded dramatically. Conclusion: Although expanding post-graduate education has been one of the main strategic objectives of the ministry of health and medical education in last two decades, it was obtained using different approaches. By time, more attention was to expanding the capacities of Iranian universities, and choosing less but more targeted students to continue their studies abroad.	[Haghdoost, A.

J	Hoops, C; Bucker, M				Hoops, Christian; Buecker, Michael			Determinants, Moderators and Consequences of Organizational Interaction Orientation	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION			English	Article						adaptive selling; cook's distance; customer-oriented selling; entrepreneurial orientation; environment; financial services; interaction orientation; learning orientation; market orientation; organizational culture; organizational strategy; organizational structures		Interaction orientation reflects the ability of a company to interact with the individual customer and to gather information from successful interactions. Four dimensions of interaction orientation are identified in the literature: customer concept, interaction response capacity, customer empowerment and customer value management (Ramani and Kumar, 2008). This study shows that indeed a fifth dimension of interaction orientation exists and investigates the determinants, moderators and consequences of this construct. The first notable finding is that B2B companies exhibit a greater degree of interaction orientation than B2C firms. Ramani and Kumar hypothesized that in their study. We show that there are B2C industries such as financial services, whose companies also have a greater interaction orientation. This could be the reason why the authors could not prove their hypothesis. Furthermore, we examine the influence of strategic orientations on organizational performances and compare various orientations with each other.

J	Inal, G; Al Ariss, A; Forson, C				Inal, Goezde; Al Ariss, Akram; Forson, Cynthia			Self-employment as a career strategy for ethnic minorities The case of Turkish-Cypriots in Britain	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Migrants; Self-employment; Ethnic minorities; Career strategy; Turkish-Cypriots; United Kingdom; Lawyers	BUSINESSWOMEN	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the self-employment process of Turkish-Cypriot restaurateurs and lawyers in the UK, in particular the way they mobilize resources as a strategic choice for their career transition. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a qualitative empirical research consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews from two different sectors with 20 restaurateurs and lawyers in London. Findings - Findings indicate that Turkish-Cypriots in Britain deliberately draw on social, economic, cultural, and symbolic forms of capital in order to pursue their career projects. The impact of the interconnectedness and availability of one resource on the participants' ability to acquire other resources is shown to have a key role in developing and transitioning into careers in self-employment. Research limitations/implications - The number of participants interviewed (20) is limited for the purposes of making generalizations and the paper has a main focus on micro-individual experiences of individuals. Originality/value - The limited literature on self-employment for ethnic minorities is often conceptualized as an option to avoid employment inequalities. This paper offers an understanding of self-employment as a career strategy for Turkish-Cypriots in Britain.

J	Kasumba, S				Kasumba, Stephen			A new dimension to neo-institutional sociology Some evidence from the adoption of new budgetary practices in local governments in Uganda	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Neo-institutional sociology; New budgetary practices; Local government; Intertwined institutional pressures; Sociology; Budgets; Uganda	PUBLIC MANAGEMENT; RATIONALITY	Purpose - The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which institutional pressures can be deployed to reinforce each other in creating and sustaining new budgetary practices. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopted a qualitative case study to investigate the macro dynamics for the adoption of new budgetary practices in local governments in Uganda, based on Kampala District. Data were collected from archival records and official documents as well as in-depth semi-structured interviews with various officials, including those in local governments, central government and aid agencies, such as the World Bank and Danida, which had significant influence in changing the institutional practices of local governments in Uganda. Findings - The study revealed interconnections and various layers of institutional pressures that influenced the adoption of new budgetary practices in local governments in Uganda. In addition, mimetic actions of the national government of Uganda were not only for the acquisition "best" organisational practices, but were also used as strategic mechanisms for influencing the decisions of donors of resourceful institutions within the organisational field of international development. Practical implications - This paper demonstrates how institutional pressures for the adoption of new organisational practices can be intertwined with the view of reinforcing each other in creating and sustaining new practices, such as budgetary practices. Originality/value - The paper provides a new perspective to neo-institutional sociology for the understanding of the macro dynamics for accounting changes in the context of a developing country.

J	Kayikcioglu, HH; Sahin, B				Kayikcioglu, Huseyin Husnu; Sahin, Berrin			Long-term effects of olive mill wastewater sludge on soil biological properties and yield efficiency: A case study of a fig grove in southern Turkey	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Enzymatic activity; fig yield; microbial biomass; N-mineralization; olive mill wastewater sludge	ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ORGANIC-CARBON; AVAILABILITY; PRODUCTIVITY; COMPOST; GROWTH; FIELD; OMW	Many studies have been conducted on the interactions of olive mill wastewater (OMW) with soils at the laboratory scale, but less attention has been paid to the effect of OMW on soils at a field scale, particularly over a long period. Additionally, little is known about the effect of OMW on soil microorganisms in terms of the soil enzymatic activities. The storage and evaporation in open tanks is a strategy followed by many producers to reduce the volume of OMW and to valorize OMW through the settlement of suspended sludge. Olive mill wastewater sludge (OMWS) was applied to a fig orchard with 15-year-old trees (cv. 'Sarilop') during the winter for 6 consecutive years at a maximum annual rate of 100 kg tree(-1). In particular, nine treatments were considered: 100, 75, 50, 25 and 0 kg of OMWS tree(-1) both every year (EY) and once every two years (ETY). The long-term trial aimed to assess the cumulative (EY) and residual (ETY) effects of the incorporation of increasing amounts of OMWS on soil biological properties, which were evaluated by measuring the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), basal soil respiration (BSR), N-mineralization (N-min), several soil enzyme activities (hydrolases and oxidoreductases) involved in the cycles of the main biological nutrients (C, N, and P), and plant yield as yield efficiency per unit of trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA). The results of this study demonstrated that OMWS significantly stimulated soil microbial activity and fig yield at the levels applied and was not harmful to soil microflora in general, except for the highest dose with yearly treatment (100 EY). OMWS applications provided 41-1046% of the increases in the level of microbial activity with respect to the control at the end of the experiment. For this reason, no toxic effect of OMWS was observed. The application of OMWS to the soil caused the highest increase in DHG activity, while the lowest increase was observed for MBC content. Microbial activities were most stimulated by 75 kg OMWS tree(-1) with yearly application, while they were least stimulated by 25 kg OMWS tree(-1) with application every two years. This agro-industrial waste could represent a strategic resource in the integrated management of agricultural systems, as its use enhances soil biological activities and improves soil fertility, and consequently, the use of chemical fertilizers can be reduced. Additionally, the results suggest that 75 kg tree(-1) applied every year and 100 kg tree(-1) applied every two years applications are the best amendment rates for degraded and poor Mediterranean soils and fig orchards in this region.

J	Liang, F; Fung, RYK; Jiang, ZB				Liang, Feng; Fung, Richard Y. K.; Jiang, Zhibin			A COMINED APPROACH OF CYCLE TIME ESTIMATION IN MASS CUSTOMIZATION ENTERPRISE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Cycle Time; Mass Customization; Statistics Regression; Customization Degree; Cost Coefficient	DUE-DATE ASSIGNMENT; RANDOM PROCESSING TIMES; SINGLE-MACHINE; MAINTENANCE; PREDICTION; MAKESPAN; COST; SHOP; JOBS	To enhance customer satisfactions and improve ability of quick responses, the production type of mass customization is advocated in many manufacturing enterprises. But in the mass customization enterprises, the customization demands will influence the standard cycle time estimation, which is essential in the analysis of contracts negotiation, capacity planning, and the assignments of due dates. Hence in this paper, a combined methodology employing an analytical model and a statistical regression method is proposed to facilitate the cycle time estimation in the mass customization enterprise. Using inferential reasoning for the analytical optimal model for cost minimization, it is deduced that the relationship between the customization degree and cost coefficient provider an efficient way to estimate the cycle time accurately. And their relationship is described with a statistical regression method. Finally, a case study from a bus manufacturing enterprise is used to illustrate the detailed estimation procedures and the further discussion is presented to explicate the significance for practice.

J	Lyu, J; Chang, CH				Lyu, JrJung; Chang, Chia-Hua			EXPLORING BUSINESS MODELS FOR APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH RESOURCE BASED REVIEW	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Application Service Provider; Resource Based Theory; Outsourcing Strategy; Business Model	SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; INTEGRATED PERSPECTIVE; VIEW; FIRM; QUALITY; DETERMINANTS; MANAGEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE	The Application Service Provider (ASP) concept is extended from traditional information application outsourcing as currently used by numerous industries for information applications. Although value-added service can be generated with ASPs, it can still have a high failure rate in ASP markets. This research applies Resource Based Theory (RBT) to evaluate the business models of ASPs in order to assess their positions and provide suggestions for development directions. Top ten application service providers among the fifty most significant ASPs were selected to investigate the global markets of the ASP industry and the trend of services beforehand Then three of them were explored to illustrate the RBT review. Based on the market review and the empirical investigation, it was found that only a few ASPs can provide integrated service contents which can adapt to fit the real demands of customers. ASPs should focus on the perspective of the ecosystem and consider employing strategic alliances in order to provide an integrated solution for their customers and sustain competitive advantage.

J	Maley, J				Maley, Jane			Hybrid purposes of performance appraisal in a crisis	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Global crisis; Performance appraisal; Purpose; Contextual variables	HUMAN-RESOURCES; MANAGEMENT; FOREIGN; IMPACT; SUBSIDIARIES; FEEDBACK; BEHAVIOR; CRITERIA; BORDERS; CULTURE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine one aspect of the implementation of the performance appraisal with a focus on its operation in an economic downturn and particularly a global economic crisis. Design/methodology/approach - It identifies the stated purposes of the performance appraisal in multinational corporations (MNCs) and explores the unstated purposes of the performance appraisal, which emerge during performance evaluation and feedback stages. The paper then investigates the different expectations employees and managers have of the performance appraisal and finally examines the changes to these expectations in an economic downturn. Findings - The principal conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that there is a weakness in the design and substance of the performance appraisal research. The international appraisal is not exclusively conditioned by culture but also by the numerous contextual-organizational, institutional and economic factors found in the typical MNC. Practical implications - It is suggested that possible strategies could include careful implementation of performance appraisal with attention to both the cultural and contextual environment. It is argued that by addressing both cultural and contextual variables the appraisal will be effective in helping achieve not only the MNC's strategic goals in a time of global economic crisis, but also recovery and survival following economic crisis. Originality/value - This paper adds to the body of knowledge of international human resource management research by illuminating the consequences of an uncertain economic environment on performance management across borders and also paves the way for future research in this important area of management research.

J	Momeni, A; Mehrafzoon, M				Momeni, Afrooz; Mehrafzoon, Mehdi			Critical Factors of Competitive Intelligence in the Power Plant Industry: The Case Study of MAPNA Group	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE STUDIES IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Competitive intelligence; Factor analysis; Strategic management; power plant industry; Iran	INFORMATION; STRATEGY; SYSTEMS	This paper aims to discuss the critical factors of competitive intelligence that influences the Iran's power plant industry (MAPNA Group). Design/methodology/approach: The paper has identified critical factors of competitive intelligence through Iran's power plant industry based on a comprehensive review of recent literature. For this purpose, a questionnaire was designed, applied and analyzed by the use of statistical methods. The results discuss various perspectives from a competitive intelligence point of view, and provide critical factors and a regression model for showing essential issues on the subject. Findings: The statistical analysis determines seven factors as critical issues in this case study. These factors are "Proportion of company's structure and goal", "Company's competitive conditions", "International Policies about foreign trade", and "Economics and Politics condition of country". Research limitation/implications: The extracted factors can act as a guideline to design a strategic plan. This helps to ensure that the essential issues are covered during design and implementation of the plan. For academics, it provides a common language to discuss the factors crucial for competitive intelligence in this industry. Originality/Value: The paper may represent high value to researchers in the competitive intelligence and strategic management fields. This study further provides an integrated perspective of critical issues for competitive intelligence in the power plant industry. It gives valuable information and guidelines that can help leaders consider the important issues during strategic planning.

J	Ostberg, PO; Elmroth, E				Ostberg, Per-Olov; Elmroth, Erik			GJMF - a composable service-oriented grid job management framework	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Grid computing; Grid job management; Grid ecosystem	RESOURCE; MIDDLEWARE; EXECUTION; TOOLKIT; BROKER	There exists a number of grid infrastructures in production use for a wide range of scientific applications. However, due to the complexities inherent to construction of distributed computing environments, many grid tools and applications remain tied to specific grids and grid middlewares. In this work we investigate best practices for grid software design and development, and propose a composable, loosely coupled Service-Oriented Architecture for grid job management. The architecture is designed for use in federated grid environments and defines a model for transparent grid access that aims to decouple grid applications from grid middlewares and facilitate concurrent use of multiple grid middlewares. The architecture model is discussed from the point of view of an ecosystem of grid infrastructure components, and is presented along with a proof-of-concept implementation of the architecture.

First, we discuss the dynamics of ICTs and the ability to generate innovations with a direct impact on business. Then we present the need for greater balance between goals of short and long term on IT projects. In the third part, we discuss how these new technologies have helped to increase the productivity of information professionals as well as to enhance the decision- making process and the satisfaction of the end customer. To conclude, the main challenges that the technology- based companies will have to face in relation to the management of the lifecycle of their technology, is consolidation and simplification of their processes within their computing environments, aiming to increase productivity and develop agile environments that allow the organizations to meet the demands of managing digital information.

While most studies addressing global cooperative strategies analyse organisational and industrial characteristics, very few theories incorporate explanations for Indian supply chain management practices. This study is an attempt to better understand Indian supply chain management practices.

The present study assesses two key aspects of the planning process among Spanish firms exhibiting at art and collectibles international trade shows: (a) the quality of their planning process; and (b) the ensuing levels of satisfaction in relation to the extent to which they fulfil their goals. A general model of trade-show planning is tested empirically against a sample of Spanish firms exhibiting at art and collectibles trade shows. The results show considerable room for improvement in current planning practices: goals are not reached and satisfactory outcomes are unrelated to the planning process. Finally, the authors offer suggestions to increase planning efficiency among firms in the art and collectibles industry. They establish that an organisational culture is needed which fosters knowledge of how to set goals and how to put into effect goal-oriented planning.

J	Quesada-Pineda, HJ; Madrigal, J				Quesada-Pineda, Henry J.; Madrigal, Johanna			Sustaining Continuous Improvement: A Longitudinal and Regional Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Continuous Improvement; Incremental Innovation; Innovation Management		This paper presents the results of a longitudinal study of four continuous improvement (CI) leader companies in two different global regions. The goal of the research was to understand how employee perception of different factors that impact the long-term sustainability of the CI process might change over time. Quantitative data analysis was used to capture and statistically analyse employee perceptions by CI factor, time, and geographical location. After validation and reduction techniques were applied to the research model, five factors were singled out: change management, strategic planning, knowledge management, performance management, and sustainability of the CI process. For two of the four companies, no changes in perception were found during the period of study for any of the factors. For the other two, however, changes were perceived in at least one of the five constructs in the study. Changes were also found across the regions included. By leveraging the quantitative analysis with qualitative data collected through interviews and visits to the case study companies, we were able to explain the changes in perception and single out the best CI management process to sustain CI in the long term.

Application of the new Morphological Quality Index in the Cordevole river (BL, Italy)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hydromorphology; river network segmentation; morphological recovery; Water Framework Directive; Cordevole River (Bl, Italy)		The evaluation of the morphological quality of rivers is essential to define the level of alteration and for implementing future management strategies that consider also hazards related to fluvial processes and channel dynamics. This type of evaluation is particularly significant for the Italian rivers, that, as in many other European countries, have a very high level of human pressure. Recently, in Italy, the National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research has promoted a methodology named IDRAIM for hydromorphological analysis of streams that pursues an integrated approach aimed at a harmonized implementation of both the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC), and the EU Floods Directive (2007/60/EC). In this paper we present the application of the Morphological Quality Index (MQI) protocol, which is part of IDRAIM, to determine the assessment of the morphological quality of the Cordevole River. The water network (only collectors greater than third-order were considered), has been divided, through GIS software, into 132 river reaches of homogeneous morphological characteristics, according to the first phase of the method. At this stage the semi-automatic calculation of lateral confinement (defined by "degree of confinement" and a "confinement index") was tried, in order to reduce the implementing time. The application of 28 indicators was made for 42 reaches representing the major river types and human pressures in the site investigation. The results showed that 48% of the analyzed reaches have a very good or good quality status, 38% have a moderate morphological quality, while only 14% have the characteristics of poor or very poor quality. The main causes that lead to a strong alteration of the terms of reference are linked to i) poor connectivity between hillslopes and river corridor, that is very important for the natural supply of sediment and large wood; ii) absence of vegetation in the river corridor, that is functional to a range of geomorphic processes; iii) presence of artificial elements, particularly the bedload interception structures in the catchment, bank protection along the reach, and the removal of sediment, large wood and vegetation.

According to this Directive, the ecological classification of a watercourse should be considered in addition to physical-chemical and biological aspects of its hydromorphological condition, in order to define the deviation of the present condition from a pre-defined reference state. The Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research has promoted a methodology called IDRAIM for the hydromorphological analysis of streams. This is an integrated approach aimed at implementing both WFD and EU Flood Directives (2007/60/EC). In this paper, we describe the application of the morphological quality index (MQI) protocol, which is part of the IDRAIM, used for evaluating the morphological quality of the Cordevole River, Province of Belluno, northeastern Italy. General settings and segmentation of the water network through the use of semi-automatic GIS techniques were presented. The MQI data derived from the application of 28 indicators in 42 reaches were then analysed. Most (48%) of the analysed reaches have a good quality status; 38% have a moderate quality status and poor morphological conditions (14%) are due to the presence of artificial elements and to the limited connectivity between hill-slopes and the river corridor.

Given the global environment, the question of why organizations from one country seek patent protection from another country is of concern to both organizations and researchers. To better understand the strategic rationale motivating non-US firms to seek software patents in the US, an exploratory multi-case study involving three German firms was conducted. Results of this study suggest that, at a minimum, obtaining US software patents is a strategic necessity. Firms were also found to use software patents for protection against infringing activities, as well as providing a possible means for strengthening competitive advantage. We provide possible explanations for the patenting strategy of the firms in our study by employing a configuration approach using Miles and Snow's strategy topology. Recommendations for future research and integration with existing theories are also presented.

J	Shen, CY; Yu, KT				Shen, Chun-Ying; Yu, Kun-Tzu			Optimization of product design based on a design-function-oriented cost model: a strategic non-throw-away perspective	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING			English	Article						throw-away cost model; design-function-oriented cost model; process capability index (PCI); specification tolerance variation; risk management		Most published studies adopt a throw-away cost model to solve minimum production cost problems, without considering subsequent risk-based contingent costs at the product design stage. The design-function-oriented cost model proposed in this study considers multi-characteristic quality specifications, product design functions, and subsequent risk-based contingent costs of a product for minimizing total costs during the initial product design stage. The optimization of in-house manufacturing process selection and quality assessment for outsourcing is associated with variation/cost functions. An adjustable managerial contingent cost coefficient was used to enable design teams to make appropriate trade-offs at various stages of the life cycle of product marketing based on the product's intended strategic market position. An empirical case study demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed model as one that can be easily understood and applied by any organization. The results and processes of the case study also provide useful managerial implications.

Power laws and fragility in flow networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Network dynamics; Power law; Degree distribution; Flow networks; Network collapse; Resource networks; Network evolution	SCALE-FREE NETWORKS; CENTRALITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONGESTION; EMERGENCE	What makes economic and ecological networks so unlike other highly skewed networks in their tendency toward turbulence and collapse? Here, we explore the consequences of a defining feature of these networks: their nodes are tied together by flow. We show that flow networks tend to the power law degree distribution (PLDD) due to a self-reinforcing process involving position within the global network structure, and thus present the first random graph model for PLDDs that does not depend on a rich-get-richer function of nodal degree. We also show that in contrast to non-flow networks, PLDD flow networks are dramatically more vulnerable to catastrophic failure than non-PLDD flow networks, a finding with potential explanatory power in our age of resource- and financial-interdependence and turbulence.

J	Sulaiman, M; Rahman, NA				Sulaiman, Maliah; Rahman, Noredah Abdul			DOES THE ENVIRONMENT MATTER? EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING IN MALAYSIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Environmental Management Accounting; Environmental Awareness; Environmental Management; Universities; Institution of Higher Learning; Malaysia		The ability of an organization to manage its environmental performance is emerging as a strategic issue for many organizations. Institutions of higher learning are no exception. Given that a university is a consumer of natural resources and a producer of waste (Flint, 2001), it is imperative that environmental cost information is made visible to the management of the organization so that the impact can be managed more effectively. Environmental management accounting (EMA) is often lauded as the tool to "capture" environmental cost information. However, before such a tool can be implemented, it is important to examine if indeed the university community is aware of environmental issues. If they are, what types of information do they perceive as important to enable them to better address the impact of their activities on the environment. Using the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) as the case, our study examined two pertinent issues: the extent the university community is aware of environmental issues and EMA and their need for environmental cost information. Data was collected using a questionnaire survey. The results revealed a moderate level of awareness on environmental matters amongst IIUM staff. Most were aware of environmental management systems (EMS) but not EMA. Further, they perceive environmental cost information to be useful to manage the impact of their activities on the environment. In particular, they felt that information on the use of paper is important.

J	Tammela, I; Canen, AG; Helo, P				Tammela, Iara; Canen, Alberto G.; Helo, Petri			Time-based competition Relation to multiculturalism and logistics in international furniture companies	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Furniture companies; Time-based competition; Benchmarking; Logistics; Multicultural organisations; Competitive advantage; Furniture; Furniture industry		Purpose - The strategic aim of this paper is to investigate whether time-based competition (TBC) strategies are related to cultural aspects. In addition, the influences of company decision-making and the success of competitive strategies in diverse globalised markets will be examined. Based on a multicultural perspective, the way time is considered depends on different assumptions among countries and cultures, as well as organisational patterns of decision-making for a variety of business areas and services. TBC and its relationship to logistics and multiculturalism through the international benchmarking of furniture companies are then explored. Design/methodology/approach - TBC and cultural perceptions in furniture manufacturing companies located in Brazil and Scandinavia were investigated. Data were collected from furniture companies by questionnaires and were analysed through descriptive statistics and multivariate techniques. The research presented here is part of a larger study that focuses on TBC strategies and multiculturalism in the furniture industry. Findings - Data were collected from furniture companies located in different countries. The findings illustrate that there is a correlation between TBC strategies and cultural variables, as well as between TBC and seeking for local partnerships. Originality/value - The originality of the paper lies in addressing relationships between TBC strategies, cultural aspects and the role of partnerships to improve logistics management competitiveness. To date, this area has received little attention in the literature. Likewise, the results point to partnerships being necessary to improve TBC and logistics strategies.

Sub-project - Innovative technologies for the mechanization of the areas hard to reach	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						conservative agriculture; steep slopes; innovations; Mars+		The care and protection of the mountain areas and their traditional crops were some of the reasons that led regional governments of Liguria and Tuscany to participate in the strategic project "Sea, Countryside and Land: potentiate the strategic unitarily" (MARS +). This project has also involved the participation of the four cross-border regions: Tuscany (leader), Sardinia, Liguria and Corsica. The aim was to promote the development of the innovations and entrepreneurship in the rural areas in order to increase competitiveness. In particular, the subproject SC has provided the transfer of innovations to facilitate the processes of mechanization in vineyards and olive orchards in contexts defined as "heroic", areas of high landscape and environmental value in which the typical cultures has been always carried out, generally, on terraces or slopes. These conditions require a great effort by the farmers and result in high production costs. The transfer of the innovations has provided the organization of demonstration days in which the technological solutions for the management of the farming operations in vineyards and olive orchards were proposed and tested. During these events, the participative process was fundamentally reconfirmed, not only as a means to expand the knowledge of innovative products, but also as an opportunity for farmers, retailers, manufacturers, researchers, and local administrators to interact and facilitate the development of other technologies. The parameters that led to the innovative solutions included: the small size, user-friendliness, agility, and the ability of operating on systems not easily accessible. These products must also ensure the ergonomics and safety of workers performing all the growing operations. A thorough research of the available technologies and prototypes, still under development, affirms the presence of many innovations. These innovations not only allow the execution of all the field operations in the vineyard and olive orchards and significant time and cost reduction but also ensure the performance in complete safety. This research has shown the constant development of these products and how the use of electronics and mechatronics is becoming more prevalent.

J	Tsai, DC; Chen, WW				Tsai, Dungchun; Chen, WeiWei			Determinants of international telecommunications alliance form in emerging markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS			English	Article						Telecommunications; Alliance form; Interfirm trust; Governmental restriction; Emerging markets; China; Hong Kong; Taiwan	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; FOREIGN-INVESTMENT; ENTRY; TRUST; COOPERATION; PERFORMANCE; ARCHITECTURE; COMPETENCE; PROPENSITY; CORRUPTION	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to attempt to explore how host governmental restriction and interfirm trust influence telecommunications operators (telcos) to choose international telecommunications alliance forms among equity alliances, relational alliances and recurrent alliances in three emerging markets: China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes multiple discriminant analysis to analyze 111 international alliances established in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan during 1993-2004. Findings - This study finds that host governmental restriction exerts greater influence on the choice of alliance form than interfirm trust. Telcos tend to develop non-equity alliances when governmental restriction is strong. In addition, they tend to develop equity and relational alliances when interfirm trust in high. Research limitations/implications - Two limitations are: this study only explores the impacts of a number of factors (host governmental restriction and interfirm trust) on alliance form choice, and it only focuses on bilateral alliances in telecommunications services industry. This study suggests that future study should explore other strategic factors (e.g. firms' capability, competitors' strategy) and multi-lateral alliances. Practical implications - This study provides three managerial suggestions. First, when international telcos establish alliances in emerging markets, they should primarily evaluate host governmental restrictions, and second assess interfirm trust. In addition, if local telcos intend to build relational and equity alliances to acquire international telcos' technology and marketing know-how, they should enhance interfirm trust with them. Lastly, when host governments attempt to attract foreign equity investment, they should remove restrictions on foreign ownership and provide support and friendly regulatory institutions. Originality/value - Most literature about telecommunications service industry focuses on developed markets and uses descriptive or case analysis. To fill these research gaps, this study conducts an empirical research by analyzing the international alliances in three emerging markets: China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The findings not only provide suggestions to international telcos, local telcos and host governments in these markets but also can be applied to other emerging markets.

J	Wainwright, DW; Shaw, CS				Wainwright, David; Shaw, Christopher			Modernising pathology services: modelling effective IT project collaboration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hospitals; Health care; National Health Service; Information systems; Pathology; Healthcare information systems; IT project management; IT project teams; Information systems strategy; Pathology IT systems; Causal modelling; Critical success factors; Template analysis	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; ISSUES; CYCLES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to adapt a causal modelling approach to investigate the organisational collaboration and information technology (IT) project management issues concerning the planning and adoption of inter-organisational IT systems across NHS hospital pathology departments. Design/methodology/approach - The researchers adopted an interpretive research approach utilising qualitative methods and in particular template analysis. Themes and categories were initially derived from a review of the literature based on critical success factors from enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects. Findings - A causal loop modelling approach was adapted to define key linkages between success factors. This highlighted virtuous and vicious cycles associated with IT project management and team collaboration - influencing the adoption process of large-scale integrated IT systems. Research limitations/implications - Single case studies can be problematic in terms of generalising from the research. The study had a limited number of interview participants due to the focus on strategic management. Future studies could extend the number of stakeholders involved and also focus on end-users of services, such as clinicians in primary care. Practical implications - The discussion and conclusions assess the appropriateness and utility of using a causal modelling approach, and an adapted causal loop model, to inform more effective approaches to IT planning, project management, team collaboration and adoption of integrated systems. Social implications - The findings indicate that a more enhanced understanding of project team collaboration involving technical, administrative and clinical stakeholders has the potential to inform more effective strategies for modernisation of hospital clinical services such as pathology. Originality/value - This study investigates the anatomy of a high-profile IT project under the umbrella of strategic modernisation of health services. Privileged access to key stakeholders has enabled the development of a causal model for IT project collaboration and management. This will form the basis for further development of more refined models to enhance project outcomes in the future.

Australia's per capita emission due to electricity is five times than the world average. This study explores government and firms especially resource sector strategic initiatives to date, and how foresight will develop capability in capitalising the changing climate change challenges, structure adaptation process and how different firms' strategies enhance sustainable innovation and knowledge management. Due to short-termism, and lack of emissions target strategy and carbon trading mechanism, country's climate strategic change initiative is fairly reactive and slow in searching this as an opportunity. Hence, a strategic climate change framework developed to exploit opportunities in carbon constrained world.

A conceptual framework aimed at addressing the 'mismatch' between the skills requirements of industry and the competences of graduates in the built environment sector was derived. A series of surveys was undertaken on the basis of the derived framework. It was intended that the findings from the surveys would enable the framework to be refined and validated. However, some of the findings suggest that the originally derived conceptual framework does not adequately represent the complexity of the professional learning context and it is not feasible to refine it. This paper describes the conceptual framework which was derived, highlights selected findings from surveys which indicate its inadequacy and then draws on the contemporary literature of higher education futures to discuss the implications for a more representative framework. Recommendations for a closer representation of the education-industry context and for further research directions are made.

Organization culture is presented as a category of knowledge, and the value of this knowledge is discussed in the strategic context of MNE integration and the development of global management competencies. In-depth interview data from 21 cases of international assignments across 13 MNEs are analysed, revealing that assignees play a role in sharing knowledge of organization culture through the process of articulating tacit perspectives held across global units. The data also reveal a role for assignments in the development of comprehension of substantive heterogeneity. This article contributes to our understanding of the developmental aspects of assignments, the utility of assignments as a method for knowledge sharing and the role of international assignments in the integration of MNEs.

It is argued that in the decades to come water would surpass oil and future wars would be fought over this scarce commodity.. South Asia is one of the regions where nature has bestowed a generous supply of water resources. But poor management and limited cooperation on its use is a source of tension among countries of the region. Pakistan-India relations in this respect are a case in point. Pakistan recognized as a water scare county needs to do a lot of work in managing and sustaining the commodity. Regional cooperation is of essence in meeting the countg's needs. The article studies the water situation in Pakistan and suggests measures for judicious use of water resources in the region.

J	Harness, DR; Harness, T				Harness, David R.; Harness, Tina			Can product elimination support post-downsizing success aspirations?	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Organisations implement downsizing to overcome difficult and uncertain trading conditions, reduce complexity and gain strategic fit. Academic theory tends to focus on the human resource implications of downsizing. Whilst such articles may acknowledge the role of product elimination, there is limited understanding of either how it can be accomplished or of the customer retention benefits that may be derived. Service deletion theory promotes the use of partial or full elimination strategies as a means to gain positive outcomes. This study utilised interviews and questionnaires to examine product elimination success in the UK financial services industry. It identified that customer retention could be achieved post elimination if the desire to accomplish this was built into the removal process. The implication is that strategically aligning the objectives and implementation of a downsizing activity is more likely to result in positive elimination outcomes that can support the company's longer-term commercial objectives.

Key issues of forestry, wood-processing industry and hunting - addressing them and proposals	CENTRAL EUROPEAN FORESTRY JOURNAL			Slovak	Article						forestry; key issues; objectives and measures		This article presents formation of forestry (forest management) and characterizes the development of social requirements (governing structures) for forests and tasks that should be carried out by the industry. It focuses mainly on the development of forestry after the change of social system in 1989, especially in the last decade, during the global economic and financial crisis (starting in 2008). Current key issues of forestry in Slovakia will be identified based on the analysis. The paper presents their causes and consequences. It proposes goals and measures with aim to stabilize the situation by 2020 so as to ensure the accomplishment of the strategic goal of forestry in Slovakia (sustainable forest management based on an appropriate use of economic, ecological and social functions for the development of society, and especially rural areas).

J	Evans, LM				Evans, Leanne M.			Peritoneal dialysis: one unit's response to improving outcome and technique survival	RENAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALASIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Peritoneal dialysis; peritonitis; self-management		Home therapies, including peritoneal dialysis (PD), empower self-management and enhance improved outcomes. Renal clinicians need to be promoting and encouraging home therapies, while providing the best possible education and support to ensure compliance and maintenance of modality of choice. Patients should be set up to succeed, with proactive management and ongoing individualised education from clinicians. A small Australian PD service identified several gaps in the current management of PD requiring a review of unit protocols including: patient selection and liaison with chronic kidney disease educator; aligned with current International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines; technique failure; patient education; and regular monitoring of infection rates.The unit sought to enhance PD outcomes through the implementation of strategic changes. These changes included: revision of PD protocols, discussions with microbiologists to reduce incidence of culture-negative peritonitis, improved communication between PD nurses and "on-call" nurses, state-wide networking, and the development of specific flow charts. The adoption of improved data collection methods and tracking of peritonitis rates further enhances outcomes by aiding the establishment of the root cause of infection, which, in turn, improves outcomes by reducing the risk of repeat episodes through focused education and prevention methods. Proactive management and ongoing individualised education, together with implemented changes as described, will result in better individual compliance, with increased support and, therefore, improved PD outcomes and technique survival time.

J	Brooker, P				Brooker, Peter			4D-Trajectory Air Traffic Management: Are There 'Killer Apps'? - Part 2	JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION			English	Article						SESAR; ATM; Killer Apps		The USA and Europe are developing plans - NextGen and SESAR - to transform the processes of Air Traffic Management (ATM). These will improve safety and efficiency, and match predicted increases in air transportation demand. They use advanced networking technology updated with information from satellite navigation and digital non-voice communication. The strategic goal, envisaged for 15-20 years hence, is a new ATM paradigm. Aircraft would fly on Four-Dimensional (4D) trajectories, incorporating altitude, position, time, and other aircraft positions and vectors. This vision would involve extremely large investments from the airline industry and ATM service providers. Thus, development priorities need to be based on sound business cases. But will these necessarily lead to the strategic vision of a 4D-trajectory system? Will the changes in practice be limited to a series of short and medium term operational improvements rather than strategic improvements? So, are there 'Killer Apps' for 4D-trajectory ATM? 'Killer App(lication)s' is jargon for innovations so valuable that they prove the core value of some larger technology. Killer Apps generate high degrees of stakeholder technical and financial cooperation. Ironically, most past ATM Killer Apps have improved safety, e. g., modern radar data processing led to collision avoidance systems. The analysis here attempts to identify and then size potential 4D-trajectory ATM Killer Apps. The evidence for Killer Apps has to pass key tests. Killer Apps obviously have to offer enormous benefits to stakeholders in the context of the potential costs. The bulk of these benefits must not be obtainable through technologically 'cut down' non-4D-trajectory versions. Part 1 of this paper (Brooker, 2012a) sets out the framework for investigating these questions. Part 2 examines potential Killer Apps derived from improvements in Fuel Efficiency, Capacity and Cost. An abbreviated version of this paper was first presented at the European Navigation Conference (ENC 2011), London in November 2011.				p_brooker@btopenworld.com					[Anonymous], 2011, CONC OP NEXT GEN AIR; ATTWOOLL V, 1985, J NAVIGATION, V38, P19, DOI 10.1017/S0373463300038133; BROOKER P, 1990, J NAVIGATION, V43, P187, DOI 10.1017/S0373463300009516; Brooker P, 2012, J NAVIGATION, V65, P397, DOI 10.1017/S0373463312000045; Brooker P, 2009, J NAVIGATION, V62, P555, DOI 10.1017/S0373463309990105; Brooker P, 2009, J NAVIGATION, V62, P203, DOI 10.1017/S0373463308005237; CAA [Civil Aviation Authority], 2001, EST DEM VAL ANN; Calderon-Meza G., 2010, INT COMM NAV SURV C; CANSO, 2008, ATM GLOB ENV EFF GOA; CANSO/IATA/Eurocontrol, 2008, FLIGHT EFF PLAN FUEL; Cook A.J., 2011, EUROPEAN AIRLINE DEL; DIXON LE, 2010, AV2010068 US DEP TRA; Dwyer JP, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5618, P748, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-02559-4_81; Erzberger H., 2004, NASATP2004212828; *EUR, 2004, CHALL GROWTH 2004 RE; Eurocontrol, 2008, CHALL GROWTH 2008 RE; Eurocontrol, 2009, STAND INP EUR COST B; Eurocontrol, 2010, 101122134 EUR; European Commission, 2009, EUR AIR TRAFF MAN MA; Helios EPS [Economics and Policy Services], 2006, IMP FRAGM EUR ATM CN; Helios Technology Ltd, 2011, HEL ATM IND SURV 201; Histon J.

Promising allelopathic rice lines derived from the recombinant inbred lines of nongan/sathi cross	ALLELOPATHY JOURNAL			English	Article						Allelopathy; barnyardgrass; breeding; Echinochloa crusgalli; low input; rice; screening; sustainable weed management	IDENTIFICATION; SUBSTANCE	Rice plants that exhibit allelopathic behavior represent potential options for sustainable weed management. Previous studies have shown that the Sathi rice variety (an indica-type) shows high allelopathic potential (HAP), whereas the Nongan rice variety (a japonica-type) shows low allelopathic potential (LAP). Hence, in this study, we assessed the F6 and F7 generations of 180 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from crossing Nongan/Sathi planted in Seoul, Korea. A laboratory assessment (double pots allelopathy bioassay) and a field assessment (rice ratoon interplanting barnyardgrass seedling) were used to screen the allelopathic potential of the rice cross. Both methods used barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli Beauv. var. frumentaceae) as a plant (weed) indicator to evaluate how rice suppressed plant growth. The results indicated that some prospective lines have HAP, exhibiting high suppression of barnyardgrass height and shoot dry-weight. Further selection for desired agronomical characteristics was performed for F8 RILs in the field in Korea, with some selected F9 lines exhibiting HAP and LAP during repeated planting in Bogor, Indonesia. The allelopathic potential of the Nongan/Sathi rice cross was confirmed on F10 RILs by evaluating agronomic performance. Through this multi-generation work, some promising lines derived from japonica and indica rice-types exhibiting high and low allelopathic traits, may be used in closely monitored agronomic field trials.

Most companies feel that coordinating their downstream supply chains is critical for long term growth and sustainability. The paper examines the supply chain coordination amongst retailers, distributors, logistics providers, customers, and major Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) multi-national companies in India. The findings confirm that supply chain integration, information sharing, and supply chain design are being given proper attention by FMCG companies. They appreciate the strategic value of information sharing for establishing collaborations with the small retailers for effective performance of supply chains. Even in the fragmented, ill-defined, unorganized, and disjointed small retail sector in India, information sharing between supply chain partners is given precedence. Lack of technological infrastructure does not deter MNCs from establishing information linkages with small retailers and harnessing it for supply chain efficiency.

J	Varriale, L; Briganti, P; La Peruta, R; Ferrara, M				Varriale, Luisa; Briganti, Paola; La Peruta, Rosaria; Ferrara, Maria			Organizational Conflict and Knowledge Creation: A Multiple Method Study in the Italian Health Care System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR			English	Article						Conflict Levels; Conflict Management Style; Health Care System; Knowledge Creation; Organizational Conflict		This study investigates the relationship between organizational conflict and knowledge creation in the Italian health care system in order to identify the main determinants and effects of this relationship. The paper defines this relationship and investigates the interaction between conflict levels, management conflict styles and their effects on knowledge. Considering the innovative characteristic of the subject, the authors propose a multiple method study. First, the authors conducted a qualitative study on the dynamics of conflict and knowledge creation using the focus group technique (38 nurses selected from the Italian health care system). Second, the authors conducted a field study (180 nurses from Italian hospitals). The results show that the participants consider conflict more as a beneficial instrument for the creation of organizational knowledge and, at the same time, there is not always a significant and linear relationship between conflict characteristics and knowledge creation dimensions. Recent theories on organizational conflict underline the strategic role of conflict, as neither positive or negative, but always necessary to preserve and further the survival of a firm. Therefore, the outcomes of the application could prove very important in improving the organizational effectiveness and day-to-day efficiency of hospitals.

Since 2005, two national hospital accreditation surveys have been conducted in Lebanon. In 2010, the Ministry of Health integrated patient safety standards into the current program. This study is one of the first efforts in Lebanon and the region to assess hospitals' readiness to integrate patient safety standards into routine practice. Methods: This cross-sectional study sampled 6807 respondents from 68 hospitals in Lebanon. This paper will detail results from the qualitative thematic analysis of the responses on 5 open-ended questions added to the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. The emerging themes were compared across regions, accreditation status, and hospital size. Results: Lebanese hospitals have made progress by recognizing patient safety as a major strategic goal and priority, but gaps still exist in implementation. Very few hospitals are ready for effective implementation of these standards. Staff education and training are needed. Public awareness about patient safety and integrating these concepts into health educational curricula were cited as important strategies among others for creating a culture of patient safety. Variations in responses across regions, accreditation status, and hospital size were discussed. Discussion and Conclusions: Integrating patient safety initiatives into routine practices requires a cultural shift in health-care organizations. Before assessing whether hospitals comply with patient safety standards, it is important to provide them with sufficient training and education on how to successfully implement these standards. Study findings provide valuable lessons for Lebanon and other countries, which are in the process or currently mandating the implementation of patient safety standards and/or accreditation programs.

The paper presents the results of an intercalibration exercise among four Black Sea phytoplankton laboratories (NIMRD-RO, IBSS-LTKR, IO-RAS - RUS and IO-BAS - BLG) conducted under SESAME FP6 Project with the objectives: 1) to assess the degree of comparability of phytoplankton and chlorophyll a data produced by routine in-house methods; 2) to formulate recommendations for progress towards harmonization of the research methodology in the Black Sea. The statistical treatment of the results reveal that at the level of total phytoplankton abundance and biomass as well as chlorophyll a the data were in a good agreement, while for some taxonomic classes (Prymnesiophyccae and small flagellates) the differences were significant. The counted sample volume proves essential for detection of species diversity and the methods of species specific biovolume measurements - for the total biomass. As a follow up Guidelines for QC/QA of phytoplankton data and check-list with suggested shapes for biovolume calculation were produced under UP-Grade Black Sea SCENE FP7 Project that offer key options for progress.

Experiments were conducted in young plantations of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) in a northern temperate climate. We assessed the efficiency of using a fine mesh fabric shelter and the effects of different types of competing vegetation (none, herbaceous, or woody) to determine the best practices to implement for the success of hardwood plantations. Despite a possible loss of seedling robustness (increased stem etiolation), the use of shelters was beneficial for seedling vigor and growth (increased height and diameter). For both species, herbivore damage was also generally reduced by shelters. Control of herbaceous vegetation competition appeared essential during the early stages of plantation establishment. The optimal management of woody competing vegetation requires further assessment to see if the positive effect of improving bole quality compensates for the negative effect on growth. For the purpose of wood quality production, investments in shelter use and strategic management of competing vegetation must be weighed financially.

J	Rizzo, A; Fulford, H				Rizzo, Alexander; Fulford, Heather			UNDERSTANDING SMALL BUSINESS STRATEGY: A GROUNDED THEORY STUDY ON SMALL FIRMS IN THE E.U. STATE OF MALTA	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING CULTURE			English	Article						Strategy; patterns of strategic behaviour; small firm; entrepreneurship; typology; grounded theory; trajectory; orientation	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENT; RESOURCE; GROWTH; INNOVATION; DYNAMICS; ISSUES; IMPACT	The common argument for the small business is that there simply is no strategy; that small businesses react heuristically to events, guided by the whims and passions of the owner-manager. Strategy, however, can be looked at from a behavioural perspective, as opposed to the more normative strategic planning schools that small firms rarely abide by. This concept of strategy as 'behaviour' encompasses the actions of the owner-manager, the context of the small firm, and the consequences of the actions taken. It looks at strategy as part deliberate and part emergent, allowing for the inclusion of both external influences and internal decision making. Grounded theory research on small firms in Malta has in fact shown strategy to be a dynamic phenomenon, one that can be viewed as a set of defined pathways between identifiable life cycle states. The paper shall outline the research findings that have identified five distinct patterns of small firm strategic behaviour, each with its own unique trajectory and performance implications. Understanding which strategic pathway a small firm belongs to allows for a comprehensive insight into the firm's competitive behaviour, and a prediction of the consequences of that behaviour.

J	Allcock, D				Allcock, Deborah			The choice, design and strategic implications of executive incentive pay schemes at the time of an Initial Public Offering A UK perspective	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper presents a critical analysis of the choice and design of executive pay incentive scheme arrangements implemented at the time of a company's initial public offering. Using a unique sample of 311 entrepreneurial companies over a five year period (1998-2002) it discovers that 172 companies implement executive share option schemes for the first time at their initial public offering. Taking this sub-sample, the paper evaluates and analyses the strategic choices made with regard to incentive pay schemes by the board of directors at this crucial time in a company's development. It finds that company's choices are split between schemes that have performance targets linked to reward and others that are contrary to the guidelines of the UK's Corporate Governance Code and best practice. Furthermore, it shows company characteristics that affect schemes and elaborates on the configuration of incentive schemes in respect of three critical elements: the performance target, comparator, and target level requirement for the shares to vest. In light of this, it proposes strategic reasons as to how these schemes might be set for initial public offerings and proposes that explanations for implementation are not underpinned by traditional agency theory but linked to a resource based view of the firm.

The pressures of complex environment and organization lead to business teams become distributed along with the dimension of space, time and computing. There is a need to develop a collaborative approach that can facilitate strategic decision-making and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of resource management. Much needed as well is integrating into this collaborative decision-making process a computer-based group decision support system (GDSS) to support and facilitate strategic decision making. This study attempts to provide the better understanding of how technology helps to enrich organizations decision-making and identifies, which factors influence on group decision making performance.

The intervention was established in January 2004 and involves 72 volunteer infant feeding and care counselors, supervised by 24 government Health Surveillance Assistants, covering 355 villages in Mchinji district. It aims to change the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of women to promote exclusive breastfeeding and other infant care practices. The main target population are women of child bearing age who are visited at five key points during pregnancy and after birth. Where possible, their partners are also involved. The visits cover exclusive breastfeeding and other important neonatal and infant care practices. Volunteers are provided with an intervention manual and picture book. Resource inputs are low and include training allowances and equipment for counselors and supervisors, and a salary, equipment and materials for a coordinator. It is hypothesized that the counselors will encourage informational and attitudinal change to enhance motivation and risk reduction skills and self-efficacy to promote exclusive breastfeeding and other infant care practices and reduce infant mortality. The impact is being evaluated through a cluster randomised controlled trial and results will be reported in 2012.

Vibration measurements were conducted for three different mine rooms and three different drivers. The vector sum value of the root-mean- square acceleration, the vector sum value of the acceleration dose and the kurtosis sum were utilized to quantify the measured vibration. The unbalanced two-way ANOVA and the Kramer-Tukey test were utilized for the statistical analysis. The results show that the operating styles of the drivers in performing scaling activity and their interaction with the mine rooms have no significant effect on the vector sum value of the acceleration, the vector sum value of the acceleration dose and the kurtosis sum value. The mine rooms have a significant effect on the kurtosis sum value and the vector sum value of the acceleration dose, but not on the vector sum value of the acceleration.

We propose the mixed threshold allocation policy as an optimal state-dependent policy that induces optimal service capacity from strategic servers. Compensation to the server can be paid at customer allocation or upon job completion. Our study focuses on the use of a multiple-server mixed threshold allocation policy to replicate the demand of a given state-independent policy to achieve a symmetric equilibrium with lower expected sojourn time. The results indicate that, under both payment schemes, for any given multiple-server state-independent policy, there exists a multiple-server threshold policy that produces identical demand allocation and Nash equilibrium (if any). Moreover, the policy can be designed to minimize the expected sojourn time at a symmetric equilibrium. Furthermore, under the payment-at-allocation scheme, our results, combining with existing results on the optimality of the multiple-server linear allocation policy, show that the mixed threshold policy can achieve the maximum feasible service capacity and thus the minimum feasible equilibrium expected sojourn time. Hence, our results agree with previous two-server results and affirm that a trade-off between incentives and efficiency need not exist in the case of multiple servers.

J	Melouk, SH; Keskin, BB				Melouk, S. H.; Keskin, B. B.			Team assignments and scheduling for the NCAA basketball tournament	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						sports; integer programming; team assignment; scheduling; OR applications	SPORTS COMPETITIONS	The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) organizes a men's basketball tournament every March to determine the national champion for the current season. In organizing the tournament, the emphasis is typically on selection of the most deserving teams to participate and providing a fair, equitable environment in which to play that result in a true, undisputed champion for the season. However, there are growing concerns of dwindling actual attendance at tournament games and increasing financial burden on the NCAA related to reimbursable team travel expenses. In this paper, we describe the development of an integer program designed to optimize team assignments in the sense of minimizing the distance travelled by teams to game sites and the corresponding travel costs. The goal is to increase tournament accessibility to fans as well as lessen the financial impact to the NCAA while maintaining the integrity of the tournament. We test our model against actual tournament assignments from the past 5 years. Results show consistent and significant cost savings and reductions in distance travelled without compromising the fairness and structure of the tournament. Overall, we demonstrate the usefulness of the model in both operational and strategic business decisions.

Strategic Management for Sustainable Ecotourism in Darabad Region in Tehran, Iran	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Sustainable tourism; Quantitative strategic planning matrix; Strategic position and action evaluation; Urban ecotourism management		'The purpose of this study was to formulate a proper strategy for ecotourism creation in Darabad region, located in the northeast of Tehran, Iran adjacent to Alborz Mountains. This region is one of the tourism and recreational regions, where is considerably potential to attract many visitors and tourists. To achieve this purpose, firstly the status of ecotourism management was evaluated using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) method. In this regards, external and internal factors were measured and gained 2.42 and 2.88 scores, respectively. This indicated the amount of threats exceeding the opportunities and strengths are more than the weaknesses. Secondly, 21 strategies were formulated. For scoring the strategies, quantitative strategic planning matrix was applied and the obtained results were reasonably used for strategic position and action evaluation matrix. The study showed that the present situation of destination, in terms of ecotourism management, is in "competitive" classification. The findings of this study present the need for developing proper promotional plans, in order to introduce regional attractions; developing welfare and safe recreational facilities such as accommodations for enhancing the eco-tourist attractions; identifying and introducing the carrying capacities of tourists and visitors in the region and establishing subtle monitoring plans in order to identify the environmental destructions due to visitors' presence and tourists through the region.

Preparedness for Pandemics: Does Variation Among States Affect the Nation as a Whole?	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						computational modeling; pandemics; preparedness; public health systems	PUBLIC-HEALTH PREPAREDNESS; UNITED-STATES; INFLUENZA; VACCINATION	Objective: Since states' public health systems differ as to pandemic preparedness, this study explored whether such heterogeneity among states could affect the nation's overall influenza rate. Design: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produced a uniform set of scores on a 100-point scale from its 2008 national evaluation of state preparedness to distribute materiel from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). This study used these SNS scores to represent each state's relative preparedness to distribute influenza vaccine in a timely manner and assumed that "optimal" vaccine distribution would reach at least 35% of the state's population within 4 weeks. The scores were used to determine the timing of vaccine distribution for each state: each 10-point decrement of score below 90 added an additional delay increment to the distribution time. Setting and Participants: A large-scale agent-based computational model simulated an influenza pandemic in the US population. In this synthetic population each individual or agent had an assigned household, age, workplace or school destination, daily commute, and domestic intercity air travel patterns. Main Outcome Measures: Simulations compared influenza case rates both nationally and at the state level under 3 scenarios: no vaccine distribution (baseline), optimal vaccine distribution in all states, and vaccine distribution time modified according to state-specific SNS score. Results: Between optimal and SNS-modified scenarios, attack rates rose not only in low-scoring states but also in high-scoring states, demonstrating an interstate spread of infections. Influenza rates were sensitive to variation of the SNS-modified scenario (delay increments of 1 day versus 5 days), but the interstate effect remained. Conclusions: The effectiveness of a response activity such as vaccine distribution could benefit from national standards and preparedness funding allocated in part to minimize interstate disparities.

The APIC research agenda: Results from a national survey	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL			English	Article						Research priorities; Infection prevention research	INFECTION-CONTROL; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION	Background: Research is an integral component of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) Strategic Plan 2020. As the role of the infection preventionist (IP) has evolved toward consumers and implementers of research, it becomes increasingly necessary to assess which topics require further evidence and how best APIC can assist IPs. In 2010, APIC determined that the research priorities first described in 2000 needed to be re-evaluated. Methods: A 33-question Web-based survey was developed and distributed via e-mail to APIC members in March 2011. The survey contained sections inquiring about respondents' demographics, familiarity with implementation science, and infection prevention research priorities. Priorities identified by a Delphi study 10 years ago were re-ranked, and open-ended items were used to identify new research priorities and understand how APIC could best serve its members in relation to research. Results: Seven hundred one members responded. Behavioral management science, surveillance standards, and infection prevention resource optimization were the highest ranked priorities and relatively unchanged from 2000. Proposed additional research topics focused on achieving standardization in infection prevention practices and program resource allocation. The majority of respondents described APIC's role in the field of research as a disseminator of low-cost, highly accessible education to its members. Conclusion: This report should be used as a roadmap for APIC leadership as it provides suggestions on how APIC may best direct the association's research program. The major research priorities described and ranked in 2000 continue to challenge IPs. APIC can best serve its members by disseminating research findings in a cost-effective and easily accessed manner. Recurrent assessments of research priorities can help guide researchers and policy makers and help determine which topics will best support successful infection prevention processes and outcomes.

Methods: A MEDLINE search for articles on pediatric trauma from GCC countries during the period 1960 to 2010 was performed. The content of articles was analyzed, classified and summarized. Results: Fifty-three articles were found and retrieved of which 18 (34%) were published in the last 5 years, 42 (79.2%) were original articles. The first author was affiliated to a university in 29 reports (54.7%), to a community hospital in 13 (24.5%) and to a military hospital in 10 (18.9%). All articles were observational studies that included 18 (34%) case-control studies, 18 (34%) case reports/case series studies, 8 (15.1%) prospective studies, and 7 (13.2%) cross sectional studies. The median (range) impact factor of the journals was 1.3 (0.5-3.72). No meta-analysis studies were found. Conclusion: A strategic plan is required to support pediatric trauma research in GCC countries so as to address unmet needs. Areas of deficiency include pre-hospital care, post-traumatic psychological effects and post-traumatic rehabilitation, interventional studies focused on a safe child environment and attitude changes, and the socioeconomic impact of pediatric trauma.

Integration of health management in schools using the Balanced Scorecard as a strategic management instrument	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-HEIDELBERG			English	Article						Health-promoting school; Occupational health management; Health; Management; Health promotion; Balanced Scorecard	PROMOTION	Aim Organizational development is crucial to health promotion in different settings. The Learn to Live Healthy intervention [German: Gesund Leben Lernen (GLL)] is a new school health promotion strategy designed to develop schools into healthy environments for all those who work and study there. GLL focuses on strengthening available health resources and reducing negative and excessive health stresses. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC), a strategic management instrument designed to support change processes, is employed in this BMBF-funded study. This research will assess the suitability of the BSC as a management and evaluation instrument for schools. Subjects and methods GLL assists schools in implementing health management programs with the aid of school coaches. Besides setting up steering committees and health circles, goals and action measures are defined and operationalized using a participatory quality development and evaluation approach. The intervention focuses on project organization instruments to implement organizational change processes in schools, develop these processes in a goal-oriented, systematic and sustainable manner, and improve the quality of education in schools by means of health interventions. It uses the BSC as a supportive strategic management tool. The BSC provides the basis for the definition and prioritization of goals at the participating schools and facilitates the measurement of health promotion activities in schools. Structured telephone interviews were conducted for a post-workshop evaluation of methodology for the implementation process of the BSC. Results A preliminary evaluation of the implementation process revealed a fundamental need to integrate the Lower Saxon Policy Framework for School Quality. Therefore, the School-BSC no longer evaluates schools from four perspectives, but rather from six, pursuant to the Policy Framework. The health specialists expect the School-BSC to promote goal-oriented and structured work and transparency within schools. Considering the participatory approach, two health specialists were enlisted to optimize the training concept. Conclusions Evaluation of the School-BSC in schools makes it possible to assess its suitability as a management and evaluation instrument in these organizations. Newly developed school programs largely dispelled the initial reservations of the health specialists. The School-BSC is viewed as a useful tool for the creation of organizational structures and transparency and for the facilitation of work. This study provides information useful for enhancing management-related interventions.

J	Pidun, T; Felden, C				Pidun, Tim; Felden, Carsten			On Improving the Visibility of Hard-Measurable Process Performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Assessment; Business Process Management (BPM); Business Processes; Indicator; Knowledge; Performance Measurement Systems (PMS); Visibility		Performance measurement systems (PMS) are necessary to ensure adequate information supply to management, but an information gap exists between process analysis and execution. PMS predominantly rely on countable, objective measures, but are also designed to deliver additional viewpoints to foster necessary explanations to measurements. Still, there is no definition of how well these approaches work in delivering sufficient explanatory information. The introduced concept of visibility of performance explains how the explication of process performance information leads to additional interpretation possibilities in performance measurement to deliver embedded and rich knowledge. It is tested on a business case, in which additional subjective information could be explicated through the application of a suitable Performance Assessment Model. The result of the explication of this knowledge is an enhanced comprehension of performance that bridges the information gap between operative and strategic level.

Investment in Human Capital as a Means to Preserve IT Strategic Advantage in an Organization: A Case Study of Greece	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS			English	Article						Financial Development; Human Capital; Information Technology; Resource Management; Strategic Planning		The rapid evolution of technology during the past decade has increased among large organizations, while at that same time they are reducing costs to retain their strategic advantage in the market. Organizations have also realized that numerous employees or cutting the size of an organization is not always a solution. Most recently, they have turned their attention to the human factor, which is renewable, to gain and retain strategic advantage inside a competitive market. The paper analyses investment in human capital, demonstrating how it is the sole solution. This paper examines knowledge employees, based on a well-structured IT department, and how they increase productivity and comprise the core of the organization structure. The leadership of an organization must administer its human resources properly to maximize the profit of their investment.

J	Coelho, J; Butler, R				Coelho, Julio; Butler, Richard			THE TOURISM AREA LIFE CYCLE A quantitive approach of the tourism area life cycle	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TOURISM HOSPITALITY AND RECREATION			English	Article						Tourism life cycle; competitiveness; tourism development; tourism strategies	HUMAN-DEVELOPMENT INDEX; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DESTINATION; EVOLUTION; TRANSPORT; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS	The Tourism Area Life Cycle -TALC model (Butler, 1980), has been one of the most cited models to explain the evolution of a tourism destination. However, this model has been an object of criticism, because while being a strong descriptive theory, it is not a normative or deterministic model, and consequently, has a weakness as a tool to define the best strategic policies in a competitive context. We propose a Tourism Development Index (TDI) that can identify the stage of the life cycle and, at the same time can give us the level of development of a tourism destination in a competitive context. Through a random simulation, based on specific assumptions, we confirmed the possibility of quantifying the different stages of the life cycle, and thus making it possible to identify at which stage a destination is in an international competitive context.

Alignment of all on-going projects with the overall business strategy is generally recognised as very important for most modern organisations. The aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework embracing a number of key variables of PPM and corresponding interrelations, derived from the extant body of literature, and to test it empirically. We conducted a survey among experienced portfolio managers representing a wide range of organisations possessing established PPM mechanisms. Data obtained in this tailor-made survey was tested in the framework using Structural Equation Modelling. Our results provide support to most of the formulated hypotheses. On the basis of our findings, we formulate several managerial implications.

We find that firms with a high degree of managerial ownership and leverage, plus firms with high growth options, high asset tangibility, and public listing status are more likely to insure their assets than other entities. We also observe that different factors determine the amount of property insurance purchased, in particular, the higher the degree of managerial ownership and indebtedness the less indemnity coverage acquired. Additionally, the younger the firm the greater the amount of insurance purchased.

Synthetic zeolite ZA nanoparticles were synthesized from natural clinoptilolite as Si source and sodium aluminate as Al source. The silver doped natural and synthetic zeolites were characterized by instrumental analysis methods, i.e., X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX) and FTIR spectroscopy. The equilibrium adsorption studies for humic acid allowed to assess the sorption capacity of the each zeolite, described by the adsorption isotherms, which informs about the surface properties and affinity of the material for the investigated pollutant. Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) adsorption isotherms were used to determine the equilibrium constants for the adsorption of the humic acid on the zeolite for various conditions, e.g., humic acid concentrations and zeolite amount. Also, adsorption kinetics has been studied in terms of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order to elucidate some sorption mechanistic aspects. All determined equilibrium and kinetic parameters showed that silver doped synthetic zeolite exhibited better adsorptive affinity and capacity for humic acid removal from aqueous solutions, in comparison with the silver doped natural zeolite.

Research suggests that in order to motivate and retain an organisation's best people, the key is to understand their strengths and maximize their opportunities to apply these strengths. Further, the study emphasizes why constraining a talent's ability to customize their role and career path (which we define as the "Mahna-Mahna" effect) must be addressed by any strategic coaching intervention in order to effectively support talent retention.

So it seems that implanting an appropriate HSE culture would be a useful step toward a decrease in workplace accidents. Obviously developing an HSE culture first corrects individual behaviors then decreases human errors. Although implantation of an HSE culture deals with a number of factors, based on the results of the current study, management is the key factor. In fact values, incentives and behavioral patterns that show commitment to work methods and abilities of an HSE culture, are the main material which build the HSE culture. This study mainly discusses HSE cultures including commitment, leadership, policy, strategic objectives, organization, documentation, resources, risk assessment and management, planning, stability and revision and auditing. In this study, 175 employees of Arvandan Oil and Gas Company were chosen by Morgan table out of 320 employees then the questionnaires were distributed among them. Reliability and perpetuity of the questionnaire was calculated through Cronbach's alpha (0.971). Data from the questionnaire was transferred to data bank and statistical analyses were conducted by SPSS19 software. The desirability of the HSE culture was classified in a 5-point range using Likert's scale, ranging from "completely desirable" to "completely undesirable". Results of T and Friedman test showed that cultural elements of HSE are in a desirable level in Arvandan Oil and Gas Company.

J	Aoki, H; Miyajima, H				Aoki, Hidetaka; Miyajima, Hideaki			Benchmarking business unit governance in turbulent times: the case of Japanese firms	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Business unit governance; Decentralization; Monitoring; Two-tiered agency relationships; Wholly owned subsidiary; Internal business unit; Japan; Governance; Corporate governance		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how corporate headquarters control business units, the governing of which has emerged as a vital issue as business portfolios have grown increasingly complex due to diversification, globalization, and corporate group expansion via spinoffs and mergers and acquisitions. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilized questionnaire survey data from 251 firms listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The authors approached the issue of business unit governance by measuring the degree of decentralization and the intensity of monitoring, and compared the governance of internal business units with that of subsidiaries, and analyzed the impact of corporate governance characteristics on business unit governance. Findings - Comparing in-house business units and subsidiaries, the authors found a significant difference in their governance. The degree of decentralization toward subsidiaries was higher for strategic and personnel decision-making. However, the complementarity of decentralization and monitoring was not observed for subsidiaries, whereas it was for in-house business units. Subsidiary monitoring corresponding to decentralization was inadequate. Examining the relationship between corporate governance and business unit governance, the paper found that firms with reformed boards of directors and under a greater degree of pressure from capital markets monitored their business units more strictly.

ICT sourcing can be a strategic lever to guarantee effectiveness and, at the same time, to increase an enterprise's dynamic capabilities and foster continuous innovation. Innovation and learning can be enabled by collaboration with a network of specialised and integrated suppliers of ICT services and technologies. The work is based on a survey of 79 enterprises and an empirical study involving 40 cases. Evidence derived from the sample supports the identification of suitable sourcing models, coherent in terms of strategy, organisation and competence management, in order to manage suppliers as a potential source of innovation. Research results also pinpoint the barriers keeping ICT suppliers from carrying out their role as true innovators in an enterprise's continuous innovation process.

Organizational ergonomics of occupational health methods and processes in a Brazilian oil refinery	WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION			English	Article						reliability; health management; user satisfaction; leadership		Organizational ergonomics refers to the optimization of social technical systems, including their organizational structures, policies and processes. The relevant topics include communications, management of resources, work projects, temporal organization of work, team work, participative project, new work paradigms, cooperative work, organizational culture, network organizations and quality management (IEA, 2000). The purpose of this study was the reorganization of the methods and processes of the occupational health sector (SMS/SO - Portuguese acronym of the area) of a petrochemical company. The work involved thirty professionals: a coordinator, two occupational physicians, one cardiologist, one occupational dentist, two occupational nurses, eleven occupational health technicians, one social worker, one nutritionist, one phonoaudiologist, one ophthalmologist, one biochemist, two ergonomists, three administrative assistants, one administrator and one psychologist, during a six-month period. The methodology that was used sought to establish a cooperative alliance focused on change, transformation and acquisition of skills, reflecting directly on the attitudes and performance of the leaderships and their work teams. In addition to the feedback practice, the following supporting tools were used for the study's success: "Functional Polyvalence Matrix", "Management of Failures", 5W2H", "6M", "5 Why" and "process mapping". The intended results after the organization ergonomics restructuring process will allow the leader to help his or her team to make a diagnosis of the problems, identify options, develop strategies, establish targets and action plans, remove barriers, review contexts and implement the business management fundaments: planning, organization, management, coordination and control. The transformation possibilities allow us to consider some hypothesis: Before: Focus only on results. After: Engage collaborators to create sustainable results. Before: Operating profile. After: Tactical/strategic profile. Before: Find errors. After: Value effort and development. Before: Listen to what is being said. After: Understand what is being said. Before: Create fears of the consequences. After: Create room for risk. Before: Be the one who approves and decides. After: Be the cooperative support.	[Bau, Lucy M.

J	Bjork, P				Bjork, Peter			BRAND RECOVERY: A QUICK FIX MODEL FOR BRAND STRUCTURE COLLAPSE	JOURNAL OF TRAVEL & TOURISM MARKETING			English	Article						Brand structure; brand identity; destination branding; well-being tourism	TOURISM; IMAGE	Exploring the gap between brand profile and brand identity, this study discusses destination branding strategies from the supply-side perspective using well-being tourism development in Finland as a case study. To apply branding strategies to destination marketing is a challenge, especially when brand structures are created by external experts in a top-down manner with minimum coordination. Few destination branding researchers have focused on strategies for restoring the brand structure. The strategic quick-fix model developed in this article comprises three phases: learn, coordinate, and organize. It is presented as a destination brand management tool for brand recovery, which highlights the importance of knowledge transfer, active actors, and external support.

J	Boyle, B; McDonnell, A; Mitchell, R; Nicholas, S				Boyle, Brendan; McDonnell, Anthony; Mitchell, Rebecca; Nicholas, Stephen			Managing knowledge in internationalizing universities through foreign assignments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge transfer; Internationalization; Universities; Employees; Job mobility; Human resourcing	FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; HIGHER-EDUCATION; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - This article discusses the opportunities presented by the globalization of education and the role of knowledge management in successful global expansion. It seeks to explain why the tacit dimensions of the knowledge transferred during international education provision makes it difficult to provide educational services in offshore campuses, absent the transfer of people. Design/methodology/approach - The article draws on literature in the discipline of international business to explain why internationalizing universities need to consider the role of knowledge transfer as a strategic imperative. As this is a conceptual article, arguments are built on insights from extant theoretical and empirical work. Findings - Based on the analysis of a diverse body of academic literature in the areas of international business, knowledge management and education theory, this article demonstrates the role of foreign assignments in the transfer of tacit knowledge in universities with offshore campuses. Research limitations/implications - The implications of the proposition raised in this article are presented with a focus on how they affirm the need for foreign assignments for effective knowledge management in internationalizing universities. Those implications include the need to use assignments to deliver courses offshore and to create face-to-face interactions with academics at partner universities. Originality/value - Drawing on a diverse body of academic literature, this article provides theoretical and practical insights into how assignments can be utilized in international educational management, international educational delivery, and the creation of an environment in which knowledge resources can be utilized on an international basis.

J	Buntak, K; Adelsberger, Z; Nad, I				Buntak, Kresimir; Adelsberger, Zdenko; Nad, Ivan			IMPACT OF PRODUCT QUALITY IN THE BUSINESS OF THE ORGANIZATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						product quality; economics of quality; quality cycle; quality management system; competitiveness		Quality has become a strategic goal and competition priority in the modern economy and certainly a key weapon in the battles to conquer new markets. Also extremely important is to ensure customer satisfaction, particularly with regard to ensuring high quality at an affordable price. Besides all that, it is essential to balance the alignment of interests, not only of producers and consumers, but of all interested parties. This means that, besides quality in the sense of usefulness of the product, the major importance lies in the performance management of the product realization process with the constant optimization of the cost in order to achieve a competitive and reasonable price for the buyer. Along the competitive price, it is important that the manufacturer provides sufficient funding to ensure a lasting and stable development. This relationship and exchange between quality and cost belongs to the fields of economics of quality and business efficiency. The process of transformation of consumers' desires and needs into a particular product is known as the cycle of quality. The aim of this paper is to lay the foundations, through analyzing the field of quality economics, for the research on the impact of product quality management on the competitiveness and business of organizations, especially those with an implemented quality management system.

J	Chetty, L; Mearns, M				Chetty, Lameshnee; Mearns, Martie			Using communities of practice towards the next level of knowledge-management maturity	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Background: Effective communities of practice undoubtedly impact organisations' knowledge management and contribute towards building a learning-organisation culture. Communities of practice represent an environment conducive to learning and for exchanging ideas, and they are a formal learning forum. However, the level of organisational learning to which communities of practice contribute is difficult to measure. Objectives: The research was conducted to analyse the impact of communities of practice on building a learning organisation. The organisational system, culture and people offer the key towards leveraging knowledge as a strategic resource in a learning organisation. The awareness of the organisation concerning knowledge management was measured on a replicated knowledge-management maturity model. Method: The organisational knowledge base was analysed prior to the implementation of the communities of practice and was compared to the situation three years later. The research was based on experiential learning cycles that consisted of five consequential but perpetual stages, namely reflect, plan, act, observe and reflect again. Results: The results indicated that communities of practice were instrumental in leveraging the organisation to the next level in the knowledge-management maturity model. A collaboration framework was developed for each business unit to work towards a common goal by harnessing the knowledge that was shared. Conclusion: Although a positive impact by communities of practice is visible, an instrument for the measurement of intellectual capital is necessary. It is recommended that the monetary value of knowledge as an asset is determined so that the value of the potential intellectual capital can be measured.

J	Chibelushi, C; Trigg, D				Chibelushi, Caroline; Trigg, David			Internal self-assessment for ICT SMEs: a way forward	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information and communication technology small and medium enterprises; ICT SMEs; information and communication technology; ICT; self-assessment		Information and communication technology (ICT) is largely used as a strategic business factor. Consequently, business opportunities for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the ICT industry are potentially very strong, as they are the service and product providers. Many assume that ICT SMEs understand the importance of continuously assessing their internal activities, such as their management capabilities, technology investment strategies, and equipment provision to their employees for their competitive advantage. However, this has often not been the case and many ICT SMEs are poorly managed, less well equipped, and often the employees depend on open source software. Our previous research showed that most ICT SMEs face various challenges. In order to understand the details of these challenges, a research was conducted on two failed companies. This paper's contribution includes detailing the side effects of lack of company's self-assessment for its internal business activities which may reduce ICT SME's critical challenges and failure. Also, we propose a new framework that can reduce these challenges.

J	Darbi, WPK				Darbi, William Phanuel Kofi			How do high-performing organizations define their mission in Ghana?	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Ghana; Corporate governance; Mission statements; Mission statement components; Strategy; Strategic management; Ghana-based firms		Purpose-High performing firms have been associated with "quality" mission statements defined by the choice of components. In an attempt to extend our knowledge in order to give more legitimacy to these claims and also provide more local and relevant reference for Ghana-based firms, the purpose of this paper is to investigate, through a component analysis, how high-performing Ghana-based firms define their mission. Design/methodology/approach-Mission statements of 50 of the Ghana Club 100 firms, primarily extracted from the official web sites, Initial Public Offer prospectuses and annual reports of the firms, were subjected to content analysis which evaluated and scored the mission statements based on the occurrence of 20 specific components. Findings-The paper found that high-performing Ghana-based firms define missions to include components that the literature uses to measure quality; and these are similar to those of the UK, Canada and Ireland. Based on the ranking of the components, three categories were identified: the imperatives, the highlights, and the adjuncts. Research limitations/implications-The paper lumped together all firms irrespective of industry or sector. There is, therefore, the need to conduct further research to identify possible industry or sectoral differences, for better insight and relevance. Practical implications-Ideas generated in this paper provide a guide to practitioners and firms regarding how they can develop mission statements, drawing on experiences of high-performing Ghana-based firms. Originality/value-This is the first attempt to study how high-performing Ghana-based firms define their mission and hence is a major contribution to the scarce if not non-existent Africa-specific studies. It also provides a more prescriptive approach to crafting mission statements by proposing hierarchies of the components of mission statements.

Strategic Positioning of the Push-Pull Boundary within a Supply Chain: An Ordering Policy Co-ordination Perspective	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						supply chain; push-pull boundary; information sharing; discrete event simulation; Taguchi experimental design; average fill rates; average inventory levels		The rapid advancement in IT communication enables the availability of demand data in a seamless manner. One manifestation of this technological advancement within the supply chain (SC) domain has been the emergence of a push-pull boundary (PPB). Push-pull boundary is a virtual demarcation point separating the portion of the SC under decentralized from that operating under centralized information sharing. However, the impact of key issues like adoption of inventory ordering policy characterized by the various echelons of a SC network structure while positioning the push-pull boundary need to be investigated comprehensively (Ahn and Kaminsky, 2005). This paper is concerned with the 'Average Fill Rate' and 'Average Total Inventory Cost' performance behaviour of a SC network structure. These performances typically results from different parameters that involves: (i) inventory ordering policy, (ii) push-pull boundary under the influence of information sharing, (iii) forecasting error, and (iv) lead time and their standard deviations. The study is accomplished via Taguchi experimental design framework and simulation analysis. The results suggest the effect of various factors on SC network system wide performance and identify the appropriate combinations of these factors for optimal performance concerned.	[Dev, N.

J	Dias, C				Dias, Casimiro			The Future of public health services in Europe: Strategic intersection with healthcare services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health system; Public health services; Health care services; Europe		This paper outlines some of the major challenges on strengthening public health, including consideration of public health services (PHS) and infrastructure, as well as some of the public health aspects of health care services. The purpose of the paper is to articulate the roles and functions of PHS and health care services. Such integrated health systems that combine individual and community approaches have an important potential to improve health outcomes. In line with the broad scope of PHS, where it spans the health-generating activities of both the health system and other sectors of society, it analyses its role and links towards health outcomes. The paper further presents the 10 horizontal 'essential public health operations' (EPHOs), describing the core PHS within each of them, as the unifying and guiding basis to set up, monitor and evaluate actions and strategies for development of public health. It concludes that strengthening PHS calls for implementation of the EPHOs while recognising strategic linkages with health care services and other sectors of society. Within this context, opportunities for intersection emerge towards improvement of health care quality, health promotion, disease prevention, and health surveillance.

J	Diers, D				Diers, Dorothea			A multi-year risk capital concept for internal models and enterprise risk management	JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE			English	Article						Non-life insurance; Enterprise risk management; Multi-year risk capital; Capital allocation; Risk management; Capital		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how risk capital can be calculated and allocated in a multi-year context. This is an important issue, since strategic management and decision making within insurance companies require a multi-year time horizon (instead of a one-year time horizon, as set out in solvency models). Design/methodology/approach - After defining risk capital in a multi-year context, the paper discusses the different properties of the multi-year risk capital concept. The paper also presents an allocation rule of how to allocate the multi-year risk capital to individual years as well as to individual segments. The paper applies the author's model framework in an application study to illustrate the different effects. Findings - The paper shows how multi-year risk capital can be used as a basis for analyzing different management strategies within risk and return indicators in the context of value-based management. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the effect of allocating risk capital in a multi-year context. Originality/value - The analysis provides new and relevant information to insurance companies' management. Whereas usually solvency rules set out a time horizon of one year, in the context of internal risk models a multi-year planning horizon is taken into account. Management needs to get an idea of how much risk capital is necessary in order to survive the next five years without external capital supply. The paper presents an answer to these questions.

J	Donaldson, B; Lee, JH; Wright, G				Donaldson, Bill; Lee, Jong-Ho; Wright, George			Strategic and organisational determinants of sophistication in deployed sales force automation systems within three industry sectors in the UK	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sales force automation; sophistication of SFA systems; system implementation	TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MARKET ORIENTATION; INVARIANCE; CRM	This paper investigates strategic and organisational context determinants of the sophistication of adopted sales force automation (SFA) systems in three UK industries: financial services, pharmaceuticals, and building/construction. Sophistication of adopted systems is associated with the organisation placing greater emphasis on information orientation, which is itself driven by an increased integration of IT and sales coupled with increased organisational slack. Increased integration of IT and sales is itself driven by increased strategic importance of sales coupled with increased use of internal communication networks. Importantly, a firm's marketing orientation, although also driven by the strategic importance of sales, has no impact on either information orientation or SFA sophistication. We discuss the implications of our findings to aid understanding of SFA implementation failure.

From the standpoints of three prominent cultural leaders, this article addresses factors that directors must consider in guiding their institution forward, such as maintaining a strategic mix of funding and the delicate balance between mission and space. A key binding element among the institutions chosen is that they all underwent a major capital campaign and the construction of a new facility prior to the crisis.

J	Glastra, FJ; Meerman, M				Glastra, Folke J.; Meerman, Martha			Developing ethnic talent in the Dutch national tax administration: a case study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						The Netherlands; Ethnic minorities; Career development; Diversity management; Talent and career development; Human resource strategies; Organizational culture	MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; CAREER; WOMEN; MINORITIES; MOBILITY	Purpose - The lack of career movement of members of ethnic minority groups in work organizations has been widely documented. The purpose of this paper is to gain insight into conditions for the realization of diversity goals in the case of talent development. Design/methodology/approach - In a case study of management development in the Dutch national tax administration, the practice of fostering vertical mobility of ethnic minority personnel through diversity management has been analysed. The authors make use of theories regarding effective diversity management and career advancement of ethnic minority employees. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 12 participants in the management development course, and a further 25 functionaries involved in the project. Findings - With regard to diversity management as a means of fostering talent development of ethnic minorities, the authors come to the conclusion that key success factors mentioned in the literature such as top level commitment and strategic integration, are insufficient and overrated conditions. More important are "non-issues" in the formulation of diversity strategies, organizational alignment of relevant organizational players, strategic coherence and organizational culture. Research limitations/implications - The case study design used in this research facilitates case-sensitive analysis, but is limited in estimations of validity and explanatory strength of factors mentioned in the literature, as it is in generalizing across organizations. Practical implications - Interventions aimed at fostering ethnic diversity in talent development should start with precise analysis of cultural and organizational conditions and processes underpinning standard practices of talent and career development, and not only seek strategic integration and top management commitment but arrange for broad-based organizational alignment. Originality/value - While there are many theoretical and normative models tracing diversity outcomes to organizational conditions and diversity management strategies, there is a dearth of empirical studies in this field. The case study explores the merits of these models and adds new insights on an empirical basis.

J	Guercini, S				Guercini, Simone			Integrating Design and Fashion Marketing	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL FASHION MARKETING			English	Article						Integrating design; Fashion marketing; Fast fashion; Fashion design; Fashion business process		Fashion business processes and time are more and more related to the retailing and consumer rhythms than to traditional manufacturing timetables (Sheridan et al. 2006). Relation between design and marketing capabilities are evolving generating a field of innovation for the fashion firms. This special section of Journal of Global Fashion Marketing aims to offer a discussion about specific aspects of the interface between fashion design and marketing. More precisely the two articles included in this special section uses secondary research and interviews in depth with management of specific kinds of fashion firms. The first article, by Preiholt (2012), aims to uncover the reasons why fashion appears in terms of collective selection in a movement towards individual style in the way people dress. Here, fashion is viewed in terms of collective fashion trends and personal style. Thus, it is the clothes, dressing habits, and garments that are observed in the research. The paper shows how the theory of symbolic interactionism can be used as an analytical tool to bring transparency to the movement from collective selection towards individual style in the fashion industry. This theoretical approach, which is connected to social interaction helps avoid the classical research trap of making statements through the study of cause and effect. The analysis is made based on examples of meanings created around the garment through an observation of the process from the initial meaning the person gives to as a symbol in social interaction, to the final stage when it becomes an individual style. There are four such phases that together create the final picture of why fashion is heading towards individual style. All these phases have different sources, and naturally provide different answers to the initial research question in this paper. Once the garment is turned into an individual style and, as customers seek more details in garments, there then occur a collapse of the "total look" towards hyper individuality. The second article, by Guercini and Ranfagni (2012), examines the bureaux de style (style agencies) as producers of fashion trends and their interactions with textile firms in order to analyze their contribution in terms of knowledge and of competence to textile innovation processes. The business relationships for innovation has considerable current importance in the textile sector. Although this industry is considered mature, product innovation, based on the generation and exploitation of fashion trends, represents a fundamental strategic option to face the increasingly competitive pressure. In particular the paper tries to answer the following questions: How do the bureaux de style produce knowledge to generate fashion trends? What are the interactions between bureaux de style and textile firms in the production and sharing of fashion trends? What contribution do these interactions make to the textile product innovation? The research of Guercini and Ranfagni is based on an examination of the literature, on an analysis of secondary data and on deep interviews with managers of bureaux de style located in Italy and in France. The relation between fashion design and marketing is analyzed in these papers under different views and generate insightful perspective about the future of the fashion industry and important managerial implications. We believe that integrating fashion design and marketing is a fundamental topic to understand future of innovation in the fashion business and further research on the topic is needed in the next future.

Those have indicated to different recognitions: 1) when amplification of the 'problem' is necessary; 2) when amplification of the 'tipping point' is necessary, and 3) when amplification of the 'success' is necessary. The practical applications and implications of the ergonomics intervention techniques are drawn from the findings of framing positive questions: 1) what is successful ergonomics intervention technique right now (Appreciative)? 2) What do we need to change for a better future (Imagine)? 3) How do we do this (Design)? 4) Who takes action and with what consequences (Act)? This requires re-framing of the ergonomics intervention techniques in an appreciative way, because of, the future action needs to be inspired by those things that participants feel are worth valuing, worth celebrating and sustaining.

J	Helquist, JH; Deokar, A; Cox, JJ; Walker, A				Helquist, Joel H.; Deokar, Amit; Cox, Jordan J.; Walker, Alyssa			Analyzing process uncertainty through virtual process simulation	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Process analysis; Virtual process simulation; Process modeling; Risk management; Uncertainty management; Modelling; Opportunity management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose virtual process simulation as a technique for identifying and analyzing uncertainty in processes. Uncertainty is composed of both risks and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach - Virtual process simulation involves the creation of graphical models representing the process of interest and associated tasks. Graphical models representing the resources (e.g. people, facilities, tools, etc.)are also created. The members of the resources graphical models are assigned to process tasks in all possible combinations. Secondary calculi, representing uncertainty, are imposed upon these models to determine scores. From the scores, changes in process structure or resource allocation can be used to manage uncertainty. Findings - The example illustrates the benefits of utilizing virtual process simulation in process pre-planning. Process pre-planning can be used as part of strategic or operational uncertainty management. Practical implications - This paper presents an approach to clarify and assess uncertainty in new processes. This modeling technique enables the quantification of measures and metrics to assist in systematic uncertainty analysis. Virtual process simulation affords process designers the ability to more thoroughly examine uncertainty while planning processes. Originality/value - This research contributes to the study of uncertainty management by promoting a systematic approach that quantifies metrics and measures according to the objectives of a given process.

We find a positive effect of global centrality measures on individual satisfaction, while local centrality measures did not have a significant impact. Moreover, our results indicate that the aggregation of power within working teams is detrimental for team performance. When some individuals are in a position that allows them to exert power over others, the performance of teams suffers. On the contrary, betweenness centralization, which could enable some people to broker information across unconnected actors, could actually be beneficial for teams and increases overall performance. We conclude that combining information on team demographics and social networks might allow inferences into why certain teams perform better than others and into which areas human resource measures should be directed to improve team performance.

J	Jovo, TT				Jovo, Tauzovic T.			OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ELECTRONIC BUSINESS SYSTEM	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						Electronic business system (e-system or e-organisation); electronic business (e-business); electronic commerce (e-commerce); electronic operations (e-operations); electronic products (e-products); optimal management; Tauzovic's General Continuum (TGC); the theoretical (TGCt) and the practical (TGCp) form of Tauzovic's General Continuum (TGC)		Comprehensive electronic business (as an e-system /e-organisation/) is regarded as the most up-to-date business. For performance of its operations (e-operations) it uses Internet (as information-communication technologies), in the initial period through electronic commerce (e-commerce) as the operational part (management), and then through its extension (or upgrading) via electronic business (e-business) as its strategic part (management). Since the strategic part of management designs the e-system, and the operational part of management performs the production of electronic products (e-products), the e-system optimisation firstly determines the optimal e-system design, used subsequently as a basis for optimal production of e-products (goods, information, management and services). The innovative methodology known as Tauzovic's General Continuum (TGC) was used for modern optimisation of e-system management (e-operations design and production); more particularly, its theoretical form (TGCt) for strategic management, and the practical form (TGCp) for operational management. Given that the application of different TGC forms (TGCt and TGCp) in the optimisation of e-system management confirms its validity as a modern (systems) management methodology, it is to be expected that further development in management of contemporary and future systems will be based on the Tauzovic's General Continuum (TGC) methodology, particularly its two forms (TGCt and TGCp).

Objective: The main objective of the study was to examine records management practices in labour organisations in Botswana Methods: A quantitative paradigm largely guided this study. The researchers used a survey research strategy. Methodological triangulation of both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods complemented the strategy. The researchers surveyed all of the 50 registered labour organisations in Botswana. Of these, 45 responded. This is a response rate of 90%. The researchers obtained their data through structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, document reviews and observations. Results: The study showed that labour organisations in Botswana had some form of records management function. However, the management of both paper-based and electronic records was not satisfactory and fell short of the best-recognised records management standards and practices. Conclusion: Although the researchers limited the study to labour organisations, it sheds light on the challenges of managing records that most organisations in Botswana face. Its results provide useful strategic recommendations to promote effective records management in labour organisations in Botswana and elsewhere in Africa.

INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SPECIALITIES			English	Article						Bioterrorism; preparedness; anthrax; botulism; small pox		Bioterrorism is defined as the overt or covert dispensing of disease pathogens by individuals, groups or governments for the expressed purpose of causing harm for their ideological, political, or financial gains. Centre for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA classifies bioterrorism agents/diseases into three broad categories i.e., Category A, B and C types depending upon the severity of these agents. The global strategic plan to combat bioterrorism is based on the following five focus areas, with each area integrating training and research-Preparedness and Prevention, Detection and Surveillance, Diagnosis and Characterisation of biological agents, Responses and Communication system. Though India has established a National Institute for Disaster Management in 2003, it has no agenda specifically directed for bioterrorism and its mitigation. Early detection and control of biological attack depends on a strong and flexible public health and animal health system at local, state and national levels. Combating bioterrorism will require capitalising on advances in technology, information system and medical and veterinary sciences.

J	Kerttula, K; Takala, T				Kerttula, Kari; Takala, Tuomo			Power and strategic change in a multinational industrial corporation	LEADERSHIP & ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Power; Change; Group; Narrative; Management; Corporate culture; Organizational culture; Multinational companies		Purpose - The aim of the study was to analyze the use of power in a strategic change process within a large forest industry company. The organization in question had a total of 7,700 employees, 6-8 organizational levels, over 30 production units and a widespread international sales network. The study highlighted the organization's internal narration as an important element in the use of power. It started in conjunction with the appointment of the new management group and continued throughout the two-year monitoring period, so that gradually all organizational layers were involved in interpreting their roles and positions in the new structure. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical data were collected during a period of more than two years through participatory observation and the change narrative was made using the change report method. The use of power was observed from the perspective of the management group. The researcher had a dual role; he served both as a researcher and a member of the management group. Findings - The first conclusion revealed that the change did not represent a separate process that was taking place outside the normal, established functioning and management process of the organization. The second conclusion was that implementing a transformative change in a large organization is a multi-stage and challenging learning process, both for the change makers as well as for other members of the organization. The third conclusion was that there were no shortcuts to change. It took place through the thinking and actions of the people starting from the understanding of the measures required for the change. Research limitations/implications - There are three limitations to the study. First, its findings are based on the viewpoint of the new management group. Second, the role of the researcher and the episodic progress narrative edited by himself defined the change process as a five-phased process. Third, and closely linked to the previous limitation, the possible narrowness of the researcher in his thinking is also a potential limitation. Practical implications - The results of the study could pave the way to a more realistic understanding of power and change in large multinational companies. Originality/value - This article is a genuine research paper with profound fieldwork. It broadens viewpoints considering power, change and the role of top management in a large and global Finnish forest industry corporation.

Strategic analysis of offshore migration of polluting firms and suppliers: an option value perspective	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Global relocation; Pollution havens; Production migration strategy; Real options analysis; Technology progress uncertainty; Corporate strategy; Pollution; Environmental management	HAVEN HYPOTHESIS; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; CHINA; ENTRY; MANAGEMENT; EXPANSION; CHAINS; JAPAN; STATE	Purpose - This paper, being complementary to existing perspectives, aims to examine the behaviors and the strategies of production migration of polluting firms from an economic point of view under appropriate decision conditions in terms of uncertain influence of supply chain support and green technology progress. Design/methodology/approach - Strategic alternatives are investigated by using option pricing tools to examine the impact of various characteristics of green technology development and supply chain relations on the timing of the decision. Findings - The theoretical and empirical results show that a polluting firm should not consider the option of relocating to offshore countries if uncertainty has been anticipated. It is suggested that, by facing green technology development uncertainty, a firm should be refrained from relocating production abroad if technology develops and offshore cost advantage disappears soon. On the other hand, a pre-emptive migration strategy is preferable when the green technology is anticipated to be delayed. Practical implications - A polluting firm in a supply chain faces challenges of uncertainty depending on whether it decides to produce domestically or to relocate internationally. The analysis conveys a concept that polluting firms can be more profitable by promoting clean production technology, instead of relocating to offshore or so called pollution havens. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the existing literature on the evaluation of offshore migration option values by taking extra consideration of uncertainty in the supply chain cost, green technology progress and complementing to studies in a moral perspective.

J	Madden, BJ				Madden, Bartley J.			MANAGEMENT'S WORLDVIEW: FOUR CRITICAL POINTS ABOUT REALITY, LANGUAGE, AND KNOWLEDGE BUILDING TO IMPROVE ORGANIZATION PERFORMANCE	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						worldview; knowledge building; strategic insights; firm performance; organization performance		From the perspective of hindsight, many researchers have ascribed plausible reasons as to why various firms have prospered and others failed. Some have gone further and worked at understanding how a specific management viewed the world at the time decisions were being made. But, the real challenge is to make progress toward useful guideposts so management can develop a worldview that better equips them to improve firm performance in the future. Without such guideposts, organizational computing, analytics (i.e., fact-based problem solving), and other modern initiatives may lose their way or not reach their full potential for improving firm performance. In the direction of useful guideposts, this article advances four points about reality, language, and knowledge building, which have been underutilized as a means to develop insights for solving business problems and constructing viable strategies. The rationale for these four complementary points is explained in terms of the management decisions behind the growth of Walmart, the successful restructuring of IBM, and the eventual bankruptcy of Kmart. Ideally, leaders should be mindful of these points and strive to ingrain them in the firm's culture. Doing so can lead to improved effectiveness in both strategies and the systems to implement those strategies-ultimately paying dividends in terms of firm performance.

J	Malekdar, M				Malekdar, Mehdi			Strategic Analysis of the Presence of Corporate Venture Capital in Iranian Science and Technology Parks and incubators	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION			English	Article						science and technology parks; incubators; corporate venture capital (CVC); SWOT; TOPSIS		Corporate Venture Capitals (CVCs) are important financial innovations used for financial resourcing of new high-risk and high-tech organizations. In order to reduce existing risks, CVCs have focused on developing firms, science and technology parks and incubators by their main twofold functions. The first function is providing the capital needed for the commercialization of ideas, plans and designs of entrepreneurs and the second one is preparing a good market for CVC. In present study, it is attempted to detect the internal strengths and weaknesses of science and technology parks and incubators using one of the most important strategic management instruments, i.e. SOWT model as well as to analyse environmental opportunities and threats confronting CVCs in science and technology parks and incubators and to represent the strategies in four strategic groups, such as SO, ST, WO, and WT. All strategies are prioritized using TOPSIS technique among these four groups which the most important strategies are using the experiences of pioneer countries in the field of CVCs, science and technology parks and incubators. The main purpose of this study is finding and sharing the benefits or losses of the developing companies and also developing activities associated with establishing relationship between investors and holders of new ideas such as market technology.

One can also consider energy as a strategic input for the establishment of any economic and social development policy. Electricity is the basis for industrial production, agriculture, as well as in providing services chain; hence, the need to reduce the cost for that input is vital. This produces great benefits to the production chain by making companies more competitive, and people benefit because the products' final price becomes cheaper. The aim of this paper is to present a new methodology for assessing industrial efficiency energy and identify points of energy losses and the most influenced sectors within the production process, and propose mitigation measures.

J	Moudani, W; Hussein, M; Moukhtar, M; Mora-Camino, F				Moudani, Walid; Hussein, Mohammad; Moukhtar, Mirna; Mora-Camino, Felix			An intelligent approach to improve the performance of a data warehouse cache based on association rules	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data Warehouse; Data Mining; OLAP; Association Rules; Cache based on chunks		In the world of business applications, it is significantly important to refl ect patterns and trends of customers, all this to make tactical and strategic decisions. The data warehouse holds information management and turns it into meaningful management information, from which, very interesting patterns can be discovered by applying knowledge discovery process. The use of Online analytical processing with other related technologies such as data mining, can meet the needs related to business management analysis of an organization. Most analytical activities are completed remotely, and because of the huge data size of the Data Warehouse systems. So we need tools that strengthen applications to access the requested information quickly. As the update of the Data Warehouse is not too frequent, it is possible to improve query performance while storing the data retrieved by them in a cache. However, the most powerful systems have a small capacity to store the entire database in memory cache. The caching chunks technique is designed to keep in cache the query results in the form of chunks of values, instead of storing them in large tables. In this paper, we propose a new technique for caching multidimensional queries based on association rules. Using this technique will allow all users to enjoy the benefits of Data Warehousing in the best manner, and also to improve performance and also increase the use of the system while reducing the response time. The technique is build using an architecture comprising a data warehouse, a memory cache on the server and a one on each user's machine, in which the association rules and query results are stored. These results are kept in the form of chunks to enjoy all the advantages of the technique of fragmentation into chunks.

Consumer confidence is critical for the development and maintenance of export and domestic shrimp markets. Public concern about the use of antimicrobial drugs and chemicals on shrimp farms, however, could threaten market access. We sought to identify high-risk areas and farm-level risk factors for antimicrobial use to inform the core messages and strategic placement of extension programs to help farmers develop best management practices for antimicrobial use. We undertook a survey of 603 operating farms within the Puttalam district over 42 weeks. Lower stocking density and early harvest were associated with a lower risk of antimicrobial use, whereas standard management practices, including water treatment, feed supplements, probiotic use, pond fertilizing, disinfectant use, and pesticide use, were associated with increased risk. Spatial cluster detection found three significant clusters of antimicrobial-using farms. Antimicrobials were more likely to be used in areas with lower farm density. Some of our counterintuitive findings are discussed from a socioecological perspective. A comprehensive understanding of why antimicrobials are used on shrimp farms requires an evaluation of the physical, epidemiological, and socioeconomic factors.

Using a mail survey method, data were collected from a random sample of 540 senior financial officers in Australian manufacturing organisations. The results revealed that business strategy (product differentiation and low cost) and a teamwork oriented culture were associated with the use of multidimensional performance measures. In addition, the use of multidimensional performance measures and all four information system characteristics (i.e. scope, timeliness, integration and aggregation) were associated with the performance related outcome dimension of PMS effectiveness, while the use of multidimensional performance measures and integrated information were associated with staff and strategic related outcomes. The study contributes to the literature by examining the use and effectiveness of PMSs.

J	Mytton, E; Gale, C				Mytton, Elizabeth; Gale, Chris			Prevailing issues in legal education within management and business environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contemporary legal education; External and internal spheres of influence; Business and management; Law schools; Legal skills; Qualifying law degrees; Education		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of prevailing issues in UK legal education in terms of current developments and changing patterns. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is designed to bring together a range of perspectives which inform how legal education is changing in terms of key spheres of influence. The authors are directly involved with the Committee of Heads of University Law Schools in the UK and also have extensive experience of managing law programmes in business and management environments. This experience provides a dynamic opportunity to lead ideas for change whilst being at the forefront of policy and strategy. Findings - Globalisation of legal, business and management education indicates that the stimuli operating in one jurisdiction are not without response to others. Universities are subject to external influences which impact on the extent to which law schools are able to operate. Political, social, economic and technological factors shape the nexus between external factors and internal spheres of influence. In many ways, law schools appear well-placed within business or management schools to maximise opportunities to lead change most effectively. This wider perspective provides the ability to transcend local influences and create a more contemporary environment in which to enhance legal education in a global context. Originality/value - The value of this paper is to highlight current challenges for those in positions of policy-making and strategic responsibility in law schools. It provides an awareness of prevailing issues in order to inform thinking about how best to position legal education given the changing influences which shape legal education in a global context.

Absorptive capacity: Relevancy for large and small enterprises	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Background: Over the years, there has been a growing interest in organisational research in the absorptive capacity (AC) construct, but only a few theoretical and empirical studies on this topic have been carried out over the last decade. However, a number of scholars and practitioners have continued to cite AC as a significant factor in determining the success or failure of organisations. With the dramatic changes in business environments, there has been a growing rise in the use of knowledge by organisations to help improve and maintain their competitiveness and consequently their survival. AC is a fundamental element that helps organisations to gain competitive advantage by producing commercial products or services through the transformation of knowledge. Objective: The purpose of this article is thus to provide a review of the literature on this subject with the aim of finding out how both large and small enterprises stand to benefit from AC. We intend to affirm that, by successfully carrying out a learning process that is characterised by the exploration and exploitation of external knowledge and the organisation's current knowledge base, organisations can realise competitive advantage irrespective of their size. Method: In the literature search, three approaches were employed, namely academic databases, online search engines and a review of references of related studies which led to more relevant articles and works whose references were further reviewed and analysed. Content analysis was done on all collected articles for quality appraisal and synthesis, the results of which we present as discussions on various sections of this paper leading to answering of our study objective. Only peer-reviewed articles were used. Results: Our findings reveal that, irrespective of the organisation's size, it can benefit significantly from AC. The study further reveal that AC is a strong predictor of an organisation's performance and hence a strategic asset for the organisation. Organisations with high AC are able to learn how to utilise new knowledge within their processes and come up with changes that improve their competitive advantage. Conclusion: We submit that, because AC is a strong predictor of an organisation's performance, it is imperative that the necessary measures are taken to improve the levels of AC for all firms, irrespective of their size.

J	O'Regan, N; Ghobadian, A				O'Regan, Nicholas; Ghobadian, Abby			John Lewis Partnership lessons in logical incrementalism and organic growth A case study and interview with the Chairman, Mr Charlie Mayfield	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						United Kingdom; Retailing; Strategic leadership; Decision making; Strategy; Strategic decisions; Strategic innovation; Logical incrementalism; Organic growth		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how strategy is developed and implemented in an organisation with an unusual ownership model. Partnerships are not a prevalent form of ownership but as this case demonstrates they can be extremely effective. Furthermore this case demonstrates how logical incrementalism can be used to implement major strategic decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on company documentary evidence and a semi-structured interview with Mr Charlie Mayfield, Chairman of John Lewis Partnership. A chairman has a helicopter view of business whose perspectives are rarely captured by strategy researchers. This case study offers an insight into strategic thinking of a chairman and chief executive of a successful company. Research limitations/implications - The case study and interview offer a unique insight into the rationale behind strategic decisions within a successful partnership that has grown organically in a highly competitive retail market without high gearing. Originality/value - This case study sheds light on strategic moves within partnership. Furthermore, very few case studies offer insight into the thinking of a chief executive who has successfully managed a business in a turbulent environment.

Various attempts all over the world have been made in order to enhance management in healthcare. However, there are no proper solutions yet. Project management was originally applied in the areas of construction, engineering etc. Academic research in the UK and other countries points out increasing numbers of new developments and new initiatives being pursued through projects and programmes. Project management is no longer just a sub-discipline of engineering, the management of projects - including programme management and portfolio management - is now the dominant model in many organisations for strategy implementation, business transformation, continuous improvement and new product development. Project management has extensive current opportunities and a bright future. One of the very important areas where it starts to find its application is certainly healthcare. There were some attempts both practical and theoretical to apply Project management in a healthcare (also published in Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice). This paper is trying to go deeper and to apply project management methods in every aspect of clinical practice. The pilot project was conducted on inguinal hernia surgery that was organized as a project and showed substantial results in terms of organizational enhancement. Therefore, one may conclude that the discipline of project management is emerging in healthcare institutions and it could significantly help improving efficiency of medical organizations.

J	Ohvanainen, J; Hietikko, E				Ohvanainen, Jukka; Hietikko, Esa			Building competitive advantage through platform-based product family thinking: Case powerpacks	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						product family; product platform		Purpose:The purpose of this paper is to discuss through the main aspects and principles of successful platform-based product family development and management. For example car industry and car manufacturers take advantage of platform-based product families while solving the conflict of balancing between wide product variety and operational efficiency. This is a common dilemma also in some other manufacturing companies operating on versatile markets; how to serve individual customer needs with minimum development, manufacturing and service efforts? Product families are in this paper seen as an answer. Thus, the aim of this paper is to promote the adoption of often complex and risky product family development especially in technology and manufacturing focused companies. To be able to minimize risks and maximize the advantages companies need to understand the dynamics of the product family thinking presented in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: After a literature survey the main aspects and principles of the product family thinking are illustrated through a case example from a company designing and manufacturing hydraulic piling equipment. Findings: The case study shows that as universal practices are missing the "best practice" in product family development is always dependent on the nature of the company and its products. It is also evident that gaining long-term competitive advantage through product family thinking will not happen without continuous learning and investments in both time and resources. Originality/value: This paper presents the main aspects and principles of the platform-based product family thinking in a systematic and hierarchical manner by connecting together platforming, architecture design, strategic aspects and management perspectives.

J	Oladokun, TT; Aluko, BT				Oladokun, Timothy Tunde; Aluko, Bioye Tajudeen			Corporate governance and real estate assets management in Nigerian banks	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE			English	Article						Corporate governance; Corporate management; Corporate real estate; Real estate assets; Real estate; Assets management; Nigeria		Purpose - This paper aims to evaluate the strategies adopted by Nigerian banks to integrate the management of their real estate assets into the overall business objectives. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaires were distributed to the corporate real estate managers of the 24 recapitalised banks in the country and supplemented with interview. The study adopted the descriptive method of percentages, mean and proportion methods for analysis. Findings - The study found that Nigerian banks have distinct real estate units that manage their substantial real estate holdings, which they revalue at the open market basis every six months. The study also found that in spite of the fact that Nigerian banks have substantial real estate holdings, employees of the real estate unit spend more time on the core business of the organisations than on real estate activities. While some of them have sole responsibility for real estate activities, others are gradually shifting attention to the importance of their real estate assets. Practical implications - The study has major implications on corporate real estate management and banking practice in Nigeria. There is the need for organisations to re-direct their focus towards the strategic perspective of CRE as an important and profit inducing tool of business. This may require exposing CRE executives to requisite training that will equip them for effective service delivery. Social implications - Inefficient real estate management can result in huge loss of shareholders fund by investors and subsequently affect the economy. Originality/value - The study identified real estate as a "turn around" tool that can be adopted by bank executives to improve their financial status and a pro active step towards building an efficient and virile profession to handle the emerging corporate real estate management sub discipline in real estate.

When the university dissolved ISD in 2006, the USC Libraries became a stand-alone entity for the first time in a decade. This article describes the USC Libraries' approach to rebuilding an identity as an active partner in teaching, learning, and research at USC. It outlines the planning process used to develop a new organizational structure, highlights practical and cultural challenges that followed the dissolution, and describes several significant lessons learned.

It investigates the effect of adoption of IT on the market share of the small and medium enterprise. Design/methodology/approach - The system dynamics methodology is used as a modeling and analysis tool to investigate the supply chain problem of an organization. The simulation model of the supply chain is made considering the relationships among different variables, using system dynamics concepts. Findings - This work suggests that an organization should increase its capacity joining rate simultaneously with increase in orders (which increases due to improvement in IT capability), to reduce further backlog which leads to customer switch to another manufacturer. Research limitations/implications - The work is based on simulation work, so the results cannot be generalized for all situations. Originality/value - The present model can be used to study different scenarios and variables. Also, the model can be extended by considering more accumulations and variables in the supply chain system. It may be useful to policy makers, decision makers and regulators dealing with a wide spectrum of strategic issues and policies in the supply chain.

J	Sollars, GG; Tuluca, SA				Sollars, Gordon G.; Tuluca, Sorin A.			The Optimal Timing of Strategic Action - A Real Options Approach	JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION			English	Article						first-mover advantage; strategic action; real option analysis; simulation; optimal investment; dynamic programming		The possibility of a first-mover advantage arises in a variety of strategic choices, including product introductions, business start-ups, and mergers and acquisitions. The strategic management literature reflects ambiguity regarding the likelihood that a first mover can or will capture additional value. This paper uses a real options approach to address the optimal timing of strategic moves. Previous studies have modeled real options using either a perpetual or a European financial option. With these models, a strategic choice could only be made either without respect to a time frame (perpetual) or at a fixed point in time (European option.) Neither case is realistic. Companies typically have strategic options with only a limited time frame due to market factors, but companies may choose to act at any time within that constraint. To reflect this reality, we adapt a method for valuing an American financial option on a dividend paying stock to the real options context. The method presented in this paper proposes a solution for the optimum value for a project that should trigger a strategic choice, and highlights the value lost by not acting optimally. We use simulation results to show that the time frame available to make a strategic choice has an important effect on both the project value for when action should be taken, as well as on the value of waiting to invest at the optimal time. The results presented in this paper help to clarify the ambiguity that is found in the strategic management literature regarding the possibility of obtaining a first-mover advantage. Indeed, a first mover that acts sub-optimally could incur losses or at least not gain any advantage. A first mover that waits to invest at the right time based on the superior information supplied by models based on real options could be better positioned to obtain the benefits that might come from the first move.

Design/methodology/approach - This research used surveys. Findings - The results largely found support for the integrated marketing communications model and confirmed the activist, situational and oral communication models found in the previous study. Research limitations/implications - The results show that the use of these models are stable across job and organization types, which provides support for applying theoretical constructs across different communication disciplines in order to build the field of strategic communication. Originality/value - The theoretical basis of strategic communication is elusive, and not many studies exist that have tried to offer a cohesive theory of the field. This research is one of the first steps in the process of building a robust and cohesive strategic communication theory and focuses on the development of models of communication with audiences or stakeholders. This is a line of research typically pursued in public relations but not in on other areas of communication practice such as marketing and government relations.

J	Wajeeh, IA; Muneeza, A				Wajeeh, Ismail Azzam; Muneeza, Aishath			Strategic corporate governance for sustainable mutual development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Corporate governance; Strategic corporate governance; Mutual development; Sustainable development		Purpose - Corporate governance has been dubbed by many as the guiding facet of modern day corporate entities. However, the success rate of the governance efforts are still unclear. It is high time that corporate governance efforts are integrated to accompany all aspects of the corporate entities and encompass the corporations' most valuable asset, its workers, as a primary benefactor rather than them being mere participants. Hence this paper aims to identify critical areas of inclusiveness and especially the impact of such an integrated effort on mutually developing the work force and the corporate entities. Design/methodology/approach - This paper attempts to identify and highlight mainstream views on corporate governance via library research and complement the research process with available information from appropriate resources to suggest a potential enhancement to the approach taken by the conventional corporate governance efforts. Findings - The paper infers that the potential for the use of corporate governance is beyond its conventional utility and suggests enhancements that could be applied within the existing mainstream corporate governance frameworks to improve the efficiency and role of corporate governance that is anticipated to mutually benefit all stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - The paper highlights a shift in paradigm that could potentially be utilized in the practical application of corporate governance efforts. It is limited by the nascent nature of the corporate governance efforts. Originality/value - Thorough analyses of the existing frameworks of corporate governance were utilized and the inferences are the authors' conjectural views and it is anticipated to help to inspire future research towards strategic corporate governance.

J	Yu, WT; Ramanathan, R				Yu, Wantao; Ramanathan, Ramakrishnan			Managing strategic business relationships in retail operations: evidence from China	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Business relationships; China; Retail operations strategy; Stakeholder theory; Performance management; Retailing; Strategic management	MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; COMPETITIVE PRIORITIES; JOINT VENTURES; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; CORPORATION; ENVIRONMENT; COMMITMENT; SUPPLIERS; SERVICE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to manage business relationships in retail operations. In particular, this study examines the links between business relationships with principal stakeholders, operations strategy, and performance. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing upon the stakeholder theory, this study employs a path analytic framework to understand the effects of business relationships on retail operations strategy and performance for a sample of retail companies in China. Findings - The findings indicate that good relationships with customer and supplier could enable retailers to be more efficient in developing quality and flexible strategies, and that low cost and flexible strategies, in turn, influence business performance. However, the results suggest that the vital role that the Chinese government played in economic activities in the 1980s and 1990s has diminished gradually. It is appropriate to treat the good relationship with government bodies as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for retail success in China. Originality/value - This study seems to be the first in investigating the effects of business relationships on operations strategy and performance applying a stakeholder theory perspective.

Understanding the support of the QMS and BSC in relationship coordination - business strategy, organizational structure and culture, is reflected in the integration and process management dimensions: 1) the existence of a hierarchical order of the strategic actions (from vision and mission, to strategy and objectives, to key success factors and key performance indicators), 2) action of various coordination mechanisms, formalization and standardization of the organizational structure and process and 3) consistent understanding and values of members of the organization, which provides efficient control of behavior, coordination and implementation of policy and company goals. Implementation of concepts of QMS and BSC will provide greater compatibility and coherence of the normative, strategic and operational management, which will lead to more successful business, enterprise development and the satisfaction of all stakeholders.

The empirical work combined survey and case studies of 24 small and medium enterprises (SME), some of which have steered their organizations from humble start-ups to professional ventures. Results show that the successful entrepreneurs committed their strategic intentions to become global archetypal capitalists while simultaneously co-exist (despite their heterogeneous backgrounds) to serve the needs of an emerging economy.

Drivers, Options and Approaches for Two Seaport Authorities on the Joint Reduction of Bunker Oil Related Emissions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH			English	Article						bunker cooperation emission reduction seaport sulphur		The international agreements, made by International Maritime Organization in 2008 are an encouraging start to reduce the SO2 emissions caused by the use of bunker oil. Port authorities are confronted with a dilemma. From an environmental point of view, a proactive attitude is preferred. However, a unilateral initiative may jeopardize their bunker oil market share. In this article, we study the benefits and drawbacks of collaboration on emissions reduction between the ports of Rotterdam and Singapore. Many options for reducing SO2 emissions and several policies strategies are discussed. Collaboration instead of competition may give a strategic financial advantage as compared to other would-be bunker harbors on the route Europe-Asia. Without a group of dedicated and critical actors, both port authorities do not have the power to enforce policies or options. The Rotterdam system can be regarded as a decentralized multi-actor network. The Singaporean situation may be characterized as a centralized authority. The process design towards cooperation should take into account these differences. Overall, it can be concluded that cooperation between the port authorities of Singapore and Rotterdam has extra benefits compared to a situation without cooperation.	[Stikkelman, R. M.; Correlje, A.

Only recently have researchers analyzed unions as distinct organizations. In order to address this void in the literature, key union officials were surveyed regarding their unions' ability to manage and shape their environment, as well as selected critical strategic issues. The results suggest that unions can and do take measures to manage their environments and control their destinies, but consistent with some prior work, union strategy is best seen as "emergent" from cumulative choices rather than a "grand design."

J	Wee, JB				Wee, Jung Bum			Pyramidal Structures and Competitive Strategies of Business Groups*	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article						Business group; Pyramidal structure; Competitive strategy; Entry deterrence; Predation; D21; G32	INTERNAL CAPITAL-MARKETS; EXTERNAL FINANCE; OWNERSHIP; PREDATION; DEBT	A theoretical model is built to explore the organizational form of a diversified conglomerate, which depends on the competitive structure of the product market. The conglomerate may choose the form of either a business group, which consists of plural legally independent firms, or a multi-division firm. The analysis shows that, because of larger outside financing capacity, a business group generally needs less internal capital and invests more than a multi-division firm. However, the expanded outside financing of the business group might intensify competition and reduce the payoffs to both the conglomerate and a competing stand-alone firm. If the controlling shareholder can extract large private benefit, he or she is better off organizing as a business group than as a multi-division firm. If the controlling shareholder organizes as a business group, the value of the conglomerate increases. The value of the stand-alone rival to the business group is less than its value when it competes with a multi-division firm. With respect to strategic behavior, because of the controlling shareholders entrenchment, a business group is less sensitive than is a multi-division firm to the stand-alone rival firms action. The analysis provides a feasible explanation for why business groups prevail in the regions where capital is scarce and/or investor protection is poor. It is concluded that the choice of business organizational form of a diversified conglomerate depends on market size, the scarcity of capital and the agency problem.

Fire Prevention in Delaware: A Case Study of Fire and Life Safety Initiatives	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						case study; fire prevention; fire service	UNITED-STATES; INJURIES	Context: Injuries resulting from residential house fires are a significant public health issue. The fire service is engaged in fire prevention activities aimed at preventing fire-related morbidity and mortality. The fire service in Delaware is regarded by some leaders in the field as a model for fire and life safety education (FLSE). Objective: We identified 3 questions to guide this research. What is the culture and context of fire prevention in Delaware? What prevention programs and policies constitute Delaware's fire prevention efforts? What can be learned from select model programs regarding their impact, sustainability, strengths, limitations, and general applicability? A discussion of the lessons learned from Delaware's experience with FLSE initiatives concludes the article. Design: We used a single case study design and collected and analyzed data from in-depth interviews, documents, and participant observation notes to address the research questions. Setting: Data were collected in Delaware. Participants: Interviewees included a purposeful sample of members of the Delaware fire service. Main Outcome Measures: Descriptions of the context in which fire prevention occurs, the initiatives underway, and the factors associated with successfully supporting fire prevention in the state. Results: Data from 16 key informant interviews, relevant documents, and direct observations of FLSE events revealed a fire service rooted in tradition, dedication, and community. A compilation of state and local FLSE initiatives illustrates the diversity of FLSE in Delaware. Thematic analysis of the data emphasize the importance of a strategic, comprehensive, and coordinated approach to realizing success in Delaware's approach to FLSE. Conclusions: The fire service is an important part of the public health infrastructure. While their role as first responders is evident, their contributions to prevention are also significant. This research suggests ways to support fire service prevention efforts and more fully integrate their FLSE work into the public health infrastructure.

Equilibrium experiments were performed and the data obtained were fitted with different isotherm equations, i.e., Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R). The Freundlich isotherm gave the best description of the adsorption process with a correlation coefficient of 0.8963. Adsorption kinetics has been studied in terms of pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion models. The results showed that pseudo-second-order kinetic model is the most appropriate to describe the uptake process satisfactorily. All determined equilibrium and kinetic parameters showed that the process is mainly governed by a physical mechanism rather than an electrostatic attraction, as confirmed by Zeta potential measurements.

Although various studies describing South African public relations practitioners had been performed, these studies are limited in terms of size and scope and do not offer a clear profile of the practitioner and whether they are equipped to perform the necessary tasks. This article is based on a study that obtained data from practitioners in top performing organisations.

J	Makar, S; Wang, L; Alam, P				Makar, Stephen; Wang, Li; Alam, Pervaiz			Managing FX Risk: How Useful Is Accounting Information?	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article								Multinational companies manage their exposure to changes in foreign exchange (FX) rates, in part, by using FX derivatives (FXD). And recent volatility in FX rates has increased the importance of evaluating this strategic choice. However, current accounting practices do not provide timely and sufficient information to accurately predict future cash flows for FXD hedge percentages less than 100 percent. This article will help CFOs and treasurers with their FX risk and cash management strategiesby describing the limits of existing accounting information on derivatives use and the Financial Accounting Standards Board's efforts to address such limits. Since CFOs are required to sign off on the veracity and accuracy of financial statements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, they should understand the limits of FXD hedge accounting information.

J	Wiggill, MN				Wiggill, Marlene N.			Strategic communication management in the non-profit sector: a simplified model	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS			English	Article							STAKEHOLDER THEORY; PUBLIC-RELATIONS	A model for strategic communication management was developed in South Africa on the basis of the excellence study and relationship management theories. This normative, theoretical model has been applied as part of a project in non-profit organisations (NPOs), government institutions and small-to-medium sized companies. However, the operational reality of organisations' communication practices has not been measured against the model. It was therefore the objective of this article to comprehend the participating NPOs' operational and strategic communication management context. It was discovered that although NPOs can theoretically apply the normative Steyn and Puth model, it is not practically feasible, because of the NPOs' unique constraints. Thereafter, the development of a simplified model on the basis of sound theoretical principles for NPOs to implement strategic communication management was carried out, notwithstanding their constraints and limited resources. The steps/actions indicated in the simplified model are aligned to the NPOs' real and current practice, within the requirements of strategic communication management. By simplifying the model, and focusing on what NPOs are already doing, misconceptions about the complexity and feasibility of communication management might be clarified. It is also recommended that staff members of NPOs, who are responsible for communication and relationship management, be trained to strategically manage communication and stakeholder relationships.

The ability to overcome current issues and the readiness to face future challenges are estimated differently between one local authority and another. Local authorities whom are equipped with strong finance, visionary leadership, systematic strategic and action planning and public support will definitely be more prepared to face those challenges. On the other hand, weaker local authorities in financial and effective administration may be faced with problems in its area. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the level of issues and challenges facing the council which served the public and the approach applied to this study. Several major findings were obtained from the use of a set of questionnaire on the issues and challenges of local authorities in Malaysia, by referring to Seberang Perai Municipality Council as a case study, and some information in the questionnaires were handed over to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (MHLG). Thus, few recommendations were proposed to its council in designing better approach to public service. In future research, the local government should be firm in addressing issues and challenges by having good instrument to be measured in their core business. The council should have close relationship with the stakeholders such as the government, non government organizations (NGO's), business communities and public as well, to deal with continuous issues and challenges in local affairs at large.

J	Cui, ZJ; Loch, C				Cui, Zhijian; Loch, Christoph			A STRATEGIC DECISION FRAMEWORK FOR INNOVATION OUTSOURCING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technology strategy; outsourcing strategy; external sources; innovation	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; SUPPLIER INVOLVEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; FIRM; COOPERATION; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN; US; ACQUISITIONS	This article gives a general decision framework for companies outsourcing strategic decisions. The authors argue that a consistent outsourcing strategy, strategic evaluation and searching of external sources, and effective implementation processes are three essential steps toward successful innovation outsourcing. The article points out that outsourcing strategy is embedded in a company's overall technology strategy, and analyzes the decision context of the sourcing strategy. The new theoretical idea is the portfolio view of outsourcing strategy. The soul of innovation outsourcing should be a mix of different external sources and different levels of integration and a match with the proper organizational structure. Examples of generic portfolios are given at the end of the article.

J	Wibisono, D				Wibisono, Dermawan			A Framework of Performance Measurement System for Manufacturing Company	SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance measurement system; benchmarking; Indonesian manufacturing company		In the current dynamic environment, measuring a company's performance becomes exceedingly complex since Performance Measurements Systems (PMS) not only measure a company's performance but also reflect their organizational culture and philosophy. Designing and implementing PMS is an integral part of management control systems. However, traditional PMS are criticized for being obsolete, irrelevant to managerial decision making, unrelated to strategic objectives and detrimental to organizational improvements. Given the shortcomings of traditional PMS, there is need for a new framework that can lead to the design of a PMS that balances short-term and long-term measures, internal and external measures, and financial and operational measures. This paper presents issues associated with the needs of a dynamic PMS, observe past research achievements in PMS and review past PMS frameworks that have been introduced. The paper then proposes an improved methodology for the design of a realistic PMS and its effective implementation in a manufacturing environment with case for Indonesia's company.

However, arising from mental and psychological phenomena factors, people's judgments on the importance of customer requirements is imprecise and vague. The fuzzy analysis hierarchy process (FAHP) with an extent analysis is utilized to determine preferences toward customer value to overcome this uncertainty in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). With this method, the researcher can use triangular fuzzy numbers for the pair wise comparisons and derive the weight vectors. Based on the calculations results, the manufacturers could implement product design and quality management to prioritize customer requirements; besides, retailers are also able to understand what kind of benefits or performances are customers prefer and thereby develop strategic appeal for them.

J	Gonzalez-Guzman, CA; Robuste, F				Alberto Gonzalez-Guzman, Carlos; Robuste, Francesc			Road Space Reallocation According to Car Congestion Externality	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Transportation management; Travel demand; Traffic management; Traffic capacity; Urban areas	NETWORK EQUILIBRIUM; TRANSPORTATION; ALLOCATION; URBAN	The mobility management tool proposed in this paper estimates the percentage of road space that should be reallocated from private vehicles to public transport according to internalization of the congestion externality generated by private vehicles. This reallocation measure could be implemented on a strategic mobility corridor in the city. The initial increase in trip time that a private vehicle experiences because of the reduction of its road space favors an improvement in mobility. This improved scenario is characterized by a more efficient reassignment of the traffic of private vehicles in the network, a modal change toward public transport, and better trip times in public transport. This tool could achieve a better social welfare compared to an uncontrolled user equilibrium condition. It could have, under specific circumstances, similar results to those by road pricing regarding the discouragement of the travel demand of automobiles and a greater acceptance on behalf of citizens and local administrations.

However, there was also a growth in the use and importance of third sector agencies in the delivery, and latterly, in the strategic development of, public policy. This created an implementation gap in the delivery of policy and a problem in ensuring that key policy makers from the third sector remain 'on-message'. In this paper we will demonstrate the difficulties that existed in retaining control while decentralising the delivery and development of public policy.

We conducted our analysis in terms of each 500-m sector of those races for which historical performance data existed. We considered the ranking and time taken in each sector by a given boat as two important predictor factors/attributes that can be taken into account for strategic pacing planning in standard rowing races. We developed a novel hybrid data mining approach based on probabilistic modelling and combinatorial optimization to find the optimal permutation of split measures (times and rankings) that can maximize the chance of a boat winning certain medals in a standard 2000-m rowing race. We further extended our probabilistic model to analyse rowing data from other perspectives. In this research, we considered race type (fast, medium, slow) as well as country profiles. The latter analysis could be used for strategic planning in terms of combating opposing countries' strategies by understanding their racing patterns.

J	Phillis, RCD; Gumede, H				Phillis, R. C. D.; Gumede, H.			Annual mine planning and execution buffering-a safety imperative	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article						CCPM; buffer		The annual mine planning process is one of the most important tactical/operational steps towards achieving strategic goals. These tactical plans are part of a very comprehensive Mineral Resource Management process, with the natural sequel to planning being execution. The execution of an underground hard rock mine plan is a multi-project environment that comprises many development-construction-equipping-stoping single project paths, which are referred to as 'stoping paths'. The uncertainty that typifies execution of projects comes in the form of untimely disruptions to constituent tasks and/or project paths. Annual mining plans also include quantified objectives for occupational health and safety, production, quality, cost, employee morale, environment, and corporate social investment. Such objectives make for a highly complex environment that management must contend with-complex in the sense that all the paths and objectives have interdependent constraints. Furthermore, at the time of this paper, Sections 54* and 55** of the MHSA*** put the onus on management to ensure legislative adherence. It stands to reason that planning estimates allow excess capacity-buffers-that cushions the impact of untimely disruptions. This paper concerns the fact that despite all the buffers allowed for, time, scope, and budget creeps impact on mine planning and threaten its successful execution. As a consequence, the paper deals with buffer management, the essence of Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM). Effective buffer management provided strategic (executive level) updates without losing the tactical/operational detail necessary for job card creation, especially where professional skills and experience are in short supply. Indicative bottom-line results showed CCPM to be highly effective.	[Phillis, R. C.

J	Suki, NM				Suki, Norazah Mohd			Public library users' dissatisfaction attributions and complaining behaviour	MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Complaints; Consumer behaviour; User behavior; Dissatisfaction; Public libraries; Malaysia		In an increasingly demanding environment, users complain because they are dissatisfied with the services rendered. This study investigates the complaining behaviour of public library users in a Malaysian state. A self-administered questionnaire was randomly distributed to 99 dissatisfied adult users of the Labuan Public Library, which is located in the Federal Territory of Labuan, Malaysia. The survey revealed that public library users, who perceive the service of the library to be free, are more likely to complain to a third party about their dissatisfaction. There are some users who complain directly to the personnel or person in charge of the department, or chief librarian at the time of dissatisfaction.

Assessing Knowledge Management Needs: A Strategic Approach to Developing Knowledge	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Asset Structure; Intellectual Capital; Knowledge Management; SPF Framework; Strategy		Most knowledge management work encourages practicing managers to pursue ever more knowledge development and sharing. There is an assumption that more knowledge always leads to greater competitive advantage and superior financial performance. Even though this may be the case, it is far from proven, and the application and use of knowledge management techniques may actually be more strategic, with optimal levels of effort and spending determined by differing circumstances. This study investigates these topics by assessing whether knowledge strategies might vary by industry, asset structure, and other potential variables.	[Erickson, G.

The first results reveal that differences between company performance and strategic groups do not exist. However, taking into account the innovative process in the pharmaceutical industry, when considering the risk-adjusted results we have confirmed the existence of differences among the strategic groups for some of the used indicators. The combination of radical and low-impact innovations, production for third parties, and commercialization under licenses can offer a better performance than other groups focused exclusively in innovation or in specific market segments.

J	Weiss, JW; Thorogood, A				Weiss, Joseph W.; Thorogood, Alan			Information Technology (IT)/Business Alignment as a Strategic Weapon: A Diagnostic Tool	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						IT Project Management; Strategic Project Management; Alignment; Leadership	BUSINESS; RESOURCE	This article presents a diagnostic for identifying a strategic profile for Business/IT alignments. Based on consulting and research over the past decade, we have observed executives who are dissatisfied with their IT program and project alignment strategies. Technical and process engineering projects rather than strategic IT-business alignments were favored. Not all IT initiatives can or should be dedicated to projects and programs that affect enterprise-wide change; however, prominent IT experts argue that CIOs are receiving pressure to align IT for strategic purposes due to competitive market forces. Two case studies illustrate the processes and benefits of aligning IT-based business outcomes at the project and program levels using the strategic diagnostic proposed here.

We bring in the technical views in the use of SIP technology as a more strategic weapon to elaborate our proposed strategies - design for manufacturability (DFM) adder, and home depot strategies through transaction cost approach that are able to be practically applying in the semiconductor foundry industry with added value by all means. DFM adder strategy is an effective solution specifying wafer processing enhancement while home depot strategy is an entire solution massing on product design integration. More substantially, these strategies are totally awesome mechanisms that can be matching and winning in the evolving marketplace for foundry industry in the 21st century.

J	Kim, KH; Kwon, OJ; Lee, BR				Kim, Keun-Hwan; Kwon, Oh-Jin; Lee, Bang-Rae			A Comparison Between Core Patents That Including and Excluding Self-Citations	INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						Self-citations; Patent map; Core Technology; Directed citation network		The use of a recently developed methodology (weighted reachability) to disclose core technologies for a specific topic by using citation networks inherently contains the issue of self-citation. When self-citations are included, the consequence may be that the importance of the core technology is overstated; it could lead us to misunderstand a de facto industry structure and to miss technological development trends. In this study we propose a new methodology which recognizes that in counting citations, including the self-citations will inherently make the patent seem more important than it really is. Using the OLED industry, we compared the results of the two methodologies. Our approach helped to find the technology development areas of competitors, trace their development trends, and recognize other core technologies of a company, which could not be disclosed when considering self citations Our methodology can improve the ability to understand patent information, allowing the identification of important strategic implications and thereby the establishment of countermeasures and will also improve tracking of technological competiveness.

J	Lin, CC; Hsieh, CC				Lin, Cheng-Chang; Hsieh, Chao-Chen			Effect of relationships in supply networks: A long-term analysis in the automotive industry	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supply networks; relationship; cointegration analysis	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; CHAIN MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; COINTEGRATION; DISRUPTIONS; CAPABILITY; VIEW; TIES	This work uses cointegration analysis to study the strength of relationships with the partners in supply networks in the Taiwan automotive industry. The purposes of this paper are: (1) to examine how firms form networks and to explore whether firms in supply networks should have long-term relationships; (2) to investigate the strength of relationships with the other partners and illustrate firm behavior in supply networks. The analytical results demonstrate two findings. First, the assembly and the automotive component manufactures have long-term relationships in a supply network. Subsequently, the results of cointegration analysis illustrated firms' convergent (divergent) behavior. Sharing shareholder value, complementary resources, and sustained competitive advantage enables firms to converge to the long-term equilibrium.

Thus, this study provides empirical evidence of the strength of relationships and contemporaneously examines firm behavior in supply networks.

FlexRFID Middleware in the Supply Chain: Strategic Values and Challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE COMPUTING AND MULTIMEDIA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						CRM; FlexRFID; Inventory Control Middleware; Policy; ROI; SCM; Supply Chain		Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been used since the Second World War to identify "friend or foe" aircrafts. It has become an enabling wireless technology that is widely used in a number of application areas, such as product tracking through manufacturing and assembly, inventory control, and supply chain management (SCM). By 2006, Wal-Mart used RFID for all of its suppliers. The use of RFID in supply chain networks has allowed Wal-Mart to create value through greater visibility in its networks, higher product velocity, reduce human error and labor cost, and more efficient inventory management, which led to the achievement of Quick Response (QR) and improved Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in the supply chain. However, RFID system challenges and uncertain Return-On-Investment (ROI) must be overcome to fully achieve these objectives. This paper introduces RFID technology and its key components and concepts, and presents an RFID middleware solution called FlexRFID that achieves the maximum benefits of RFID technology independently of the interested backend applications. This paper illustrates how RFID technology is used to solve the main problems in SCM, the advantages and key issues when implementing RFID in SCM networks, and the relationship between RFID and the main SCM processes.

Stimulating sturgeon conservation and rehabilitation measures in Turkey: an overview on major projects (2006-2009)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Sturgeons	OCT 25-30, 2009	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA				GROWTH	The aim of this report is to provide an overview of the current status of efforts on the potential rehabilitation of sturgeon populations in Turkish waters, describing the structure and the outcome of projects carried out since 2006 and identifying the strategic needs for sturgeon conservation measures at a national level. It is well known that there were six sturgeon species occurring around Turkish Black Sea coasts while entering the rivers, mainly Kizilirmak, Yesilirmak, Sakarya and Coruh Rivers for spawning. Anadromous sturgeon species have been strictly protected throughout Turkey since 1997. Conservation and management measurements have been implemented since 1970s. However, this was apparently with little success as stocks continued to decline and habitats deteriorated further, threatening the stocks with extinction. At the same time the needs for survival are not well documented. A project was initiated on 30 January 2006, consisting of seven-work packages including studies on population structure, reproduction, habitat assessment, genetic variability between and within stocks and the development of protective management strategies and plans. The work covered the Turkish Black Sea coastline and the rovers Yesilirmak, Kizilirmak, Coruh and Sakarya. Actively sampled and / or accidentally caught specimens have been tagged by T-bars and released after measurements and tissue sampling for genetic analyses. In addition, broodstocks of Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Beluga (Huso huso), and stellate (A. stellatus) are being built by rearing fish at the Central Fisheries Research (Yomra, Trabzon, Turkey) Institute. Reproduction studies have mainly focused on sperm collection, cryopreservation and induced spawning as well as on larval rearing.

J	Chen, WS; Chen, CY; Chen, FC; Liu, CC				Chen, Wen-Sheng; Chen, Chia-Yon; Chen, Feng-Chin; Liu, Chun-Chu			THE IMPACT OF THE TAIPEI PORT CONTAINER TERMINAL ON THE NORTHERN REGION OF TAIWAN: A COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODEL	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TAIWAN			English	Article						computable general equilibrium; social accounting matrix	TRADE LIBERALIZATION; INCOME INEQUALITY; ECONOMY; SECTOR	There are some primary modelling tools, including econometric forecasting models, fixed price input-output (I-O) multi-sector models, social accounting matrix (SAM) and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, used to analyse regional economic issues. CGE models combine the advantages of econometric, I-O models and SAM, strengthening the theoretical basis of the modelling effort and thus enabling more precise policy analysis. Current CGE literature includes models used to analyse international trade, tax reform, energy and environment issues. However, application of this technique on a regional scale is rare in the scientific literature. In this paper, a small regional computable general equilibrium model is constructed and applied to analyse the economic impact of constructing Taipei Port Container Terminal (TPCT) locating in northern Taiwan. The research results provide a valuable reference for decision-makers in formulating ocean shipping and regional policies, as well as helping business managers with strategic planning.

J	Jih, WJ				Jih, Wen-Jang			Impact of e-CRM on Website Loyalty of a Public Organization's Customers	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Customer Relationship Management; e-Commerce; e-Customer Relationship Management; Website Loyalty	E-SATISFACTION; BRAND LOYALTY; E-COMMERCE; EXPLORATION; CHAIN	Web-enabled customer relationship management, or e-CRM, is able to simultaneously achieve the conflicting goals of strategic flexibility and operational efficiency in developing and executing innovative e-commerce marketing strategies. A multi-disciplinary field, involving such areas as marketing, economics, business strategy, information systems, social psychology and consumer behavior, e-CRM strengthens customer relationships via a portfolio of trust-building practices with the support of powerful information technologies. While most literature in e-CRM has examined how firms formulate and implement e-CRM initiatives, there is little information on the overall quality of an e-commerce firm's e-CRM practices from the consumer point of view. This research proposes such a consumer-oriented concept, e-CRM value, based on existing e-CRM research, and examines the effect of e-CRM value on website loyalty. An empirical study is conducted to validate the theoretical model. Customers' perceptions of e-CRM value have positive causal effects on their website loyalty. Valuable implications can be derived from this finding for public organizations in managing their customer relationships.

Strategic Planning by the Palliative Care Steering Committee of the Middle East Cancer Consortium	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY			English	Article						strategic planning; palliative care; comprehensive cancer care; Middle East		High quality comprehensive palliative care is a critical need for millions of patients and families, but remains only a dream in many parts of the world. The failure to do a strategic planning process is one obstacle to advancing education and pain prevention and relief. The Middle Eastern Cancer Consortium Steering Committee attendees completed an initial strategic planning process and identified "developmental steps" to advance palliative care. Underscoring the multi-disciplinary nature of comprehensive palliative care, discipline-specific planning was done (adult and pediatric cancer and medicine, pharmacy, nursing) in a separate process from country-specific planning. Delineating the layers of intersection and differences between disciplines and countries was very powerful. Finding the common strengths and weaknesses in the status quo creates the potential for a more powerful regional response to the palliative care needs. Implementing and refining these preliminary strategic plans will augment and align the efforts to advance palliative care education and pain management in the Middle East. The dream to prevent and relieve suffering for millions of patients with advanced disease will become reality with a powerful strategic planning process well implemented.

The study sample comprised 301 employees from universities of medical sciences in Iran. Multiple and simple linear regression and path analysis were used to test the direct and mediated relationships among the variables. The study considers how motivation to learn, training attitudes, and perceived support of employees to their knowledge sharing may be shaped by their level of affective commitment and psychological contract. Results highlight significant relationships between (a) strategic training practices and affective organisational commitment, (b) affective organisational commitment and turnover intentions, (c) knowledge sharing and turnover intentions, (d) affective organisational commitment and knowledge sharing, (e) strategic training practices and psychological contract, (f) psychological contract and knowledge sharing, and (g) psychological contract and affective organisational commitment. Results reveal that whereas strategic training practices are positively related to affective organisational commitment and psychological contract, both affective organisational commitment and knowledge sharing are negatively associated with turnover intention. In addition, the results provide evidence that affective organisational commitment and psychological contract have a significant mediating effect on the relationship between strategic training practices and knowledge sharing. Managerial and practical implications of the findings are highlighted.

J	Arndt, F				Arndt, F.			Assessing dynamic capabilities: Mintzberg's schools of thought	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; STRATEGY; FIRM; MICROFOUNDATIONS; MANAGEMENT; EVOLUTION; NETWORKS; MODEL	A growing body of research in strategic management has focused on dynamic capabilities as a central source of firms' competitive advantage. The theoretical roots of dynamic capabilities can be found in many of the schools of thought identified by Mintzberg, Ahlstrand and Lampel (1998). In this paper, we identify three aspects of dynamic capabilities that, we believe, require more detailed attention: Process, cognitive and decision-based micro-foundations, and human agency. We explore each of these areas from an evolutionary perspective to emphasize the fact that dynamic capability is essentially an evolutionary construct. By highlighting the evolutionary implications of these areas, we add important detail to the way "evolution" has been used in this field of research.

J	Chang, HL; Hsiao, HE; Lue, CP				Chang, Hsin-Lu; Hsiao, Hsiang-En; Lue, Chia-Pei			Assessing IT-business alignment in service-oriented Enterprises	PACIFIC ASIA JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Customer service systems; IT-business alignment; Service-oriented enterprise; Service integration	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT; MARKET ORIENTATION; SYSTEMS; IMPLEMENTATION; CAPABILITIES; ANTECEDENTS; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; DIMENSION	Nowadays, more and more businesses transform into service-oriented enterprises in order to sustain their competitive advantage. To ensure that the underlying information technology (IT) can best support the transformation, we aim to develop an IT-business alignment framework to assess the quality of alignment in the context of service-oriented enterprises. Based upon the existing literature, we propose three components of IT-business alignment: strategic alignment, operational alignment, and social alignment. We study their various contributions to the performance of service-oriented IT projects, together with the interactions with service integration level. Our data were collected from Web questionnaires. The total dataset is derived from 300 selected companies in an on-line technology management forum. Among the returned questionnaires, 104 were found to be complete and usable; this represented a response rate of 34 percent. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis is conducted and derives the following three research findings: (1) IT-business alignment plays a significant role in improving the performance of service-oriented IT; (2) the service integration level is an important performance moderator for strategic and operational alignment; (3) the service integration level is an important contributor to social alignment.

J	Jensen, PA				Jensen, Per Anker			STRATEGY AND SPACE: A LONGITUDINAL CASE STUDY OF BROADCASTING FACILITIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Space strategy; Strategic uncertainty; Positioning strategy; Adaptability; Project champions		The article is based on results from a research project on space strategies and building values, which included a major case study of the development of facilities for the Danish Broadcasting Corporation over time. The focus is to identify, how different space strategies have been implemented in different periods and how these strategies can be related to the general conditions of the corporation. The strategic uncertainty of the corporation is investigated as a main determining factor for changes in space strategy based on theories of the relations between strategy and place. These theories include that corporations follow one of the three generic space strategies: Incrementalism, standardization, and value-based strategy. Among the conclusion are, that the space strategies mostly changes between incremental and value-based strategies, but one period of standardization was identified. Furthermore, there is a clear relation between value-based space strategies and the presence of visionary project champions.

This study evaluates the impact of environmental factors on international competitiveness of the Western Balkans SMEs by identifying the key pairs of environmental factors and factors of international competitiveness, which facilitate an increase in international competitiveness of these firms. The paper also studies the importance of strategic planning and decision making process in the Western Balkans SMEs.

J	Wu, F; Sun, PR; Chang, CC				Wu, Fan; Sun, Pei-Ran; Chang, Chi-Chang			Apply Influence Diagrams for Utility Analysis of Paying the Weight-Reducing Expenses: A Case Study in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian network; Influence diagrams; Preventive medicine	RISK-FACTORS; OBESITY; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; DECISIONS	To effectively control the growth of medical expenditure, Bureau of National Health Insurance (NHI) of Taiwan has taken many measures, including the Reasonable Number of Outpatient Services, Ceiling Price, Global Budgets, Strategic Analysis and the Excellence Plan; however, these measures can only scratch the surface. Due to the change of life style and the deteriorating condition of over-nutrition and obesity, people now have a higher risk of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease, cancer, gout, arthritis, and so on, which leads to higher medical expenditure. Therefore, good civil preventive health care is regarded as the solution of surging medical expenditure. According to NHI's statistics, the annual medical expenditure of diabetes is about 13 billion NT dollars. Among these diabetics, over 95% are affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus; at least two-thirds-over 80% according to some researches-are overweight or obese. The research says, losing 5% to 10% of the original body weight can lower the risk of chronic diseases effectively; also, giving early therapy for obesity can reduce the complication probability, thus for avoiding the waste of medical resources. By applying influence diagrams of Bayesian Network and Utility Expect of statistics, this paper evaluates the medical expenditure of Taiwan's NHI under the circumstances of providing and not providing benefit for weight-loss outpatient services. The result of this research is that the cost of not providing benefit for weight-loss outpatient services is 3.4 times of the contrary. Therefore, if Taiwan's NHI provides reasonable benefit for weight-loss outpatient services, not only the risk of people suffering from diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease, cancer, gout, arthritis, etc. will go down; but also the medical expenditure can be effectively reduced.

Risk-management has emerged high at the corporate agenda as globalised supply chain networks are more stretched than ever due to offshoring and thus are more exposed to disruptions, while reverse logistics has been proven to constitute a profit center. In this environment, global companies have to scrutinize especially the role of major Asian economies (with large manufacturing capacities and huge markets), while conducting their strategic procurement planning. The developed model can be applied to a number of different scenario types encompassing various instances of disruptions to the collection of the end-of-life products, of the transportation system, and of the remanufacturing yield and capacity. Analytical closed-form solutions are obtained and important managerial insights on the merit of contingency strategies in managing uncertainties for reverse logistics networks are discussed.

J	Boakye-Agyei, K				Boakye-Agyei, Kwame			Approaching climate adjusted environmental due diligence for multilateral financial institutions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Environmental assessment; Multilateral financial institutions; Environmental due diligence; Banks		Purpose - This paper seeks to review literature on environmental safeguards for five selected multilateral financial institutions (MFIs) with the objective of verifying whether their environmental safeguards have been updated with climate change elements, and whether they have adopted specific climate change strategies for their investment portfolios. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology set for this review was based on a set of descriptive criteria. These included content reviews on MFIs existing safeguards or formal environmental guidelines, the extent of incorporation of climate change to guidelines text, and overarching strategies adopted to address climate change. Findings - Generally, the environmental safeguards reviewed have minimally discussed formal considerations of climate change issues. Although environmental safeguards continue to play vital roles in bank operations, it generally remains traditional with minimal adjustments to formally include climate change. Nevertheless, all the banks have developed overarching climate change strategies at the strategic level. Research limitations/implications - The information presented herein is compiled from articles, reports, papers and books identified from computer-based searches. The research is limited to information available on the internet, books and papers. It is therefore possible that MFIs are involved in some climate change activities not yet in the public domain, and as such are not covered by this paper. Practical implications - Quite clearly, the adjustment of environmental assessments such as environmental impacts assessment/strategic environmental assessment to include climate change is in the offing. This means that practitioners may need to considerably understand the character of climate change and thereby construct concrete approaches to tackle both ideological and methodological gaps. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need in the climate change discourse, bringing forward climate change as an issue deserving more legal, formal and obligatory attention.

J	Bonnedahl, KJ				Bonnedahl, Karl Johan			Strategic implications of European economic integration: the relative importance of barrier categories	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						economic integration; barriers to competition; intra-community; European Union; internal market; common market; SMEs; small and medium-sized enterprises; perceived distance; psychic distance; Sweden; strategic implications; strategy	CULTURAL DISTANCE; PSYCHIC DISTANCE; SMALL BUSINESS; TRADE; INTERNATIONALIZATION; MARKET; FIRM	Investigating strategic implications of economic integration for firms, this paper presents and discusses a framework for assessment of barriers to intra-community competition. The case is the European internal market, from the perspective of Swedish SMEs. The dismantling of certain barriers as well as remaining barriers to intra-community transactions is acknowledged. Both circumstances influence competitive advantages on the domestic market and the need for resources and experience abroad. Opportunities and threats are related to the initial exposure to barriers of different categories: whether barriers build on political measures, market behaviour, culture or nature. Data from Swedish SMEs, including perceived distance to other markets, underline limitations in policymaking's reach as well as the importance of geographic and lingua-cultural distance.

J	Celma, J				Celma, Javier			Water Quality in Zaragoza	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								The severe droughts of the 1990s made clear that the Strategic Plan of Zaragoza and the Action Plan of Local Agenda 21 in terms of water management were not appropriate to satisfy the development needs of its economy and the future demands of a growing population. In response, the city redefined its water management model, from one of continuous exploitation of resources to the search for solutions to reduce consumption. The city's efforts included a comprehensive programme of stakeholder involvement, rehabilitation of drinking water treatment and distribution infrastructure, improvement of water quality, and reform of the billing system. After 12 years, the city has managed to deduce its total consumption by nearly 30% and improve the quality of its water very significantly.

J	Dell'Era, C; Buganza, T; Verganti, R				Dell'Era, Claudio; Buganza, Tommaso; Verganti, Roberto			Figures of speech as semantic operators in the innovation process	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product design; Semantics; Rhetoric; Innovation		Purpose - Product functionalities aim to satisfy the operative needs of the customer, while product meanings (i.e. the emotion and the symbolic values represented by the product) aim to satisfy the emotional and socio-cultural needs of the customer. What consumers are increasingly looking for in consumer products are new forms of psychological satisfaction that go beyond normal and simple consumption; today, more than ever, products define their own presence not only through their attributes, but also through the meanings that they assume, through the dialogue that they establish with the user, and also through the symbolic nature that they emanate. Figures of speech can be exploited to emphasise a message or a meaning. The purpose of this paper is to propose an application of rhetorical figures to product design that will make them more communicative. Design/methodology/approach - Specifically, the authors propose the "Rhetorical Innovation Process" as a methodology that foresees the application of figures of speech as semantic operators. First, the authors discuss several product innovations that can be interpreted according to the "Rhetorical Innovation Process". Then, a brief workshop assignment in the strategic design course at the Faculty of Industrial Design of Politecnico di Milano explored the potentialities of the method in relation to different product typologies: 40 Italian master students were divided into eight groups (five industrial design students each) in order to develop five products per group. Findings - The results obtained by design students demonstrated as figures of speech can stimulate associations with other contexts and modifications to existing architecture. The exploration of the "rhetorical innovation process" in collaboration with eight design student teams has shown that this method can support and enrich the concept generation phase. Moreover, four configurations proposed by the "rhetorical innovation process" allow one to generate different alternatives supporting the creative process and allowing the identification of strengths and weaknesses associated to each solution. Originality/value - The method described in the paper elucidates the structure and process adopted by several designers and also illustrates an effective framework for communicating choices to their clients. In particular, the cross-context associations proposed in the "rhetorical innovation process" provide additional insights and incentives during the concept generation.

The theoretical treatment of the complexity construct and the separate analysis of imitability and substitutability of technological assets contribute to improving our understanding of these relations. The empirical evidence from a sample of Spanish biotech companies indicates that complex capabilities are better protected from imitation. But the results for barriers to substitution show that an excessive proportion of complex tacit knowledge may have a negative effect on competitive advantage sustainability, as it reduces interested agents' confidence in the technology, and hence, encourages competitors to seek more attractive alternatives.

J	Ghazinoory, S; Abedi, S; Mashari, B				Ghazinoory, Sepehr; Abedi, Sadegh; Mashari, Behnam			Model for IP Protection based on an Empirical Study of Iranian Nanotechnology Companies	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS			English	Article						Nanotechnology; innovation protection; innovation strategy; technological innovation; company size; learning capabilities	APPROPRIABILITY; PATENTS	In spite of being a rather recent, emerging area, nanotechnology has seen a flurry of investment in both developed and developing, countries. However, protection of innovation from competitors has been an area of concern and important aspect that should be included as a part of strategic plan in companies. In this study, a model is proposed for strategic protection of IP in nanotechnology companies. Accordingly, as a first step, necessary criteria along with factors affecting existing innovation preserving systems are identified and classified The identified indices are grouped into three classes comprising organizational, environmental and innovation characteristics. A qualitative study on various businesses carried out by nanotechnology companies in Iran allowed prioritization of those indices which are effective. A decision making matrix is proposed by the authors based on two indices, namely, size of company or financial power and organizational learning capacities. An examination of the innovation preservation practices in 45 existing companies in the area of nanotechnology protection in Iran revealed that of all the proposed mechanisms of protecting innovation, only patent protection is made use of and that too to a limited extent. An evaluation of the proposed model is also carried out by studying the companies themselves.

J	Hoholm, T; Stronen, FH				Hoholm, Thomas; Stronen, Fred			Innovation, strategy and identity: a case study from the food industry	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Corporate identity; Strategy; Process; Practice; Actor network theory; Food industry; Norway	ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY; METAPHOR; CULTURE	Purpose - Current research focuses on the interaction between innovation and strategy process, but less is known about how identity influences innovation and the formation of strategy. The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate the relationship between organizational identities and innovation with regards to strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the current research stream on innovation and strategy process. The study is based on a longitudinal case study of strategy and innovation processes in a small Norwegian food producer. Through analyzing two different innovation and product development processes in a Norwegian food producer, one related to creative recombination and the other to reproduction of established practice, the paper illustrates how organizational identities influence sensemaking during strategy processes, and thus the inclusion of innovation in the strategy. Findings - Identity can be used as an explanation for why some actions are deemed to be strategic while others are not, hence enforcing or limiting innovation. The paper finds that identity needs to be considered both as a "soft" and a "hard" concept in the process; providing stability while at the same time being up for re-negotiation. By understanding strategizing and innovating as situated and heterogeneous processes, it identifies how identity becomes a stabilizer and an organizer during emergent strategy processes, and reveals tensions between creative recombination and conservative reproduction. Orginality/value - This paper provides a richer understanding of innovation and strategy formation by suggesting that construction of organizational identity is central to the strategy process.

Questionnaires were completed by 17 experts directly involved in tourism development projects. Analytical results indicated that while industry professionals, government authorities and resort investors considered all five dimensions of Porter's Diamond Model (that is factor endowments; demand conditions; firm strategy, structure and rivalry; related and supporting industries and government) important, each group ranked their relative importance differently. Finally, a recommended solution was presented and analyzed based on the business strategic plan.

It sought to align staff and student expectations of feedback and support greater use of feed-forward approaches. A baseline analysis of staff views in the School of Life Sciences suggested that students did not make strategic use of the feedback they received. A similar analysis of the student position revealed that as a group they felt that the feedback provided to them was often insufficiently helpful. To address this dichotomy, a MAC process was developed in the School of Life Sciences and trialled with a cohort of about 350 first year undergraduate students. The process was based on a student-centred, three-stage model of feedback: Subject specific, Operational, and Strategic (SOS model). The student uses the subject tutor's feedback on an assignment to complete an online self-review questionnaire delivered by a simple tool. The student answers are processed by a web application called e-Reflect to generate a further feedback report. Contained within this report are personalised graphical representations of performance, time management, satisfaction and other operational feedback designed to help the student reflect on their approach to preparation and completion of future work. The student then writes in an online learning journal, which is shared with their personal tutor to support the personal tutorial process and the student's own development plan (PDP). Since the initial development and implementation of the MAC process within Life Sciences at Westminster, a consortium of universities has worked together to maximise the benefits of the project outcomes and collaboratively explore how the SOS model and e-Reflect can be exploited in different institutional and subject contexts. This paper presents and discusses an evaluation of the use of the MAC process within Life Sciences at Westminster from both staff and student perspective. In addition, the paper will show how the consortium is working to develop a number of scenarios for utilisation of the process as a whole as well as the key individual process components, the SOS model and e-Reflect.

Jay; Han, Chonghun			Quality Determination of Steel Surfaces Based on Best Feature Selection	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING OF JAPAN			English	Article						Wavelet Packet Transform; Best Basis; Texture Classification; Surface Quality; Wavelet Texture Analysis	WAVELET PACKET TRANSFORM; TEXTURE ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION	We propose a quality classification methodology based on optimal textural feature selection. This method employs the wavelet packet transform to decompose the original image into multiple-resolution images. Wavelet texture analysis is applied to extract quality-related features from subimages. Optimal textural feature selection is employed to select the discriminative texture in accordance with class information. The previously used best basis approach is incapable of optimal texture classification when combined with wavelet texture analysis. The proposed texture classification method unifies the best basis approach with wavelet texture analysis. Further, we improve the previous best basis to obtain an optimal basis using a simple rule to select discriminative signatures. The proposed methodology is applied and validated for classifying the surface quality of rolled steel sheets. Experimental results show that features extracted using the proposed method are more discriminative than those obtained using the best basis in terms of classification performance and Fisher's index.

The aim of the implementation of the objective is to establish three priority areas: quality, openness and efficiency. The analysis of only one part of the higher education system in terms of quality management has shown weaknesses in the systems approach to the structure of economical programs especially and lack of definition of key processes generally. Moreover, the current progress of the Bologna process is not fully satisfactory, the bachelors are not ready for practice and the original principle of multi-stage education has not been efficiently applied.

Fools rush in: clever HR practitioners test international assignment candidates with the Intercultural Affinity Scale	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IAFFS; intercultural affinity scale; intercultural communication competence; strategic international human resource management; intercultural communication training; assessment; selection; international assignments	COMMUNICATION COMPETENCE; ADJUSTMENT; HOST; ATTITUDES; MANAGERS; PERFORMANCE; ADAPTATION; VALIDATION; SOJOURNERS; SUCCESS	The Intercultural Affinity Scale (IAFFS) is introduced to assist human resource practitioners in their efforts to assess the intercultural affinity of candidates for international assignments. Fools rush into global missions without evaluating candidate-location fit and intercultural communication training needs. Clever human resource practitioners, however, engage in socially responsible practices. The IAFFS is designed to reliably appraise employees' and their families' affinity for their home and future host cultures to find the right candidates for the right international assignments. The seven-item IAFFS was developed and tested in numerous studies with students at 13 universities in six countries (New Zealand, Germany, United Arab Emirates, England, Czech Republic and USA). The IAFFS shows a stable two-factor structure, acceptable test-retest correlations, adequate Cronbach's alphas and almost no social desirability bias in self- and peer evaluations. The IAFFS is sensitive enough to detect test-retest differences. Implications and future research are outlined.

J	Lahovnik, M				Lahovnik, Matej			Strategic fit between business strategies in the post-acquisition period and acquisition performance	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						strategy; acquisition; performance; strategic fit	EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; MANAGEMENT; MERGERS; OBJECTIVES	The overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that, from the acquirer's perspective, acquisitions are mostly at best "break-even" situations and at worst failures. Our study seeks to contribute to this pool of knowledge by analysing the performance of horizontal acquisitions. We examined the performance of horizontal acquisitions regarding the strategic fit between the business strategies of acquiring and acquired companies in the post-acquisition period. Horizontal acquisitions in which the acquiring and acquired companies developed an identical type of business strategy in the post-acquisition period outperformed acquisitions where the acquiring and acquired companies developed different types of a generic business strategy. The results suggest that the sharing of activities and transfer of skills are important in cases of a fit between business strategies in the post-acquisition period.

J	Lee, L				Lee, Louise			Corporate volunteering - business implementation issues	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						corporate social responsibility; CSR; corporate volunteering; implementation challenges; corporate community involvement		The importance of corporate volunteering has been acknowledged internationally, particularly in practitioner literature relating to corporate social responsibility (CSR). However, while a growing number of businesses support corporate volunteering initiatives, existing research on the challenges of implementing such CSR activities is scarce. This paper provides practice-based insights into CSR implementation by examining business managers' understandings of the drivers and operating practices for corporate volunteer schemes and the challenges facing business managers in implementing such initiatives. Results from this study indicate that managers perceive corporate volunteering programmes as being driven by an array of motivations, representing an uneasy mix of business efforts to satisfy internal and external stakeholder concerns.

J	Lin, SP; Chan, YH				Lin, Shu-Ping; Chan, Ya-Hui			Enhancing service quality improvement strategies by integrating Kano's model with importance-performance analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICES TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service quality; customer satisfaction; importance-performance analysis; IPA; Kano's model; KIPA model; online job agency	MULTIPLE-ITEM SCALE; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; PERCEPTIONS; ATTRIBUTES	In resources limited situation, seeking effective ways to fulfil customers' needs is fundamental for the success of a business in the long-term. Importance-performance analysis (IPA) and Kano's model are two main decision making techniques for improving customer satisfaction. This study aims at developing a strategic action model by integrating Kano's model with IPA to consider the phenomena of non-linear relationship between attribute performance and overall satisfaction. To verify the validity of this integrated model, a Taiwanese online job agency case is then presented. The results show that this integrated model can certainly advance service quality improvement strategies according to different contributions of diverse quality factors on customer satisfaction. Thus, the new proposed strategic action model can be regarded as a comprehensive tool to help managers make effective strategies to enhance customer satisfaction.

This research aims to identify the current logistics and supply chain-related strategic development priorities of manufacturing firms that operate in Finland and to identify the key determinants of these priorities. Based on survey data from 317 manufacturing firms, the top five supply chain development priorities for the years 2009-2013 were identified as cutting logistics costs, improving delivery reliability, developing information systems, improving customer service and increasing supply chain transparency. A multinomial logistic regression analysis further highlighted the role of manufacturing strategy and the extent of the geographic dispersion of supply networks as predictors of firms' supply chain development priority choices.

J	Menkhoff, T; Wah, CY				Menkhoff, Thomas; Wah, Chay Yue			Improving Small Firm Performance Through Collaborative Change Management and Outside Learning: Trends in Singapore	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge Management; Learning; Organizational Change Management; Singapore; SMEs	HIGH-TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; ENVIRONMENT; INNOVATION; CHINESE; SMES	This empirical-exploratory article sheds light on the change management approaches used by Chinese ownermanagers of small firms in Singapore and their openness toward strategic learning. The paper examines widespread common-sense assumptions that ethnic Chinese adopt mostly directive-coercive (autocratic) change management approaches, which may stifle innovation. Great diversity exists amongst small firm owners in Asia with regard to their change leadership practices, and respective change implementation approaches are contingent on both demographic variables and situationalforces like the urgency of change, the degree of resistance to change, and/or the dynamics of the environment in which the firms operate. Data from a SME survey in Singapore (n - 101) serves to substantiate several propositions about change management of Chinese owner-managers of SMEs in Singapore. Three hypotheses about the openness of SME owner-managers to outside sources of learning are presented to ascertain the prediction that such knowledge can give SMEs a performance headstart by helping them to work smarter.

J	Meyerson, J; Konichezky, A				Meyerson, Joseph; Konichezky, Andres			Hypnotically Induced Dissociation (HID) as a strategic intervention for enhancing OCD treatment	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL HYPNOSIS			English	Article						OCD; Hypnosis; Dissociation; HID; Psychotherapy; Hypnotherapy	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY	To date, cognitive behavioral therapy has been designated the most efficient evidence-based psychotherapeutic approach for OCD management. This is mainly due to its ability to effectively address the constitutional and developmentally acquired emotional and cognitive deficiencies of OCD, which express themselves through behavioral compulsions and intrusive thoughts. Yet some reports indicate that from 30 to 60 percent of OCD patients are not responsive to psychotherapeutic interventions. As a consequence, broader therapeutic models have been considered. These models encompass multifactorial etiologies of OCD and take intrapsychic stressogenic factors into consideration as well. Some of these models have adopted hypnotherapeutic approaches. In the present article, we introduce a therapeutic tool that utilizes hypnotically induced dissociation (HID) to identify and address the intrapsychic etiology of OCD. The result is a therapeutic intervention that complements existing OCD treatment strategies. Clinical cases are presented to illustrate implementation of the approach.

J	Ming, LT				Ming, Lam Tak			Value Chain Flexibility with RFID: A Case Study of the Octopus Card	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic Information Systems; Value Chain Flexibility; RFID Technology; Electronic Payment	FRAMEWORK	Octopus cards are an electronic payment system based on a wireless RFID technology developed in Hong Kong. Users simply hold their contactless smartcards over an electronic reader, and the payment is deducted from the card automatically. If users link their cards to their credit card to upload money, there is no cash transaction involved. Launched in 1997, Octopus cards are the world's most widely accepted contactless RFID electronic payment system. The system generates value for customers, service providers, and societies. This article makes a theoretical and applied contribution to our understanding of strategic information systems. It adopts and modifies Porter's value chain and develops value-chain flexibility as a theoretical framework to analyze the Octopus card system. The fast and dramatic changes in customer needs, business competition, and technological innovation are creating an urgent need for flexibility throughout the whole value chain. By looking at order fulfillment as a process, the shop outlet-either online or offline-is only part of the entire flow from customer enquiry to customer receipt. It is clear that no single idea could significantly reduce customer lead time. Only a total effort from organizations to increase flexibility and eliminate bottlenecks can make the kind of difference needed to compete ( Day, 1994; Blackburn, 1991; Yusuf, Sarhadi, & Gunasekran, 1999). Therefore, value chain flexibility must be broadly defined, and it should be applied in the service industry. In other words, organizations should be able to deal with the uncertainty along the value chain to meet customer demands.

Strategic Management of NGOs in Developing Countries	JOURNAL OF NONPROFIT EDUCATION AND LEADERSHIP			English	Article								This literature review summarizes the knowledge in the field of strategic management of international Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) operating in developing countries, based on the analysis of 161 books and articles published since 1980. The review yields five major themes: 1) relationships with donors, 2) relationships with governments, 3) NGO coordination, 4) NGO accountability, and 5) strategic impact of NGOs. The review reflects the growing complexity of the external environment and the challenges of strategic management. In response, NGOs have developed closer relations with UN agencies, strategic partnerships with host governments, greater inter-agency coordination and management, impact assessment, and shared learning systems. The review concludes with an evolving research agenda for addressing key issues confronting the strategic management of NGOs.

Solving problems in this field requires a quality strategic positioning eco exploitation sites, which is the most burdened by environmental problems, based on modern scientific approaches and definitions. Realistically frequent criticism and environmental hazards in mining the potential of various statements. There is a long-term disruption of natural flow and overall ecological balance of the system. Demonstrated environmental destruction and damage of smaller or larger extent the result, which can be accessed from the aspect of taking corrective action by the state. A complex analysis of the causes, the analysis of environmental risks and the definition of preventive environmental strategy, hardly can speak, at least in the forms of modern analytical and methodological approaches. The basis of determining the initiation of interest on taking responsibility for local environmental priorities and their protection in areas of intensive exploitation of works. It is a negative impact on human health and the need to preserve the total ecosystem. Analysis of environmental risks is becoming logistically purpose and need with which to be flexible, adaptable, and efficiently organize and manage access to environmental reality and truth in the context of improvements, now and in the near future. This paper presents real experiences and research results in environmental practicum proposals and implementation of modern concepts, methods and models for the analysis of environmental risks.

This article is in type of developmental researches and its performance method is survey and library studies. Moreover information collecting tool is taking notes. In literature of subject of this article initially the principles of total quality management has been discussed, so that we can obtain better perception in order to applying this system in business and improvement of organizations' performance. In order to apply total quality management in organizations strategically, we have examined TQM movement in Japan and some cases about using of this method have been mentioned. In fact, in this article the model which has been named Total Quality Management Advanced Model (TQMEX) is based on TQM facts and has been modeled according to instructions of this model. A referendum which has been done in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea indicates the importance of Japanese system of total quality management advanced model in order to implement total quality management system in organizations. Finally, results and information obtained from this research provide criteria and methods for which are the result of the large organizations' experiences that not only have passed two world's oil crisis and Asian financial crisis successfully, but also have continued their growth while these two crises.

J	Rusetski, A; Lim, LKS				Rusetski, Alexander; Lim, Lewis			Not complacent but scared: another look at the causes of strategic inertia among successful firms from a regulatory focus perspective	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						marketing strategy; strategic inertia; regulatory focus; decision making; Markstrat		While complacency is the most commonly offered explanation for the lack of strategic change among successful firms, research in management psychology suggests otherwise. Based on regulatory focus theory, we propose that competitive success prompts an increased sense of responsibility in managers, causing them to assume a defensive attitude and to concentrate on preserving the status quo instead of becoming complacent. Data collected from the Markstrat simulation support our predictions. The findings imply that efforts to encourage strategic change by pressurizing managers will backfire, because they will aggravate managers' defensive attitude. Instead, firms should loosen the pressure on managers and allow them to experiment with innovative strategies.

In this paper the impacts of strategic management of technology are outlined in a conceptual framework with a perspective to utilisation of the framework. The elements of the strategic management of technology consist of structures, objectives and impacts. The impacts are classified as tangible, business model, knowledge based, transitional and dynamic, social and environmental impacts. As a comprehensive model the framework is proposed to apply for practitioners in systematic development of strategic management of technology, and to provide a frame of reference for scholars.

J	Sjogren, H; Puumalainen, K; Syrja, P				Sjogren, Helena; Puumalainen, Kaisu; Syrja, Pasi			What does the owner-manager want and get out of the business?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Owner-managers; Small enterprises; Dividend distribution; Drawings strategy		Purpose - The paper seeks to explain the differences in drawings (e.g. owner-manager dividends and salary) strategies among small business managers to show that owner-managers' personal work values impact on the strategic choices of firms. It also examines the relationships between owner- managers' work values and the amount of dividends the entrepreneurs take out of the business in order to follow the chosen strategy. Design/methodology/approach - This paper contributes to the existing knowledge of entrepreneurship and small business management. Legal constraints and strategic motivations are essential to drawings strategy. The paper analyses the owner-managers' work-related values as a potential determinant of the drawings strategy. The empirical data used to test the hypotheses were drawn from a mail survey and financial statements. The final drawings strategy scales were formed with the help of exploratory factor analysis. Findings - The findings provided evidence that work values are related to drawings strategy factors, and the factors reflect entrepreneurs' attitudes to drawings taken out of the business. However, the authors could not find any relationship between the drawings strategy and how entrepreneurs behave when they actually take dividends. Practical implications - The findings of this research surprisingly provided evidence that entrepreneurs are unaware of the peremptory provisions of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act. When entrepreneurs decide on the amount of dividends, tax legislation clearly dominates their decision making. This could lead to a situation where the entrepreneur takes more dividends than the solvency test of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act allows.

This combination of pressures jeopardizes the water quality and ecological functioning and demands for an integrated sustainable development plan. As part of the strategic management plan for the area, a so-called effect chain modelling framework is being developed. This process-based approach combines biotic and abiotic processes, the main ecological components and the relevant anthropogenic demands. The integrated modelling framework is implemented in Delft3D (developed by former WL I Delft Hydraulics) and is composed of separate building blocks for hydrodynamics (Delft3D-FLOW) and sediment transport (Delft3D-SED), water quality (Delft3D-WAQ/BLOOM) and ecological dynamics (HABITAT) including interactions with higher trophic levels using a GIS-based spatial analysis tool. It allows for the quantification of the impact of a system component, parameter or process on the relevant ecological groups or processes within the marine environment. It results in an improved understanding of cause-effect relationships between the physical, natural environment and system stressors. The ultimate aim of the modelling framework is to develop a robust assessment tool for dealing with management questions related to site-specific issues, such as the relation between high turbidity and oxygen-depleted zones or the effect of nutrient inputs and dredging activities on water quality and habitat suitability.

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Yu (Molly)			An Evaluation Tool for Strategic Training and Development: Application in Chinese High Star-Rated Hotels	JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN TRAVEL & TOURISM			English	Article						strategic training and development; evaluating tool; China's hotels		China's tourism is growing rapidly. By mid-2009, there were 10.958 star-rated tourist hotels in the country that employed 1.5 million employees. Noticeably, one of the challenges that all the hotels in China are facing is how to obtain sufficient qualified employees to sustain the rapid development. With most of the world's leading multinational hotel companies having launched their properties in the country. China is becoming increasingly integrated with the global tourism and hospitality markets. Actually, hotels in China, both indigenous hotels and hotels operated by international hotel chains, are increasingly competing on containing and developing talents. Having an evaluation tool to compare their own training and development (T&D) practices with their competitors' practices is important for them to improve their competitiveness. This article proposes a T&D evaluation tool for high star-rating hotels operating in China. It is designed based on the Western strategic T&D rationales and is modified according to the Chinese context.

The stated government goal is to build up an SPR equivalent to the amount of 90 days of net oil imports by 2020. To build up an SPR needs a large amount of funds. How to determine the optimal acquisition strategy to reduce the total cost as much as possible is a challenge for China. Furthermore, in the process of establishing the SPR, there are many uncertain factors. This paper employs the dynamic programming (DP) method to determine an optimal acquisition strategy and to evaluate the total cost for establishing China's SPR. The impact of varying a number of uncertain factors on the results is also examined. The results would be helpful for policymakers in China to develop a better scheme for strategic stockpiling for China's SPR.

The manuscript describes the three years long process of building an implementation framework for the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in teaching and learning in the form of blended e-learning - combined classroom and online learning via e-learning platform (or learning management system, LMS). The implementation started practically from ground zero, with the goal of preparing the infrastructure and the environment for the implementation, while also building a community of educated practitioners. A few points for getting support and networking have been established within the university infrastructure: faculty e-learning teams and/or representatives taking care of the institutional promotion and deployment of e-learning and connected to the university Committee for e-learning as a policy making body, the e-learning centre, which provides e-learning platform (LMS) maintenance, development, and technical user's support, and the IT Academy which assures delivery and development of education from general ICT to specialized e-learning programs. All the processes and activities within the network are assured for quality control. Two years after the deployment, the platform hosts more than 400 e-courses with 15,000 e-students. The survey among teachers using e-learning to perform blended courses revealed satisfaction and general acceptance, indicating the increase in effectiveness of teaching and learning processes. Although much of the effort and investing into resources is still needed, we believe that the report presented here could serve as a case of good practice in institutionally supported e-learning implementation. With the institutionally planned approach, we succeeded in building a solid institutional framework, awareness and understanding, visibility, promotion, and common language within the community, which will all hopefully serve for future progress.

J	Gearey, M; Jeffrey, P				Gearey, Mary; Jeffrey, Paul			Using legitimacy dialogues to explore responses to flooding issues in a UK catchment	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						flooding; river catchment; stakeholder engagement; strategic change; urban development	MANAGEMENT	A growing awareness of the potential impacts of climate change has led to the consideration of a variety of future outcomes by water supply companies, regulators and local authorities within England and Wales. These strategies recognise the possibility of episodes of flooding within catchments, with the Environment Agency's fourth Periodic Review requiring water companies to explore future demand and supply scenarios up to 2030. However, there is a gap in the literature concerning how those tasked to implement water policy, and those subject to it, view these change scenarios. This paper outlines a study undertaken within the River Nene catchment, exploring how water resource governance bodies and water users respond to flooding issues. In particular, the research focuses on the twin concepts of legitimacy and dialogue as a means to assess the boundaries of stakeholder engagement with these strategic change scenarios.

J	Pohl, H				Pohl, Hans			INTERPARADIGMATIC HYBRIDS: A NEW THEORETICAL CONCEPT WHEN ADDRESSING PARADIGMATIC SHIFTS IN TECHNOLOGY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; paradigm; automotive; hybrid electric vehicles		Paradigmatic shifts are challenging and consequently considerable efforts have been made to find concepts relating to the innovation process which lead from one paradigm to the next. This paper takes its inspiration from previous literature and studies of more than incremental innovations in the automotive industry. It outlines the concept of an inter-paradigmatic hybrid as a temporary combination ( in one product or service) of technologies from an existing and a future paradigm in a way that facilitates the development toward the future paradigm. The proposed concept is tested on the product level using empirical data from the automotive industry, where it is assumed that hybrid electric vehicle technologies have the role of an interparadigmatic hybrid in the potential shift from the internal combustion engine to the paradigm of "pure"electric propulsion. The conclusions include an argument for the usefulness of the proposed concept for corporate managers, and perhaps even more so for policymakers and researchers, as it provides long- term strategic guidance and a (techno) logical order.

Operationalizing Leon Health Assets	HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL			English	Article						Healthcare FM; Lean assets; performance indicators; Goodhart's Law	IMPACT	Objective: To demonstrate the potential of employing unconventional facility/facilities management (FM) performance indicators in healthcare settings to enable more strategic conversations between FM and business users concerning asset performance. Background: The theoretical background for a Lean asset approach and a high-level analysis of data form hospital trusts in England have been published elsewhere. This paper reports on the first uses of that approach in operational settings. Method: Observations are drawn primarily from three case studies. Results: The individual studies support the premise that the conventional emphasis on cost per square meter (m(2)) as a preeminent measure of FM disguise a portfolio of too much underutilized space. They provide a means of putting a health-care estates strategy in terms that will engage business users. Conclusions: Despite a growing interest in Lean approaches in healthcare, the philosophy has not yet been extended to the estate. This study demonstrates that alternative benchmarks are possible.

J	de Langen, P; Douma, A				de Langen, Peter; Douma, Albert			CHALLENGES FOR USING ICT TO IMPROVE COORDINATION IN HINTERLAND CHAINS; AN OVERVIEW	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS			English	Article						intermodal transport; coordination; business models; ICT; distributed planning	PORT; ROTTERDAM; TERMINALS	The importance of hinterland transport in intercontinental door-to-door chains is widely recognised. Intermodal hinterland transport services are provided by many different firms, each taking care of a part of the chain. Consequently, there is a need for cooperation and coordination in hinterland chains, to ensure an attractive overall service for shippers. However, different firms have different market positions and business models. This leads to differences in incentives, resources, capabilities, and attitudes concerning coordination and cooperation. Analysis of their business models suggests that there is so much competition between players with different business models, especially for involvement in design of scheduled transport networks, that initiatives to enhance coordination often have strategic implications. Consequently, coordination and cooperation do not (always) emerge, even when beneficial for the overall hinterland chain. This conclusion is relevant for the potential of ICT in improving coordination. Mechanisms to improve coordination will only be successful if they are in line with the business model of the firms involved. Distributed planning is a promising approach in this respect, as it may offer solutions to hinterland coordination problems, while, unlike traditional centralized systems, not effecting business models of the involved firms.

J	Griffiths, D; Koukpaki, S				Griffiths, David; Koukpaki, Serge			Are we stuck with knowledge Management? A Case for strategic knowledge Resource Development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						Definitions; Historical Perspective; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Resource Development; Organisational Resources	INFORMATION; CREATION; SYSTEMS; MODEL	This is a conceptual paper offering an approach to apparent practitioner and academic dissatisfaction with the field of Knowledge Management (KM). Discussing definitions of knowledge, the drivers for its value as an organisational resource and comparing these against definitions of Knowledge Management, this paper suggests a divergence between operational needs and KM as the medium for coordination. Offering an historical perspective of knowledge as a resource it suggests KM to be too broad a concept to be effective in fulfilling the needs of organisations. The authors suggest a continuum for knowledge resource development from which Strategic Knowledge Resource Development is offered as a potential solution for current unsatisfaction.

Web-based disclosures have the advantages of low cost, mass reach, frequency and speed, and yet the extent of Internet disclosure varies across companies and industries. Drawing on interdisciplinary work in information technology and corporate governance, in this paper, the authors examine the S&P 100 companies' use of the Web for corporate governance information disclosure and analyze the association between the Web disclosing practice and firm attributes. Their findings support the proposition that Web-based disclosure decisions were associated with various firm specific attributes. This study has implications for the strategic role of the Internet and Web in disclosure and transparency.

The paper also develops a Strategic Framework as a guideline for manufacturers to formulate their Internet channel strategies. Unlike most other studies on channel conflicts that focus on channel management after the manufacturer has already established its ODSC, this study provides a comprehensive strategic analysis of channel conflicts based on a pre-ODSC context, which prevents unnecessary losses from channel conflicts before they occur.

J	Sahin, M				Sahin, Mehmet			Blended learning model in mechanical manufacturing training	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Blended learning; blended model; mechanical manufacturing; vocational training		Blended learning is increasingly prevalent and it is vital for higher education and corporate trainers to create strategic plans focusing on blended learning techniques to benefit from this teaching and training model. A qualitative study was carried out using an interview technique with a trainer who applied a blended training model in a vocational organisation. The aim was to determine whether blended learning is effective in mechanical manufacturing training. The results indicate that blended learning can play a vital role in vocational training settings in educational organisations and workplaces. The approach can be used for vocational training based on skill development for manufacturing and production areas at any level. Implementation of a blended learning model in a very specific vocational education field (mechanical manufacturing) has demonstrated that the approach is very useful if designed well.

J	Dubois, S				Dubois, Sebastien			Paradox in the Worlds of Art: Socio-economic Stability and Organizational Multiplicity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Arts organization; strategy as practice; strategic plans; conventionalist analysis; stakeholders	CAREERS; AESTHETICS; MARKET	The worlds of art, and particularly the careers of artists, are often seen as unstructured and disorganized and therefore difficult to analyze. The author uses the case of contemporary poetry to put forward an analytical grid for these apparently labile universes. He identifies two forces that impose a structure on the universe of poetry: socio-economic constraints, and artists' competencies and the aesthetic frontline. Poets' careers steer a course between these beacons, which the author suggests could be called a "tennis tournament," where progressive and structured selection operates.

J	Gupta, R; Pandit, A				Gupta, Rakesh; Pandit, Ajay			ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN INDIAN TALENT POOL MANAGEMENT-A CASE OF MERITTRAC	ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CASES			English	Article						Entrepreneurship; talent pool; knowledge economy; higher education; skill intensive		The growth of knowledge economy and its increasing contribution to the global economy has brought into focus the importance of highly educated and quality manpower. As the knowledge economy expands, the issue of qualified, skilled and highly educated manpower is going to assume strategic importance for countries as well as for companies. The effect of changing demographic profile and the increasing trend of outsourcing in the services sector has brought into focus the talent pool of many developing and emerging economies of the world. In this context, the Indian talent pool assumes significance for a number of reasons; one is the sheer number of students graduating every year, which makes it the largest talent pool in the world. The other factor is the growth story of the Indian economy that, to a large extent, is dependent on the growth of the services sector, especially the skill-intensive services. This case examines in detail the talent pool of India and its higher education infrastructure in the light of the emerging scenario. It looks into the depth and quality of the talent pool to identify the gap areas to see whether certain niche entrepreneurial opportunities exist that can help in overcoming these gap areas. MeritTrac is an example of one such enterprise, which highlights the existence and relevance of these entrepreneurial initiatives.

J	Huang, JD; Hu, MH; Wee, HM				Huang, Jheng-Dan; Hu, Michael H.; Wee, H. M.			Lead Logistics Provider and Its Effect on Supply Chain Alliances - A Case Study on Taiwan Motor Industry	OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Lead logistics provider; supply chain alliances; third-party logistics; automotive industry		The increasing competition due to globalization and e-Business development has stimulated manufacturers to pursue supply chain alliances more aggressively. The primary motivation for this is to minimize overall costs and gain mutual benefits through supplier-manufacturer integration. Supply chain alliance is one of the key strategic co-operations adopted by manufacturers to simultaneously reduce costs and improve service. The advancement of supply chain alliance is moving from a Third-Party Logistics System to a Lead Logistics Provider Management System. The Lead Logistics Provider plays the role of logistics manager who lead the logistics operations across the entire supply chain with the ability to provide superior expertise in transportation services, warehousing capabilities, information technology, and materials replenishment among the other logistics activities. A Lead Logistics Provider system framework is composed of three components that include Resources Management, Information Central System, and Logistics Synchronization. This study presents a case of a Taiwanese automotive supply chain illustrating the application of supply chain alliances via the Lead Logistics Provider system. Significant improvement on inventory costs and improvement on the transportation performance is reported resulting from the application of this system. This scheme also showed enhanced service quality that creates business opportunities among the supply chain partners.

Strategic Group Formation for Carbon Governance in Indonesia after the Indian Ocean Tsunami 2004	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						carbon governance; Indian Ocean Tsunami; LULUCF; strategic groups; sustainability		This article indentifies the carbon governance landscape after a complex and large-scale disaster by identifying the formation of new strategic groups and the utilization of resources policies. The article highlights the post-disaster context of land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF). In particular it examines the power issue surrounding carbon management in Aceh Province, Indonesia, after the Indian Ocean tsunami (lOT) 2004. The author proposes a new institutional framework, namely the Strategic Framework for Sustainability Analysis (SFSA). The SFSA uses a series of strategic group analyses, combined with strategic resources identification and strategic policy to analyze LULUCF problems. The strategic groups in LULUCF are those that hold the decision-making power to discourage/encourage sustainability of local natural resources. Each group is assumed to reposition itself strategically in order to gain more control over resources. The lOT 2004 has led Aceh to exercise its own sustainability policies, which are set through many initiatives such as a moratorium on logging, a sustainable palm oil policy, livelihood-based carbon conservation projects, and green development policies, including disaster risk reduction.

However, technical-oriented enterprises usually emphasize the virtues of a cluster of technical competences and technological resources availability. So, this paper aimed to discuss communication skills development beyond technical communication in a high technology and technical-based operation, such as ground and flight operations. To do so, this article describes some tragic-ending cases in commercial aviation in which the poor quality of interpersonal communication was identified as the one of the most influential causes of the aircraft, or at least that was seen as a compelling force for creating the perfect backdrop for a disaster involving civilian aircrafts. Methodological procedures were basically addressed to a qualitative approach, supported by a documental research considering some of the most documented cases of aircraft accidents reported by the Aviation System Safety Report, issued by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), USA, as well as reports of accidents provided by The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), USA, and by the Center for Aircraft Research and Prevention (Cenipa), Brasil.

J	Yang, HW; Yang, KF; Yang, CH; Chao, CY				Yang, Hao-Wei; Yang, Kai-Fu; Yang, Chung-Hsin; Chao, Chih-Yang			An effective way to measure the performance of cooperative strategies with competitors in Taiwan's small business	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Intellectual capital; cooperative strategy; performance measurement; strategic alliance	KNOWLEDGE; ALLIANCES; SELECTION; NETWORKS; ASSETS	Forming strategic alliances with competitors has become a heated issue not only in practice but also in academic research. Firms involved in the alliance should dedicate their knowledge, skills, technology, and other valuable resources to achieve collective goals and to create cooperative performance. Drawing from an intellectual capital perspective, this paper attempts to answer three major questions: How does a firm contribute its intellectual capital to be able to cooperate with its competitor? What are the elements of cooperative strategies with competitors? And, how does a firm measure cooperative performance? In this study, a strategic alliance led by a focal company in the supermarket industry in Taiwan was investigated. In order to collect qualitative data, the study conducted an in-depth face-to-face interview with nineteen CEOs in the alliance. They, together, have defined five key cooperative strategies and critical indicators for measuring cooperative performance. As well, the study also developed important intellectual capital which is necessary for implementation of those cooperative strategies. This practice-oriented study contributed a more complete exploration of intellectual capital, cooperative strategy, and performance measurement in practice as well as in research.

J	Fatur, P; Likar, B				Fatur, Peter; Likar, Borut			Statistical Analysis for Strategic Innovation Decisions in Slovenian Mechanical Industry	STROJNISKI VESTNIK-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						innovation; R&D; technology; industrial management; productivity and performance management; machinery and equipment manufacturing industry	PRODUCT; PERFORMANCE	The objective of this study is to identify the main factors influencing the innovation and R&D performance of the machinery and equipment manufacturing industry in the Republic of Slovenia (RS). The research is based on statistical data from the Statistical Office of RS. Spearman's coefficient of correlation has been applied to the entire set of input and output variables in calculating the correlation coefficients. Results indicate the existence of two clusters of companies. Both are innovation followers but differ in their capabilities to produce breakthrough innovations and innovation-related turnover. For both of them, no correlation between the innovation outputs and business/financial petformance is present. Based on the empirical findings, we propose some organizational areas where additional managerial effort needs to be invested. Thus, the research also has a practical implication for the enterprises as well as for the national policy makers. (C) 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved.

From the boardroom to the farmers' market: Using activity system mapping to explore a farmers' market competitive advantage	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Competitive advantage; activity system map; farmers' markets; strategic planning tools; strategic positioning		There are few recent success stories in North American agriculture that match the growth of direct marketing. The number of farmers' markets in the United States, for example, tripled from 1,755 in 1994 to 5,274 in 2009 (USDA, 2009). Despite this positive trend, recent research suggests that this dramatic increase masks the reality that many farmers' markets fail within their first few years of operation. Markets may fail for many reasons, including ineffective management weakened by a lack of resources. On the other hand, those markets that have been well planned and understand their strategic position and competitive advantage in the local market are more likely to survive these vulnerable formative years. Business strategist Porter (1985) developed the "activity system map" to show how a small set of core competencies (what an enterprise does well), together with specific management and policies that support those competencies, fit together to create a strategic position. An enterprise that has effective strategic position is said to have a competitive advantage in the marketplace. In this paper we describe how we created an activity system map for a farmers' market in an eastern Tennessee. This included analyzing organizational documents and interviewing market organizers and management, and then creating a simple diagram that depicts the web of relationships between core competencies of the market and the ongoing activities and policies of the farmers' market managers that support these competencies. We believe that farmers' market sponsors and managers often may be too immersed in day-to-day activities to step back and see the relationship of these activities and policy enforcement to the core competencies. Activity system mapping facilitates discussions on market policy, promotion, and competitiveness. We conclude from this exercise that activity system mapping has the potential to be a useful tool for agriculture and food system practitioners in assisting new or existing farmers' markets to increase their viability in the short run and their sustainability over the long term. Recommendations are made for adopting and/or adapting this technique for use with farmers' markets in other communities.

Numerical Modeling and Computation of Storm Surge for Primitive Equation by Hydrodynamic Model	THAI JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Gulf of Thailand; hydrodynamic model; South China Sea; storm surge		The numerical modeling and computation of storm surge in the shallow regions of the South China Sea (SCS) and the Gulf of Thailand (GoT) are important to study the impacts of tropical storms. The storm surge causes the inundation at the lateral boundary exhibiting in the coastal zones of some parts of the SCS and GoT. The predictions of extreme weather events in the SCS and GoT are important to protect the local properties and human life In the present study, the Princeton Oceanic. Model (POM) is used to silitulate the tropical storm induced surge in a case study of Typhoon Linda 1997. The model results compared with the tide gauge station data can describe the characteristics of storm surges at the coastal regions.	[Wannawong, W.; Humphries, U.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTERACTION			English	Article						Environmental Scanning (ES); HR Management; Human Resources; Intelligent Filters; Technological Resources		This paper examines HR Management issues in Environmental Scanning (ES) process. Although literature claims that selecting information in this kind of processes is central, the authors are using the concept of "intelligent filters" (Simon, 1983) to understand how human attention can be managed for selecting strategic information in a complex environment. The author examines HR executives and the way they deal with issues related to ES and focuses on an empirical study in a big technological firm, where the use of an internal reporting and communication system (the weekly) was studied. This author finds that this particular system can be considered as an "intelligent filter", requiring both human and technological resources. Finally, suggestions that the system is used by HR executives in order to organize communication and coordination in an ES process but also to increase the participation and involvement of all employees in such a process are made.

Induction over constrained strategic agents	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Discriminant analysis; Principal-agent; Strategic gaming; Spam; Data mining		In a new learning paradigm called Induction over Strategic Agents, the principal anticipates possible alteration of attributes by agents wishing to achieve a positive classification. In many cases, agents are constrained on how an attribute can be modified. For example, attribute values may have upper and lower bounds or they may need to belong to a certain set of possible values such as binary valued attributes like "pays bills on time" or be linearly dependent like the relationships between accounting entries in an income statement. In this paper, we explore Induction over Strategic Agents for a class of problems where attributes are binary values. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The development of an instructional design model as a strategic enabler for sustainable competitive advantage	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								In a business environment of continuous change and in light of a defined need to fast track skills improvement in South Africa and Africa, training strategies and practices are under increasing pressure to develop a more productive and skilled workforce. Demands on training and the practices it employs increasingly focus on the alignment with strategic imperatives of organisations. This research presented an instructional design (ID) model positioned in the intersection between the positioning-based and resource-based theories and used a multi-disciplinary approach to extend the literature on ID models and offer measurable improvements in job-specific knowledge and productive behaviour as proxies for sustainable competitive advantage. The research confirmed the contribution of the ID model in this regard and described and substantiated the pivotal link between training and ID models and the application thereof in practice to aid organisations in the achievement and sustainability of competitive advantage. In this, the second article, the ID model will be subjected to empirical investigation and evaluated through the application thereof in a case organisation and a grounded conclusion provided. Hence, this article presents a brief overview of the first article, and focuses on the research methodology, research results, analysis and interpretation; conclusions and assessment of the research. This is the second in a series of two articles	[Le Roux, L.; Oosthuizen, H.] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Business, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa		Oosthuizen, H (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Business, POB 610, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.	ho2@usb.ac.za					Boyle M.

J	Lee, JJ; Duong, VTE				Lee, Joosung J.; Duong, Vathana T. E.			Analysis of the Cambodia's Garment Industry and Catch-up Strategy	ASIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION			English	Article						garment trade; safeguard policy; garment industry; OEM suppliers; Cambodia	VIETNAM; CHINA	This article aims to assess the capabilities of Cambodia's garment industry in the post-Safeguard Policy era, and the country's ability to upgrade its garment assembling status to Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) status. This article analyzes and proposes a strategic positioning of Cambodia's garment industry in the next decade by utilizing the analytical framework developed by the US International Trade Commission (USITC) in 2004. Findings from the USITC framework-based assessment have been illustrated in a cobweb-shaped diagram to show an analogy of Cambodia's garment industry in comparison with that of China and Vietnam. For the improvement of the current working environment and the forthcoming upgrading process, a trajectory of the Cambodia's garment industry has been projected in three vital stages: (1) assembling, (2) OEM, and (3) original brand manufacturing. In response to the first objective, the Cambodia's garment industry is predicted to face a high risk of industrial downturn in the post-2008 era due to the internal weaknesses in the supply side. For the second objective, the shift from Cambodia's current garment assembler status to OEM status will take a long time and require training of local managers and skilled workers.

In particular, we ask whether non-coordinated trade policies stimulate cross-border mergers that are overall inefficient, and if this then is an argument for international coordination of such policies? We address this issue in a setting where policy makers use two-part tariffs to tax exporting firms. The analysis reveals that while non-coordinated policies may induce cross-border mergers by allowing the firms in question to play national policy makers out against each other, this can nevertheless be overall welfare enhancing compared to market outcomes under coordinated policy making.

In combination with the relevant literature and interviews with experts, this study adopts the modified Delphi method and the analytic network process (ANP) to construct an evaluation method and to determine ANP effectiveness. The results indicate that executives of banks and insurance companies most prefer financial holding companies.

J	Deo, Z				Deo, Zulfiqar			A Strategy Implementation Framework for International SME's	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP			English	Article						International SME's; SBU; Risks; Complexities; Strategy Implementation; Strategy; Tactics; C4I Framework		This article is a summarised version of a research based project (30% of the authors MBA course) which has separated the notion of business strategy implementation and business strategy execution. Prior to this project business strategy implementation and business strategy execution were considered to be synonymous both in academia and industry. This project cross applied a military framework for strategy implementation and customised it for International SME's. This article limits itself to the theory generated by the project and is intended to improve the overall understanding of the business strategy process within the International SME sector focused around the senior management of the company. The project helped an International SME to understand the need for a framework at the SBU level, customised one for the purpose, and showed how to practically use it. This aided senior managers to make more effective decisions at the SBU level. It also helped to clarify what is strategic and what is tactical, the need to dynamically manage the risks and complexities, and engrain the need for interactions between various management levels in the decision making process to ensure flawless realisation of the Owner/Manager's vision for the company. This project used the realist research paradigm as the research strategy and case study as the research method. Combined they allowed the use of innovative research tools like social media. The strategy implementation solution for the Medium Sized Company has been accepted by the case company to provide greater insight into current operations. Other companies in the SME sector have also accepted the value of the customised framework. The university has accepted and graded this project. The case company solution is confidential and therefore unavailable.

These sensors have also potential interest to the aerospace field due to their ability to operate in harsh environment such as high temperatures and intense radiation. In the present paper, this roadmap is described and presented in four main sections: i) introduction, ii) what we have already done in the past, iii) what we are doing in this moment, and iv) our targets up to 2015. The critical technological issues were evaluated for different categories: SiC deposition techniques, SiC processing techniques for sensors fabrication and sensors characterization. This roadmap also presents a shared vision of how R&D activities in microelectronics should develop over the next five years in our laboratory.

Through multidisciplinary teamwork, medical and informatics experts collaborated and studied on system scope definition, standard selection challenges, system implementation barriers, system management outcomes, and further expandability of other systems. After user requirement analysis and prototyping, from 2005 to 2008, an online clinical decision support system with multiple functions of reminding and information push was implemented. It was to replace its original legacy systems and serve among the main hospital and three branches of 180-200 clinics and 7,500-8,000 patient visits per day. To evaluate the effectiveness of this system, user surveys were performed, which revealed that the average score of user satisfaction increased from 2.80 to 3.18 on a 4-point scale. Among the items, especially e-learning for training service, courtesy communications for system requests, and courtesy communications for system operations showed statistically significant improvement. From this study, the authors concluded that standardized information exchange technologies can be used to create a brand new enterprise value and steadily obtain more competitive advantages for a prestige healthcare system.

A Numerical Study of Two Coordinates for Energy Balance Equations by Wave Model	THAI JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Cartesian coordinate; Energy alance equations; spherical coordinate; Wave model		For the numerical simulations of the ocean wave model, the coordinates for the operation of wave prediction model need to be studied due to the high resolutions affecting the domain boundaries. In the present study, the two coordinates for the wave energy balance equations required for operation and computation are proposed. The two dimensional models, the spherical coordinate and Cartesian coordinate propagations with deep and shallow water conditions, are used to test the operation of the wave model from the eye storm generation at the Pacific Ocean entering into the South China Sea (SCS) and the Gulf of Thailand (GoT) respectively. The results suggest that the spherical coordinate propagations with deep water conditions are acceptable with similar values of the observational data.	[Wannawong, W.; Humphries, U.

Jeffrey; Daranpob, Ammarin			Middle-term metropolitan water availability index assessment based on synergistic potential of multi-sensor data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Water sustainability; remote sensing; drought management; water supply; risk assessment	ENERGY BALANCE ALGORITHM; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; SOIL-MOISTURE; RIVER-BASIN; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; SATELLITE IMAGERY; SPECTRAL INDEX; DROUGHT INDEX; QUALITY; CHLOROPHYLL	The impact of recent drought and water pollution episodes results in an acute need to project future water availability to assist water managers in water utility infrastructure management within many metropolitan regions. Separate drought and water quality indices previously developed might not be sufficient for the purpose of such an assessment. This paper describes the development of the "Metropolitan Water Availability Index (MWAI)" and its potential applications in assessing the middle-term water availability at the watershed scale in a fast growing metropolitan region - the Manatee County near Tampa Bay, Florida, U. S. A. The MWAI framework is based on a statistical approach that seeks to reflect the continuous spatial and temporal variations of both water quantity and quality using a simple numerical index. Such a trend analysis will surely result in the final MWAI values for regional water management systems within a specified range. By using remote sensing technologies and data processing techniques, continuous monitoring of spatial and temporal distributions of key water availability variables, such as evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation, is made achievable. These remote sensing technologies can be ground-based (e. g., radar estimates of rainfall), or based on remote sensing data gathered by aircraft or satellites. Using a middle term historical record, the MWAI was applied to the Manatee County water supplies. The findings clearly indicate that only eight out of twelve months in 2008 had positive MWAI values during the year. Such numerical findings are consistent with the observational evidence of statewide drought events in 2006-2008, which implies the time delay between the ending of severe drought period and the recovery of water availability in MWAI. It is expected that this forward-looking novel water availability forecasting platform will help provide a linkage in methodology between strategic planning, master planning, and the plant operation and adaptations in response to the MWAI implications.

J	Milano, GV				Milano, Gregory V.			Postmodern Corporate Finance	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								One of the core tenets of modern finance theory is that corporations create value by producing operating rates of return on capital that are greater than the cost of capital. "Postmodern" corporate finance, while reaffirming the importance of earning an adequate return on capital, also attempts to restore at least part of the traditional corporate emphasis on top-line growth that prevailed before the intense focus on returns by modern shareholder value advocates. One important reason for the heightened emphasis on growth in addition to returns is that most rate-of-return measures used by companies and investors are based on conservative accounting practices that make old assets look moreprofitable than new ones, thereby discouraging investments in growth. This article introduces a new return measure called "Gross Business Return" that, when evaluated against a Required Return framework that reflects the level of current stock prices, has a stronger correlation with how companies are valued by the stock market. Moreover, in reviewing historical returns over time for both the market and specific industries, the author's research suggests that the market appears to demand considerably lower current returns than those implied by traditional weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approaches. And to the extent corporate executives rely on WACC, they could be passing up valuable growth opportunities. To help evaluate tradeoffs between growth and return, the author introduces a cash-based measure of corporate economic profit called Residual Cash Earnings. Unlike most traditional return and economic profit measures, Residual Cash Earnings, when expressed as a percentage of sales, provides a way for corporate managers to identify growth opportunities that, while producing current returns lower than WACC, are likely to add value over a multi-year time horizon. These new measures and analytical tools are suitable for strategic planning, budgeting, resource allocation, performance measurement, and rewards. Consistent application of these principles across these management processes provides a framework for constantly rebalancing the emphasis on growth and return to adapt to changes in the economy, industry, and competitive landscape.

J	Nutt, PC				Nutt, Paul C.			An Empirical Test of Thompson's Model of Strategic Choice	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						Decision making; Selecting decision rules		Prescriptions found in Thompson's strategic choice propositions call for decisionmakers to select a decision approach according to demands posed by the decision task. Defining decision tasks in terms of means and ends clarity, the paper provides a way to conduct an empirical test of the value of the propositions. The test was made with several hundred organizational decisions, comparing the success realized when decision makers followed, and failed to follow, the guidelines found in the propositions. The findings suggest that success increases when the guidelines are followed and declined when they are not followed, offering considerable empirical support for Thompson's prescriptions. The implications of the findings for managers and management are discussed.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE CRITICAL PHASES AND DECISION-MAKING CRITERIA FOR THE SHUTDOWN OF CHEMICAL PROCESSING PLANTS CASE STUDIES: SOUTH AMERICA, SPAIN AND PORTUGAL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Plant shutdown; Decision making; Critical phases; Main criteria; Project management		Normally, chemical processing plants work at 95% of their capacity productive. In order to avoid delays or a reduction in their capacity, they develop a maintenance and replacement strategic plan of equipment, carried out by plant shutdown projects. The success of these will depend on the correct management and the effectiveness of the decisions taken by the responsible team. This paper aims to describe the decision making process, to identify the most critical phases in this projects, in addition to establishing the required parameters. This study has been conducted in 53 chemical processing enterprises with 78 experts in this type of project. Results allow to concluded that the most critical phases are the early stages definition and planning. The sense of a lack of information expressed by experts confirm that the present management requires a conceptual base which integrates the different and disperse data available in an organised manner.

J	Bretones, DD; Quinio, B; Reveillon, G				Bretones, Daniel D.; Quinio, Bernard; Reveillon, Gilbert			Bridging virtual and real worlds: enhancing outlying clustered value creations	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						bridge; clustered value creations; innovation; social networks; virtual worlds		Virtual worlds and virtual social networks provide real opportunities for companies to implement research in management dealing with immersive environment, interaction and co-creation of values (artefact, process, knowledge). New capabilities and new tools are emerging. The observations drawn from experiments allow categorizing them. We then propose an approach that could help companies to start activities inside these new environments of collaborative work. The cross fertilizing insights between the virtual and the real world are shown and introduced as the bridge. The 3D economy process is based on shorter cycles of decision making processes. The 'bridge model' integrates the added value chain and goes beyond it with the creation of outlying clustered values. The bridge mechanism shows a spectrum from low potential to high potential areas - of fulfillments. A company strategy may explain a positioning on one or the other limits of the spectrum.

He then explores the roots of strategic thinking on supply strategy. From China, he focuses on Sun Tzu's the Art of War (bing-fa in pinyin) and from India, the work of Arthashastra by Kautilya (also known as Chanakya and Vishnugupta). What is found is that whilst there is a very extensive literature on supply chain management, both the works by Sun Tzu and Kautilya are rarely mentioned as part of it. Yet as this article will document, these very ancient works Art of War and Arthashastra besides being deeply enmeshed in Chinese and Indian cultures, respectively, contain insights relevant for supply strategy.

Solar cell, one of the green energy, is growing rapidly with its nonpolluted and unexhausted characteristics. In addition, the patent data contains plentiful technological information from which is worthwhile for exploring further knowledge. Therefore, two graph-based methods, KeyGraph and Data Crystallization, were employed so as to analyze the patent data, to form a technological scenario, and to explain the overview of solar cell technology. Finally, the relations among companies, technology, and application have been observed, and the strategic suggestions have been proposed accordingly.

J	Deboudt, P				Deboudt, Philippe			Towards the implementation of a collective action for managing natural coastal risk in France	CYBERGEO-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY			French	Article						coastal defenses; collective action; France; Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM); natural disasters; natural risks; stakeholders	ZONE MANAGEMENT; NORTH	Since the mid 19th-century, the vulnerability of the economic stakes on this coastal fringe has been managed mainly by controlling the hazards; this control is coordinated by the national government, which has initiated coastal defense practices. At the beginning of the 1980s, natural risk prevention policies favored managing the consequences of natural disasters, with the creation of the CatNat insurance regime to indemnify natural disaster victims. By the middle of the 1990s, new natural risk management strategies had been invented to complete the control of natural hazards. As part of the emerging philosophy of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), the French government encouraged the development of natural risk prevention policies by establishing Natural Risk Prevention Plans (PPRn) in 1995. These PPRn were a new approach to shoreline management that favored controlling development in coastal communities. At the beginning of the 21st century, the French government set down the general orientations for managing natural coastal risks, but it was not the only stakeholder involved. Collective action emerged, bringing the national government, public institutions, territorial and local authorities together to develop risk management policies. This collective action was facilitated by a form of decentralization of natural coastal risk management, involving regional or local implementation of the strategic orientations of shoreline management, respecting the general principles defined by the national government. These changes are part of the ICZM implementation process, which has been under way since 2005.

J	Demos, N; Marston, C				Demos, Nick; Marston, Claire			Firm visibility via group presentations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING			English	Article						corporate communication; corporate disclosure; investor relations; IRs; visibility; group presentations	CORPORATE DISCLOSURE; CAPITAL-MARKET	Investor relation (IR) is a function that should make a difference to listed companies' communication process to the markets. It is also the strategic corporate activity that promotes the investment case of a listed company and puts its listed stock 'on the radar screen' of the analysts and the fund managers. But which corporate communication tool should the listed companies utilise to inform the market? What can the top management and especially the in-house Investor Relations Officer (IRO) do to increase company visibility? One option is to participate in and communicate through group presentations. This paper investigates the Greek listed firms' efforts towards attaining visibility via group presentations. Visibility should result in better stock liquidity and increased stock price.

Exploring intra-industry competitive heterogeneity The identification of latent competitive groups	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive strategy; Modelling; Public sector organizations; Banks; Economics; United States of America	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; STRATEGIC GROUPS; INSURANCE INDUSTRY; MOBILITY BARRIERS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MARKET; DIVERSIFICATION; CONDUCT; MODELS	Purpose - The paper aims to examine the nature of competition within an industry by proposing and examining three separate sources of competitive heterogeneity: the strategies that industry members use, the performance that they obtain, and how effectively the strategies are utilized to obtain such performance results. Design/methodology/approach - To do so, a restricted latent structure finite mixture model is devised that can quantify the contribution of these three potential sources of heterogeneity in the formulation of latent competitive groups within an industry. The paper illustrate this modeling framework with respect to COMPUSTAT strategy and performance data collected for public banks in the USA. Findings - The paper shows how traditional conceptualizations via strategic or performance groups are inadequate to fully represent intra-industry heterogeneity. Originality/value - This research paper proposes a new class of restricted finite mixture-based models, which fit a variety of alternative forms/models of heterogeneity. Information heuristics are developed to indicate "best model."

J	Ehrmann, T; Meiseberg, B				Ehrmann, Thomas; Meiseberg, Brinja			Benefits of Inner Strength for Franchise System Expansion	JOURNAL OF MARKETING CHANNELS			English	Article						clusters; franchisee performance; franchising; Germany; site selection; social network analysis		For every franchise system, making the leap from the unknown to the common place requires a strategic plan for growth. The exogenous market perspective holds that evaluating market conditions is central to defining promising outlet locations as there are direct economic effects on performance. The endogenous firm perspective and the social network approach together provide an inner strength perspective on interconnected firms; this perspective holds that access to resources offered at a certain spot determines site attractiveness, rather than location-specific market factors. Using a sample of 201 German franchisees, this study tests hypotheses that explore which perspective dominates location decisions in practice and clarify the relevance of the decisive criteria for outlet performance. Results show that location decisions rely on both perspectives, yet franchisee performance depends more on inner strength factors. We also find that expansion is better served by following a geographically dispersed cluster approach than by growing steadily from a baseline site.

J	Galtier, T; Gupta, S; Rychlik, I				Galtier, Thomas; Gupta, Sayan; Rychlik, Igor			Crossings of Second-Order Response Processes Subjected to LMA Loadings	JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS			English	Article								The focus of this paper is on the estimation of the crossing intensities of responses for second-order dynamical systems, subjected to stationary, non-Gaussian external loadings. A new model for random loadings-the Laplace driven moving average (LMA)-is used. The model is non-Gaussian, strictly stationary, can model any spectrum, and has additional flexibility to model the skewness and kurtosis of the marginal distribution. The system response can be expressed as a second-order combination of the LMA processes. A numerical technique for estimating the level crossing intensities for such processes is developed. The proposed method is a hybrid method which combines the saddle-point approximation with limited Monte Carlo simulations. The performance and the accuracy of the proposed method are illustrated through a set of numerical examples.

K.; Parsons, Jay			Risk Navigator SRM: An Applied Risk Management Tool	JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS			English	Article								Risk Navigator SRM is a ten-step risk management program for agricultural producers, which is based on the strategic planning process. The ten steps are designed to integrate disparate and difficult risk management concepts into a single system that is easy to use, yet still effective. With the aid of computers and the internet, producers can work through each step toward a final comprehensive plan. The website includes 25 decision tools that help producers accomplish each step and provides links to complementary educational programs, like a national agricultural risk education library, the award-winning risk management simulation program called Ag Survivor, and a recently published book that describes the program and provides additional depth and explanations. The ten-step program has been presented in over 200 workshops with over 90 percent approval by participants. The website has averaged over 1,000 unique visitors per month from 120 countries.

In response, the Korean government has adopted various policies in an attempt to deregulate real estate speculation. For example, the Loan to value ratio (LTV) has been increased in order to stimulate housing supply, demand, and housing transactions. However, these policies could potentially result in a mortgage crisis due to an increase in over-amplified and high-risk derivatives in Korea's secondary mortgage market. Consequently, the housing market could fall into such deep confusion that it will be even more difficult to perform empirically based housing market forecasting. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic method is required to analyze the real estate financial market and the causal relationships between market influence factors. With an integrated perspective and an application of a system dynamics methodology, this paper proposes Korean Real Estate and Mortgage Market dynamics models based on the fundamental principles and causal loops of housing markets, which are determined by the economic activities of consumers, financial agencies, and real estate financing investors. The potential effects of the Korean government's deregulation policies are also considered by focusing on the main factor of these policies: the mortgage loan.
