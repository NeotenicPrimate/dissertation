J	Jarvensivu, T; Lukkari, P; Jarvensivu, P				Jarvensivu, Timo; Lukkari, Pirjo; Jarvensivu, Paavo			Strategic networks and the institutional environment A case study of Pharma Industry Finland (PIF)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND HEALTHCARE MARKETING			English	Article						Institutional care; Entrepreneurialism; Health services; Pharmaceuticals industry	PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; COMPANIES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the impact of the institutional environment on strategic networks including their cohesiveness as well as institutional entrepreneurship activities conducted by members of these networks. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a case study of the trade association Pharma Industry Finland (PIF) and its institutional environment. Findings - Institutional environment and institutional entrepreneurship of a strategic network are intertwined in various ways. Changes in the institutional environment influence the strategic cohesiveness of the network and the mutual goals of its network members. As a result, PIF proactively engages in entrepreneurial activities to realize its interests. Research limitations/implications - The paper of one network and one institutional environment is limited in generalizability. Further research is needed to explore if similar results can be obtained in other contexts. Practical implications - In order to be successful, companies should be able to sense and evaluate which matters can be effectively addressed through collective institutional entrepreneurship and/or the company's own entrepreneurial activity. Originality/value - This empirical study contributes to discussions on the theoretical understanding of strategic networks in relation to institutional environments, institutionally bounded strategizing in networks, and institutional entrepreneurship in business networks.

J	Johnson, KA; Cain, W				Johnson, Kurt A.; Cain, William			Adaptation and Application of Federal Capabilities-Based Planning Models to Individual States: State of Colorado Case Study	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						homeland security; national security; national and state strategies; strategic management; capabilities-based planning		This article utilizes the State of Colorado as a case study in how individual states are adapting and applying federal capabilities-based planning models to their homeland security programs. The article reviews the corrective change in direction taken by Colorado in implementation of homeland security organizational strategies, structures, policies and procedures. The authors' findings lead to conclusions about Colorado's beginning phase of transforming deficient homeland security strategy, incoherent organization, and fragmented planning processes into sound strategy, focused structure, and organized methods. In November 2008, the Center for Homeland Security (CHS) at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs began a research and mutual support effort with the Colorado Governor's Office of Homeland Security for the purpose of immersing in the state's revitalized homeland security planning cycle. The intent was to gain insight into the state's creation of a new homeland security organization, the application of a new homeland security strategy, and the efficacy of implementing federal capabilities-based planning processes from a strategic and operational perspective, rather than a federal grant application focus. Colorado's shift to a capabilities-based planning process was largely in response to criticism from both the Department of Homeland Security and Colorado state auditors on the use of federal homeland security funds. Audits described the state's strategy as disorganized and its homeland security structure as fractured with poor accountability and little meaningful oversight. This article examines the initial findings of the CHS immersion experience.

This study constructs standards for assessing location selection based on competitive advantage and risk perspective. Data is collected via modified Delphi approach interviews, then analyzed via content analysis and Analytical Hierarchy Process. Based on the analytical results, the evaluation standards are divided into risk evaluation and the four main dimensions: factor conditions; demand conditions; firm strategy structure and rivalry, and related and supporting industries. This study also develops three evaluation standards for resort park location. Measuring location selections can help businesses select suitable international resort parks, to provide some evaluation standards which can provide basis for tourism departments and assist industries in location selection.

J	Kristianto, Y; Helo, P; Takala, J				Kristianto, Yohanes; Helo, Petri; Takala, Josu			Strategic inventory allocation for product platform strategy	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Inventory management; Production planning and control; Supply chain management; Decision making		Purpose - This paper focuses on decision making related to the use of strategic inventory allocation in product platform design. The purpose of the paper is to present a novel approach to managing product variety by considering product and manufacturing strategy, and considering the supply chain benefits. Design/methodology/approach - Discrete event simulation is used for analyzing product platform performance in terms of inventory level and throughput. Simulation parameters such as lead times and safety stock allocation are optimized by using an analytical model of strategic safety stock allocation. Findings - The results show that strategic safety stock allocation supports product platform strategy by increasing production output, and reducing inventory level and customer order queues at a higher level of product variety. Research limitations/implications - Linking the safety stock allocation and product platform strategy facilitates simultaneous product and process design by providing the most optimum platform strategy at minimum safety stock allocation. Practical implications - Strategic safety stock allocation facilitates decision making with regard to lean strategy by reducing inventory level, agile strategy by increasing the amount of product variety and outputs, and responsiveness by reducing the number of customer order queues. Originality/value - The paper presents an innovative customer order decoupling point decision.

J	Law, D; Yip, J				Law, D.; Yip, J.			Profiling Chinese Hong Kong consumers' attitudes on the atmospheric management strategies adopted by intimate apparel retailers	JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE			English	Article						Chinese; attitudes; atmospheric; intimate; apparel; retailers		The atmosphere in a store is a crucial factor for inducing impulse shopping or providing an effect on perceived brand image and product quality. The atmosphere is especially important for aesthetic-related products, such as fashion. However, fashion becomes an inseparable element even in a function-oriented product, namely intimate apparel. In this study, the authors adopted a qualitative method, the grounded theory, to investigate the ways that the store atmosphere affects the attitudes of Chinese female consumers to intimate apparel. Attitudes with regards to cognitive and affective aspects are discussed and numerous strategic directions are presented.

J	Leung, BYP				Leung, Barbara Y. P.			WEALTH TRANSFER IN FORWARD PROPERTY MARKETS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Forward property market; Presale properties; Asymmetric information; Wealth transfer; Repeat sales method		The principal-agent problem arising from asymmetric information in presales of uncompleted properties in forward property markets has been well-recognized. Since buyers are not able to inspect the uncompleted properties when they make the purchases, developers may hide information about the negative aspects of the properties or over-state the quality in order to generate an extra profit in the presales on top of the equilibrium value as if the properties were sold in the spot market. In this regard, the study adapted a forward-spot property repeat sales pricing model to explore the pricing of presale properties compared to that of spot properties in which the principal-agent problem does not exist. The findings suggest that developers were able to impose a wealth transfer from the buyers in pricing presale properties taking the advantage of asymmetric information embedded in forward property markets.

The authors analyze some of the retooling undergone at their library to meet the shifting demographics of students who in 10 years have grown from 1,000 online students to 14,500 and increased to 65% of the students now taking online classes. To meet this challenge, the library centralized library services by closing the regional Library Information Centers and established a Multimedia Department focused on developing tutorials and online training materials, established an outreach librarian position, and worked with reference and instruction librarians to expand their roles as liaisons to the various academic programs. The library is learning to work smarter, not necessarily harder, and much leaner.

J	Magau, MD; Roodt, G				Magau, Mpho D.; Roodt, Gert			AN EVALUATION OF THE HUMAN CAPITAL BRIDGE(TM) FRAME WORK	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						human capital; intellectual capital; strategic business partner; strategic alignment; South African mining industry		Orientation: The methodologies employed for achieving two important goals of human resource (HR) measurement, namely to enhance decisions about human capital and to connect HR and business strategy, are rarely empirically investigated. Research purpose: The aim of the present study was therefore to use the Human Capital (HC) BRidge TM framework to compare the views of HR practitioners with those of line management on HC solutions towards achieving strategic business objectives. Motivation for the study: The motivation for this study was to determine whether the HC BRidge TM framework can create a useful platform for leveraging human capital solutions and for demonstrating HR value-add. Research design: A census-based survey was conducted on a target population of 787 supervisors and managers in specific categories in a mining company, which yielded 202 responses. The measuring instrument used was based on the HC BRidge TM framework and on the companys strategic objectives. Item intercorrelations on the subscales were followed by factor analyses and iterative item analyses. Main findings/results: The self-developed measuring instrument yielded an overall Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.97. Statistically significant differences were found between line management's and HR practitioners' views in respect of the three strategic business objectives. Practical/managerial implications: The results suggested that HR management was not yet fully aligned in respect of strategic business objectives and of becoming a strategic business partner. Contribution/value-add: The study therefore suggested that the HC BRidge TM framework can be used as a method to connect human capital processes with business strategy to leverage business results and to demonstrate value-add.

J	Mesa, W				Mesa, William			The composition of intellectual capital in non-profit orchestras	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL			English	Article						Intellectual capital; Music industry; Non-profit organizations; Working practices; Knowledge management	KNOWLEDGE; ORGANIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; INTANGIBLES; MANAGEMENT; CAPABILITY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explain how intellectual capital (IC) is enacted and used in non-profit symphony orchestras from an organisational behaviour perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a nine-month case study on two community-based non-profit orchestras. The method uses field observations, interviews, factor analysis, and visual models in explaining how IC is connected to organisational practices. Findings - IC is perhaps best understood in its context to specific organisations rather than as discrete items that are allocated. Research limitations/implications - The case study is limited to non-profit orchestras based on an organisational behaviour perspective. The results, however, invite further research into how IC is used as a resource towards strategic planning. Practical implications - The study results point towards managing IC resources, given that they are grounded in actions and practices of the organisation. Questions of "how" (how is IC used?) drive the study versus questions of "what" (identification of IC)." Originality/value -Understanding IC as context-dependent provides management guidance to NPO orchestras for improving volunteer participation, motivation, and meeting personal goals.

The data was collected using a mail survey to top management of listed companies in Malaysia. The results show that SPMS makes a significant contribution with organisational competitive advantage and capabilities. However, diagnostic use is not significantly associated with organisational capabilities. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge by showing the role of SPMS from the perspective of the resource-based view theory and levers of control framework. The findings acknowledge that SPMS can be an indirect source for competitive advantage through its ability to enhance organisational capabilities.

J	Park-Poaps, H				Park-Poaps, Haesun			Public pressure against sweat shops as perceived by top-management of apparel and footwear companies	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Garment industry; Labour; Corporate image; Social responsibility; Public opinion; United States of America		Purpose - Public pressure has been recognized as one of the most forceful factors underlying change in sweat shop conditions in the industry. The purpose of this study is to investigate the level of public pressure perceived by top managers of US clothing and footwear firms and to examine effects of individual and organizational factors that may differentiate the level of perception. Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained through a mail survey, with a total of 96 cases included in the analyses. Findings - Results of a series of t-tests revealed statistically significant influence of firm size, tenure, and firm ownership type on perceived public pressure for fair labor practices, while gender, age, education, business type, and percentage of foreign- sourced merchandise were not found to be statistically significantly related to perceptions of public pressure. Research limitations/implications - The findings warn that the current public pressure is toward certain types of firms and their managements. Small and private firms that form the majority of the clothing and footwear sector need to be exposed to the pressure. Data consisted of a portion from a larger scale survey and may not represent a random sample. Further investigations could identify top-management's strategic actions and social performance of the firm as a response to such pressure. Originality/value - Managerial perception of social pressure is likely to initiate social actions undertaken by the firms. The findings of the study produced valuable further discussions on the current states and directions of managerial reactions to the sweat shop issues.

Kinetics of Hot Deformation in Mg/Nano-Al2O3 Composite	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						hot deformation; metal-matrix composite; nano-dispersion; rate-controlling mechanisms; prior-particle boundaries	MECHANISMS; TEXTURE; CREEP; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR	The hot deformation behavior of extruded Mg/nano-Al2O3 composite has been studied in the temperature and strain rate ranges of 300-500 degrees C and 0.0003-10s(-1). In the lower strain rate regime (<0.1 s(-1)), the apparent activation energy evaluated is much higher than that for lattice self-diffusion. At higher strain rates, the behavior of the composite is similar to that of the matrix material and is controlled by grain boundary self diffusion. The prior particle boundaries in the composite, which are decorated by the nano-alumina particles, are stable and only kink under compression parallel to the extrusion direction.	[Prasad, Y. V. R.

J	Ryu, JH; Lee, HJ; Sunwoo, MH				Ryu, J-H; Lee, H-J; Sunwoo, M-H			An electric powertrain modelling of a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle and development of a power distribution algorithm using H-infinity control	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING			English	Article						fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle; state space model; power distribution; robust H-infinity controller	MANAGEMENT; DESIGN	This paper presents an electric powertrain model of a parallel-type fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) and its robust H-infinity controller for efficient power distribution between a fuel cell and a battery. The electric powertrain of the parallel-type FCHEV is composed of a fuel cell stack system, a d.c.-to-d.c. converter, and a battery. The fuel cell stack system is connected to the battery through the d.c.-to-d.c. converter, which is a key component for power distribution between the fuel cell and the battery. In this study, the electric powertrain model of the FCHEV was derived from the dynamic differential equations of the equivalent-circuit model that describes the electric powertrain. Using this model, the robust H-infinity controller was designed to control the power distribution between the fuel cell and the battery efficiently. Finally, the results of driving-cycle simulation verified the performance of the proposed robust H-infinity controller.

Strategic invasion: response of the voluntary nonprofit to strategic processes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Strategic planning; Non-profit organizations; Organizational behaviour	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the encounter between the voluntary nonprofit organization (VNPO) and the strategic process in order to study how these organizations may harness strategic processes in a way that somehow does not threaten their cultures and social mission. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts an exploratory case study approach. Findings - The case study identifies a set of complex, multi-faceted behaviors that serve a dual role, functioning simultaneously as both inhibitors and enablers of the strategic process. As a framework for future research, the paper proposes a two-dimensional scheme which models the scope and mode of organizational behavior in a strategic process. The case study indicates that VNPOs may tend to adopt what is classified as a "sectional-organic" pattern of response. This pattern of response balances the organization's needs for continuity and change, enabling the execution of the process in a manner compatible with the specific organizational characteristics of the VNPO. Originality/value - Previous studies of strategic processes in the VNPO have reported resistance and partial, stunted processes, stemming from the organization's need to protect its mission-oriented identity from the threats posed by a strategic process. However, the results of this case study, in which the subject organization managed to successfully develop an effective strategic plan, suggest that the behavior pattern of the VNPO in a strategic process may not be strictly defensive.

J	Simpson, K; Bretherton, P				Simpson, Ken; Bretherton, Phil			Reconciling Expert Advice and Community Opinion in a Local Government Strategic Planning Process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						local government; strategic planning; community consultation; tourism	CONSULTATION; GOVERNANCE	This article proposes that the eventual outcomes of local government strategic policy deliberations can often reflect the interplay between "expert" administrative staff, democratically elected politicians, and the community they jointly serve. A multi-site case study approach, to examine the generation of local government strategy related to a niche economic activity concludes that broadly conceptualized opinion congruence can sometimes be threatened by substantial pockets of stakeholder vested interest. As such, "expert" and "political" opinion reflects a caution based on both historical experience and political expediency; while community opinion displays an optimism based on eager anticipation of an unknown future.

J	Yeo, RK; Ajam, MY				Yeo, Roland K.; Ajam, Moktar Y.			Technological development and challenges in strategizing organizational change	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Communication technologies; Organizational change; Leadership; Management strategy; Malaysia	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; PERSISTENCE; GOVERNMENT; DISCOURSE; MOMENTUM; POWER; ICT	Purpose - This paper aims to examine the role of information technology (IT) as part of an "electronic government" (EG) initiative in the Sabah State Public Administration, and explores its influences on organizational strategy, structure, leadership, and performance after ten years of implementation. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative methodology was utilized involving in-depth interviewing with 18 subjects. Three subgroups constituted the sample, including department heads, senior officers, and IT officers. An interview protocol was developed and refined through a pilot study. Triangulation of data involving unobtrusive observation and archival records was employed. Content analysis was performed. Findings - The strategic direction of the organization has taken on a much broader dimension with long-term consideration. Social structures have been created and power relations distributed where the conventional view of leadership has been redefined with IT being used as a buffer between authority and compliance. "EG" has led to positive intangible outcomes although people's resistance to change is still a fundamental concern. Research limitations/implications - "EG" has led to a proliferation of how information is to be used, disseminated, and retained. A socio-cognitive perspective of change processes will yield useful insights into the interrelation between unlearning and relearning. Arguably, entrenched behavior is one of the greatest deterrents to change. Practical implications - Understanding the behavioral and motivational aspects of individuals in change processes will help organizational leaders to consider practices and policies that facilitate change as a consequence of disruption to routines and comfort zones. A key management decision is the role of distributed power and authority that create a renewed sense of empowerment on employees. Originality/value - The focus of the paper is not entirely on IT; it brings to light a paradigm deemed critical for cross-boundary exposure and competition in a developing country. Especially, in Sabah state where there are rural areas to which the public administration needs to reach out, "EG" becomes as much a vision as a tool.

J	Ryu, S; Lee, JG; Kim, KH				Ryu, Seewon; Lee, Jae-Gook; Kim, Kyung-Hee			Current State of u-Health and Its Developmental Strategies in Korea	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			Korean	Article						u-Health; Undeserved population; Accessibility; Efficiency; Effectiveness		U-Health based on ubiquitous information and communication network is being considered as an alternative to the mainstream face-to-face healthcare services in addition to its supportive functions. Traditional healthcare system has inherent problems such as limited accessibility and inadequate fulfillment of service needs to the underserved populations. Proponents of u-Health suggest that it will provide solutions to those problems. There have been many trials and pilot projects for telemedicine since 1988 in Korea, and the system is now called "u-Health". After legislation of clause regarding telehealth in the Korean medical law in 2002, local governments have made several attempts to utilize u-Health system to the patients with chronic disease living in rural under-served area. Recently, Korean government has implemented u-Health trial projects about telemedicine, monitoring chronic disease, and providing homecare in the three underserved rural and many-islands area. Patients' perceived level of satisfaction, preference, attitude, and usability of u-Health was significantly high. Patient's compliance to u-Health has improved over time. A strategic approach based on the innovative and proactive mindset to the u-Health is strongly needed. At the time of u-Health implementation in the medically underserved area, utilization of both u-Health center and mobile clinic is recommended to achieve operational efficiency, and ensure high quality of service. Although u-Health is effective and supportive method to the mainstream face-to-face healthcare, we should be cautious, since u-Health model needs more development and more rigorous experiments.

J	Roy, K; Chen, Z; Crawford, CAG				Roy, Kakoli; Chen, Zhuo (Adam); Crawford, Carol A. Gotway			Economic Perspective on Strategic Human Capital Management and Planning for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						human capital management; personnel economics	ORGANIZATIONS; INCENTIVES; GENDER; MOTIVATION; PROMOTIONS; PRIVATE	An organization's workforce-or human capital-is its most valuable asset. The 2002 President's Management Agenda emphasizes the importance of strategic human capital management by requiring all federal agencies to improve performance by enhancing personnel and compensation systems. In response to these directives, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) drafted its strategic human capital management plan to ensure that it is aligned strategically to support the agency's mission and its health protection goals. In this article, we explore the personnel economics literature to draw lessons from research studies that can help CDC enhance its human capital management and planning. To do so, we focus on topics that are of practical importance and empirical relevance to CDC's internal workforce and personnel needs with an emphasis on identifying promising research issues or methodological approaches. The personnel economics literature is rich with theoretically sound and empirically rigorous approaches for shaping an evidence-based approach to human capital management that can enhance incentives to attract, retain, and motivate a talented federal public health workforce, thereby promoting the culture of high-performance government.

THE BRITISH ISLES NETWORK OF EXPERT CENTRES: A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO THE DIGITAL ARTS AND HUMANITIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES AND ARTS COMPUTING-A JOURNAL OF DIGITAL HUMANITIES			English	Article						NoC; ICT Network of Expert Centres; Digital Resources; Sustainability		The UK's Network of Expert Centres: A collaborative approach to the digital arts and humanities. A Network of Expert Centres has been recently been established with a broad mission to facilitate exchange of expertise and outreach across the community of practice engaged in all aspects of digital arts and humanities research and scholarship, including practice-led research; and to promote and facilitate engagement with digital methodologies within the broader research community. Areas of interest and expertise of members include data creation, curation, preservation, management (including rights and legal issues), access and dissemination, and methodologies of data use and re-use. Its membership is open to all such Centres in Great Britain and Ireland. Since the demise of the Arts and Humanities Data Service and the AHRC ICT Methods Network, there has been no centralized supporting infrastructure and co-oordination of activity in this area. While the Network is by no means a substitute for these services, it will provide a much-needed focus and community resource for all aspects of the digital arts and humanities, including digital tools, projects and methods, as well as data management and sustainability. The Network will also provide greater visibility for publicly funded research projects in this area. The Network's mission is to advocate, promote and raise awareness and understanding of the use of ICT in research and scholarship in arts and humanities. It will take an active role in developing the scholarly communication agenda in relation to all aspects of digital publications, and outputs. Publications and outputs developed by members will be disseminated via the community resource, arts-humanities. net, which will support the development and exchange of expertise, knowledge, standards and good practice. The Network will also identify and represent the needs of the research community in this key strategic area, and conduct dialogue with relevant stakeholders including funders, libraries, and those engaged in teaching and research in related disciplines. This article sets out the background to the establishment of the Network, its structure and plans for future development.

This paper explores the policy process for the reforms. A case study method was used and, to assist this, a conceptual framework was developed. Analysis of four initiatives indicated that there were deviations from the government guidelines and that the policy processes used were weak. The progress of different reforms was affected by a variety of factors: the immaturity of the political process and civil society, which together with innate conservatism and resistance to change on the part of the bureaucracy resulted in weak strategic sectoral leadership and a lack of clear purpose underpinning the reforms. It also resulted in weaknesses in preparation of the detail of reforms leading to poor implementation. The study suggests a need for broadening the stakeholders' base, building the capacity of policy-makers in policy analysis and strengthening the institutional basis of policymaking bodies.

J	Schroeder, A; Fang, YL; Lee, BY				Schroeder, Andreas; Fang, Yulin; Lee, Bryan			Managing Knowledge in a Business Intelligence Consulting Project	PACIFIC ASIA JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Knowledge management; project management; knowledge risk		IT projects require diverse knowledge resources, which need to be accessed, created, and shared. The lack of these knowledge resources or their inappropriate management is one of the main sources of project delays and even failure. The present case describes the situation of a challenging, but to some extent typical, business intelligence (BI) implementation project at Hong Kong International Airport. The case highlights the diverse knowledge-based challenges encountered during the implementation of the BI system and its implications for the further development of the project. The case is designed to introduce students to Reich's (2007) knowledge-based risk framework, which allows for a systematic analysis of knowledge-related issues in IT project environments. As knowledge has become a critical source of both short-and long-term competitive advantage for international enterprises (Fang et al. 2007), the analysis points to the diverse knowledge-based issues as the root causes of several problems the project is facing and indicates the complexity surrounding these knowledge issues. Extensive background information on the strategic position of the Hong Kong Airport and the potential role of BI technology provide the basis for further discussion and additional analyses.

J	Naicker, V; Saungweme, P				Naicker, Visvanathan; Saungweme, Percy			Strategic alliance governance in Zimbabwe policy and strategy	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic alliances; governance; trust; networks		Worldwide interest in strategic alliances has increased dramatically partly because of their potential to expand firms operations in the short run. Among the many issues posed by the increasing interest in strategic alliances, this paper focuses specifically on the dynamics associated with the governance of strategic alliance relationships. Furthermore, due to the constant deterioration of the Zimbabwean economy and the resultant heightened customer expectations, Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have to enter into collaborative relationships which involve a high level of trust, goal alignment and commitment. The research used a multi-method field approach to gather, information on strategic alliances and corporate governance from 50 strategic alliance relationships from a wide spectrum of firms in a variety of industries in Zimbabwe. Ultimately, this paper identifies four critical governance areas into a framework for strategic alliance governance. The advent of the Internet has increased the ease of application or collaboration to form strategic alliances. Factors such as increased competition because of easier market entry, speed of data, and demanding customer requirements are necessitating a revolutionary change in the way that SMEs are managed. The struggling economy of Zimbabwe provides a platform that enables SMEs to extend their alliances to its suppliers thereby forming dynamic industrial districts. These factors, shared with an eagerness to contribute towards information and technology flow, will enable an efficient alliance thereby responding to the needs of customers.

This article reviews the main contributing factors to BPR success using a framework that considers culture, structure, technology and resource. Eight Taiwanese case studies are used to explore issues contributing to, or impeding, successful process re-engineering in small firms. The analysis shows that BPR success is empowered by innovation, employee empowerment, top management commitment and strategic direction and is dependent upon customer relations, IS involvement and financial resources.

Organizations are faced with unpredictable changes in new technologies, products and marketplaces but it is noteworthy that they can prepare themselves to face such changes and this readiness results in competitive advantages. This article aims at introducing a method that enables organizations to draw up robust strategies in uncertain situations and leads to formulation of strategies to immunize them against environmental changes. The proposed method has combined 'scenario planning method' and 'fuzzy inference system' with traditional strategic planning by adopting a new and creative approach. Using the values of uncertain factors in the external environment, this method designs some probable forthcoming scenarios of the organization and then based on fuzzy information described by experts for fuzzy inference systems, defines a robust strategy to deal with the designed scenarios and assists managers in their evaluations of future environment.

Background and Purpose: B-10 deriving from B-10-para-boronophenylalanine (BPA) and B-10-borocaptate sodium (BSH) have been detected in blood samples of patients undergoing boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) using prompt gamma ray spectrometer or Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) method, respectively. However. the concentration of cacti compound cannot be ascertained because boron atoms in both molecules are the target in these assays. Here, we propose a simple and rapid method to measure only BPA by detecting fluorescence based on the characteristics of phenylalanine. Material and Methods; B-10 concentrations of blood samples from human or mice were estimated by the fluorescence intensities at 275 nm of a BPA excited by light of wavelength 257 run using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. Results: The relationship between fluorescence to increased BPA concentration showed a positive linear con-elation. Moreover, we established an adequate condition for BPA measurement in blood samples containing BPA, and the estimated B-10 concentrations of blood samples derived from BPA treated mice were similar between the values obtained by our method and those by ICP method. Conclusions This new assay will be useful to estimate BPA concentration in blood samples obtained from patients Undergoing BNCT especially in a combination use of BSH and BPA.

It was designed by applying the five basic management principles to reach success in business. These principles, along with survival principles in the activity, delineated the features of the MDA System. It can be characterized as a strategic system which targets the ends from start, that is, the definition, a prior, of targets and deadlines is a primary condition to carry out any task. Therefore, there is a need to measure and follow up procedures. If results are not reached, questions must be placed on the training offered to employees or on the methods utilized, but never on the people. Moreover, all people interested in the business must have their expectations met shareholders, customers, employees and the society.

Paramedic-led prehospital thrombolysis is safe and effective: the East Anglian experience	EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL			English	Article							ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION; PRIMARY ANGIOPLASTY; MORTALITY; TIME; FIBRINOLYSIS; REPERFUSION; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	Introduction: Prehospital thrombolysis has been shown to improve patient outcomes in clinical trials and this has been confirmed in the ongoing large national myocardial infarction registry (Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project; MINAP) reports. This paper describes a system to improve the delivery of prehospital thrombolysis and the associated governance requirements to gain maximum patient benefit. Methods: Demographic data were prospectively collected on all patients treated by the East Anglian Ambulance Trust with bolus thrombolytics for a presumed diagnosis of ST elevation myocardial infarction between November 2003 and February 2007. Survival status was determined from the NHS strategic tracing service. Results: 1062 patients (mean age 64.0 years (SD 10.6), 795 men) were treated in this time period. There were 71 deaths in this group, with actuarial survival of 93.9% (SE 0.9%) at 30 days, 91.7% (SE 1.0%) at 6 months and 90.8% (SE 1.1%) at 12 months after treatment. Age and cardiac arrest were most strongly associated with mortality (both p < 0.001). Twelve (1.2%) patients received thrombolysis that on review was considered inappropriate. There were no deaths in this subgroup. Conclusions: Prehospital thrombolysis can be administered safely by ambulance staff supported by a Trust clinical support system with excellent clinical outcomes.	[Khan, S.

J	Mathrani, S; Viehland, D				Mathrani, Sanjay; Viehland, Dennis			BUSINESS BENEFITS FROM ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION IN SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Enterprise System (ES); Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Business Benefits; Implementation Practices; Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)	ERP; ADOPTION	The market for enterprise systems (ESs) continues to grow as business becomes increasingly global and competitive. Increasingly, the market focus for ES vendors is on small businesses. The purpose of this study is to provide a unique ES vendor/consultant perspective on (a) the business benefits small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) expect from their ES investment and (b) to examine current practices of ES implementation in SMEs through a conceptual framework that considers the organisational, process and strategic context of the implementation. This study does so with interview data collected from ES vendors, ES consultants and IT research firms, who are the key players in the New Zealand ES industry. A distinctive contribution of this research is the vendor/consultant perspective as the unit of analysis, rather than the SME perspective commonly used in similar research. The vendor/consultant perspective offers a comprehensive viewpoint that extends across numerous SMEs in a variety of industries. Findings from interviews with these professionals indicate that although many ES implementations are several years old now, SMEs have only recently started tracking benefits through analytical processes in expectation to realise business value from their ES investment. The results also identify how ES implementation practices are adapting to be more suitable to the SME sector, an important market for ES vendors given the saturation of the large enterprise market for ES implementation.

The intervention addressed known and persistent inequities in influenza vaccination among African American and Latino older adults, and associated infections, hospitalizations and mortality. It was designed to increase resident ability to make informed decisions about vaccination, and to build internal and external infrastructure to support sustainability over time. The intervention brought a group of social scientists, vaccine researchers, geriatricians, public health nurses, elder services providers and advocates together with senior housing management and activist African American and Latino residents living in public senior housing in a small east coast city. Two buildings of equal size and similar ethnic composition were randomized as intervention and control buildings. Pre and post intervention surveys were conducted in both buildings, measuring knowledge, attitudes and peer norms. Processes and outcomes were documented at four levels: Influenza Strategic Alliance (macro and exo levels), building management (meso level), building resident committee (meso level) and individual residents. The Influenza Strategic Alliance (I.S.A.) provided ongoing resources, information and vaccine; the building management provided economic and other in-kind resources and supported residents to continue flu clinics in the building. The V.I.P. Resident Committee conducted flu campaigns with flu clinics in English and Spanish. The vaccination rate in the intervention building at post test exceeded the study goal of 70% and showed a significant improvement over the control building. The intervention achieved desired outcomes at all four levels and resulted in a significant increase in influenza vaccination, and improvements in pro-vaccination knowledge, beliefs, and understanding of health consequences.

J	Witthaus, G				Witthaus, Gabrielle			The Implications of SCORM Conformance for Workplace eLearning	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING			English	Article						learning design; SCORM conformance; LMS; LCMS; learning objects; e-learning 2.0		This paper explores the impact that SCORM conformance has had on workplace e-learning. The author describes a project in which she was requested to "repurpose" some materials that had originally been designed for the face-to-face teaching of English as a Foreign Language, into SCORM conformant e-learning materials. The rationale for this request was that the training centre management wanted to track learners' progress via a Learning Management System (LMS). However, in order to integrate SCORM-conformant tracking functionality into the programmes, the learning materials would have to have been stripped of all the collaborative, productive and communicative aspects of their pedagogy. The learning designers and training centre management had to engage in a steep learning curve to find an alternative solution that was both pedagogically sound and administratively efficient. This anecdote highlights some of the challenges facing the corporate sector in terms of the management of e-learning content. To put the issues into context, the paper gives an overview of SCORM, and defines some related terminology -Sharable Content Objects (SCOs), LMS and Learning Content Management System (LCMS). SCORM conformance has two main aims: the ability to deliver content on any Learning Management System, and the ability to track learners' actions and scores when they use the materials. It is argued that, while the higher education sector has chosen to emphasise the first aim, focusing more on the development of stimulating learning content that can be shared across disciplines and across institutions, the corporate sector has emphasised the second aim, focusing more on tracking learners' progress through learning programmes. It is suggested that this is one of the explanations for the continued proliferation of relatively rigid, behaviourist style teaching materials for workplace e-learning. This instructivist style pedagogical model is considered in relation to the military and programming origins of SCORM, and a number of more innovative approaches to workplace e-learning from the recent literature are discussed. The paper concludes by arguing that, for corporate e-learning programmes to be successful, all stakeholders need to be included in the strategic decisions, and all stakeholders need to engage in a learning process to understand each others' points of view and explore the available options and their consequences. This study will be of value to anyone who needs to develop SCORM conformant courses, as well as managers who are charged with overseeing such projects, or developing an organisational training strategy involving an LMS/ LCMS.

J	Bradbury, J; Clark, J				Bradbury, Jill; Clark, Jude			The Millennium Development Goalposts: Researching the Score on and off the Field	JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The United Nations' Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) work in pervasive and powerful ways in the international imagination, by naturalising a strategic set of goals, indicators and targets, and in doing so, either opening up, or precluding and prescribing particular possibilities for understanding the state of the world and people's experiences. Our departure point for exploring the need for alternative research routes is therefore an engagement with the conceptualisation of 'development', the hopeful product of the 2015 target. This conceptual critique is three-fold: 1. There is a slippage in the discourse of the MDGs between 'poverty', 'health' and 'development' and consequently, the relations between different goals are poorly theorised. 2. There is an absence (or extreme paucity) of structural analysis. 3. While people are surely the centre of the developmental goals, in their formulation there is a remarkable absence both of specific groups of people and any conceptualisation of personhood in a more universal human sense. An alternative framework for understanding development and the relations between structure and agency is explored by theorising the themes of gender, national identity and childhood/youth. We then suggest that narrative methodologies may offer a productive research trajectory.

J	Emanuelson, P; Willer, D				Emanuelson, Pamela; Willer, David			One-shot exchange networks and the shadow of the future	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Networks; Exchange; Weak power; Suboptimal; Iterated; One-shot	PRISONERS-DILEMMA; EFFECTIVE CHOICE; POWER	From the Prisoner's Dilemma and other games, it is well known that strategy selection in one-shot games can be very different from that in iterated games. Because exchange structures were studied only as iterated games, whether one-shot structures differ was not known. Nor have exchange theories previously considered whether events in structures Would be different if studied as one-shot games. This paper offers new theory to predict one-shot exchange structures and one-shot experiments to test that theory. As predicted, the experiments found that processes and Outcomes of one-shot exchange structures are quite different from those of iterated exchange structures. For example, certain relations that are strategically used as threats in iterated exchange Structures occur very rarely in one-shot structures. It follows that power differences in one-shot structures regress from those observed for repeated structures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Okumura, K				Okumura, Kazuhiro			The Use of Third-Party Review to Reduce Health and Environmental Hazards from Surfactants and Cleaning Products in the Janitorial Industry	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article								The demand for environmentally preferable products is increasing in the area of Institutional and Industrial (I&I) cleaners. The GreenBlue Institute (GreenBlue) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA's) Design for Environment (DfE) launched two programs to review surfactant ingredients and final cleaning products, with the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) conducting third-party reviews. The Local Hazardous Waste Management Program (LHWMP) in King County, Washington, has a strategic goal to reduce the risk of exposure of hazardous chemicals to vulnerable populations such as janitorial workers. This report summarizes the NSF partnership with GreenBlue, CleanGredients, and U.S. EPA's DfE to perform third-party reviews of cleaning product ingredients and its relevance to LHWMP's interest in reducing risks to workers in the janitorial industry, Due to information barriers, workers in the janitorial industry are at risk daily to these hazardous chemicals. The surfactant and formulator review program will make positive contributions towards the reduction of toxic chemical exposure to the employees of the janitorial industry. With proper communication and an increased use of less toxic cleaners, exposures to vulnerable populations can be reduced.

J	Schumann, C; Schultheiss, D				Schumann, Christina; Schultheiss, Daniel			Power and nerves of steel or thrill of adventure and patience? An empirical study on the use of different video game genres	JOURNAL OF GAMING AND VIRTUAL WORLDS			English	Article						video games; genres; uses and gratifications; restrictions; capacities; player skills		This empirical study focuses on explaining the utilization of three video game genres - first person shooters, strategy games and role-playing games - and on whether different explanatory models can be established for the three genres. A model comprising the three explanatory components, gratifications sought (GS), gratifications obtained (GO) and subjective restrictions or capacities, operationalized by the skills that players have to have for the specific genres, serves as a theoretical basis. Data was collected by way of an online survey (N = 5,257). The results show that GO and the capacities are particularly suited to explaining the use of video games. While GO generally seem to offer a basis for explaining the use of video games, since the dimensions 'power and competition' and 'thrill of adventure' do influence the use of all three genres, there were considerable differences between the individual genres in terms of capacities. Gamers who have a high stress threshold and quick reactions, as well as a good sense of direction, tend to prefer first person shooters. The use of strategy games may be explained in terms of skills like logic and strategic thought. On the other hand, patient gamers prefer role-playing games. The explanatory power of GS, however, proves to be extremely low. Based on these results, approaches are discussed for further research in this field.

It takes into consideration (1) structural changes in the future (e.g. depopulation), (2) regional characteristics of societies (e.g. large urban, small to intermediate urban, and mountainous areas), (3) effects of the earthquakes occurring in a time-lagged manner, and (4) disaster images of individual areas hit by earthquakes occurring in a time lagged manner (e.g. disruption to social systems and effects on zero-meter areas) in order to show the research frameworks for "Tokai, Tonankai, and Nankai earthquake linkage evaluation, Sub-project 2-(4) Disaster Response and a long term recovery strategies reflecting regional and societal characteristics in the future." As the results of sorting out those issues, following things were pointed out. 1) Present frame work for disaster management for Tokai, Tonankai, and Nankai earthquakes does not count on the issues resulting from time lagged occurrence of those earthquakes, 2) According to depopulation in Japan, exposure to those earthquakes will reduced, 3) in western part of Japan, the time lagged occurrence would be worst-case scenario, and in eastern part of Japan, the simultaneous occurrence would be the worst, 4) Tsunami inundation would make serious problems for recovery in under sea level area, where the recovery work starts from un-watering the area, 5) analytical frame work on the long term recovery strategies based on "Program Evaluation" scheme consisted from (1) Assessment of need for the program, Assessment of Program Design and Theory, Assessment of program process and implementation, Assessment of program outcome/impact, Assessment of program cost and efficiency.

The objective of this study was to determine if branches in black spruce are uniformly distributed around the stem at the tree, log, and whorl levels with respect to branch size. Branch size limits were selected to reflect the largest branch per whorl and knot size limits were established by visual grading rules for 2 x 3 and 2 X 4 dimension lumber. Using Rayleigh's test of uniformity, branches are considered to he uniformly distributed around the stem for all branch size limits: between 40 and 80% at the free level, over 70% at the log level, and virtually 100% at the whorl level. The findings of this study indicate that a simple random assignment (from a uniform distribution) of branches around the stem within each whorl is sufficient to properly describe branch location within black spruce tree growth models.

The bioreactors for 3D tissues systems could be an advantageous alternative in terms of low contamination risk, easiness of handling and scaling-up. A careful and strategic design of these equipments provides a better process control and a safe and reproducible production of tissue construct. They can offer the technical means to perform controlled studies aimed to understanding the specific biological, chemical or physical effects. An important problem that has to be solved is the bioreactors scalability of the technology in mammalian systems. A cell line development process, carried on bioreactors, should be well defined and standardized so that areas requiring high-throughput and repetitive work can be identified.

J	Gatev, E; Ross, SA				Gatev, Evan; Ross, Stephen A.			Momentum Trading and Performance with Wrong Return Expectations	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Many long-term institutional investors use strategic portfolio allocation to maximize net asset value assuming that long-run expected returns are constant. This approach is complemented by tactical asset allocation when an asset class is perceived to offer higher expected returns in the short run. When investment performance is evaluated in the interim, it can be difficult to assess the merit of private beliefs about changing expected returns. The authors examine the annual expected return and dynamic trading under wrong assumptions about time-varying expected returns and show that a misspecified portfolio policy can outperform the correct policy. They also find that the particular assumptions about how expected returns vary through time can be identified from observed rebalancing of a portfolio. The assumption that expected returns are changing implies that momentum trading is optimal under certain conditions. In contrast, contrarian trading is always optimal when prices are assumed to follow a random walk around a constant long-term trend. These results can inform the annual performance evaluation of institutions, such as endowments, pension plans, mutual funds, and hedge funds that have long-term investment objectives.

This bundle of policies and procedures, following the best practices in the area, intends to guide and control the IT function in order to add value to the organization and to minimize IT risks. The purpose of the research is to identify the measure in which the IT governance practices are implemented to the level of the financial institutions in Romania. The goal of this paper is a comparative analysis for implementing IT governance using data offered by the IT Governance Institute. This institute makes every year a study (IT Governance Global Status Report - 2006) to determine a sense of priorities and to develop actions for implementing IT governance, using data which acknowledges once more the need for all organizations to have tools and services to assure an efficient IT governance. In this way, the research will analyze, in the field of Romanian financial institutions, the most serious IT problems pointed out by the respondents from the last year, the most efficient measures considered by top management for resolving problems pointed out, the best used practices in IT governance and the most used frameworks for implementing IT governance practices.

Moreover, the market growth potential and size across the Formosa Strait are significant. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in Export Choice (EC) software, we find that the top ten KSF in the TV shopping industry across the Formosa Strait are somewhat different in order of importance and in the content. Managers in Taiwan consider watching habit, income, age, occupation, product positioning strategy, channel releasing policy, education, differential pricing, target product strategy and strategic sensitivity as the top ten KSF in order of importance.

J	Aarseth, W; Sorhaug, HC				Aarseth, Wenche; Sorhaug, Hans Christian			Improving business performance in multi-company projects through 'cooperative power': presentation of a collaborative tool model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business strategy; business performance management; strategic alliances; project management; stakeholder performance; stakeholder relationship; collaboration; partnerships		Increasing global competition drives most industries to search for competitive advantages and continuous process improvement. Through a three-year research project we found that the competitive advantage of multi-company projects lies in the ability to make a shift from the competitiveness and performance of the autonomous firm to the competitiveness and performance of the value chain of firms. Nearly all important indicators and measurements of profit and efficiency were linked to the performance of the firm and the traditional business worldview strongly emphasises competitive power. There is little mention of the flip side of the coin, which is cooperative power. The purpose of this paper is to improve business performance in projects by understanding the concept 'cooperative power' and what conditions influence projects organisational problems. As we found no literature on how to practically implement cooperative power, we developed a practical model which companies can use in projects in the future to improve performance. The empirical results are based on an extensive literature study, interviews, project presentations and focus group work in 14 companies.

J	Aluchna, M				Aluchna, Maria			Implementation of best practice code: practical implications from the Warsaw Stock Exchange	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Corporate governance; Best practice; Stock exchanges; Poland		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the best practice initiative in Poland, presenting codes formulated in 2002 and 2005 and focusing on the recent document known asBest Practice of WSE Listed Companies. Moreover, the paper aims to present practical aspects of implementation of new code between January and April 2008. Design/methodology/approach - The paper identifies the guidelines recommended in three versions of the Warsaw Stock Exchange code of best practice. Additionally it discusses companies' doubts and questions addressed to the Warsaw Stock Exchange, analyzes technical challenges referring to new system of reporting on companies compliance as well as raises some concerns regarding the content of the new code. Findings - The paper shows that the codes of best practice attempted to address the most problematic issues of transitional Polish corporate governance. The recommendations content was adopted during the last eight years as the response to the changes in market environment and governance challenges. However, the new code addresses mostly the strategic plans of the Warsaw Stock Exchange rather than the corporate needs and its implementation and communication with listed companies leaves a lot of room for improvement. Practical implications - The analysis addresses the needs for coherence between the crucial moments of development of corporate governance and the code of best practice. Moreover, it points out potential shortcomings in the process of the code implementation. Originality/value - The paper is based on the documents prepared by the Warsaw Stock Exchange, companies remarks as well as author's experience of working at the Stock Exchange during the first three months of 2008 code implementation.

J	Aubke, F				Aubke, Florian			Relating Cognitive Preferences to Study Approaches of Hospitality and Tourism Students	JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN TRAVEL & TOURISM			English	Article						MBTI; temperament; learning approach; learning preference; academic performance	PERSONALITY; INTELLIGENCE; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTORS; SUCCESS; STYLES	The objective of this study was to develop an understanding of the relatedness of personality constructs and study approaches with a view to enhancing the student learning experience and, in consequence, improving academic performance. For this, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was applied for measure of cognitive preferences and the Approaches to Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) for measure of approaches to study. The profile of psychological types in the sample was found to replicate previous studies, suggesting a distinctness of hospitality and tourism students in terms of their cognitive preferences. Correlations were found between the SJ temperament and a preference for the "Strategic Approach" to studying, which, in addition, led to better academic performance. The results suggest that the learning outcome for a subject needs to be clearly defined and that the acknowledgment of distinct temperaments and study approaches can help foster efficacious teaching modes that discourage surface learning and yield qualitatively better learning experiences.

J	Bhaskaran, S; Jenkins, H				Bhaskaran, Suku; Jenkins, Helen			Case study of processing firm-distributor firm outsourcing alliance	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Distribution management; Outsourcing; Strategic alliances; Joint ventures; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Supply chain management	FOOD; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; LOGISTICS; ISSUES; TRUST	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss a distribution outsourcing alliance between a small-to-medium scale food processor and a national distributor of frozen and chilled food products. The paper discusses the influence of market dynamics, core and differentiated competencies and strategic intents on alliance formation and operations in the small-to-medium scale food enterprise sector. Design/methodology/approach - The dyadic relationship of a small-to-medium scale food processor and its distributor is investigated through reviewing past studies of processor-distributor alliances, conducting in-depth face-to-face interviews with senior managers in both firms, and reviewing documents and correspondence between the firms. Findings - The partners do not complement their core and differentiate competencies to achieve greater customer value creation through a joint enterprise business model. The alliance focuses pre-eminently on short-term sales development and cost savings targets. Non-achievement of these targets adversely influences partners' trust and commitment to the alliance. A significant strength of the alliance is its capacity to identify customer needs and use this knowledge to speedily develop and introduce new products. In its present form this alliance is unsustainable. The partners should adopt a new philosophy and vision to pursue an alliance that will use their core and differentiated competencies more effectively. Research limitations/implications - To generalise the findings and inform theory building, the research has to be replicated in other businesses and market environments. The findings are specific to the market environment and strategies of a single small-to-medium scale food processor and a single national distributor of frozen and chilled foods. Multi-case studies in multi-contexts (capturing varying sizes of business, industry sectors, target market segments, competitive environments and market environments) have to be completed to enable generalisation and theory building. Practical implications - This paper demonstrates the disadvantages of pursuing distribution outsourcing alliances with a short-term and enterprise level perspective. The case study provides real life evidence of the benefits of pursuing distribution outsourcing alliances based on a joint enterprise philosophy. Originality/value - This paper contributes to knowledge on distribution outsourcing alliances, a topic that several recent studies have identified as not having been explored in great detail in extant supply chain studies.

J	Blomquist, T; Wilson, TL				Blomquist, Tomas; Wilson, Timothy L.			On productivity in project organizations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Productivity rates; Project management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at the underlying unit cost considerations in project conduct at the firm level and an established business unit concept is extended to multi-project organizations. The approach and background are described along with apparent implications. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology developed by Gold is extended to cover multi-project organizations. The adaptation of the productivity network is demonstrated using a hypothetical case. Findings - The focus of the paper is on demonstrating an approach. Generally, productivity in an organization is found not to be dictated by a single input, but by the multiplicative outcome of each together. In particular, the number of projects handled each year appears to be of strategic importance in productivity. Research limitations/implications - The paper is conceptual, so applicability depends upon the nature of the particular organization to which it is applied. Implications, of course, will depend upon the degree to which actual data match the model. Practical implications - The approach permits managers to get a handle on productivity in their organizations. It is particularly attractive insofar as it largely depends upon available accounting information for input. This paper seeks to fuel greater interest and debate by practitioners and project management academics about the topic. Originality/value - Although the paper is conceptual, the authors believe that it may among the first to quantitatively treat productivity in multi-project organizations. The approach can be used to understand the productivity as well as some elements of effectiveness of multi-project organizations.

J	Bogetic, Z; Acimovic, S				Bogetic, Zoran; Acimovic, Slobodan			ECR STRATEGY - CONCEPT AND TOOLS FOR TIMES OF ECONOMIC RECESSION	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			Russian	Article						supply chain management; efficient consumer response; economic crisies		The following presentation sublimates the results of extensive studying on the causes of traditional marketing channels and supplying inefficiency and non-competitiveness and developing strategic solutions, contained in the logic of efficient consumer response. Given the recessive economic situation, as well as the current moment and the necessity of developing efficient business models, among contemporary theorists and practitioners matured awareness about necessary deeper understanding of efficient consumer response strategy, including factors of affirmation of such a business approach, as well as the elements and expected ECR effects. Economies in the Balkans, especially in the Western Balkans, in recessive times, finding themselves in phase of transition and in searching for more effective business models, and faced with European integration and intensifying competitive game, have a special need for sustainable business models that mean continuity, profitability and development. Hence the need for deeper understanding of supply chain management strategy, effective in approach of efficient response to consumers. Particular emphasis is on business philosophy, strategy and tactical steps of implementation of efficient consumer response, as a new paradigm of competitive games with successful players of the Western business world.

J	Caccia-Bava, MD; Guimaraes, VCK; Guimaraes, T				Caccia-Bava, Maria do Carmo; Guimaraes, Valerie C. K.; Guimaraes, Tor			Testing some major determinants for hospital innovation success	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Hospitals; Innovation; Change management; Strategic leadership; Project management; United States of America		Purpose - Hospitals have adopted new policies, methods and technologies to change their processes, improve services, and support other organizational changes necessary for better performance. The literature regarding the four major areas of strategic leadership, competitive intelligence, management of technology, and specific characteristics of the organization's change process propose their importance in successfully implementing organization innovation. While these factors may indeed be important to enhance hospital performance, the existing literature contains limited empirical evidence supporting their relationship to successfully implementing innovation in hospitals. This study aims to empirically test these relationships proposed in the literature by researchers in separate knowledge areas. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 223 hospitals has been used to test an integrated model of these relationships. The response rate and the representativeness of the sample in terms of hospital size and geographical location were found satisfactory. The quality assurance/compliance managers for each hospital were the target respondents to questions, which require a corporate perspective while reducing the chance of bias for questions regarding top management leadership abilities. Findings - The results provide clear evidence about the importance of strategic leadership, competitive intelligence, management of technology, and specific characteristics of the hospital's change process to the hospitals success in implementing innovation. Practical implications - Given the importance of hospitals to change their processes, improve services, and support other organizational changes necessary for better performance, a great benefit is that the main factors for successful innovation have been brought together from scattered literature and tested among hospitals. Further, the items used for measuring the main constructs provide further insights into how hospital administrators should go about developing these areas within their organizations. Originality/value - This study is a first attempt at empirically testing the importance of strategic leadership, competitive intelligence, management of technology, and specific characteristics of the hospital's change process for the success of innovation efforts.

This is because SMEs present different profiles to bigger firms and therefore they require special attention. We consider that the evolution of firms and their experience are also factors that affect the planning and managing processes of companies and their supply function, in particular. To analyze the effect of experience, we take the new ventures concept as a reference. The global sample is divided into two subsamples: 'new ventures' and 'established forms'. The implications that derive from our research, its limitations and proposals for future research are also discussed.

J	Cheong, CS; Wilson, PJ; Zurbruegg, R				Cheong, Chee Seng; Wilson, Patrick J.; Zurbruegg, Ralf			An analysis of the long-run impact of fixed income and equity market performance on Australian and UK securitised property markets	JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE			English	Article						Interest rates; Real estate; Stock markets; Australia; United Kingdom		Purpose - Given the mixed findings in the literature, this paper aims to re-examine the relationship that the securitised property market has with both the fixed income and general stock markets in the UK and Australia from July 1998 to June 2006. Design/methodology/approach - The base methodology is the cointegration procedure developed by Inoue in conjunction with the procedure developed by Johansen, Gonzalo and Granger that allows the extraction of permanent and transitory driving factors underlying cointegrated systems. In Australia both listed property trusts (LPTs) and real estate management and development companies (REMDs) are studied, while in the UK the analysis is restricted to REMDs due to the fact that real estate investment trusts were only introduced in 2007, hence providing insufficiently long series. Findings - The Inoue test reveals that ignoring structural breaks in any cointegrating system may lead to erroneous inferences. In both Australia and the UK securitised property is influenced by the general stock market in both the long-and short-term. In Australia the fixed income market does not have a permanent influence on LPTs, despite the fact that LPTs use more long-term debt than REMDs. Originality/value - A major contribution of this study clearly points to the relative weightings that portfolio managers may now consider to be appropriate vis-a-vis their holdings of bonds, equities and securitised property (under its different structures as considered here) in their portfolios for both their tactical and strategic asset allocations.

Creating the network infrastructure that enables firms and organizations to adapt to rapidly changing business needs has never been more important than now. Building the enterprise network infrastructure requires careful planning, effective design, and appropriate strategies for successful implementation. The current case study examines how a regional supermarket store chain in the retail food industry develops its enterprise network infrastructure to outperform its larger competitors. A detailed description of the evolution of the company's enterprise network infrastructure is presented to show how the strategy of network infrastructure development has aligned with the organization's growth strategy for the past two decades. The current case study highlights critical success factors for firms to build an effective enterprise network infrastructure that include IS planning firmly tied to critical business goals, strategic collaboration with technology vendors, and careful evaluation and selection of network services and technical details.

J	Clark, C; White, L				Clark, Christopher; White, Lesley			Entry barriers in retail pharmacy: a novel model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND HEALTHCARE MARKETING			English	Article						Trade barriers; Retailers; Pharmaceuticals industry; Australia		Purpose - Barriers to entry and entry deterrent strategies are widely discussed elements of the strategic literature and help define the attractiveness of an industry. The channel structure of the pharmaceutical industry, in part because of the level of regulation applicable to it, has the potential for idiosyncratic strategic behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to explore the applicability of traditional approaches to entry barriers and entry deterrence in the Australian retail pharmacy industry facing the threat of a major entry by examining the perceptions of incumbent retail pharmacists regarding the strength of potential barriers to entry into the industry, and their likely response to entry. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses both qualitative and quantitative methodology to categorise potential barriers to entry in terms of their perception by incumbent players. More than 20 in-depth interviews are conducted with a range of stakeholders and 132 retail pharmacists completed questionnaires. Findings - The paper suggests that this industry is relying on barriers which, while arguably effective, are outside the industry's control, and do not justify the apparent complacency among retail pharmacists. Practical implications - This research is of significant managerial relevance since it demonstrates that the incumbents are unprepared for potentially devastating impacts if supermarkets or other new competitors were to enter the market. Originality/value - The authors propose and utilise a novel framework for entry barrier analysis which includes the perceived locus of control for each entry barrier. The contribution of the paper is therefore in its treatment of the traditional arena of entry barriers and deterrence.

J	Fisher, SA				Fisher, Sally A.			Value management: raising CRE strategic relevance	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE			English	Article						Value analysis; Change management; Strategic alignment; Strategic alliances; Career development; Real estate		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the need to go beyond relationship management to embrace the techniques of value management with details on why and how CRE managers should pursue this as a professional goal. Design/methodology/approach - This article discusses the experiences of the author working across multiple global corporate accounts. The article advances the discussion on how to strategically align and advance the performance of CRE departments to support business change for corporate competitive advantage. Findings - As CRE managers strive to elevate their strategic relevance to the organization, they are challenged to go beyond relationship management. They are challenged to become value managers, capable of implementing corporate strategy anywhere and with anyone in the organization. Research limitations/implications - Further research is warranted into the perspectives of senior management on the contribution of CRE to the business planning process. CRE managers are often viewed as functional experts and may be overlooked as candidates for involvement in corporate management development programs. Practical implications - CRE managers, in charge of business alignment, must turn a professional corner by focusing more on driving corporate value. A career choice is required to invest in the business and financial acumen needed to sit credibly at the planning table with senior management. The career path of the in-house CRE manager is one of a general business manager, referred to in this article as a "value manager". Originality/value - CRE managers are challenged to adopt the behavior, attitude and skill set of general business managers to arrive at solutions to business challenges. These challenges are cross-functional in nature and often do not start nor end with real estate or, by extension, facilities. Thus, the role of relationship manager needs to evolve into a value manager, who possesses the skills of business planning, business case development, and cross-functional project management.

J	Gottschalk, P; Karlsen, JT				Gottschalk, Petter; Karlsen, Jan Terje			Knowledge management in law firm business	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Knowledge management; Communication technologies; Small enterprises; Lawyers; Norway		Purpose - To support knowledge work by lawyers, law firms have implemented knowledge management systems. This paper aims to present a stage model for knowledge management technology (KMT) in law firms. Design/methodology/approach - The four stages are lawyer-to-technology, lawyer-to-lawyer, lawyer-to-information and lawyer-to-application, respectively. An exploratory empirical study is carried out in law firms in Norway to determine their stage of KMT. Findings - Most surveyed law firms are at the third stage of what-they-know systems with lawyer-to-information applications. Research limitations/implications - The path of evolution through stages of growth connot not be verified with the collected survey data. Originality/value - Law firms are undergoing significant changes. They are emerging as knowledge organizations in the legal knowledge business. Knowledge is their strategic resource that must be managed to achieve profitable growth. Since knowledge resides predominantly in the heads of individuals, recruitment and development of lawyers is critical for success in law firms.

J	Jeeva, A; Dickie, C				Jeeva, Ananda; Dickie, Carolyn			Theory and Practice of Procurement Flexibility: A Model for Suppliers and Manufacturers	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT			English	Article							STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; PARADIGM; DESIGN; CHAINS	This paper is designed to extend knowledge of flexibility in manufacturing supply chains through examination of procurement entity relationships, flexibility classifications and their commonalities as used by practitioners. Data were collected from procurement, supply chain, logistics and manufacturing managers in Australian companies in 17 Standard Industry Classification categories. The research findings suggest that Australian manufacturing organisations have not sufficiently integrated their manufacturing strategies with their organisational strategies and, more importantly, suppliers to manufacturers do not have sufficient flexibility in their supply activities. One limitation pertains to the possibility that targeted respondents may not have the assumed intimate knowledge of their organisation's procurement activities, or are biased regarding their view of the quality of the organisation's procurement performance. The major contributions of the study are the development of a definition of procurement flexibility (ProcFlex), a conceptual model for use as a benchmarking tool to measure procurement flexibility, and the presentation of an integrated model of ProcFlex for use by manufacturers and their suppliers to be more responsive and increase competitive advantage.

J	Kehagias, J; Skourtis, E; Vassilikopoulou, A				Kehagias, John; Skourtis, Emmanuel; Vassilikopoulou, Aikaterini			Plaiting pricing into product categories and corporate objectives	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product specification; Pricing policy; Strategic objectives; Greece		Purpose - Using the product classification proposed by the Commodity School as it was originally expressed and later developed, this research aims to focus on defining pricing strategies for specific corporate objectives, that is, profit increase, market share increase, and prevention of new competitors from entering the market. Design/methodology/approach - In order to investigate the relationship between four consumer product categories and alternative pricing strategies in light of various corporate objectives, a set of research questions and propositions was formed and tested on the basis of data reflecting opinions expressed by marketing executives through a mailed survey in Greece. Findings - For convenience and preference products, the low-price strategy is used more often, irrespective of corporate objectives, whereas the highprice strategy is used more often, irrespective of corporate objectives, for specialty products. For shopping products, the low-price strategy is used more often when the main corporate objectives are increased market share and the prevention of new competitors from entering the market, but when the main corporate objective is increased profits, the high-price strategy tends to prevail. Research limitations/implications - The current research could be further expanded to cover other related topics such as the pricing policies and specific pricing methods that are used in the four product categories in combination with the pricing strategies they relate to and serve. Practical implications - For marketers, the development of the proposed framework can serve as a basis for pricing decisions, provided, of course, that they use research-based information about the extent to which their products have the attributes of a certain product category. Originality/value - As the literature review revealed, no conceptual links have been made between the three important parameters examined, that is, product categories, corporate objectives, and pricing strategies, that can form a pricing framework for consumer products. This research serves as a starting point for developing such a three-point framework.

Within this context, the concept of Virtual Research Environments(VRE) is an emerging concept looking at addressing the complex challenges associated with conducting collaborative research. Even though concept of VRE is at its infancy, it is important to assess user perception about those, both to establish its success of uptake and future development strategies. However, to date, there is no formal method established to evaluate VREs. This paper reports a strategy adopted within an international collaborative research project (EURASIA) to evaluate its custom built VRE, VEBER, using the well known Computer Human Interaction principles.

J	Koh, DH				Koh, Dong-Hee			The Effects of Product Line Rivalry: Focusing on the Issue of Fighting Brands	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Product line rivalry; Cannibalization; Self-selection; Fighting brands; Product proliferation		Firms produce various products that differ by function, design, color, etc. Product proliferation occurs for three different reasons. When there exist economies of scope, the unit cost for a product is lower when it is produced in conjunction with another product than when it is produced separately. Second, consumers are heterogeneous in the sense that they have different tastes, preferences, or price elasticities. A firm can earn more profit by segmenting consumers into different groups with similar characteristics. For example, product proliferation helps a firm increase profits by satisfying various consumer needs more precisely. The third reason for product proliferation is based on strategy. Producing a number of products can not only deter entry by providing few niches, but can also cause a firm to react efficiently to a low-price entry. By producing various products, a firm can reduce niches so that potential entrants have less incentive to enter. Moreover, a firm can produce new products in response to entry, which is called fighting brands. That is, when an entrant tries to attract consumers with a low price, an incumbent introduces a new lower-quality product while maintaining the price of the existing product. The drawback of product proliferation, however, is cannibalization. Some consumers who would have bought a high-price product switch to a low-price product. Moreover, it is possible that proliferation can decrease profits when a new product is less differentiated from a rival's than is the existing product because of more severe competition. Many studies have analyzed the effect of product line rivalry in the areas of economics and marketing. They show how a monopolist can solve the problem of cannibalization by adjusting quality in a market where consumers differ in their preferences for quality. They find that a consumer who prefers high-quality products will obtain his or her most preferred quality, but a consumer who has not such preference will obtain less than his or her preferred quality to reduce cannibalization. This study analyzed the effects of product line rivalry in a duopoly market with two types of consumers differentiated by quality preference. Author assumes that the two firms are asymmetric in the sense that an incumbent can produce both high- and low-quality products, while an entrant can produce only a low-quality product. The effects of product proliferation can be explained by comparing the market outcomes when an incumbent produces both products to those when it produces only one product. Compared to the case in which an incumbent produces only a high-quality product, the price of a low-quality product tends to decrease in a consumer segment that prefers low-quality products because of more severe competition. Prices, however, tend to increase in a segment with high preferences because of less severe competition. It is known that when firms compete over prices, it is optimal for a firm to increase its price when its rival increases its price, which is called a strategic complement. Since prices are strategic complements, we have two opposing effects. It turns out that the price of a high-quality product increases because the positive effect of reduced competition outweighs the negative effect of strategic complements. This implies that an incumbent needs to increase the price of a high-quality product when it is also introducing a low-quality product. However, the change in price of the entrant's low-quality product is ambiguous. Second, compared to the case in which an incumbent produces only a low-quality product, prices tend to increase in a consumer segment with low preferences but decrease in a segment with high preferences. The prices of low-quality products decrease because the negative effect outweighs the positive effect. Moreover, when an incumbent produces both kinds of product, the price of an incumbent's low-quality product is higher, even though the quality of both firms' low-quality products is the same. The reason for this is that the incumbent has less incentive to reduce the price of a low-quality product because of the negative impact on the price of its high-quality product. In fact, the effects of product line rivalry on profits depend not only on changes in price, but also on sales and cannibalization. If the difference in marginal cost is moderate compared to the difference in product quality, the positive effect of product proliferation outweighs the negative effect, thereby increasing the profit. Furthermore, if the cost difference is very large (small), an incumbent is better off producing only a low (high) quality product. Moreover, this study also analyzed the effect of product line rivalry when a firm can determine product characteristics by focusing on the issue of fighting brands. Recently, Korean air and Asiana airlines have established budget airlines called Jin air and Air Busan, respectively, to confront the launching of budget airlines such as Hansung airline and Jeju air, among others. In addition, as more online bookstores have entered the market, a leading off-line bookstore Kyobo began its own online bookstore. Through fighting brands, an incumbent with a high-quality product can increase profits by producing an additional low -quality product when its low-quality product is more differentiated from that of the entrant than is its high-quality product.

J	Kyriazopoulos, P; Samanta, I				Kyriazopoulos, Panagiotis; Samanta, Irene			Creating an innovation culture through knowledge management: the Greek firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						knowledge management; innovation culture; motivation; leadership; Greece		Knowledge Management (KM) has attracted much attention in the business world since the introduction of the concept by Davenport and Prusak (2000). They acknowledged that the essence of managing knowledge within organisations in a changing contemporary business environment calls for an active engagement with KM initiatives. This study investigates the theoretical underpinnings of innovation theory and concepts and applies these to the investigation of the level of innovation culture and knowledge sharing in Greek firms from a number of aspects, including innovation culture, roles, structure, teamwork and leadership creativity. The key findings were that successful innovators had adopted a culture based on innovation, had management support for innovation, were aware of the relationship between innovation and strategic planning and worked in a place where employees' contributions to innovation were recognised and rewarded.

To evaluate the enterprise strategic management performance (ESMP) scientifically and accurately, this paper overcomes the shortcoming of tradition linear ESMP evaluation method, proposes a evaluation method which unifies the improved BP neural network (BPNN) algorithm and the multistage dynamic fuzzy judgment (MDFJ), takes the multistage dynamic fuzzy judgment as the sampling foundation, uses the BP neural network principle to establish evaluation model. This method not only can exert the unique advantages of BP neural network, but also overcome the difficulty of seeking the high grade training sample data. The ESMP evaluation of 14 enterprises indicates that the method to evaluate the ESMP is stable and reliable.

J	Lobue, RM				LoBue, Robert M.			Is accounting at odds with corporate governance?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						MSI; management-supplied information; transparency barrier; corporate governance; strategic management; KM; knowledge management; intangible assets; agency assurance; differentiation costs; explicit knowledge; tacit knowledge	KNOWLEDGE	Many incidents of accounting fraud and audit failure continuously provide evidence that the quality of management-supplied information sources is clearly insufficient, creating a transparency barrier between management and shareholders in the 21st century system of corporate governance. Towards resolving this issue, strategic management theory assists with identifying the investments in intangibles-related activities that add strategic value in today's corporations. Knowledge management theory further supports an innovative classification approach, providing for significantly higher accounting recognition of these intangible assets. The agency assurance approach calls for a completely new accounting standard in which the differentiation costs of today's readily identifiable, explicit knowledge-based intangibles are capitalised as assets, while investments in tacit knowledge-based activities remain as period expenses. Capitalisation not only validates the strategic value of differentiation costs but also, simultaneously, provides the cost basis for management's monitoring of the underlying intangible assets.

J	Ojiako, U; Maguire, S; Guo, S				Ojiako, Udechukwu; Maguire, Stuart; Guo, Shuting			Global operations management during major change An exploration of industrial practice	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Operations management; Organizational change; Restaurants; Hospitality services; Business performance	FAST-FOOD; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIC CONSENSUS; OBESITY; SYSTEMS; CHINA; UNCERTAINTY; RELEVANCE; SCIENCES; SERVICES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the key practical factors that confront global businesses as they attempt to improve all aspects of their operations including emerging areas of the customer experience. The paper focuses on the way various organisational capabilities such as information systems/information technology have been adopted in order to provide an enhanced operational and strategic control over key areas of business. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a case-based participation observation study which explores the global operations of a major restaurant brand. This approach enables it to explore several concepts which examine the behaviour of global operations at a time of major change. Findings - The paper has focused on the application of change principles in the restaurant and hospitality industry and its importance for business performance and marketing strategy. The paper shows how adapting business strategy to incorporate key cultural sensitivities can pay major dividends for organisations. This strategy appears to be contrary to the general approach of standardisation adopted by other franchises in this key market sector. Research limitations/implications - It will be necessary to increase the range of this research to ensure any real certainty regarding its implications. Originality/value - The paper identifies a number of interesting changes to preconceived ideas of standardising product portfolios in the restaurant sector. It shows the need for a balanced "mix" of menu products to satisfy local and national requirements.

J	Ross, PK				Ross, Peter K.			NEW TECHNOLOGY AND WORK IN THE AUSTRALIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR: WHAT ROLE FOR TECHNICIANS?	LABOUR & INDUSTRY-A JOURNAL OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS OF WORK			English	Article								This paper examined the impact of rapid technological change on the role and employment practices of Telstra technicians. The ramifications of technological change for these workers included changed skill sets, electronic monitoring, job cuts and the outsourcing of some former core work. The paper concludes that technological determinism may assist in explaining some of the resulting changes to the roles of Telstra's in-house technicians, while the heightened use of electronic monitoring was in line with the 'control imperative' of labour process theory. However, new technology did not appear to be the major factor behind Telstra's shift towards a unitarist employment relations approach. Rather, this approach represented a strategic choice on the part of Telstra management, although new technologies provided support for some of their unitarist strategies.

San			Merging Financial and Managerial Accounting: Strategic Cost Management and Enterprise Risk Assessment Under SOX	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article								The spate of accounting and financial reporting scandals in recent years has challenged busi-nesses, auditors, directors, and accounting regu-lators to take a much broader perspective in evaluating and reporting on risk. The Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) legislation in the United States was an attempt to address the problems by requiring enterprises to assess their risks. This article examines the eventful life of an entrepreneurial, publicly traded U.S. telecom venture, including its efforts to support the "strategic enterprise" perspective. It points out the dangers when this perspective is ignored.

Complex standards and innovation in the digital economy: the Internet Protocol	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						standards; innovation; information technology; internet; technology life cycle; corporate strategy; public policy; IP; internet protocol; transition costs; IT services		As Web-based services evolve from a medium for data exchange to a system for managing geographically-dispersed work flows, the complexity of the supporting infrastructure is increasing along with the sophistication of the actual services. This paper presents a case study of the global transition to IPv6 to illustrate the importance of a standards infrastructure in the evolution of internet-based services across the global economy and the consequent strategic and policy issues facing industry and government. Industry cost data ore presented and a model is proposed to explicitly represent the role of standards in the innovation process and illuminate private sector investment risks.

J	Turner, C				Turner, Colin			Combating commoditisation in service provision: evidence from the UK telecommunications market	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						commoditisation; solutions; telecommunications		This article examines the strategic responses to the process of commoditisation in service provision and proposes a framework to analyse the potential options that are available to businesses that face such conditions. This framework is based upon a contingency approach to strategy formation which works on the basis that if firms are subject to the same environmental pressures then the same strategic responses are possible. The framework assesses the move towards the provision of solutions where the firm seeks to generate a differential between the generic (commodity) and the offered product through higher degrees of customer intimacy. This proposition is then explored through a multiple case analysis of the UK's alternative telecommunications network operators. In this sector, there is evidence of a shift towards offering solutions though it is clear that the full effects of commoditisation have yet to work their way fully through the industry.

This paper summarizes our study of the risks for construction and engineering firms in China through interviews of government agencies, organizations and Australian firms in China. As a result, major risks arising from the involvement of Australian construction and engineering firms in China were identified. IP protection, complex networks of policies, decrees and regulations, and fragmentation or conflicting among them imposed by the state, industry and local governments, were generally considered as three major risks in China, although there were slightly different opinions in different sectors. The outcomes from the study may provide both policy-makers and Australian firms with useful information for governance, management and planning at either the strategic or operational level.

J	Woodside, AG; Lai, WH; Kim, KH; Jung, DK				Woodside, Arch G.; Lai, Wen-Hsiang; Kim, Kyung Hoon; Jung, Deuk Keyo			Interpreting Bounded Rationality in Business and Industrial Marketing Contexts: Executive Training Case Studies	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Bounded rationality; Decision system analysis; Original equipment manufacturer; Thematic organization packets; Contingency thinking streams; Aspiration adaptation theory		This article provides training exercises for executives into interpreting subroutine maps of executives thinking in processing business and industrial marketing problems and opportunities. This study builds on premises that Schank proposes about learning and teaching including (1) learning occurs by experiencing and the best instruction offers learners opportunities to distill their knowledge and skills from interactive stories in the form of goal-based scenarios, team projects, and understanding stories from experts. Also, (2) telling does not lead to learning because learning requires actiontraining environments should emphasize active engagement with stories, cases, and projects. Each training case study includes executive exposure to decision system analysis (DSA). The training case requires the executive to write a Briefing Report of a DSA map. Instructions to the executive trainee in writing the briefing report include coverage in the briefing report of (1) details of the essence of the DSA map and (2) a statement of warnings and opportunities that the executive map reader interprets within the DSA map. The length maximum for a briefing report is 500 wordsan arbitrary rule that works well in executive training programs Following this introduction, section two of the article briefly summarizes relevant literature on how humans think within contexts in response to problems and opportunities. Section three illustrates the creation and interpreting of DSA maps using a training exercise in pricing a chemical product to different OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers. Section four presents a training exercise in pricing decisions by a petroleum manufacturing firm. Section five presents a training exercise in marketing strategies by an office furniture distributer along with buying strategies by business customers. Each of the three training exercises is based on research into information processing and decision making of executives operating in marketing contexts. Section six concludes the article with suggestions for use of this training case and for developing additional training cases for honing executives decisionmaking skills. Todd and Gigerenzer propose that humans use simple heuristics because they enable adaptive behavior by exploiting the structure of information in natural decision environments. Simplicity is a virtue, rather than a curse. Bounded rationality theorists emphasize the centrality of Simon's proposition, Human rational behavior is shaped by a scissors whose blades are the structure of the task environments and the computational capabilities of the actor. Gigerenzer's view is relevant to Simon's environmental blade and to the environmental structures in the three cases in this article, The term environment, here, does not refer to a description of the total physical and biological environment, but only to that part important to an organism, given its needs and goals. The present article directs attention to research that combines reports on the structure of task environments with the use of adaptive toolbox heuristics of actors. The DSA mapping approach here concerns the match between strategy and an environmentthe development and understanding of ecological rationality theory. Aspiration adaptation theoty is central to this approach. Aspiration adaptation theoiy models decision making as a multi-goal problem without aggregation of the goals into a complete preference order over all decision alternatives. The three case studies in this article permit the learner to apply propositions in aspiration level rules in reaching a decision. Aspiration adaptation takes the form of a sequence of adjustment steps. An adjustment step shifts the current aspiration level to a neighboring point on an aspiration grid by a change in only one goal variable. An upward adjustment step is an increase and a downward adjustment step is a decrease of a goal variable. Creating and using aspiration adaptation levels is integral to bounded rationality theory . The present article increases understanding and expertise of both aspiration adaptation and bounded rationality theories by providing tearner experiences and practice in using propositions in both theories. Practice in ranking CTSs and writing TOP gists from DSA maps serves to clarify and deepen Selten's view, Clearly, aspiration adaptation must enter the picture as an integrated part of the search for a solution. The body of direct research by Mintzberg, Gladwin's ethnographic decision tree modeling, and Huffs work on mapping strategic thought are suggestions on where to look for research that considers both the structure of the environment and the computational capabilities of the actors making decisions in these environments. Such research on bounded rationality permits both further development of theory in how and why decisions are made in real - life and the development of learning exercises in the use of heuristics occurring in natural environments. The exercises in the present article encourage learning skills and principles of using fast and frugal heuristics in contexts of their intended use. The exercises respond to Schank's wisdom, In a deep sense, education isn't about knowledge or getting students to know what has happened. It is about getting them to feel what has happened. This is not easy to do. Education, as it is in schools today, is emotionless. This is a huge problem. The three cases and accompanying set of exercise questions adhere to Schank's view, Processes are best taught by actually engaging in them, which can often mean, for mental processing, active discussion."

J	Yan, Y; Ding, D; Mak, S				Yan, Yanni; Ding, Daniel; Mak, Simon			The Impact of Business Investment on Capability Exploitation and Organizational Control in International Strategic Alliances	JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Business investment; capability exploitation; organizational control; targeting; formalization		The purpose of this paper is to address how a firm that adopts various organizational controls can moderate the relationship between business investment and capability exploitation. In this study, the primary effect of a firm's business investment is examined on both how it can successfully exploit organizational capabilities across each of the dimensions of management, marketing and technology-specific capabilities, and how the improvement to organizational control, particularly business targeting and formalization, plays a pivotal and moderating role across all organizational capabilities, depending ultimately on the effects of business investment to organizational capabilities and performance. Survey data from 267 Sino-foreign firms suggest that business investment is a significant predictor of an organization's effectiveness through the utilization of firm-specific resources and capabilities. A framework is constructed based on the organizational change concept where a firm's business investment can increase its control efficiency through the exploitation of firm-specific capabilities and thus create subsequent organizational developments. The results of this study shed light on how international strategic alliances (ISA) operating in an environment like China are able to improve their business investments in both capital and non-capital resources. Organizational capability in terms of management-, marketing-and technology-specific capabilities in this study is as a distinctive construct and the result of this study suggests that the establishment of business targets can positively moderate the relationship between a firm's business investment and organizational capabilities. The importance of business investment to the exploitation of organizational capabilities in today's ISAs creates successful investment strategies and development opportunities. The findings have significant implications for investment strategies of ISAs and for the improvement of their investment effectiveness in an emerging market such as China. This study breaks new ground by combining resource-based theory and financial economics theory to show that investment exerts potent influences on the exploitation of organizational capabilities. The assessment of the multiplicity of the forms of organizational capabilities draws attention to the capability dimensions that enable ISAs to adapt to changing market conditions.

J	Gupta, M; Sharman, R				Gupta, Manish; Sharman, Raj			Dimensions of Identity Federation: A Case Study in Financial Services	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SECURITY			English	Article						Identity federation; Security Assertion Markup Language; Identity Management; Single Sign On; Federation Web Services; SAML; Federated Identity Management; case study		In the networked economy, strategic partnerships and collaboration are an important way to develop and maintain competitive advantages. At the same time, enterprises also need to reduce costs, increase revenues and seize new business opportunities. This demands enterprises to enable convenient and secure business interactions with internal and external stakeholders, and create relationships to trust the electronic identities to access critical information resources. Federated identity management (FIM) is a system that enables individuals to use the same credentials or identification data to obtain access to the networks of multiple enterprises to conduct business transactions. FIM has demonstrated huge potential in providing reliable and scalable solutions to problems in systems security and access management. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is the dominant web services standard for FIM. The objective of the paper is to present an exploratory case study based research to investigate implementation challenges, outcomes and federated identity management opportunities using evidence from a complex implementation of Identity Federation using SAML at a mid-sized north-east US bank. The SAML integration was achieved using a commercial off the shelf product, by Computer Associates, eTrust (R) that also leverages SAML as web services standard for federated identity management. Discussion in the paper presents common obstacles, opportunities, motivations and future directions in the realm of identity federation based on evidence from extensive project and product documentation provided by the financial services institutions team and on interviews with six team members of the case study project, including one senior information security manager.

J	McLellan, JD; Moustafa, E				McLellan, John D.; Moustafa, Essam			Exploratory Analysis of the Importance of Management Accounting Tools in the GCC Countries	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES			English	Article						Management accounting; Management accounting tools; GCC countries		This article uses a survey of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) in the six Arab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to examine the importance that CMAs place on a number of management accounting practices for the efficient operation of their business and to determine the degree of adoption of that management accounting practice by their organization. The findings indicate a large discrepancy between what accountants consider effective management accounting tools and the use of those tools by their companies. senior management team. Evidence suggests that companies in the GCC rely on the traditional management accounting practices rather than the more recently developed tools. In addition, the management accountants of GCC companies feel that it would be more important for their businesses to emphasis a range of non-financial tools as well as to adopt a more strategic management focus using tools.

J	Park, K; Yang, J; Chang, JH; Kim, DH				Park, Kwanghee; Yang, Junsik; Chang, Joon-Hyuk; Kim, Deok-Hwan			Anticipatory I/O Management for Clustered Flash Translation Layer in NAND Flash Memory	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article						FTL; AFTL; clustered hash table; prefetch; continuity counter		Recently, NAND flash memory has emerged as a next generation storage device because it has several advantages, such as low power consumption, shock resistance, and so on. However, it is necessary to use a flash translation layer (FTL) to intermediate between NAND flash memory and conventional file systems because of the unique hardware characteristics of flash memory. This paper proposes a new clustered FTL (CFTL) that uses clustered hash tables and a two-level software cache technique. The CFTL can anticipate consecutive addresses from the host because the clustered hash table uses the locality of reference in a large address space. It also adaptively switches logical addresses to physical addresses in the flash memory by using block mapping, page mapping, and a two-level software cache technique. Furthermore, anticipatory I/O management using continuity counters and a prefetch scheme enables fast address translation. Experimental results show that the proposed address translation mechanism for CFTL provides better performance in address translation and memory space usage than the well-known NAND FTL (NFTL) and adaptive FTL (AFTL).

After exploring Zaragoza's credentials as host for such an event, and in particular one with the theme of water and sustainable development, this article reviews other landmark events hosted in Spain, and the attractions and potential advantages to be derived from holding such events. It focuses on Zaragoza's strategic geographical position, and the city's role as a catalyst for economic development in Aragon and beyond, before asking to what extent Zaragoza achieved the desired aims of urban renewal and the raising of environmental awareness. It highlights some of the controversy surrounding the exhibition and invites readers to contribute to the Open Forum, particularly on the economic and environmental aspects.

J	Shiu, H; Fong, J				Shiu, Herbert; Fong, Joseph			Reverse engineering from an XML document into an extended DTD graph	JOURNAL OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						data semantics; extended DTF graph; reverse engineering; XML document	INFORMATION	The extensible markup language (XML) has become a standard for persistent storage and data interchange via the Internet due to its openness. self-descriptiveness, and flexibility. This article proposes a systematic approach to reverse engineer arbitrary XML documents to their conceptual schema, extended DTD graphs, which are DTD graphs with data semantics. The proposed approach not only determines the structure of the XML document, but also derives candidate data semantics from the XML element instances by treating each XML element instance as a record in a table of a relational database. One application of the determined data semantics is to verify the linkages among elements. Implicit and explicit referential linkages are among XML elements modeled by the parent-children structure and ID/IDREF(S), respectively. As a result, an arbitrary XML document can be reverse engineered into its conceptual schema in an extended DTD graph format.

J	Walvvyn, D				Walvvyn, David			A target for South Africa's business expenditure on research and development based on industry structure	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article							INVESTMENT	THE IMPORTANCE OF MIGRATING THE South African economy from its present dependence on resource-based industries towards more knowledge-intensive economic activities has been repeatedly emphasized in many policy documents over the last decade. A higher business expenditure on research and development (BERD) is fundamental to this restructuring. Although the present level of expenditure, expressed as a percentage of total research and development (R&D) expenditure is higher than in most countries with similar levels of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), this comparison is misleading. BERD, as a percentage of industry value added, is low by international standards, especially when one considers that many of South Africa's leading industries, such as in the highly important sectors of food, metal products and petrochemicals, compete in a global market place and should be investing at levels equivalent to or even higher than their direct competitors. I analyse the structure of South African industry at sub-sector level in this paper and develop a target for manufacturing BERD, based on the industry structure and international benchmarks for such industries. As a result, I propose that manufacturing BERD should be at least R12.5 billion (an 85% increase on the 2004 values), equivalent to 0.9% of GDP (2004 rand values). I recommend that this target be incorporated into the strategic plans of the departments of Trade and Industry and of Science and Technology as an important goal for this sector and in the monitoring of their existing policy instruments, such as the recently introduced tax credit for R&D.

While clinical governance in community health is not new, the work of the project has aimed to develop a more consistent approach to safety and quality. This represents a strategic response to policy imperatives at a state and national level, which has resulted in a transition to a client population that has greater acuity and complexity in their health and social needs. The project has focused on the areas of clinical risk management, credentialling, defining scope of practice, clinical indicators and board reporting. The project has been evaluated through an annual sector survey which has demonstrated that the majority of respondents have used resources created by the project. Ninety-four per cent of respondents indicated that they bad reviewed their clinical governance reporting processes in the previous 12 months. The project has strong governance from a steering group comprised of stakeholders from the community health sector, the acute sector, state government, accreditation agencies and insurance authorities, with the project work being completed by working groups consisting of community health chief executive officers, managers and clinicians. This has resulted in high levels of engagement and ownership by the sector.

J	Hochman, G				Hochman, Gal			Trade negotiations, domestic policies, and the Most Favored Nation clause	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE			English	Article							DISCRIMINATORY TARIFFS; ECONOMIC-THEORY; WARS	This paper illustrates how restricting trade instruments to non-discrimination links trade agreements to non-trade agreements and, under certain conditions, helps governments further lower tariffs and/or domestic standards (policies). These conditions are: (i) governments' objective functions are sufficiently concave with respect to domestic standards (policies); (ii) domestic standards are sufficiently valued; and (iii) policies are strategic complements. These can then be used as a rationale for restricting safeguard measures to non-discrimination.

J	Gupta, VK				Gupta, V. K.			India: IPR and the national security	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS			English	Article						IPR laws; national security; dual use inventions; Atomic Energy Act; defence R& D		The paper highlights intellectual property rights (IPR) issues related to defence and national security in the Indian context, for example, management of IPR during defence R&D and technology development, protection of IPR of strategic nuclear and dual use technologies and applications, negotiating patents and Other IPR during acquisition of military equipment and technologies, and counterfeiting and piracy of legally owned intellectual property. The emerging non-nuclear commercial applications of sonic of the 'prescribed' substances in the Atomic Energy Act of 1962 like uranium, thorium, titanium, zirconium, graphite, Or radioactive isotopes have been discussed. The paper stresses the need for resolving IP related issues, particularly, for dual-use materials and systems by evolving an appropriate IPR policy. It points out significance of IPR in defence acquisition procedures and implementation and risks to internal national security from piracy of trademarked or copyrighted or patented products. India may have to act against such a piracy and crack clown of intellectual property theft as part of response to the new set of national security challenges.

J	Bose, SK; Chatterjee, J				Bose, S. K.; Chatterjee, Joydeep			CHALLENGES FACED BY THE INDIAN TINPLATE PACKAGING INDUSTRY: AN ANALYSIS	MANAGEMENT-JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT ISSUES			English	Article								The New Economic Policy of 1991 opened up the Indian markets to the world. Indian manufacturers, which once operated in the protected economy, were now open to the competition from organizations world-wide. It became imperative for the organizations to develop a competitive advantage to tide over the crisis. They were quick to evolve with a restructured strategy of neo-manufacturing from simply the economies of scale to an agile organization with a higher degree of flexibility. However, soon it was realized that focusing on manufacturing alone was not enough; one needs to have an integrated approach to carry out manufacturing in line with the value delivered to consumers. Thus, evolved the concept of the value curve and formulated strategy accordingly. The paper discusses the Indian tinplate manufacturers, which once enjoyed a monopoly in the Indian tinplate market. However, the liberalization ushered in a huge euphoria and India transformed into a freight advantageous zone for the tinplate manufacturers world-wide. The drastic reduction in import duties, coupled with weak regulatory policies by the government with respect to the packaging segment, led to unscrupulous dumping of the tinplate from outside. This landed the organizations in a crisis situation. However, the organizations were quick to respond to the situation. The paper attempts to do an analysis of the Indian tinplate packaging market and tries to identify the opportunities of the future. In addition, current approach in practice is analyzed and a shift in paradigm, needed to address the changing market needs, is being suggested. Although the detailed strategic approach is beyond the scope of discussion of this paper, it still gives the readers an overview of the new approach; that is the value innovative approach of looking into the ` mind space' of the consumer.

Business networking relationships for business success	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ALLIANCES	This study explored the context of business relationships in the networking practices of South African businesses. The objective of this study was to investigate the networking practices of Gauteng businesses and specific perceptions and experiences of business owners and managers on their business networking objectives. A multi-method design was used, which included qualitative research (focus groups) and quantitative research (structured questionnaire). Perceptions recorded amongst the participants indicated that business relationships are built for referrals and strategic networking connections. Different forms of business networking and different motivations behind the building of business networks were identified, such as profit, access to resources and improved efficiency. Different characteristics in terms of business relationships were identified and different age groups, group 1 (44 years and younger) and group 2 (older than 45 years of age) indicated that they felt differently about the number of connections in a network. This article can contribute to the business practice of networking and the awareness of business owners and managers in terms of the importance and influence of networking in their specific business.

The Role of HRD in Integrated Crisis Management: A Public Sector Approach	ADVANCES IN DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES			English	Article						integrated crisis management; human resource development; training; public management		The problem and the solution. This article examines the role that human resource development (HRD) plays in integrating crisis management systems in public sector organizations. We chose to examine the role of HRD in government organizations because public organizations play cross-sector roles in managing large-scale crises and because we have consulted in public organizations for more than 30 years. We reviewed more than 30 journal articles, books, and government studies and identified some possible conditions affecting the integration. As the review suggested that crises make organization adaptability imperative, we maintain that governments facing national man-made or natural disasters require flexible deployment of resources to attain strategic advantage. To explore further the role of HRD, we analyzed conditions in the CharlotteMecklenburg (North Carolina, United States) government that integrated HRD in crises management systems. We identified four emergent themes and compared them to crisis management literature to develop three hypotheses of how such integration occurs. We follow this with suggestions for future research and practice.	[Rusaw, A. Carol] George Washington Univ, Management, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Rusaw, A.

Merging management technology in workflow systems is a critical step to provide service-oriented architecture and on-demand business. We propose a value-oriented process technique as a strategic alignment to improve investment value. Our framework focuses on the guidelines for traditional users to identify the structural conflicts in integrating Web services. A comparative study of workflow models for intra-and inter-organizational process control is presented. This article identifies the current progress in the adaptability in the design of process models coupled with structural changes of workflow views. The study provides a resource list of successful implementations for practitioners in organizational management. The research highlights the motivation of market facilitation, expert sharing and collaboration that enable commercial applications to support complex heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed information systems.

J	Zaied, AN				Zaied, Abdel Nasser			Strategic planning for e-development in developing countries	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						strategic planning; e-development		One of the most persistent criticisms of open markets and free trade is that they increase the gap between developed and developing countries. The rapid emergence of the internet economy is giving this argument new impetus and is increasing focus on the digital divide and e-development to reduce the gap between "information rich" and "information poor" countries. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is widely recognized as a potentially powerful tool to minimize this gap. ICT can provide a great opportunity for developing countries to leapfrog stages of economic development. A strategic management approach to ICT is therefore necessary in providing national guidelines on how ICT can be harnessed by developing countries to increase their technological capabilities towards e-development. This study proposes a frame work that aimed at facilitating the process of creating and implementing ICT strategies. This framework that comprises three phases is a step-by-step methodology that can help the developing countries to establish their own ICT strategies. It needs further studies to complement with countries mission based on their resources and situations.

J	Kotani, M; Iijima, J				Kotani, Masafumi; Iijima, Junichi			IT applications portfolio management under business and implementation uncertainty	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						IT-investment management; application portfolio management; real options analysis; risk-return model; risk-tolerance paradigm; timing decision	OPTIONS	Corporations need to improve business processes in order to enhance velocity and service levels while reducing their processing costs and differentiating themselves in the face of competition. The levitation of importance beyond support roles has raised IT investment decisions to high priority in chief executive officers' agendas. Corporate planning groups as well as lines of business are increasingly applying techniques of IT applications portfolio management in a more systematic fashion to improve decision-making and resource-allocation processes. Recent advances in software engineering and IT service delivery methodologies have achieved the logical separation of business functions from implementation. This separation has made a new breed of innovative IT project possible with a new project risk structure; the adjustment of portfolio management techniques is appropriate. We present an integrated portfolio management model so that the corporation can focus on organic growth through sources at both the department and top management levels. The research gives clear advice as to how top management can seek economic growth by selecting an entrepreneurial strategic posture, implying a strong risk-taking propensity. By integrating a risk-return model and risk-tolerance paradigm to cope with today's risk structure, overall capabilities can improve the decision process and the corporation's performance as well. The application of the integrated technique to a Japanese manufacturing firm is described.

Findings indicate that ecological effects on survival localize to the level of separate international markets as an industry becomes global. How firms structurally participate in these markets moderate these ecological forces. Strategic choices about technology management, such as centralized versus decentralized manufacturing and R&D operations, help firms "crack" densely packed markets. The developed theory is tested with firm-level data on the structure and international presence of all organizations in the worldwide population of integrated circuit manufacturers, from 1961 to 1994.

J	O'Shea, L; Ulph, A				O'Shea, Lucy; Ulph, Alistair			The role of pest resistance in biotechnology R&D investment strategy	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						resistance; R&D; strategic interaction; innovation	PERSISTENCE; MONOPOLY	The biotechnology industry has become highly concentrated due to two factors: large research and development (R&D) investments in biotechnology, and an intense period of mergers and acquisitions during the late 1990s and beyond. In this paper we explore the link between R&D and market concentration in the biotechnology sector. In this sector the potential development of resistance by insects to pest control biotechnology has to be accounted for. The central question is whether the pest resistance effect reinforces or weakens the link between R&D investments and concentration. To address this, we develop a standard game-theoretic model of strategic innovation between an incumbent and a potential entrant but introduce a risk of pests developing resistance. Firms are thus faced with two types of threat to their innovation-from rivals within the market 'competitive threat' and from pests 'pest threat'. To combat these threats they make two types of R&D investment 'competitive R&D' and 'pest R&D'. We show that the incumbent is likely to invest less (more) in competitive R&D than the entrant when innovation is drastic (non-drastic). We find that introducing the pest effect has different impacts on relative incentives depending on whether we allow firms to react to the threat of pest resistance or not. In addition, we show that accounting for the ability of pests to develop resistance to technologies increases industry concentration. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Pitt, LF; Schlegelmilch, B				Pitt, Leyland F.; Schlegelmilch, Bodo			Juggling Janus - strategy for general managers in an age of paradoxical trends	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Whereas trends in the modern age tended to be linear and unidirectional, the trends in our postmodern times are more likely to be paradoxical. Like the Roman god Janus, they have two faces, and are seldom simply positive or negative, or universally 'good' or 'bad'. This article identifies and describes eight such trends, and looks at each of their 'faces'. The trends include the growth in prosperity, free markets, population growth, global bliss and gloom, the power of multinationals, worldwide media reach, the age of brands, and the decline of service. We argue that simple applications of strategy might be inappropriate in the face of these paradoxical trends, and that firms will have to consider revolutionary changes to strategy in order to achieve strategic balance.

This paper draws on a recent book by the authors to suggest a process for developing and implementing robust policy for fire and emergency management. Different approaches to policy development are discussed. The case is made that there are distinct types of policy problems in fire and emergency management, each requiring distinct approaches. The need for thought on policy implementation style, the advantages of multiple problem framing and the challenge of policy instrument choice are set out.

J	Adebajo, A				Adebajo, Adekeye			The bicycle strategy of South Africa's bilateral relations in Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS-SAJIA			English	Article						South Africa; Africa; bilateral relations; regional powers; strategic partners; conflict resolution		In order to consolidate its strategic bilateral relations developed in Africa over the past 14 years, South Africa must choose five key 'hubs' (regional powers) in each of Africa's five sub-regions. In addition, South Africa should pick two additional 'spokes' (influential actors) in each sub-region. These 15 strategic partners can increase South Africa's engagement on the continent in the areas of diplomacy, conflict management, and trade relations. South Africa's bilateral relations would thus resemble a gigantic bicycle, with five hubs and ten spokes. The five hubs are Mozambique, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, and Algeria. The ten spokes would be Zimbabwe, Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan, Tanzania, Egypt and Libya. It is around these countries that South Africa can build solid strategic bilateral relationships in Africa.

A New Framework to Ensure Excellence in Patient-Focused Care: the nursing directorate's Balanced Scorecard approach	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategy; targets; measures; performance management; patient outcomes; governance; balanced scorecard		The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) implemented at St Vincent's Private Hospital (SVPH), Sydney, Australia has the key objective of helping managers and clinicians enhance the clinical and corporate governance of their units individually and the hospital as a whole. It does this by systematically mapping out key strategic objectives, measures, targets, initiatives and accountabilities to aid in the delivery of quality and safe patient-focused care. In effect, the BSC helps managers and staff execute strategy by turning the aforementioned initiatives and accountabilities into action. This paper discusses the methods by which enhanced clinical and corporate governance is achieved, including a systematic approach to the identification of strategies tailored to improve current care delivery marked by achievable and measurable targets. It also presents the results of implementation which include, but are not limited to an increase in: patient satisfaction scores throughout the hospital; percentage of patients pre-admitted; percentage of patients risk assessed; and a decrease in: hospital identified MRSA, falls and medication incidents; patients transferred to rehabilitation; and average length of stay.

BENCHMARKING OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR: PROSPECTS, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						benchmarking; benchmarking process; human resource management; public sector; public sector management		This paper reviews the role of human resource management (HRM) which, today, plays a strategic partnership role in management. The focus of the paper is on HRM in the public sector, where much hope rests on HRM as a means of transforming the public service and achieving much needed service delivery. However, a critical evaluation of HRM practices in the public sector reveals that these services leave much to be desired. The paper suggests the adoption of benchmarking as a process to revamp HRM in the public sector so that it is able to deliver on its promises. It describes the nature and process of benchmarking and highlights the inherent difficulties in applying benchmarking in HRM. It concludes with some suggestions for a plan of action. The process of identifying "best" practices in HRM requires the best collaborative efforts of HRM practitioners and academicians. If used creatively, benchmarking has the potential to bring about radical and positive changes in HRM in the public sector. The adoption of the benchmarking process is, in itself, a litmus test of the extent to which HRM in the public sector has grown professionally.

J	Anderson, D; Keleher, P; Smith, P				Anderson, D.; Keleher, P.; Smith, P.			Towards an assessment tool for the strategic management of asset criticality	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Many organisations in both the private and public sectors rely on engineering assets to provide products and services. The failure of these assets, or their components, can have undesirable consequences for the organisation. Failure consequences can be measured in terms of their impact on the safety of personnel, the public and the environment, and on their impact on desired levels of service or output. Existing decision tools for determining the criticality of asset failure are typically rigorous and detailed. They are necessarily time consuming methodologies. A strategic management approach seeks to focus the effort and cost of such detailed analysis more appropriately. It recognises the value of the expert knowledge of those directly engaged in operations and maintenance functions in supporting a strategic approach to the assessment of asset criticality. The purpose of such a tool is to quickly and effectively identify critical assets within a facility to assist strategic decision making. The assessment tool being trialled is to support the Maintenance function of organisations and therefore it is focussed on the Operations and Maintenance phase of the asset life cycle. This paper presents an overview of the alternative methodology being trialled and some examples of its practical application.

J	Burrell, DN				Burrell, Darrell			Why Small Private Liberal Arts Colleges Need to Develop Effective Marketing Cultures	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						marketing culture; marketing leadership		Strategic marketing is not a common leadership concept for college administrators. Small private liberal arts colleges are closing at an alarming rate in the United States due to an inability to innovatively adapt their organizational cultures to be more marketing oriented in the competitive marketing environment for new students. The essence of college leadership today is about adaptation, innovation, creativity, and management actions focused on the developing set of strategies that can help organizations and the people in them break through gridlocks, flourish, and even survive. Significant organizational change inevitably involves an innovative ability to adapt to challenges and break historical and fixed organizational paradigms and values. Organizational leaders through their actions can be incubators for innovations that overcome barriers in stagnant organizational systems to accelerate and accomplish deep change and develop the adaptability to thrive in complex, competitive, and challenging marketing climates.

Managing the Risks of Risk Management	JOURNAL OF DECISION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Software Engineering; Risk Management; Risk Object; Hazard; Exposure; Coverage		Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a field of enormous importance due to its economic repercussion. More and more companies are paying attention to it, given there is significant economic savings for attending to the various aspects of risk. At the same time, ERM has witnessed a shift in the way firms manage the many uncertainties that stand in the way of achieving their strategic, operational and financial objectives. Nevertheless, existing Risk Management Systems (RMIS) are neither powerful, nor flexible enough to model the complexity of the risk management process. In this paper we will examine these issues in greater detail, explaining the existing problem and proposing a software system that addresses them. We will also show the actual design and operation of ARMISTICE (Advanced Risk Management Information System: Tracking Insurances, Claims and Exposures), a successful RMIS case study.

J	Cattani, G				Cattani, Gino			Leveraging in-house R&D competencies for a new market: how Corning pioneered fibre optics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						fibre optics; incumbents; knowledge; patents; technological innovation	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; AUTOMOBILE-INDUSTRY; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; ALLIANCE FORMATION; ESTABLISHED FIRMS; PATENT CITATIONS; LOCAL SEARCH; INNOVATION	This paper examines how established firms create new (radical) technologies by re-deploying existing knowledge into other domains than those in which that knowledge was originally accumulated. Drawing from the strategy and the innovation research, the analysis focuses on some of the mechanisms firms can use in developing a new technology. More specifically, we study the following mechanisms: the role of internal vs. collaborative R&D the breadth of firm's search behaviour; the scope of this firm's R&D activity; the importance of individual inventors relative to the teams of inventors in new technology developments. We trace Coming's invention and the development of fibre optics over the period of 1970-1995 using multiple sources of data and information. The analysis shows that Coming developed fibre optics mostly in-house by leveraging its stock of knowledge into a new application domain, i.e., long-distance telecommunications. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Our OR results show that rating agencies use only a subset of variables they describe or indicate as important to CMBS credit rating as some of the variables they use were statistically insignificant. Overall, ANN show superior results to OR in predicting CMBS credit ratings.

J	Dealtry, R				Dealtry, Richard			Exploration of a contextual management framework for strategic learning alliances	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING			English	Article						Corporate universities; Strategic alliances; Learning; Innovation		Purpose - This article aims to take a further step forward in examining those important business factors that will shape the future of best practice in the quality management of internal and external strategic alliances. Design/methodology/approach - The article presents a speculative scenario on the future of strategic alliances in education, training, development and business, inspired learning by applying information and data from well-established professional alliance management sources as the underpinning context for its guidelines. Findings - Many different attempts have been and still are being made by business and academic institutions to set up working relationships that are intended to work well for both parties. These relationships travel under various titles, with the term "partnership" being the most common. Problems of sustainability and/or quality of outcomes are prevalent as a result of the alliance management perspective being taken on a limited understanding of the total relationship dynamics for success; too narrow a perspective on what dynamics have to be managed. Models for success are, however, readily available. Research limitations/implications - In the broader context there is a wealth of research, best practice and practical experience in the field of strategic alliance management. iPCo's current research is therefore focused on how this professional resource and experience can be adopted to provide a quality framework of management practice that will enable business management to ensure that they make the right choices in the selection and construction of their strategic learning relationships both internally and externally. Originality/value - The need for major innovations in the management of lifelong training and learning is now well established. Trying to achieve the successful implementation of these developments on a piecemeal basis has, however, proved to be an unrewarding process for many managers. The inertia of large institutional bodies and the "not invented here" syndrome have been proved to slow down or sideline major innovations. Knowing the size of the problem in each situation and how to deal with it effectively and efficiently at the right level is now one of the main strategic imperatives for corporate university managers.

Identification of supplementary metrics to sustain fleet readiness from a maintenance perspective	NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL			English	Article								A wide variety of programs and schemes are in place (and many programs are in continuous development by organizations such as the Office of Naval Research) that address the sustainability of the Navy's Fleet. Newly developed technologies are allowing for the continued design and development of much more complex ships with a host of innovative concepts and requirements. The cost of construction of these next-generation ships, budgetary restraints, and other factors have also made it so necessary to maintain, adapt, and extend the life of the legacy fleet to meet operational requirements and maintain our maritime dominance. As we extend and adapt technology to become implemented across the wide variety of vessel platforms in existence in the legacy fleet, manning reductions are being implemented across the various ship-type classes. As more and more maintenance is being shifted from the sailors on the ships to various off-ship organizations, this brings into question the level of training necessary for ship's personnel in the maintenance area that is required when manning the ship from a tactical or operational perspective. Decision tools need to be developed for senior Navy management for use in evaluating and determining the optimal balance in manning ships from not only the operational perspective but also from the maintainability/survivability perspective. It is believed evaluation of the requirements, benchmarking, and the development of assessment metrics for determining the requirements of the Fleet for capable maintainers are of vital importance and will have far-reaching impact on the Sea Warrior, Sea Trial, and Sea Enterprise programs in support of the "Sea Power 21" strategic concept of the Navy. This paper explores the necessity of benchmarking current ship's force capabilities, establishing manning requirement metrics, and evaluation of current maintenance policies.

J	Goyal, P; Metri, BA				Goyal, Preeti; Metri, Bhimaraya A.			The FIFTH Perspective: Extending the Balanced Scorecard for Outsourcing	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						business process outsourcing; balanced scorecard; performance measurement	PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; METRICS	Today, alliances, collaborations, and networks are synonymous with strategy. Business process outsourcing (BPO) is one such type of alliance. With increasing reliance on outsourcing, the organizational boundaries are blurring. The implications for the client organization can be tremendous, as it now relies on an outside organization to fulfill its operational objectives. Currently, there is no single framework that can effectively measure performance for BPO arrangements. In its present form, the balanced scorecard (BSC) only addresses the performance measurement needs of a single enterprise and any perspective on any external relationships is completely missing. The traditional BSC does not suffice as a performance measurement framework for BPO. While both the client and the vendor can use a BSC for their respective organizations, the strategic objectives of the organizations may not be met. In this article the authors propose a new perspective as an extension to the BSC, namely, the goals alignment perspective. Goals alignment of the two organizations will enable creation of performance measures that will help participating organizations to achieve their respective goals.

J	King, WR				King, William			The Post-Offshoring IS Organization	INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						core competencies; critical success factors; offshoring; outsourcing		In the age in which many traditional IS functions will be taken over by offshore vendors or otherwise outsourced, attention needs to be paid to those functions that will increase in importance and/or need to be developed by IS departments if they are to be effective in this new environment. This article suggests a framework that may be judgmentally applied to IS activities in order to determine if they should be considered for offshoring/outsourcing. The results of applying the framework will be unique to each firm that uses it. However, in using that approach in more than 25 firms, the author has found that most firms will wish to retain a number of functions in-house.

J	Kirby, M; Godwin, M				Kirby, Maurice; Godwin, Matthew			Operational Research as counterfactual history: A retrospective analysis of the use of battlefield nuclear weapons in the German invasion of France and flanders, May-June 1940	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article						Operational Research; Battle of France; World War II; war gaming; nuclear weapons		In 1955 British Operational Research (OR) analysts attached to the British Army conducted a hypothetical study of the likely impact of nuclear weapons as they might have been deployed by Anglo-French forces in resisting the German invasion of North-East France in May-June 1940. The study formed the first major attempt by OR analysts to assess the use of nuclear weapons at the tactical level. In deriving lessons from 1940, OR analysts focused on several battlefronts where nuclear weapons could have provided relief to defending forces. Consideration was also given to a situation where the invading forces were also nuclear-equipped. As this paper demonstrates, valuable insights were gained from the events of 1940 on the deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons. However, in neglecting the wider strategic environment, OR analysts failed to consider the possibility that a nuclear land battle fought in Europe between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact could precipitate a strategic nuclear exchange.

SHIFT-SHARE ANALYSIS OF MANUFACTURING AS A MEASURING INSTRUMENT FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT	SA JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Manufacturing; job creation; economic geography; shift-share analysis; industrial development		Shift-share analysis of employment as a measuring instrument for human resource management is proposed by this study. The results obtained through this technique can assist human resource management on the macro-level in making informed and strategic decisions regarding future employment practices and trends. This technique is often applied to studies of economic geography, and is illustrated in this article through its application to the estimation of future employment potential of manufacturing industries of South Africa's Southern District Municipality. The economy in this region is mainly dependent on gold mining, which is declining as gold reserves are becoming depleted. As a result, a large section of the area's population will be unemployed in future, causing adversity and other development needs. Shift-share analysis provides insight into the shifts of employment in the various sectors over time, as well as insight into the national share effect on employment in the region, including the regional-industrial mix and the competitive share effects. It was found that the sectors with the highest employment creation potential are: transport equipment, wood and paper products, metal products, and furniture. Some suggestions are also made regarding the ways that this information can be utilised in human resource management.	[Kleynhans, Ewert P.

J	Lanza, A; Pellegrino, A; Simone, G				Lanza, Andrea; Pellegrino, Antonella; Simone, Guiseppina			Heterogeneous effects of heterogeneity Disentangling heterogeneity positive and negative effects on performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Organizational performance; Business performance; Management strategy		Purpose - The aim of the paper is to test the Heterogeneity Construct as a second-order construct determined by dimensions expressing the resource utilization process carried out by firms, and to test the different impacts of Heterogeneity sub-dimensions on firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach - After collecting data on the machine tools industry, two models are tested by Lisrel. The first model is a second order confirmatory model. The second one is a structural model testing the causal relations between Heterogeneity components and Performance. Findings - It is found that Heterogeneity is a second order construct, whose dimensions differently contribute to firm performance: two of them positively and a third dimension negatively. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the study refer to single industry used, limited sample size, and single respondents. Even if the sample size is low, it allows to run the model and to estimates results. The single respondent bias is mitigated by interviewing managers involved in the resource utilization process. Future research could improve our comprehension of the heterogeneity construct by testing the model in other industries. Practical implications - By discovering the different effect of the Heterogeneity dimensions on firm performance, we provide some useful implications for managers involved in the resource utilization process. To reach a competitive advantage, firms should orient their decisions to leverage on "contextuality" and "complexity", while mitigating the effect of "intertwinedness". Originality/value - Studies in the strategic management field of study measure Heterogeneity by using single variables. This paper fills in this gap by providing a measure of the Heterogeneity construct on a multidimensional basis, showing the different role played by each dimension on firm performance.

J	McDonagh, J				McDonagh, John			The development of corporate real estate asset management in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE			English	Article						Real estate; Assets management; New Zealand; Surveys; Time series analysis		Purpose - This research paper aims to review the development of corporate real estate asset management (CREAM) in New Zealand since 1992. Design/methodology/approach - The first research into CREAM in New Zealand was carried out by Wei Kium Teoh. Lincoln University staff and post graduate students have subsequently undertaken several CREAM research projects involving surveys of organizations in New Zealand. These were spread over a 14 year time period and led to the opportunity to carry out a time series analysis of the development of CREAM practice in New Zealand. Findings - Substantial improvement in some aspects of CREAM practice was observed, for example, in the qualifications of those responsible for CREAM and the development of strategic plans for those assets. However, other aspects of CREAM have remained remarkably stable or plateaued, for example the percentage of organizations with a separate real estate unit, reporting levels to management and the allocation of real estate costs. Research limitations/implications - Both academic and industry attention in New Zealand can now be focused on those areas of CREAM development that appear to be lagging or otherwise warranting further research due to inconsistent results across the different studies. Originality/value - CREAM research in a New Zealand context is limited. This paper collates and interprets much of that research with the added benefit of hindsight and trend analysis. The similarities in the findings with research carried out in other countries means international developments in CREAM are likely to be also applicable in a New Zealand context.

J	Mo, SJ; Sorig, IA				Mo, Sun-Jong; Sorig, In-Am			A Study on the Strategic Use of an IMC Planning Model for the Distribution Industry	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			Korean	Article						IMC; IMC planning model; IMC Mix; IMC activities; IMC attitudes; brand loyalty; repurchase Intention		Marketing for the distribution industry is making an ongoing progress in the changes of customers, the competitive environment, and the internal marketing environment. Integrated marketing communication activities are required for the enhancement of efficiency in the market oriented activities. In this study, IMC is defined as "a notion that a market oriented business integrated marketing communication means, conducting and evaluating marketing activities with consistent messages in order to communicate with customers based on databases." In this study, an IMC planning model for the improvement of marketing efficiency in the distribution industry was derived from a pilot study. This model may be broken down into the following phases: IMC goals setting, situational analysis (customer analysis, competition analysis and company analysis), customer data analysis, contact management, budgeting, the establishment of an IMC strategy, the IMC mix and execution, an evaluation system, and feedback. In consideration of the characteristics of the distribution industry, this study was accompanied by a vocational study on IMC means employed by, in particular, department stores and other distributors such as-' advertising, sales promotion, sales promotion advertising, direct marketing, public relations, personal selling, the Internet, mobile, visual merchandising, words of mouth. In addition, this study also covered the correlation among variables such as IMC activities of distributors, the process of forming customer's brand attitudes, brand loyalty and repurchase intention. This research would enhance the utilization of IMC. The analysis on customer's brand attitudes toward the IMC activities of distributors requires the simultaneous consideration of how they are linked to purchase as well as their attitudes toward both distributors and stores. The formation of brand loyalty and repurchase intention is related to the integration of marketing communication and the maintenance of consistency in contents, which requires integrated brand communication (BBC) strategies. IBC is a concept of using IMC means to manage the brand in a continuing and consistent manner and measuring their effect, which is a process to establish enterprise level brand identity and maximize brand loyalty and repurchase intention by integrating IMC means. For an empirical analysis in this study, an online questionnaire survey was conducted among those department store customers from 20's to 50's who reside either in the Seoul and Gyeonggi areas and have made purchase at department stores. In this study, the research model consisted of four theoretical variables: IMC activities, IMC attitudes, brand loyalty, and repurchase intention, on which variables a pilot study was conducted. A number of hypotheses were constructed on the relations between IMC activities and IMC attitudes, between IMC attitudes and repurchase intention, and between brand loyalty and repurchase intention. The test of the hypotheses may be summarized as follows: Firstly, the test of the hypothesis concerning the relation between IMC attitudes and IMC activities - advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, public relations, personal selling, the Web, mobile, visual merchandising, and word of mouth - indicates that advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, public relations, personal selling, mobile, visual merchandising, and word of mouth have significant impact on IMC activities. In addition to the result similar to those of previous studies that such marketing communication means as word of mouth, advertising, personal selling and sales promotion, in particular, play very important roles, a notable finding of this study is that visual merchandising performed by department stores is shown to have very significant impact on IMC activities. On a separate note, it is also noteworthy that Internet marketing activities engaged by department stores are not shown to have significant impact on IMC attitudes. Secondly, the test of the hypothesis on the relation between IMC attitudes and brand loyalty attests that IMC attitudes for the distribution industry significantly affect brand loyalty. Thirdly, the test of the hypothesis concerning the relation between IMC attitudes and repurchase intention confirms that IMC attitudes for the distribution industry significantly affect repurchase intention. Fourthly, the test of the hypothesis concerning the relation between brand loyalty and repurchase intention indicates that brand loyalty significantly affect repurchase intention. A comprehensive view of these findings points to the conclusion that the IMC activities for the distribution industry do affect IMC attitudes, brand loyalty, and repurchase intention.

J	Niederhut-Bollmann, C; Theuvsen, L				Niederhut-Bollmann, Christoph; Theuvsen, Ludwig			Strategic management in turbulent markets: The case of the German and Croatian brewing industries	JOURNAL OF EAST EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Brewing industry; Croatia; competitv analysis; strategic management		European beer markets are characterized by major changes that are forcing breweries to redesign their competitive strategies. In this paper, we analyze the changes in the German and Croatian brewing industries by referring to Porter's five forces model and generic strategies framework. The analysis reveals growing competitive pressures in both markets and a wide spectrum of competitive strategies. Whereas in Germany cost leaders have gained market shares, the Croatian market is strongly influenced by the differentiation strategies of multinational brewing groups and medium-prized local brands. A comparison of the market characteristics and firm strategies in Germany and Croatia and some theoretical and managerial implications close the paper.

J	Ojanen, V; Salmi, P; Torkkeli, M				Ojanen, Ville; Salmi, Pekka; Torkkeli, Marko			Cross-border acquisitions in technical engineering sector: motives, trends and effects in finnish consultancies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Engineering; services; mergers; acquisitions; M&A; cross-border		The objective of this study is to explore the cross-border acquisitions - purchases and sales - of Finnish engineering consulting firms during the years of 1997-2006 in terms of the amount of transactions and the geographical distribution of acquiring and target nations. The focus area of the study - the technical engineering and consulting business - is a significant sub-sector of technology-related knowledge-intensive business services, which have strongly gained the interest of both practitioners and academic researchers in recent years. The methods utilized in this study consisted of literature reviews in the above-mentioned focus areas, the deal analysis of Finnish engineering consultancies on the basis of Thomson ONE Banker database, as well as the use of secondary data such as annual reports and expert opinions for complementing the analysis. The motives and intended effects of acquisitions were studied and compared to literature reviews and general industry characteristics. Results show that product and market extensions are the most significant types of cross-border acquisitions, which is in line with the existing literature. Expansion and other strategic motives can be seen in the study, but in spite of the increased significance of knowledge-intensity and innovativeness in many industries, knowledge acquisition for promoting innovation and R&D capabilities is not so apparent in the motives. Moreover, the geographical distribution in the Finnish sample does not yet clearly indicate a global movement of the industry towards the east. However, the strategies for market extensions of these knowledge-intensive firms in many cases seem to be implemented by other types of organizational changes than cross-border acquisitions. The results of the study provide several possibilities for in-depth further studies of the motives and effects of acquisitions and future comparative studies of other geographical areas.

J	Rahman, Z; Qureshi, MN				Rahman, Zillur; Qureshi, M. N.			LIFENET hospitals (India): developing new services' case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Health services; Medical management; Managed care; Quality function deployment; India	CARE; COUNTRIES	Purpose - Indian healthcare is in the process of offering a plethora of services to customers hailing largely from India and from neighboring countries. The Indian hospital sector consists of private "nursing homes" and government and charitable missionary hospitals. Government and missionary hospitals determine their charges according to patients' income levels and treat poor patients freely. Nursing homes charged higher, market-determined rates. They offer services in just a few medical specialties, owned and operated by physicians who worked with them. Nursing homes cannot afford the latest medical technology, but they provide more intimate settings than government hospitals. This case study aims to demonstrate the various strategic options available to a for-profit hospital, in an emerging economy with a burgeoning middle-class population and how it can choose which services that it can best offer to its target population. Design/methodology/approach - Diagnosing and treating complex ailments in nursing homes could be a time-consuming and expensive proposition as visits to several nursing homes with different specialties may be necessary. This paper demonstrates how an hospital can develop new customer-oriented services and eliminate the hassle for patients needing to run around different healthcare outlets even for minor ailments. Findings - The paper finds that large government hospitals generally have better facilities than nursing homes, but they were widely believed to provide poor-quality care. They failed to keep up with advanced equipment, train their technicians adequately and did not publicize their capabilities to doctors who might refer patients. Many missionary and charitable hospitals were undercapitalized and did not offer all services. These conditions left an unsatisfied demand for high-quality medical care. In 1983, LIFENET opened in Madras, becoming the first comprehensive, for-profit hospital in India. LIFENET, invested in a cardiology laboratory and clinics with capacity to diagnose heart and lung ailments, which grew through referrals it received from other doctors. Originality/value - Out of promoters' shared vision and the persistence to overcome financial and regulatory hurdles, LIFENET turned into a super specialty hospital. In early 2004, LIFENET promoters considered several options for expansion. In addition to building more hospitals, they considered licensing the brand name and establishing India's first health maintenance organization.

J	Ratnatunga, J				Ratnatunga, Janek			Strategic quality management in an internationalised university department: a case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quality management; Strategic management; International accounting; Higher education; Australia		Purpose - In the early 1990s, a number of controversial and radical initiatives were introduced by the Australian Government that had a compounded impact on higher education in general, and for the teaching of accounting studies in particular. The impacts of these initiatives have nowlasted well over a decade. The purpose of this paper is to address this situation. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a case-study approach to study the quality management objectives and strategies of an accounting department, to survive and prosper in this changing academic environment, initially as an independent entity in the period 1990-1996, and thereafter from 1997 to 2006 as a merged entity with another accounting department in the same university that was an internal competitor in the earlier period. Findings - It is demonstrated that the department was largely successful in climbing from a position of significant under-achievement amongst its peers in 1990, to one of strength in terms of both research performance and entrepreneurship by 1994. However, continual re-structuring of the department by the university has resulted in a loss of synergy and a decline in the latter periods of the study. Practical implications - This case is of particular interest to educators who are coping with the issues of "balance" between teaching and research, and to those interested in seeing how a department implemented a comprehensive quality management programme largely in keeping with the framework provided by the Higher Education Council. Originality/value - The value of the paper is that it provides many useful insights on many diverse issues to those universities and their departments which wish to operate in a globalised environment.

J	Ravichandran, N				Ravichandran, N.			MANAGING BULLWHIP EFFECT: TWO CASE STUDIES	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						India; Supply chain management; Demand management; Consumer durables		Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present two examples based on real life experiences where the Bullwhip effect (BWE) in supply chain is considerably reduced. Both examples relate to the consumer durables industry in India. Design/methodology/approach: The first example uses enterprise resource planning and vendor managed inventory as tools to reduce the BWE. The second example uses a modification of the classical inventory control policies to eliminate BWE. Research limitations/implications: This paper could initiate research in an area which would help supply chain researchers and managers to understand why some companies are able to contain BWE and others are not. Findings: Based on these two empirical case studies, the paper argues that managing BWE is a strategic initiative by organization and the best approach is a combination of several tactical initiatives. Originality/value: This paper briefly summarizes the managerial approaches to tame BWE in two different contexts. The two examples have some similarities, differences and offer unique insights related to managing BWE.

Perspective on Department of Energy Geospatial Science: Past, Present, and Future	JOURNAL OF MAP & GEOGRAPHY LIBRARIES			English	Article						U.S. Department of Energy; geospatial sciences; GIS; energy; environmental stewardship; outreach; national security	EDUCATION	For many decades, the Department of Energy (DOE) has been an international leader in basic scientific and engineering research that utilizes geospatial science to advance the state of knowledge in disciplines impacting national security, energy sustainability, environmental stewardship, and associated basic research. However, the realized benefits from cross-cutting geospatial science contributions have fallen short of what they could have been with greater collaboration across the DOE complex, stronger emphasis on core geographic information science (GIScience) research and development to support advanced applications, increased strategic institutional support (e.g., for management of legacy data), and additional education and outreach concerning how geospatial science can benefit DOE programs and operations. We propose a vision for DOE's geospatial science based on expanded collaboration to address major national problems, additional advanced GIScience research and development, and a long-term strategy to better manage DOE's geospatial science resources (personnel, facilities, shared data, etc.).

J	Richardson, AJ				Richardson, Alan J.			Organizational Founding, Strategic Renewal, and the Role of Accounting: Management Accounting Concepts in the Formation of the "Penny Post''	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						strategic renewal; Penny Post; Rowland Hill; post office reform		Organizational strategies, processes, and procedures may become institutionalized during the early history of an organization, leading to dysfunctional rigidities when the environment changes. The postal system worldwide is under significant pressure to change its business model, including rescinding the provision of universal service and uniform pricing, as the posts are privatized and opened to competition. Cost accounting has become a key mechanism to achieve reform in the postal system. But is the introduction of a cost-based logic new to the design of post office reforms? Were the core policies of the post office originally developed without reference to cost? This paper analyzes the key document in the creation of the current postal business model: Rowland Hill's (1837) "Post Office Reform: Its Importance and Practicability.'' The pamphlet shows a basic understanding of economic concepts including the elasticity of demand and opportunity costs as well as implementing practical accounting techniques that we now call value chain analysis, cost behavior analysis, activity-based costing and activity-based management, and target costing. This paper provides an analysis of Hill's logic from the perspective of current management accounting techniques and terminology. It illustrates the use of management accounting in the reformation of social institutions and provides a rare example of the early decision-making use of management accounting concepts.

Success Factors in the Implementation of Strategic Information Systems: An Empirical Investigation of Public Sector Undertakings in India	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Strategic Information Systems; Public Sector Undertakings; Information Technology; Strategic Information System Planning; Information System Strategies		Understanding Strategic Information Systems (SIS) implementation is an important challenge to organizations. It is considered important because Information Technology (TT) decisions about investment are made worldwide and these decisions have the impact on the survival and growth of the organizations. In this context, SIS should be implemented very carefully so that right, timely and accurate information should be available to the managers, who are responsible for taking strategic decisions. Review of literature indicated the clear gaps existing in the implementation of Strategic Information Systems in general and in the Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) of India in particular. Keeping the research gaps in this area in mind, we have undertaken this study in Indian PSUs so as to investigate the factors affecting the implementation of SIS. Organizational Culture, High Turnover of Professionals, Management Involvement, Collaboration, Systems Standards, Resources Implementation, Resources Availability, Market Competition, Organizational Bureaucracy and Organizational Autocracy are emerged as the successful factors which must be taken care of while implementing SIS in Indian PSUs.

J	Shami, M				Shami, Manar			Solid waste sustainability related to building deconstruction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction and Demolition; C&D model; deconstruction; deconstruction technologies; green construction; recycling; reuse issues; safety issues; social issues; sustainability; tipping fees		This paper discusses various issues of sustainability in relation to solid waste and building deconstruction. Four major themes are researched: (1) the major challenges in the deconstruction and demolition processes, (2) the monetary and social impacts of deconstruction, (3) the decision criteria for deconstruction vs. demolition and (4) the strategic issues in deconstruction and lessons learned from past case studies. Data collected and presented provide detailed assessment of available deconstruction technologies and materials' recycling and reuse methods. The benefits of deconstruction lead to reduce the impacts on the nation's virgin materials, energy demand and landfill space. Tipping fees of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste represents a determining factor for the economic health of the deconstruction industry. The model presented shows a steady trend in devising innovative technologies that help in reusing and recycling C&D waste. Should this trend continue through the next decade, full diversion rates and recycling becomes a possibility.

Recent developments in these industries demand a re-evaluation of traditional explanations of these choices as resource constraints mandate collaborative organisational forms while the potential for proprietary knowledge dissipation cautions towards greater control.

J	Svensson, G				Svensson, Goeran			The Industrial / Societal Bullwhip Effects and Supply Chain Performance	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			Korean	Article						Bullwhip effect; supply chain performance; industrial; societal; two-way; mlcro; macro		The objective of this paper is to describe the construct of bullwhip effect beyond supply chains, namely at industrial and societal levels. The author provides a conceptual discussion of the bullwhip effect - its derivation is extended, and the positioning of the construct is broadened. The bullwhip effect has been explored within intra-organisational and inter-organisational supply chains. A broader descriptive framework is introduced, one that positions the bullwhip effect construct at industrial and societal levels. A conceptual framework is provided that bridges the interface between the micro and macro environments of the bullwhip effect construct, but further conceptualization is required. The introduced derivation and positioning of the bullwhip effect construct reveal a number of research potentials. A principal one is that the exploration of the construct may consider the industrial and/or the societal environment when the bullwhip effect is studied in supply chains. The extended derivation and broadened positioning of the bullwhip effect in the overall environment is of interest to practitioners. It stresses the importance of contextual factors in operative, tactical and strategic supply chain performance. The principal contributions are: a) an interface between micro and macro levels in supply chain performance contributing to an extended derivation of the bullwhip effect; b) a typology of the bullwhip effect contributing to broadening the positioning of the same construct; c) the bullwhip effect being seen as two-way view construct at the micro level and d) a framework ofmanagerial implications. Most important of all is that the causes and effects of the bullwhip effect have been addressed in a wider context that so far has been underestimated in literature.

Effect of grazing strategy, ryegrass overdrilling and herbicide application on vulpia content, tiller density and seed production in perennial pastures	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM; ANNUAL GRASSES; PLANT; COMPETITION; GROWTH; FASCICULATA; DYNAMICS; MANAGEMENT; DEMOGRAPHY; SEEDLINGS	Vulpia species C. C. Gmel. are annual grass weeds that can reduce the productivity of perennial pastures throughout southern Australia. To develop more effective strategies to manage vulpia, a 3-year experiment was established in western Victoria (average annual rainfall: 625 mm) comparing different methods currently used to control this weed. Overdrilling perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) seed and simazine application treatments were applied to phalaris (Phalaris aquatica L.) pastures that were set-stocked or rotationally grazed (either as a four-paddock or strategic rotation) with Merino ewes. The content of vulpia, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) and other annual grasses as a proportion of total dry matter increased, and the proportion of phalaris decreased in most grazing treatments throughout the experiment. The mean vulpia content was lowest and the phalaris content was highest in the four-paddock rotation, whereas vulpia content was greatest and phalaris content was lowest under set-stocking. Simazine application in June with or without ryegrass overdrilling reduced the number of vulpia tillers/m(2) in 2000 and 2001 and vulpia panicle production in 2000, although vulpia populations increased to pretreatment levels in herbicide-treated swards by 2002. The number of vulpia seeds in the soil seed bank was not affected by any of the treatments. The most effective treatment was a combination of ryegrass overdrilling and herbicide application in the four-paddock, rotationally grazed pastures. This experiment highlights the need for an integrated approach to manage vulpia since relying on herbicide application alone is ineffective. This is particularly the case when competitive pasture species are unable to adequately utilise available resources and prevent a recovery in vulpia populations.	[Tozer, K. N.; Chapman, D.

J	Tozzini, S				Tozzini, Sidney			Benchmark regulation in Brazil Potential strategic implications for electricity distribution utilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Regulation; Benchmarking; Brazil; Corporate strategy; Electricity industry		Purpose - The regulation model used by Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica (ANEEL) (Brazilian National Agency of Electric Energy) brings together the incentive regulation approach (price cap) and benchmarking practices to establish the "efficient" operational costs of regulated companies using a "shadow" or "reference" firm. The specific objective is to evaluate in what extent the adoption of the "reference firm" would condition the strategic goals of the regulated firms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses the correlation between the efficient operational costs set by the reference firm and operational variables of actual utilities during the first cycle of the periodic price revisions conducted by ANEEL from 2003 to 2006, for utilities with more than 400,000 consumer units. Findings - The analysis shows that the use of the reference firm promotes short-term efficiency goals for regulated utilities (thus promoting the maintenance of their existent structure). However, it would restrain their technological updating (long-term efficiency) and their adjustment to meet future demand growth (both vertical and horizontal). Research limitations/implications - The analysis comprises a sample of 28 utilities with more than 400,000 consumer units and a limited set of physical and economic variables. The study could be improved with the inclusion a number of additional economic and physical variables coupled with the use of additional statistical tools to further test its results for the next cycle of periodic price reviews (2007-2010). Originality/value - The study is a first quantitative attempt to analyze the relationship between economic regulation and its consequences upon the strategic management of the utilities conducted in the energy distribution industry in Brazil.

J	Carbo-Valverde, S				Carbo-Valverde, Santiago			Implications of Basel II for Different Bank Ownership Patterns in Europe	ATLANTIC ECONOMIC JOURNAL			English	Article						Capital adequacy; Bank ownership; Regulation		This paper explains that Basel II has different implications for stakeholder-owned (mutual) and stockholder banks in the European Union. Some strategic paths for stakeholder-owned banks are proposed as a response to the Stockholder Value Maximization goals Basel II implicitly advances. Even though empirical evidence indicates that capital strength and risk-taking exposures do not differ across bank ownership structures, SME lending and other characteristic specializations of stakeholder banks promise to generate high capital charges. However, improved corporate-governance practices and cooperative securitization and risk-management activities can reduce the compliance costs and risk-taking constraints mutual banks might experience from shifting to a Stakeholder Value Maximization Model. For all EU banks irrespective of their ownership structure, the analysis stresses that establishing an incentive-compatible cross-country safety-net scheme poses a critical challenge.

(Onno)			ALIGNING R&D TO BUSINESS - A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF BU CUSTOMER VALUE IN R&D	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						R&D customer value; R&D performance; strategic alignment; gap analysis	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MARKET ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE	In large technology-based firms, especially in long life cycle industries, often a tension exists between corporate R&D and the business unit (BU) customers. The long term R&D orientation needed to come to the more radical (even disruptive) innovations for the long term survival of the prospector firm being at odds with the need of the BUs for more incremental "sustaining" innovations for their day-to-day activities. This paper takes a new approach to this problem by analyzing the corporate R&D to business relationship from a customer value perspective by identifying R&D flexibility, R&D communication, strategic alignment and R&D performance as the main attributes of the value map of the BU customers of corporate R&D. We then present the Cusvalin instrument (Customer Value Learning in INnovation) that was constructed to overcome the R&D to business incongruence by providing feedback on the gaps between the value maps of R&D and their BU customers. This instrument has been tested in a longitudinal survey from 1997 through 2002 (696 respondents) in a large technology-based supplier company (+/- 30 000 employees world wide). It is concluded that the Cusvalin model is an effective instrument to monitor the strategic alignment of R&D and the BUs, and ultimately leads to better R&D performance, as perceived by the BU customers. From the longitudinal analysis it is concluded that a system that balances radical innovation (via Technology Board-funding, in which R&D management, headquarters, and BU directors jointly decide on long-term radical R&D projects) and incremental innovation (via BU unit-funding) is effective in providing strategic alignment between R&D and business.

J	Sen, SK; Swierczek, FW				Sen, Salil; Swierczek, Fredric			Societal, Environmental and Stakeholder Value Drivers: A Case Analysis of US and Asian International Firms	JOURNAL OF HUMAN VALUES			English	Article								There is a shift in the role of business in society where societal, environmental and stakeholder value drivers could reshape the basis of economic competitive advantage. Investors are willing to pay a premium for well-governed companies because of positive perceptions of CSR. Organizations respond to the value drivers to endure and function effectively along the societal, environmental and stakeholder dimensions. In this article case analysis is performed for four international firms, chosen from USA/Europe and Asia, with distinguished records of sustainability. The case studies were based on the company sustainability reports and related material published in EthicalCorp, CSRWire and Covalence online publications. Assessments were performed using publicly available information. The non-parametric correlation analysis shows that firms with better commitment to CSR respond more to societal, environmental and stakeholder drivers through strategic initiatives. This improves their competitive advantage as assessed by economic value added.

However, the magnitude of funds leveraged and the factors that facilitate success in leveraging are rarely researched, An example of one of these grant-funded initiatives is the National Turning Point Initiative. Twenty-one states received funding from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as part of this initiative to establish and implement strategic goals for achieving significant statewide public health system improvement through diverse, cross-sector partnerships. Leaders from 17 of these 21 states participated in a two-phased study regarding the leveraging of additional funds for their public health infrastructure improvement activities, This article reports on the second phase of the study. In this phase, key informant interviews were conducted to examine how leveraging of resources occurred as part of this large national initiative. Findings indicate that the combination of a comprehensive planning process and a broad-based partnership was crucial in securing resources to expand their efforts. The ability to strategically respond to unexpected events and opportunities also helped states use their plans and partnerships to "make the case" for additional resources to improve their public health infrastructure.

After discussing some of the theoretical and conceptual aspects, some empirical cases of alliances in the field of German trade fair organizers are given. This article provides an overview of existing alliances and cooperation agreements between German fair organizers on an, international and national basis. Motives to form alliances on an international basis include cost and risk sharing as well as learning and entering a foreign market These motives are consistent with the form of alliance the trade fair organizers choose in many instances, the joint venture.

J	Kim, C; Galliers, RD; Yang, KH; Kim, J				Kim, Changsu; Galliers, Robert D.; Yang, Kyung Hoon; Kim, Jaekyung			Evolution of Web-Based Shopping Systems: Characteristics and Strategies	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN ORGANIZATIONS			English	Article						strategy; Web-based shopping systems (WBSS)		This article offers a theoretical analysis of evolutionary processes in WBSS strategies. For that purpose, we propose a research model that shows strategy patterns. Based upon the model, we identified several types of strategies. In our research model, WBSS are classified into four types: (1) general-direct-sales (GDS); (2) general-intermediary-sales (GIS); (3) specialized-direct-sales (SDS); and (4) specialized-intermediary-sales (SIS). On the basis of these four categories of WBSS, we analyze the characteristics of WBSS and suggest five evolution strategies for WBSS, which have implications for both theory and practice. Amazon.com's strategic movements, such as product line expansion through alliance and acquisition, provide an exemplary case of the evolution of WBSS strategy. We expect that this research will serve as a guide for Internet businesses and as a catalyst for new research agendas relevant to Web-based shopping and electronic commerce.

J	Kristiansson, MR				Kristiansson, Michael Rene			Strategic reflexive conversation - a new theoretical-practice field within LIS	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article								Introduction. The traditional competences as possessed by libraries and libraries are challenged by changes in users' behaviour. In addressing and responding to current and upcoming challenges, a range of development projects will be implemented in a number of libraries. Method. A Modus 2 inspired action research model labelled strategic reflexive conversation has been developed, which facilitates the conduct of three concrete public library development projects that are conceived as a research-based experiment to be undertaken jointly with library practitioners. Scenario workshops and scenario interviews were relied on as structural context. The present researcher intervened into the practitioners' discussion adhering to the principles of scenario planning and action research. Analysis. Discursive strategies of analysis were applied. The analytic object was the development in participants' discussing centring on the library development projects to be implemented Results. Throughout the process, practitioners developed a new kind of strategic language along with a new understanding of their respective library development projects. In this way, the action research model - defined as strategic reflexive conversation - demonstrated its feasibility and practical applicability. Conclusions. As an outcome of the research experiment reported here a new innovative perspective on and a new practice for library development has been developed. The concept of strategic reflexive conversation can be considered of importance to both action research ( researchers) and library development ( practitioners) in LIS.

Employee turnover: an HR risk with firm-specific context	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RISK			English	Article								The purpose of this paper is to determine the elements that have the most significant influence on employees decisions to remain engaged and employed at a particular firm. Moreover, the paper seeks to describe the importance of retaining critical core employees and developing strategies to enhance employee retention practices. The results of this expos can be used by firms to: (a) develop policies, practices and strategies that would enable the firm to identify key risk indicators, which allow management to capture the early warning signs of employee disengagement; (b) secure higher levels of employee retention; and (c) create greater efficiencies in meeting strategic business objectives.

Mapping the Knowledge Management Domain of Ideas: Evidence from a Practice Group	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						community of practice; concept map; knowledge management; KM; sense making		This article adds to our understanding of the field of knowledge management as an evolving body of concepts, relationships, strategies, and practices. Using qualitative research methods, we examined the activities of a community of practice for knowledge management professionals operating in a large metropolitan U.S. city. Through the analysis, we produced an organizing framework that maps KM topics according to the tactical-strategic orientation of the KM issue and level of analysis (individual-group-enterprise). We constructed and populated the framework based on a content analysis of 44 presentations made from 2001-2005, from survey data, from interviews conducted with key informants, and from data collected as participant-observers. The work provides insight into the decision-making processes regarding the selection of KM topics and adds to our understanding of collective sense making (Weick, 1995) based on the differing needs, values, and perceptions of the multiple stakeholders in this KM community of practice.

Local public health certification and accreditation in Illinois: Blending the old and the new	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						accreditation; local public health practice; performance measurement		Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through the Multi-State Learning Collaborative, the Illinois Accreditation Development Project is developing a proposal to reengineer the 15-year-old Illinois local health department certification process. The Project is addressing a variety of political, technical, and resource issues in its attempt to develop a new approach to a mature program that will incorporate more meaningful performance and capacity measures for all local public health practice standards. Both statewide strategic planning and the evolving national momentum toward local public health agency accreditation are motivating the enhancements to the Illinois program. A new proposal that blends the current mandatory certification program with a new voluntary local public health accreditation program is discussed. The proposed new structure enhances the state-operated certification program with specific performance measures and creates a three-tiered voluntary accreditation process governed by a third party accreditation board.

R&D knowledge flows and spillovers are the results of non-cooperative games played between neighboring agents in the model. The model demonstrates a situation where no agents have incentives to hide their economic knowledge, a situation that is observed in open source software development projects. The likelihood of obtaining a stable situation where new economic knowledge is openly shared is increased when heterogeneity of agents is introduced.

J	Chen, YJ; Tung, CP				Chen, Yun-Ju; Tung, Ching-Pin			New criteria for sustainable water quality management	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						cumulative impact; carrying capacity; sustainability; watershed management; pollutant loading; QUAL2E	RIVER BASIN; MODEL	New criteria, pollutant load of unit area (PLUA), are developed for sustainable water quality management, which not only avoids degrading water quality but also considers the equity of development between different generations. A simulation-optimization model is established to determine PLUA, in which uses the QUAL2E model to simulate pollutant transport and formulates a linear programming model to optimize the objective of maximal loads (carrying capacity). Two watersheds, the Touchen creek and the Keya creek, both in Taiwan, are taken as case studies. The PLUA criterion is applied to several existing projects which have passed environmental impact assessment (EIA). The results show that if the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park discharges wastewater to the Touchen creek, the total pollutant discharge of 85.6 kg/day exceeds the allocated load. Consequently, a waste reduction of at least 23.4% is required. Although these existing projects have passed EIA, most of them violate the criterion of PLUA and thus contribute to continued degradation of water quality. This study suggests developing PLUA as a part of the process of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for watershed management plans and then applying it to EIA as a criterion for new project assessment. Furthermore, if carrying capacities of all pollutant discharges and resource uses can be translated into loads per unit of area, an integrated sustainable watershed management plan can be developed.

J	Heifetz, A; Ponsati, C				Heifetz, Aviad; Ponsati, Clara			All in good time	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME THEORY			English	Article						issue-by-issue bargaining; endogenous agenda; asymmetric information	BY-ISSUE NEGOTIATIONS; 2-SIDED UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGIC DELAY; AGENDA; INFORMATION	Why is issue-by-issue bargaining a common phenomenon, even though it disallows the beneficial trade-offs across issues that are possible when negotiating a global solution? We show that under asymmetric information, issue-by-issue bargaining has two attractive features. First, it avoids bundling a good deal on one issue with a bad deal on another issue, when the lack of gains to agreement on the latter is not a priori common knowledge. Second, it avoids the imposition of the asymmetric information inefficiency of "harder" issues on issues which turn to be "easier" to solve. That's why when the agenda is not imposed on the parties but is rather left for them to determine when negotiating, they may very well opt for issue-by-issue bargaining. We demonstrate this in a natural game where bargainers communicate, whenever they choose to do so, their willingness to discuss or make offers either on one of the issues or on a bundle of issues.

J	Samson, EG; Mendoza, TC				Samson, Emmanuel G.; Mendoza, Teodoro C.			Applications of the total quality management (TQM) framework to sugarcane production	PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						hardware; humanware; large farms; medium farms; small farms; software; sugarcane; total quality management; TQM		Sugar yields in 12 mill districts of Negros Occidental were assessed using Total Quality Management (TQM) indicators: hardware (101 indicators), humanware (78) and software (11). The farms were clustered into 3: large farms (more than 100 ha), medium (25 to 100 ha) and small farms (24 ha and below). Data were gathered through formal survey and the TQM variables were analyzed through stepwise multiple regression analysis, to identify TQM indicators for high sugar yields within the clusters. TQM was not farm-size dependent and not exclusively practiced by the big farms; however, it was TQM that spelled the difference in yield between and among farm clusters. The results indicate that increasing further sugar yields requires improvements not only in one or two but all of the three indicators of TQM The hardware (process, product control and continuous improvements), humanware (humans and relationships) and software (strategic planning and information) were found to be interrelated with each other. The new outlook requires that sugarcane production not only consider the biophysical and technology aspects of production but also include the human element. Better care and management of the workers translated to higher sugar yields. Giving proper incentives and providing better living conditions among farm workers (humanware) were found important requisites to achieving high yields particularly in large farms where yields were already higher than the medium and small farms. There were already sugarcane planters (6%) obtaining high sugar yields (10 that and above). It means the TQM culture is already here. Providing the enabling conditions so that most if not all farmers can achieve high yield levels will satisfy the increasing demand for sugar in the future.

The proposed knowledge classification framework classifies horizontal knowledge areas into customer, product, and process, and vertical knowledge hierarchies into strategic, conceptual, and operational. This provides useful strategic and operations insights in KM for MC. The classification framework explained different methods of knowledge process operations and different KM strategies. Therefore, firms intending to implement KM for MC need to consider the differentiated characteristics of classified knowledge areas and hierarchies. This study was conducted through focused interviews on practitioners from companies providing MC.

J	Dougherty, D				Dougherty, Deborah			CONTINGENT ORGANISING FOR GAMES OF INNOVATION: DIVERSE CONFIGURATIONS OF CORE PRINCIPLES FOR INNOVATIVE ORGANISATIONAL DESIGN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovative organizing; organizing principles; contingent organizing		This paper leverages current thinking on organising for innovation to create new ideas on contingent organising for innovation. I argue that all successfully innovative organisations need to be built on the same higher-level principles of innovative organising, but the relative emphasis on which principles and how they are implemented will vary by game of innovation. I focus on four organising activities: defining the work that will be done, differentiating that work into coherent units, integrating those differentiated units, and controlling the whole system over time. I synthesise the literature into four principles of innovative organising: defining innovative work as professional practice; differentiating innovative work into domains of practice; integrating these domains via strategic sensemaking, and controlling the work with social rules. Finally, particular configurations of these principles are developed for various MINE games of innovation, based on the dynamics of each game.

J	Miller, R; Olleros, X				Miller, Roger; Olleros, Xavier			THE DYNAMICS OF GAMES OF INNOVATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategy; value creation; heterogeneity; innovation; strategic logic; eco-system; dominant logic	SYSTEMS	Many executives see innovation as an unmanageable process, riddled with risks. The research we conducted with the Industrial Research Institute, interviewing over 200 vicepresidents of research and development and chief technical officers in many sectors around the world, yields a more nuanced view. Innovation becomes manageable once managers move away from normative prescriptions that view the process as uniform and recognise that different rules and practices apply to different circumstances. Our argument is that clusters of interdependent firms contributing to the building of a set of interacting products and services tend to self-organise themselves into distinct and relatively persistent "games of innovation". Such games operate at a meso level of analysis, grouping together many complementary agents, such as competitors, suppliers, public regulators, universities, innovation-support agencies, and venture capitalists. Six games of innovation, each with a distinct set of rules for innovating, have been identified around value-creation exchanges between buyers and sellers. Three games focus on market creation: "patent-driven discovery", "systems integration" and "platform orchestration". Marketmaintenance games are "cost-based competition", "systems extension and engineering" and "customised mass production". The perspective proposed in this paper recognises that heterogeneous innovation patterns and strategies can coexist within a single industrial sector and that the same game can be played in many sectors. Specific conditions call for distinct rules and practices. Customer expectations, for example, are central in some games but almost irrelevant in others. Rules for managing innovation are neither generic best practices that can be applied universally nor narrow industry recipes. They are game-and role-specific ways to create and capture market value.

J	Randles, TJ; Blades, CD				Randles, Theodore; Blades, Chris			Creating Explanations That Guide and Motivate	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						KBS explanation facilities; knowledge types; knowledge continuum; video analysis; contextual maps; explanations		Based on a description of a knowledge continuum and on the knowledge combustion and vehicle analogy, problems regarding the explanation facilities of knowledgebased systems (KBS) are addressed. Furthermore, drawing from the lessons learned from the analysis of the video recordings of medical diagnostic telemedicine consultations, a new approach for developing justification and strategic explanation facilities for KBS is presented. Rather than enabling computers to make profound decisions and generate convincing explanations, which is not technically feasible according to the knowledge continuum, the development of a KBS that provides relevant explanations for specific diagnostic situations is proposed. The knowledge continuum indicates that there is a narrow gap between information, declarative knowledge and some types of pragmatic knowledge. To take advantage of this knowledge characteristic, the creation of a hybrid knowledge type that integrates several more explicit knowledge types through simple processes of extraction, representation, analysis, modelling and editing is proposed.

J	Rousseau, L				Rousseau, Louise			Are there organisational barriers in vaccination accessibility against influenza and pneumococcus?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			French	Article							ADULTS	Context: Despite the implementation of a Quebec immunization program against influenza and pneumococcal disease (PQIIP), vaccine coverage has remained low. There have been many studies on personal barriers to vaccination, but few have explored other kinds of barriers. Objectives: To explore the presence of barriers in relation to the organization of the health care system and to propose recommendations for increasing vaccine coverage. Methods: Within a mixed protocol, a phone survey of 996 people in the target population and a case study implicating the follow-up of the PQIIP with all the site and actor categories via 43 semi-structured interviews and 4 focus groups were realized. Survey data underwent a descriptive statistical analysis. Qualitative analysis followed the Miles and Huberman approach. Results: The results indicate the presence of barriers with regard to information accessibility. These include access to: the physicians' recommendation, knowledge of the efficacy or the security of vaccines, and admissibility of clients to the PQIIP. Organizational barriers were also found to limit access to vaccination, especially in terms of restricted choices of time and location. Coordination and incentives mechanisms are not optimal. Removal of organizational barriers depends more on strategic rather than structural factors. Conclusion: Addressing organizational barriers should be an important component of strategies aimed at improving vaccine coverage. Public health authorities should focus on strategic management of the information and inter-organizational environment.

J	Andrikopoulos, A; Koronis, E				Andrikopoulos, Andreas; Koronis, Epaminondas			Reputation performance: a portfolio selection approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						reputation performance; corporate reputation; modern portfolio theory; business strategy; organisational risk		This paper introduces a normative view on corporate reputation strategic management. Reputation performance is conceptualised as the outcome of complex processes and social interactions and the lack of a holistic reputation performance management framework is identified. In an attempt to fill this gap, a portfolio-based approach is put forward. Drawing on the foundations of modern portfolio theory we create a portfolio-based reputation management algorithmic model where reputation components and priorities are weighted by decision makers and shape organisational change in an attempt to formulate a corporate reputation strategy. The rationale of this paper is based on the foundational consideration of organisations as choosing the optimal strategy by seeking to maximise their reputation performance while maintaining organisational stability and minimising organisational risk.

J	Braziel, C; Thal, AE; Weir, JD				Braziel, Carlos; Thal, Alfred; Weir, Jeffrey			Evaluating the effectiveness of utility privatization efforts	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public sector organizations; Privatization; Strategic evaluation; Decision making; Strategic planning; United States of America		Purpose - Government-owned utility systems at many locations are old, obsolete, and unreliable. Replacement of these systems has become more technically and operationally complex, thereby making them more difficult for personnel to operate and maintain. In response, some governmental agencies are conveying ownership of these systems to the private sector through utility privatization as a way to efficiently operate and upgrade them. For utility privatization to be successful though, independent audits are necessary to ensure desired quantitative and qualitative factors are balanced. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach - The paper explains how the value-focused thinking (VFT) methodology was used to develop a multi-objective decision analysis (MODA) model to determine the effectiveness of utility privatization efforts. Findings - The VFT MODA model was determined to be a suitable tool to evaluate a complex decision problem such as utility system evaluation. The model captured 28 values and 47 measures relating to utility privatization program's objective of improving the overall quality, reliability, and responsiveness of utility systems. Research limitations/implications - The VFT MODA model lacks real-world data for evaluation, senior leader stakeholder input and a value and measure to evaluate energy efficiency. Practical implications - The paper provides organizations faced with utility privatization decisions with an effective decision-analysis tool. Originality/value - The paper explores the first documented use of VFT to assist organizations and governments in providing insight into the performance of its privatized utility systems.

J	Erskine, JGP				Erskine, Jonathan G. P.			The West Wansdyke: an appraisal of the dating, dimensions and construction techniques in the light of excavated evidence	ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								The West Wansdyke is a major earthwork in the former County of Avon, now Bath and North-East Somerset, which is thought to date to either the late Roman or early post-Roman periods. A series of cross-sections excavated across the earthwork showed, firstly, that it originally existed in some areas where there are no longer any visible remains, but, secondly, that there are still some unexplained gaps. The research suggests that the monument was of a very consistent and uniform design and dimensions, a feature which implies strategic planning and co-ordinated management during construction. Evidence from two particular sites, Blackrock Lane and Compton Green, indicated that significant stretches of the dyke bank originally had a timber revetment, but that, where it was easily available, stone was used, as at Binces Lane, Stantonbury. Little artefactual dating evidence was recovered during the work, although the presence of Romano-British and earlier pottery, and prehistoric flints from bank construction deposits does not preclude the established, post-Roman, context, but can also allow a late Roman date. Construction techniques indicate work in a Roman military tradition, possibly re-using an earlier structure.

Design/methodology/approach - After laying out the conceptual framework, and after giving a short description of the Spanish institutional landscape on corporate social responsibility (CSR), the paper focuses on SMEs and the practical issues relating to strategy design, core business and implementation as identified by managers and academics. Findings - The paper shows a joint venture and a strategic partnership between the Javier Benjumea Chair and a new small Spanish company, in which the partners start a process of mutual help and learning. That partnership is itself an interesting experiment as a case of collaboration between the enterprise and an academic institution. Research limitations/implications - This is only the first step in generating a model applied to improve CSR uptake at the SME level. Originality/value - The theoretical goal that is sought after in this paper is how to advance the design of a conceptual model and tools for analyzing and managing dynamically some of the most relevant intangible aspects of an SME, in order to improve its strategic management of the relationships with the stakeholders.

We discuss how the People's Republic of China's failure to strategically align its human resources activities with its national image enhancement goals for the Games could lead to a large scale public relations disaster. This discussion and the strategic model we develop can be generalized to any sized project, in any locale, for any goal, and by any entity. Much of the world will be watching the televised Beijing Olympic Games and following related developments in the news media, therefore, China's Olympics-related labor processes must align with the national image enhancement goal such that labor processes win world-wide approval. Further, if China can show that it is now using globally-perceived fair and ethical labor processes, then an additional benefit would be a reduction in labor-associated risks for all of its foreign investors' projects and businesses.

J	Khong, PW; Ren, RM				Khong PohWah; Ren RongMing			User acceptance of information technologies for enterprise development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Information and Communication Technologies; ICT; mobile commerce; user acceptance; World Trade Organisation; WTO		From the industrial revolution to the age of space travel, the same pattern keeps emerging. For a sustainable business process, the emphasis is no longer on raw technology but on how to make the new technology reliable, secure, inexpensive and easy to use. Products that used to require years for their development are now being produced in months or even weeks, and rushed to the market. Globalisation, technological advancement and change in legislation landscape have led to strategic shifts for enterprise development. The emergence of e-business, especially, has transformed the international trade landscape. As this development has the potential to benefit economic growth and living standards around the world, it is imperative that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) supports barrier-free e-commerce. Moreover, global competition combined with technological innovation has created an environment that opens a window of opportunity for enterprises. This paper outlines the challenges and issues of sustainable enterprise development in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) era. Through the findings of web-based-survey, user acceptance of a new business development is tested in the 'virtual world' by the intended users/customers. The experiences of these early users/customers are forwarded to the enterprises that make final decision.

J	Lee, J; Lee, Y				Lee, Jihyun; Lee, Yuri			Exploring how the effect of attributes varies with fashion product e-tailer type Based on Korea context	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fashion industry; Internet; Retailers; Consumer behaviour	INTERNET; ATTITUDES; SHOPPER	Purpose - The purpose of this study was to find different effects of e-tailer attributes on consumer attitude in fashion product purchase situations according to e-tailer types. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative study with a survey method was adopted to test the significance of the paths which construct the structural equation model. Findings - As a result of the study, e-tailers were classified into three types: comprehensive mall, fashion specialty mall, and limited brand mall. In addition three attribute dimensions were derived from the statistical analyses: transaction fulfillment, variety, and accessibility. Transaction fulfillment and variety were the critical dimensions for the comprehensive mall and the limited brand mall, whereas variety was the only significant dimension for the fashion specialty mall. According to the multi-group comparison, it was found that similar strategic implications can be applied to comprehensive and limited brand malls. Research limitations/implications - The variety dimension be further researched. With variety being equally important for all of the e-tailer types, specific sub-dimensions need to be identified. Originality/value - The paper provides value in classifying the e-tailer type and investigating the attributes.

J	Lowe, DJ; Emsley, MW; Harding, A				Lowe, David; Emsley, Margaret; Harding, Anthony			Relationships between total construction cost and design related variables	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction cost; client costs; design related variables		This paper seeks to redress the omission in recent literature on the influence of project strategic, site related and design related variables on the cost of construction. It presents, in part, the results of an investigation into the influence of 41 independent variables on both construction cost and client cost, concentrating on design related variables. Data were collected from 286 construction projects in the United Kingdom and correlation and test for differences were used to determine the relationships that exist between the dependent and independent variables. The analysis ascertains the cost ranking of many design related variables and establishes other relationships which exist within the data, confirming many of the relationships that had been anticipated from the literature. It also established the ordinal sequence of several nominal variables. These data, therefore, can be confidently used to develop models of the total cost of construction as verified by the development of both regression analysis and neural network cost models.

J	Maile, T; Fischer, M; Huijbregts, R				Maile, Tobias; Fischer, Martin; Huijbregts, Rick			The vision of integrated IP-based building systems	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE			English	Article						Real estate; Buildings; Facilities		Purpose - This paper aims to share the vision of integrated building systems based on internet protocol (IP) based on the presentations and facilitated discussions at the BuilConn: Cisco's Connected Real Estate Roundtable in Spring 2006. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the observation of the BuilConn Conference Roundtable and related literature, this paper lays out requirements to support IP- and computer-based integration of building systems. Findings - The authors detail the value proposition, challenges, and related engineering and business transformations of integrated building systems. While cost savings, new advanced services, and flexibility in building operations are the major benefits, the main challenges are the missing awareness and knowledge in the building industry, the educational gap among real estate professionals and owners, the implementation of appropriate security, the use of intelligent building technology, performance and cost saving issues, specific problems for building renovation projects, and the realization of reliable critical building operations. Furthermore, the balance between IP and non-IP devices, benefits of the IP itself, and the need for more elaborate standards were discussed at the Roundtable. The Roundtable participants identified the following critical transformations within the building project environment to make integrated IP-based building systems a reality: more flexible design, construction, and facility management contracts, earlier involvement of integration experts, and more flexibility in today's design process. Practical implications - The participants felt that only when these transformations are accomplished and the mentioned challenges resolved will companies be able to take full advantage of the benefits and realize the vision of integrated IP- based building systems. Originality/value - This paper summarizes the presentations and facilitated discussions at the Roundtable, which have, so far, only been accessible to the roundtable participants, and provides a reflecting point of view of participants from the building industry, building owners, and academic representatives on strategic and operational issues around IP- based building systems.

In the event of SNS deployment, state and local public health authorities must be prepared to receive, distribute, and dispense the materials. We propose a cache of supplies, termed the "POD go-kit," prepared in advance and locally available prior to the establishment of Points of Dispensing (POD) for SNS material. Characteristics of the preassembled go-kit are its multiplicity of use, ease of storage and transportation, minimal redundancy with SNS material, and packaging in a manner consistent with POD function. The POD go-kit is assembled into 4 separate "subkits": administrative supplies, patient routing supplies, dispensing supplies; and POD staff protection supplies. Incorporating existing practices from the SNS Listserv, this article itemizes the contents of the POD go-kit and its subkits and provides a rationale for its packaging. The Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) has not certified the proposed "POD go-kit" as a standardized POD go-kit.

J	Muyeed, AA				Muyeed, A. A.			Barrel Composting of Domestic Solid Waste in Bangladesh: A Case Study	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION			English	Article						Barrel composting; domestic solid waste; food waste		The solid waste in most of the urban centres in Bangladesh contains a very high proportion of biodegradable organic fraction. Thus the management of this organic fraction of solid waste is becoming a very important strategic option to minimize severe environmental pollution resulting from mismanagement of solid waste in many urban areas. The organic fraction of solid waste can be composted to reduce the volume of the waste and the compost can be used as soil conditioner. This paper summarizes one year long applied research on barrel composting plants undertaken to design an efficient small-scale plant for composting biodegradable portion of solid waste in Bangladesh. Selected environmental parameters were measured to assess the environmental conditions of digestion processes during composting of solid waste in these barrel-composting plants. The study included determination of chemical and microbial quality of compost produced of these composting plants for the effective use of compost as soil conditioner.	[Muyeed, A.

Interviews with senior-level and IT managers in Chilean firms revealed a positive business climate, advanced hardware/software infrastructure, and significant utilization of computing resources. The strategic use of DSSs was much more limited. A modified Unified Theory of and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was developed to examine cultural aspects that explain DSS adoption in Chile. The model shows that DSSs are implemented as a result of immediate business requirements rather than their potential to yield future competitive advantage; senior management supports investment in DSSs when the IT manager can make a business case; and the mix of technical and business capabilities needed for development is not available in all companies. The primary implication is that developing countries should develop IT managers trained in business strategy as well as technical skills to increase DSS adoption and economic growth.

J	Rodgers, S				Rodgers, Svetlana			Deriving Strategic Advantages from Extended Shelf-Life Foods in the Hospitality Sector	JOURNAL OF CULINARY SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Food services; cook-chill; sous vide; shelf-life; product development; entrepreneurship		The perishability of food service products can be reduced by refrigeration and packaging technologies. Both the institutional and commercial sectors take advantage from the "time buffer" between food production and consumption in bulk food production. Setting up a central production unit requires the knowledge of technological and operational concepts. It consists of conceptualization, product development and implementation stages. First, the size of the capital investment required, the availability of current food service technologies, reports on operational efficiencies as well as mandated food safety measures are analyzed. Second, menu engineering and product development to minimize mechanical damage during bulk preparation and product deterioration during storage/re-thermalization are conducted. Third, the possibility of extension of the product shelf-life, which is linked to the degree of heating, packaging, and "natural" preservation, is explored. The main technical difficulty here is the balance between the severity of processing, which determines food quality, and the acceptable level of food safety risks. The modification of processing to derive operational advantages requires challenge studies, which are expensive. However a complex product is not easily copied by competitors, as it requires investment and technological "know-how."

Trade in Educational Services: An Overview of GATS and Policy Implications for Higher Agricultural Education in India	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION			English	Article						GATS; Agriculture; Higher education; India; Strategic policy		Higher education is a service that contributes to national development, integration and regional cohesion. Agricultural education in particular has been viewed in many developing countries as a significant contributor to sustainable development and poverty alleviation. In view of its public mandate, higher education in most countries is regulated by competent bodies. However, higher education is also a service recognized under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is therefore subject to WTO's essential principles of promoting trade liberalization, market access and equitable treatment to all participants. But very little is known about the consequences of free trade in educational services. Also it is difficult to define which educational services are strictly commercial and which are public services. As a result, application of GATS can lead to disputes, unless the definitions are clear and international standards are in place, as in the case of other WTO agreements such as TRIPS, SPS and TBT. The present paper assesses the implications of application of the provisions of GATS to higher education in general and agricultural education in particular, with respect to Indian regulatory mechanisms for agricultural education. International scenarios of application of GATS in higher education and relevant policy issues for India as perceived by the faculty members of agricultural universities are discussed. The purpose is to initiate a fruitful debate at various national forums that can inform national policy and take advantage of the opportunities provided under GATS, while ensuring that national interests are kept in perspective.

It reviews a wide spectrum of literature in areas such as Industrial Organization, Resource-Based View of the Firm, Value Based Management, Knowledge Management, Transaction Costs Economics, and other disciplines. The statistical analysis correlates two existing variables: Economic Value Added and Growth of Operating Capital with two new testable variables: Market Power and Knowledge. This paper shows how the framework developed integrates competitive strategies, corporate strategies, and functional strategies. It shows that the different existing models and theories produce different results in terms of stock value creation.

The study aims to consider both costs and benefits of different governance choices and to examine which of the activities could be outsourced and which it is preferable to keep in-house. The study makes a distinction between the electricity retail services and electricity distribution network activities and focuses solely on the network business. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a four-staged process and utilizes the extended transaction cost economics as a theoretical framework. The research design includes in-depth interviews with ten managers and CEOs of Finnish electrical utilities, analysis and interpretation of findings and verification of results by electricity network business experts. Findings - The extended transactional cost economics theoretical framework and research design support analysis of governance structures and make-or-buy decisions. The findings demonstrate that the activities of the companies operating in the electricity distribution business differ in terms of potential long-term efficiency effects when sourced from the market or made in-house. The determinants of the governance choice depend partly on the nature and strategic importance of the activity in question. Operations management seems to be a function to be kept in-house in the current market situation, whereas there are clear potential benefits that can be obtained by outsourcing field work activities.

J	Wu, HL				Wu, Hsueh-Liang			Behavior, performance and policy effectiveness: Lessons from Taiwan's steel industry	JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY			English	Article						behavior of firms; firm performance; industrial policy; industrial evolution	MANAGEMENT; GOVERNMENT; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; ASIA	In the evolution of the Taiwanese steel industry, the behavior of steel firms - both in the micro-perspective of firm-level behavior and in the macro-perspective of industry-level behavior - has played a complicated role in ensuring the effectiveness of the government's industrial policies. Using a hybrid method in the context of the Taiwanese steel industry during 1970 - 1996, this study aims to explore the 'black box' of how policy measures engender influences on the two levels of behavior and consequently on firm performance. The firm-level survey not only shows that steel firms dynamically adjusted both their strategic capabilities internally and their competitive conduct externally in response to industrial evolution but also confirms the linkages between firms' attitudes toward policy measures and their behavior patterns, which lead to performance differentials within a specific period of time. The results of the industry-level analysis indicate that the collective production behavior in the sample period is influenced by policy measures through the productive resources exploited by the industry.

The conceptual model is based on a hierarchical approach for formulating manufacturing strategies in small and medium enterprises, which structures the process as a hierarchy and links the levels using tools of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The original model consists of 4 levels: (a) the well-being of the company, (b) strategic objectives, (c) strategic business units, (c) critical success factors and (d) manufacturing decision area. This model includes the four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard, as follows. The financial perspective is included in the strategic objectives, the customer perspective is included in the critical success factors and the process perspective and innovation & development perspective are included in the manufacturing decision areas. In this way, the same hierarchical model for formulating a manufacturing strategy can be used as a tool for generating performance measures. The main contribution of this work is that it provides with a systematic mechanism for generating performance measures. It also allows the assignation of weights to the measures created, using a well known and proved process as AHP.

J	Sanchez-Lorda, P				Sanchez-Lorda, Pablo			Stock market response to acquisitions and alliances in the European telecom industry: An information asymmetry perspective	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article						acquisitions; alliances; telecommunications industry; event study; Europe	JOINT-VENTURES; MERGERS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS; FIRMS; COMPETITION; INVESTORS; RETURNS; CHOICE; GAINS; EVENT	This paper investigates two kinds of strategic combinations carried out by the European telecorn operators between 1986 and 2001: acquisitions, on the one hand, and strategic alliances, on the other. The aim of the paper is twofold. First, it analyzes the behavior adopted by these companies to adapt to an environment that, after the processes of globalization and privatization presents a clearly different structure. Second, it focuses on the effect that internationalization and diversification could exert over the returns obtained by the European telecom firms involved in acquisitions and alliances, differentiating when such strategic combinations are more profitable for the shareholders of the firms that carry them out.

Identifying strategic technology directions in a national laboratory setting: A case study	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						R&D management; strategic planning; nonproliferation; national security technology		We present a case study of strategic technology planning in a large, mission-oriented division of Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Division, Nonproliferation and International Security, was strongly oriented around its eponymous mission. The challenge for our planning process was one of scale: identifying a manageable handful of science and technology thrusts that would drive that mission forward. Based on a detailed analysis of future missions and technology possibilities, we identified three strategic directions: (1) computer-enabled understanding, (2) networked and intelligent sensors, and (3) physics applied to sensors. The lessons we learned apply to strategic planning in other diverse R&D organizations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Managerial competencies among first-line newsroom managers at small to medium-sized mainstream media enterprises in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article								Changes in the South African media and management environment have had distinct influences on especially small to medium-sized mainstream media enterprises (media SMEs) which often have to compete with bigger media organisations for the same news stories. Moreover, these media organisations are commonly faced with unique challenges related to human and other resources. This situation adds to the importance of effective and efficient management practices at these media sites. The management practices of first-line news managers in media SMEs are qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in this paper by considering six managerial competencies found in general management theory. These competencies relate to communication, planning and administration, teamwork; strategic action, global awareness and self-management.

J	Barker, A				Barker, Adam			Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) as a tool for integration within coastal planning	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						sustainable development; integrated coastal zone management; strategic environmental assessment	IMPACT ASSESSMENT EIA	Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is widely recognised as a key mechanism for asserting sustainable development objectives within coastal areas. However, despite significant developments in ICZM practice and developlate ment, a number of challenges remain. Particular concerns relate to the existence of a limited understanding of the relationship between biophysical and socioeconomic processes and poor mechanisms for institutional coordination. This article explores the contribution that strategic environmental assessment (SEA) can make as a decision-making tool for integration within ICZM. Through the adoption of systematic "tiered" assessment procedures, it is argued that SEA can help identify and mitigate competing development pressures.

J	Dudink, G; Berge, Z				Dudink, Gertrude; Berge, Zane			Balancing Top-Down, Bottom-Up, and Peer-to-Peer Approaches to Sustaining Distance Training	TURKISH ONLINE JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION			English	Article						Distance training; Bottom-Up; Peer-to-Peer Approaches		Many distance training case studies identify distance training leadership as bottom-up, whereas much of the literature suggests a need for strategic, top-down approaches. With change management as an overarching framework, approaches to sustaining distance training that originate at different levels of the organization are explored. Special attention is paid to the content of the change messages involved, guided by Rogers' five attributes of innovations. Research of change management and distance training literature suggests a combination of approaches that should fit the organizational culture as well as correctly address genuine concerns at the various organizational levels. A properly balanced approach could lead to new levels of communication and understanding in a learning organization and to distance training being sustained as a business process.

J	Groznik, A; Vicic, D				Groznik, Ales; Vicic, Dejan			E-GOVERNMENT: THE ROLE OF BUSINESS RENOVATION AND INFORMATISATION	MANAGEMENT-JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT ISSUES			English	Article								The introduction of E-government is the key to bringing public administration closer to clients. This requires organisations to integrate and synchronise their strategic vision and tactical delivery of services to clients with the information technology and service infrastructure needed to meet that vision and process execution. E-government is not only about technology. It also involves restructuring the public sector, business process, people and culture to ensure the successful achievement of e-government. Many projects in the past have failed because the orientation of projects was strictly on business processes which generated major changes but without involving other aspects. In this paper, we present the role of business renovation and informatisation which was successfully implemented in a business case.

RETAIL SERVICE QUALITY EXPECTATIONS AND PERCEPTIONS AMONG PHILIPPINE SMALL/MEDIUM ENTERPRISES	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP			English	Article						SMEs; retail; service; Philippines		The Philippines is among the emerging markets in the world. Along with China, the Philippines attracts international enterprises seeking to establish a presence in Asia. This study examines small/medium enterprises (SMEs) management and employee perceptions of customer service on a number of dimensions. The results suggest that managers and employees in the Philippines behave in similar ways to those in Western countries, but there are differences, probably related to cultural characteristics. As the Philippine market becomes more involved with global business, the importance of service quality increases. The results can be valuable in the formulation of training, sales and marketing, business development, human resources management, and strategic planning. Implications for practice are discussed.

Roughly ten years ago the Industrial Marketing Management journal published a study on the expected consequences of the European Union (EU) single market. In the current study, we investigate the actual results of the single market formation on industrial marketing in the EU and compare them to the expectations noted by industrial marketers a decade earlier. We find that the effects differ markedly from those anticipated and that they have important implications for business marketing practice in the EU. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study measures the success in achieving these goals. Methods: Data were abstracted from charts of all 249 reported TB cases during 2000-2002. Treatment completion was considered for patients indicated for completion in 12 months or less. Documentation of treatment improvement included therapy adherence, sputum culture conversion, and chest radiograph improvement for pulmonary cases, and therapy adherence and clinical improvement for extrapulmonary cases. Results: Treatment completion was measured in 204 of 249 TB cases; 87.1 percent completed treatment in 12 months or less. There was a significant difference in completion by site of disease, 89.9 percent for pulmonary cases and 66.1 percent for extrapulmonary cases (P <.01). Documentation of treatment improvement was 61.2 percent among pulmonary cases and 83.6 percent among extrapulmonary cases (P <.01). During the study period, there was a significant decrease in documentation rates for patients with pulmonary TB (P <.01). Conclusions: The goal of 90 percent treatment completion was nearly accomplished but the goal of 95 percent documentation of treatment improvement was not achieved, Barriers to TB treatment in Wisconsin need to be identified, Case management of TB is necessary for control and prevention of TB.

J	Tzeng, HM				Tzeng, HM			Model testing on the crisis interventions and actions to prevent medical disputes: a Taiwanese nursing perspective	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						crisis management; hospital; medical dispute; nursing; nursing director; nursing practice	RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; RISK-MANAGEMENT; MALPRACTICE; SAFETY; CARE	Aims and objectives. This study investigated the contributions of comprehensiveness and necessity scales on crisis interventions and actions toward nursing practice-related medical disputes in Taiwanese hospitals and institutions' demographic characteristics, to overall satisfaction toward nursing-related crisis management policies and interventions and overall satisfaction toward their institution's crisis management system. Background. In a health-care environment that is focused on cost containment, for overworked nurses and understaffed medical wards, patients still expect nurses to provide high quality, compassionate care. Patients usually regard nurses as the principal link between the technical and interpersonal aspects of their care. However, current hospital systems tend to require patients to be self-reliant in managing their own care. Patient mistrust of medical care providers might have contributed to the current medical error/dispute crisis. Methods. In this cross-sectional study, the subjects were nursing directors of Taiwanese hospitals (197 valid subjects). The author developed the questionnaire used in this study. Results. The ordinal logistic regression analyses demonstrated that being a public hospital managed by the government, being a hospital operated by a corporate body, the more comprehensive the technical/structural aspect and the assessment aspect and the more needed the psychological aspect, contribute to higher general satisfaction levels toward nursing-related crisis management. The more comprehensive the strategic aspect and having more acute beds, contributes to higher satisfaction levels with their institution's overall crisis management activities. Conclusions. These findings inferred a possible change in a hospital's resource allocation or power structure when dealing with issues of patient care quality, including nursing practice-related crisis management policies, interventions and actions. Relevant to clinical practice. A good crisis management system may help to keep a crisis from worsening, which might lead to a serious situation that includes malpractice litigation. It is believed that the questionnaire used in this study may be used as a diagnostic tool for assessing a crisis management system within a hospital's nursing environment.

An analysis of strategic performance measures of companies listed the JSE Securities Exchange South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES			English	Article								This study highlights the importance of economic profits (EVA) and their long-term effects on shareholder value (MVA). South African companies listed on the JSE were analysed and it is evident that the relative measure of internal performance (spreads) can be used to rank companies in terms of value creation. Individual companies and sectors were also placed on a financial strategy matrix, which evaluated companies according to spreads and cash management. The sales growth less the SGR percentage was used to indicate cash management. Statistical tests (regression analysis) were done on the data to test the validity of the financial strategy matrix model. The results showed that there is a positive relationship between spreads and shareholder value, but sales growth less the sustainable growth rate does not contribute significantly to shareholder value.

J	McAlearney, JS; McAlearney, AS				McAlearney, JS; McAlearney, AS			Community health center integration: Experience in the state of Ohio	JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FOR THE POOR AND UNDERSERVED			English	Article						community health centers; organizational models; health services accessibility; medically underserved area; medically uninsured; organizational objectives; organizational case studies	HOSPITALS; NETWORKS; ADOPTION; SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; MARKET	In the face of severe financial challenges and demands to improve quality and service to patients, many community health centers (CHCs) have aligned or integrated with other CHCs, physician groups, or hospitals. Yet the nature of and rationale for these organizational decisions are not well understood. Our research applied an organizational theoretical framework to test whether strategic adaptation theory or institutional theory best describes the integration activity of CHCs in Ohio. We collected primary data from case studies of seven CHCs selected for geographic representation and studied December 2000-January 2001. Semi-structured interviews and a case study database supported our chain of evidence. We found that CHC integration activity was substantial (five of seven CHCs integrated) and extremely varied. Consistent with strategic adaptation theory, we determined that CHC integration actions were predominantly center-specific, rational responses to environmental challenges and were initiated to improve operations or financial performance. Rarely did CHCs initiate major organizational change merely to mimic other CHC actions, as might have been expected of highly institutionalized organizations. Understanding the basis for CHCs' strategic decisions while monitoring financial health will remain critical as lawmakers and administrators work to develop policies that both maintain progress made and improve primary care access for the poor, the uninsured, and those with special health care needs served by these important safety net providers.

Searching development strategies for less-favoured areas	NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						micro-macro modelling; coupled systems; research strategy	INCOME DIVERSIFICATION; HOUSEHOLD; INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS; MARKET	Rural households in less-favoured areas (LFAs) face multiple constraints for overcoming chronic poverty and resource degradation. Strategic development options can be assessed through interdisciplinary research based on coupling of human and natural systems approaches. Simulation modelling enables the identification of more precise research questions and the definition of appropriate fieldwork methods. We present an overview of the stylized micro-macro modelling framework used for the exploration of production and resource management options and livelihood strategies at household and village level. The simulation outcomes are subsequently used for the identification of feasible pathways for agricultural and rural development in LFAs and for critical incentives that enable households to invest in profitable and sustainable resource management. The interaction between model simulations and topical field research generates useful insights for the design of comprehensive research programmes regarding strategies for sustainable development in LFAs. Stylized models of coupled human-natural systems based on the behaviour of representative stakeholders provide a practical and flexible framework for exploring critical research issues.

CRISIS MANAGEMENT AND SANATION OF ENTERPRISES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PUBLIC GOODS	SERBIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sanation of enterprises for the production of public goods; Crisis management; Strategic planning; Reingeneering; Benchmarking; New public management		The process of the sanation of enterprises for the production of public goods represents a very complex, risky and expensive (politically, economically and business) venture. The long-lasting policy of treating the sector for production of public goods as an activity having as its basic task to provide, sheaply of gratis, the supplying of population and economy with public goods and services as well as exlusive political criteria in the choice of their management along with the nonselective subventions of various political, macroeconomic and business failures, developed an incremental conduct in practically each enterprise for the production of public goods regarding the changes in social, economic and technological surrounding. The start position in the present work is that it is necessary to raise the work efficiency of the enterprises for the production of public goods - by implementing the relevant techniques of crisis management with inner (internal) restructuring on the basis of individual programs made by respecting the methods and concepts of the following techniques: strategic planning and managing, team work, reingeenering and benchmarking on one side and the specificities of restructuring these enterprises in societies and economies in transition and being reflected in undeveloped market infrastructure and absence of adequate regulatory public mechanismus for the substitution of the market mechanisms. This fact give the certain degree of subjectivity to the whole process of the sanation of the enterprises producing public goods. According to this, the Authors selected an approach where the basic task of the crisis management in this sanation of enterprises for the production of public goods in the adaptation of so-called soft elements (software) as (1) Changes in the structure of might between inner and outer factors with emphasis on making a precise, public and transparent framework for the public regulation of the conduct of enterprises running their business in the regime of natural or administrative monopoly, (2) Improvements in regulatory circles and rules of game for performing key business processes in the production and distribution of public goods, (3) Adaptation of general frameworks defining he role and economic position of employees and (4) Development of the culture of organization (of the production of public goods) ensuring the quality of contents of characteristic rituals of behaviour of employees in the function of more efficient satisfaction of the needs of customers or users of public goods and services.

J	Breen, H; Innes, K				Breen, Helen; Innes, Kate			Strategic Management of External Change in NSW Registered Clubs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Strategic management; clubs; marketing; gambling; cross border issues		This research examines how clubs strategically manage change resulting from alterations in their external environment. Specifically, this paper aims to investigate the marketing implications of recent legislative change arising from restrictions imposed on advertising and promotion of club gaming in one Australian state, the most populous state of New South Wales (NSW). Managers of three northern NSW clubs situated adjacent to the southern Queensland (QLD) border were interviewed to obtain primary data for this investigation. Results show that legislation restricting gaming advertising, promotion and external signage has caused difficulties in marketing these three clubs whose core product is gaming machines. Short-term results of revised marketing strategies indicate that club member numbers are steady but spending is unpredictable. Visitors are harder to attract, particularly new visitors.

CORPORATE STRATEGIES OF BUSINESS GROUPS IN THE WAKE OF COMPETITIVE SHOCKS Lessons from Argentina	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Market liberalization; Strategy; Decision making style; Argentina		Conventional economic and management theories explain that business groups facing market liberalization policy reforms (i.e., competitive shocks) would have incentives to reduce corporate portfolios and increase internationalization. We empirically examine the strategic responses of Argentine business groups and, through an inductive theory building process, propose refinements to this theory. We argue that such a strategy process is moderated not only by differences in market forces set out by policy reforms across different economic segments but also by the path dependency of resources and capabilities as well as management decision-making style of individual business groups. We discuss implications for theory and practice.

J	Gonzalez-Alvarez, N; Munoz-Doyague, MF				Gonzalez-Alvarez, Nuria; Munoz-Doyague, Maria Felisa			Causal ambiguity of technological competencies, human resource practices and competitive advantage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						causal ambiguity; technology transfer; imitation; high involvement human resource practices	FIRM PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE; ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; PRODUCTIVITY; TURNOVER	Traditionally, it has been recognised that causal ambiguity of technology, by making it difficult for competitors to identify the technological competencies on which a particular firm bases its competitive advantage, represents an effective protection mechanism helping the firm to obtain superior performance. Recently, researchers have unearthed evidence that the effects of causal ambiguity also could be extended to the interior of the firm itself, hampering the diffusion of its own technological capabilities among its managers. In this case, the existence of causal ambiguity will have a negative impact on firm performance. The first aim of this article is to analyse both perspectives with the last end of establishing the net influence that causal ambiguity exerts on firm performance. The second one, to study how the high involvement human resources practices can help to solve this debate. With this in mind, a set of hypothesis is proposed and they will contrast using a sample of 258 Spanish manufacturing firms.

J	Ha, HY				Ha, Hong-Youl			An exploratory study and consumers' perceptions of e-reverse bundling price in online retailing	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						e-dynamic bundling; value perception; brand reputation		Limited information exists about consumer reaction to a potentially major e-nnovation known as e-reverse bundling. This study explores how brand reputation, benefits and word-of-mouth directly affect consumer perceptions in e-reverse bundling. Two experiments were conducted. One shows that diversity of product choice and e-reverse pricing directly affect consumers' perceptions and benefits. In particular, consumers' perceptions of bundles are consistent with the proposition of Stremerch and Tellis (Stremersch, S. and Tellis, G.J. (2002) Strategic bundling of products and prices: A new synthesis for marketing. Journal of Marketing 66, 55-72) that for price information, it is optimal for companies to: (a) integrate all price information in a single bundle price or re-adjusted single bundle price rather than present it in a list of separate product prices, and (b) separate the bundle discount in multiple savings rather than present it as a single saving. The second experiment revealed that attribution and the relationship with a web retailer affected positive and negative word-of-mouth communication intentions. The experiments help us to understand consumer perceptions and behavioral intentions towards a future emerging product-e-reverse bundling price. The results have implications for managers and academics in the areas of product development, consumer behavior, and brand reputation.

J	Halepete, J; Park, J				Halepete, Jaya; Park, Jihye			Competitive e-tailing strategies for fair trade organizations Benchmarking against successful commercial organizations	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Electronic commerce; Fair trade; Management strategy; Benchmarking	ONLINE; DESIGN	Purpose - This study aims to provide competitive e-tailing strategies for fair trade organizations using a benchmarking approach. Design/methodology/approach - A coding guide was developed to obtain information available on 28 fair trade web sites and 28 commercial web sites focusing on company information, product information, distribution channels, customer service, and web site structure/media service. Findings - Results revealed several evidences that fair trade organizations presented limited information online, compared with commercial organizations. Research limitations/implications - Fewer commercial retailers benchmarked in the study sold handicrafts, compared with fair trade organizations. Discrepancies in the proportion of products carried by each organization may result in limited generalization of the findings across product categories. Practical implications - Through benchmarking against profit-making business leaders, fair trade organizations would be able to evaluate strengths and weaknesses for their current online business operations and explore opportunities and improvement in web site management. Originality/value - This paper provides valuable managerial implications for fair trade organizations focusing on web site operations. Information availability and strategic web site management can attract customers to make purchases on fair trade web sites and, in turn, enable organizations to sustain and grow in the competitive marketplace.

Apparently, the existing assessment methods have failed to take these special characteristics into account, since formal evaluation methods are not widely applied in organizations. In this paper, we draw from literature and develop a conceptual framework for evaluating strategic IT investments and, based on that, we propose a comprehensive assessment methodology for strategic IT investments. As a descriptive case, we apply the methodology to evaluate the investment alternatives for a Web Content Management (WCM) System in a large multinational company in financial industry.

J	Hammond, K				Hammond, K			Breeding strategies for the development of the Australian beef industry: an overview	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						adaptive fitness; artificial insemination; Beef Cooperative Research Centre (CRC); breeding; BREEDOBJECT; BREEDPLAN; carcass quality and yield; cattle; extension; feed intake; genetic improvement; genotype x environment interaction (GEI); management groups; production systems; progeny testing; value-added marketing	DESIGN; QUALITY; CATTLE; GENETICS	Strategic directions for the period 2010 to 2020 and research and development needs are considered for the Australian Beef Industry from the breeding sector's perspective. These are related to the way major technologies are developed for an industry, the current status and likely trends in market development and appropriation of benefits to the consumer, processor, commercial beef producer and breeding sectors. The primary strategic needs identified are: (i) understand the functional biology for the major production environments ( supply chain packages), (ii) accelerate the speed of genetic improvement for production environment breeding goals based on commercial sector profitability and the dissemination of superior genetic material to this sector, and (iii) retain and develop the Beef Cooperative Research Centre concept over the period. Tactics for realising each strategy are considered. Rigorously designed industry-level studies based on a genotype x environment interaction approach, involving all major production environments and breeds, have an important role to play, as do the serial development of measuring equipment and procedures for carcass quality and yield, body maintenance, disease management and maternal performance. Information and communication, molecular genetics and artificial insemination technologies, along with formal progeny testing and an extended BREEDPLAN system, will be increasingly used by the breeding as well as commercial industry sectors to more consistently meet particular market demands. Carefully executed progeny testing is a pragmatic and necessary breeding approach for the period, serving a number of important purposes. The beef industry as a whole will need to take more responsibility for its genetic improvement element by: managing the appropriation of benefits across sectors, developing an increasingly effective system of value-based marketing and, for each sector and production environment, a more appropriate program of capacity building. The industry could now usefully consider the further development of its activity to address these longer-term strategic needs.

J	Hannagan, T				Hannagan, Tim			Leadership and environmental assessment in further education	JOURNAL OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article								This paper examines management reaction to strategic change in organizations based on the findings from a study of management responses to environmental change in further education. The paper sets out a number of propositions about the key factors required for successful strategic change in a public sector organization based on a national survey of colleges of further education in England in the six years after incorporation, which was followed up by case studies to investigate the key variables in greater detail. The analysis of strategic change in these public sector institutions highlights the importance of leadership and environmental assessment while the development of a conceptual model to underpin the research illustrates how private sector approaches can be adapted to the public sector.

J	Holtzman, YB				Holtzman, Yair B.			Creating transparency around the research and development tax credit And why should your company care anyway?	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Research and development; Tax allowances; Product innovation; Computer software; Manufacturing systems; Competitive strategy		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the basic workings of the research and development tax credit and highlight the interconnection between the credit and strategic implications to research, product development and overall market competitiveness. It explains how this credit can be a hidden and immediate source of cash for companies that are involved in research activities and have invested time, money, and resources to the advancement and improvement of their companies' products and processes. Design/methodology/approach - The catalysts for this article came from interviews and discussions with scientists, engineers and CEO's of small to mid-size companies who were unaware of this credit. Findings - Managers commonly misclassify R&D expenses as something else. For example, specialized computer software that is used in R&D may be misclassified as general and administrative expense. Consultants can potentially save a significant amount of tax dollars by examining client records, interviewing client personnel to gain an understanding to see if reclassification is possible. Originality/value - The original viewpoint presented in this article suggests that manufacturing, research and development, corporate, and tax strategy are all interconnected. These need to be considered in tandem to optimize the overall effectiveness of the R&D dollars spent.

J	Jobs, C; Butler, D				Jobs, Charles; Butler, David			A case study in the globalization of jobs in Ireland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Employment; Labour market; Globalization; Outsourcing; Call centres; Ireland		Purpose - The paper sets out to identify the challenges and potential responses Ireland has related to the potential loss of jobs due to offshoring in a key Irish employment sector. The following research question is addressed. How can Irish call centers effectively respond to offshore competition? Design/methodology/approach - This case study is a based on a field research project including interview and survey data. The project was supported by The Irish Development Agency (IDA) to obtain data about the workers, management and demographic trends of the Irish call center sector. A review of literature available on the subject and observations made during the data gathering phase of a field research project run during the summer of 2004. Findings - Shows that the global market for offshoring is growing at an accelerated rate due to economic drivers, cultural perceptions and expectations of corporate managers, SMEs, and IT systems integrators. Illustrates how Ireland can turn the problems associated with offshoring into strategic advantage. Practical implications - The paper proposes responses to the threat of lost jobs in Ireland due to the forces of globalization may offer useful insights for other countries facing similar economic threats. Originality/value - Very few papers have been published related to Irish job migration. The value is the paper studies a significant Irish industry sector in terms of employment and very real issues related to the globalization of jobs via offshoring. This is important to the IDA and to economic development practitioners in other countries facing the loss of jobs to globalization and offshoring.

J	Kaufmann, J; O'Neill, HM; York, AS				Kaufmann, Jeffrey; O'Neill, Hugh M.; York, Anne S.			The Impact of Structural Prescriptions on Joint Venture Survival	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article						Joint ventures; Transaction cost-based prescription; Structural prescriptions; Interorganizational structure		Prior research on joint ventures using both legal and strategic perspectives provides several transaction cost-based prescriptions for structuring joint ventures to minimize the threat of opportunistic behavior by venture partners. However, the effects of these prescriptions on the subsequent survival of the alliance are largely untested. Using survey data from senior managers responsible for alliance participation to explore these relationships, results show that many of the prescriptions that impact venture formation also impact survival, but in a somewhat different and more complex manner than previously thought. Managers desiring to influence the long-term survival of a joint venture should focus on the factors that best fulfill their goals for the partnership. By clarifying these issues we seek to inform our understanding of how the transaction cost-based prescriptions influence alliance survival, enhance managers' ability to capture the gains from this potentially valuable strategic tool, and raise important considerations for future research.

J	Kemper, A				Kemper, Andreas			Modeling network growth with network theory and cellular automata	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Networking; Diffusion; Innovation; Automation; Complexity theory	INFECTIOUS-DISEASE; CRITICAL-BEHAVIOR; SPREAD	Purpose - Although the nonlinear growth of networks, e.g. the diffusion of innovations, is vital for strategic management, it is often treated implicitly in management theory and practice. Partial explanations of this discrepancy are the unintuitive nature and complexity of the required analytical tools. The goal of this research is to assess two possible approaches - the network theory and cellular automata (CA) - and to generate guidelines for their application. Design/methodology/approach - After having clarified the necessity for a network growth analysis, the network theory and CA are outlined and compared as alternative analytical approaches for its investigation. Findings - Results of the theoretical analysis indicate that the amount of the interacting agents and the complexity of the interaction rules are key determinants for choosing the optimal methodology. Originality/value - Given that sound research has addressed the implementation handles, the further application guidelines mentioned here can help corroborate and validate the concepts presented and contribute to a further diffusion of the underlying complex systems principles in management theory and practice.

J	Kim, KH; Payne, GT; Tan, JA				Kim, Kong-Hee; Payne, G. Tyge; Tan, James A.			An examination of cognition and affect in strategic decision making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Decision making; Cognition; Organizational behaviour	ORGANIZATIONAL TASK; PERFORMANCE; CHOICE; UNCERTAINTY; ENVIRONMENT; EMOTIONS; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY; THREAT; ISSUES	Purpose - The purpose of this article is to better understand the nature of the decision maker's cognitive-affective information processing behavior in the context of strategic decision making. Design/methodology/approach - Reviews of the psychological science, organizational behavior, and strategic management literatures serve as a foundation for the development of a model and a series of research propositions. Propositions and model development lead to a discussion regarding limitations of the current literature, as well as areas for future research that incorporates cognitive-affective information processing issues in organizational research. Findings - Organizational homogeneous and heterogeneous behaviors in the organizational adaptation process depend on a strategic decision maker's cognitive-affective informational interpretation of both internal and external environmental stimuli. Research limitations/implications - The focus of this article is limited to the individual level of analysis. Further theoretical and empirical research should investigate how the framework could be applied at the team and organizational levels and how it holds under various industrial and/or environmental conditions. Practical implications - This article informs practicing managers of how their decision-making behavior is influenced by both cognition and affect when they scan and process their strategic informational environment and, furthermore, how these influence their choice of organizational forms and practices. Originality/value - Extends theoretical understanding of cognitive-affective informational processing and its influence on the organizational homogeneous-heterogeneous adaptation process.

J	Kooymans, R; Abbott, J				Kooymans, Rob; Abbott, James			Developing an effective service life asset management and valuation model	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE			English	Article						Real estate; Replacement costs; Life cycle costs; Assets valuation; Databases		Purpose - This paper seeks to describe the development and testing of a depreciated replacement cost model for a portfolio of corporate real estate assets. Design/methodology/approach - A model was developed in Microsoft Excel, using depreciation rates and adjustment factors derived from readily-available tables applied to elemental building costs. The model was applied to an actual property portfolio, with the costs of data-gathering being estimated. Findings - The developed model proved to be effective in both planning and managing maintenance and capital expenditure, with application to life-cycle maintenance and replacement decisions. The model was successfully used to conduct a replacement cost valuation on the test portfolio. It was found that the cost of the initial detailed data-gathering could be repaid in a relatively short time by use of the model. Practical implications - The methodology appears to be widely applicable to corporate real estate portfolios, with depreciation rates and methods, and levels of detail of components used being able to be changed to suit individual country and portfolio circumstances. Originality/value - Provides a model useful for harnessing basic property information into a sophisticated day-to-day and strategic portfolio management tool.

J	Lehmann, H				Lehmann, Hans			European International Freight Forwarders: Information as a Strategic Product	JOURNAL OF CASES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						business process planning; global IS; information analysis techniques; information technology adoption; information-enabled leadership; innovative technology; IS implementation; IS/IT planning; IS success; software development methodologies	TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE; BUSINESS	This case study is about information systems in one of the largest freight forwarding companies in Europe, here named Spedition Chur AG (SCA) (1). With a long tradition of computers, data processing, and information systems on a global level, SCA has used information technology extensively since the 1960s. Over the years, their systems have become a truly strategic resource; many of the services SCA offers today are based solely on information management - the physical side of the transport business has taken a back seat and is often outsourced. The problems and issues SCA is dealing with now are the dichotomy of its IT strategy: how to coordinate a stringently standardized core of systems with its critically important but highly individualized system-to-system interfaces with its key customers. Furthermore, the rapid change in technology and the very wide range and reach of its operations now means that the global implementation of new information systems often cannot be completed before the technologies underlying them have become obsolescent. The case describes the development of the systems that underlie the business success and sets out the governance and management structures that make this possible.

Besides calculating the static value using the conventionally adopted net present value method, the potential value through strategic flexibility is also measured using a binomial option approach. This study obtains the following findings. First, based on evaluation with the net present value method, the securities firm should immediately be integrated with the financial holding company. However, the firm value may be underestimated by failing to consider strategic flexibility. Second, the integration should be delayed by using a binomial option approach. Third, the value of the securities firm increases with the range of options (available for consideration). Fourth, given variation in risk-free interest rate, firm value, strike price, time to maturity, and value volatility, the option value may influence the timing of firm decision making.

There is a basic paradox between, on the one hand, the managerial prescription for effective alliances that emphasises the importance of extensive preplanning and agreement in order to ensure inter alia there are no asymmetries in goals, strategies, contributions and the modus operandi of the different parties; and, on the other hand, the apparent need for freedom, flexibility, and 'room for learning' that experience suggests are necessary for the development of such relationships. The paper analyses the issues associated with the effective management of alliances and suggests propositions for further analysis.

Simon and other top Management Science/Operations Research (MS/OR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers, suggested that an integration of the two disciplines would improve the design of decision-making support tools in organizations. The suggested integrated system has been called an intelligent decision-making support system (i-DMSS). In this chapter, we use an existing conceptual framework posed to assess the capabilities and limitations of the i-DMSS concept, and through a conceptual meta-analysis research of the Decision Support System (DSS) and AI literature from 1980 to 2004, we develop a strategic assessment of the initial proposal. Such an analysis reveals support gaps that suggest further development of the initial i-DMSS concept is needed. We offer recommendations for making the indicated improvements in i-DMSS design, development, and application.

J	Nishimura, A				Nishimura, Akira			ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF FEED FORWARD CONTROL	ASIA-PACIFIC MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING JOURNAL			English	Article						Internal control; enterprise governance; value creation; risk management		In a growing market world-economy, in which the scope for financial mismanagement increases, enterprises need to strengthen their strategic risk management. Enterprise governance is not only a publicly regulated issue but also a matter of self-control, since it is closely related to conformance and performance (value creation). Therefore, enterprise governance should be studied from the viewpoint of proactive and preventive (feed forward) control rather than a reactive and reflective (feedback) viewpoint. The integrated aspects of financial and management accounting should be examined with relation to internal control and enterprise governance, although generally only corporate governance (conformance) has been discussed from the viewpoints of auditing and financial accounting, and feedback control. Management accountants in Japan should pay more attention to the establishment of feed forward management accounting and good enterprise governance.

COORDINATION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN: VENDOR MANAGED INVENTORY IS THE WAY TO GO	SERBIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Vendor managed inventory; Supplier owned inventory; Supply chain coordination		Vendor managed inventory (VMI) has proven to be a successful initiative enabling many companies to cut down their inventory costs, form strategic partnerships with their suppliers and improve service to customers. This article looks at an implementation of VMI at an electronics manufacturer, and discusses the process flow, setup considerations and the requirements to make a VMI implementation successful. Finally, the argument is made that for this practice to proliferate among the vendor community, the benefits of VMI implementation need to be equitably shared among supply chain partners.

J	Reid, I; Freeman, S				Reid, Imogen; Freeman, Susan			Foreign Market-Entry into Central and Eastern Europe: Australian Firms in Poland and the Czech Republic	JOURNAL OF EAST-WEST BUSINESS			English	Article						Foreign market-entry; transitional markets; Network Perspective and strategic decision-making	PARTNERSHIPS; COUNTRY; TIES	This study examines key elements associated with Western firms entering Central and Eastern Europe (CEE): a region classified as transitional. We highlight the role of networking in the foreign market-entry (FME) process in terms of entry strategies. Following a qualitative analysis of six Western (Australian) firms entering two main (Poland and Czech Republic) transitional markets, three key themes were identified: networking strongly underpins initial market-entry; is fundamental in refining target-market decisions; and is integral to strategy-building for market participation in the post-entry phase. Based on our findings we describe a distinct market-situation for emerging markets. We then propose a typology, identifying a fifth "type" of market-situation in emerging markets, the "Transitional International," an extension of Johnson and Mattsson's (1988) typology. Our 'Transitional International' firm is characterised by significant pre-entry and development of post-entry business networks within a transitional market environment.

J	Sammour, GN				Sammour, G. N.			Elearning Systems Based on the Semantic Web	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING			English	Article						Learning Objects; eLearning; Ontologies; Semantic Web; Web Based Learning		ELearning has been identified as a strategic resource that can be utilized as an increasing variety of venues such as homes, workplaces, and traditional institutions of learning, education, and training. ELearning systems are becoming technologically sophisticated and complicated, with regard to training management or course management. Their use does not always match well with traditional modes of teaching and learning and much care needs to be taken when considering the use of ELearning in educational institutions. The use of semantic web in eLearning has been explored with regard to two application areas: 1) software that supports teachers in performing their tasks in flexible online educational settings, and 2) software that interpret the structure of distributed, self organized, and self-directed ELearning and web-based learning. The resulting system will be used by learners to perform the tasks they are asked to do more effectively in the context of gaining knowledge out of the material presented by teachers. These two application areas and related tasks require a semantic representation of educational entities and pedagogical material, specifically the structure and the techniques of the teaching-learning process. In most eLearning systems users are able to manage and reuse learning contents according to their needs without any access problems. However the quality of learning is not guaranteed. This paper emphasizes the integration of the semantic web technologies with Elearning systems, taking into consideration the standards and reusable Learning Objects LO. The advantage to improve the descriptions of content, context and structure of the learning materials and the benefits of providing access to the learning materials are also presented.	[Sammour, G.

J	Schubert, HJ				Schubert, Hans-Joachim			Integration, ethnicity, education. the definition of ethnic identity of students with Turkish heritage	BERLINER JOURNAL FUR SOZIOLOGIE			German	Article							MIGRANT FAMILIES; TRANSMISSION; CHILDREN; GERMANY; POINT	Societal integration of Turkish immigrants with higher education does not go hand in hand with cultural assimilation. Educational success is accompanied by the individual-strategic integration of German and Turkish identity attributes, because new diversity management concepts of international organizations are offering new career opportunities. The process of social-emotional integration is,,selective" as well, because socialization of Turkish students in German educational institutions leads to disaffection with their ethnical heritage and their social connections to German communities remains incomplete. Questions of cultural-authentic integration, connected with a strong bias for individualism, are answered by a new culture of immigration beyond class and ethnic community. Communicative Integration, enabled by public discourse, is causing a distancing from German and Turkish life-worlds. Turkish immigrants with a higher education do not accept a categorization of themselves through ethnic characterization; instead they construct hybrid identities, post-traditional communities, and active trust through the process of reflexive integration.

Modeling customer support performance in Indian IT hardware industry	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stochastic modelling; Demand forecasting; Customers; India; Electrical goods		Purpose - Customer support assumes strategic importance in India for branded IT-hardware products. An authorized service center and a stream of specialized service centers undertake field services and represent a sale-territory's support network. "Time constrained" service men have to deliver customized service meeting a promised time-standard. The stochastic demand for support services severely mars the customer response resulting in poor service quality. A manufacturer has to address the following decisions under these conditions: what is the ideal staffing level in a territory considering restricted server availability? What will be the impact of changing the staffing levels on customer service level? This study develops an analytical model to address these decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The study identifies the variables underlying stochastic service demand through a field survey and determines the demand distribution. Applying stochastic principles the study derives relation between field staffing level and customer response considering server time constraint. Study performs statistical analysis to validate this model with real time data on variables collected from the field survey. Findings - The outcomes of analysis reveal the following findings: this model can be applied in service systems where a time constrained server has to deliver expected level of performance (research implication); and increasing field staffing levels obscures the significant difference between the customer waiting times under very high levels of uncertain demand (practical implication). Originality/value - The study derives relation between the staffing levels and customer waiting time considering uncertain demand with restricted working hour conditions.

Strategic Planning in Local Television Newsrooms	JMM-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MEDIA MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This study compared the characteristic of strategic planning as used in the corporate world with the planning process used in a sample of television news departments in local television stations in the United States. The purpose was to determine if commonalities exist, in what circumstances, and whether techniques and approaches used for many years by businesses could advance the process of planning in the fast-paced environment of local television news. In-depth interviews were conducted with a sample of highly experienced local news managers. The results indicated some similarities in planning approaches, but suggested significant differences in how the two industries approach key elements of traditional strategic planning. The primary conclusion drawn from the research suggests the local television news industry in the United States has informally adapted strategic planning processes to their needs with heavy emphasis on tactical execution.

New dilemmas in regulating critical infrastructures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES			English	Article						critical infrastructures; strategic behaviour; regulation; transparency; process management		Regulation, as it was introduced to round off the great institutional changes in the critical infrastructures, has failed to fully curb strategic behaviour in these sectors. This is one of the reasons for the somewhat disappointing performance of these sectors. Regulation in its present shape is based on the mantra: independent, rule guided and transparent. This paper sets out how these principles might be reshaped, allowing strategic behaviour to be tackled more successfully.	[ten Heuvelhof, E.

J	VandePol, B; Gist, R; Braverman, M; Labardee, L				VandePol, Bob; Gist, Richard; Braverman, Mark; Labardee, Lyle			Strategic Specialty Partnerships: Enabling the EAP for Evidence Informed Best Practices in Workplace Crisis Response	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH			English	Article						Crisis response; recovery management; trauma debriefing		Rapid advancement of both research and practice in the field of organizational crisis intervention has brought demands for more substantial breadth and much greater depth in EAP efforts to serve their clients in this critical domain. Once dominant practices (e.g., debriefing groups) have been brought strongly into question while those approaches with solid empirical backing (e.g., trauma focused CBT) remain relatively underrepresented in the intervention armamentarium of most EAPs. Other vital aspects such as organizational crisis planning and longer term recovery management have not been as well developed as might be desirable with respect to human resource impacts, and EAPs need to acquire capability and capacity to assist their clients in these areas as well. This paper reviews how recent advances impact the provision of organizational crisis response and discusses the growing need for specialty partnerships to ensure that information, skills, and resources can be efficiently and effectively deployed to ensure that EAPs are positioned to meet and exceed both client expectations and advancing standards of practice in this rapidly evolving arena.

J	Wolfe, EC; Paul, JA; Cregan, PD				Wolfe, EC; Paul, JA; Cregan, PD			Monitoring ley pastures and their response to winter cleaning	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article						biomass; botanical composition; cover; seed pool; seedling density; subterranean clover	SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER PASTURE; BARLEY GRASS CONTROL; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM; VICTORIAN MALLEE; FARMING SYSTEMS; TAKE-ALL; HERBICIDES; MANAGEMENT; WHEAT	The purposes of this study were to evaluate subterranean clover-based leys on farms and in experiments using several pasture parameters, and to assess the impact of winter cleaning on the productivity and botanical composition of clover swards. Annual pastures were monitored on a group of 5 farms in the Wagga district and compared with an experimental subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) pasture. The major problem in the farm paddocks was a lack of legume biomass due to poor legume densities, a consequence of the use of the soft-seeded cultivar Woogenellup and a high content of grassy weeds. The farmers in the group were unaware of the tools, parameters and benchmarks for making quantitative pasture comparisons. In 2 experiments, a range of subterranean clover swards were generated through the use of cultivars, seeding rate and winter cleaning treatments, grazed at 15 sheep/ha and monitored for 3 years. Appropriate benchmark values for the seed pool of subterranean clover were 300-350 kg/ha in winter and 600-700 kg/ha in summer. On the basis of both winter production, a function of May seedling density (target > 1000 seedlings/m(2)) and spring production, which depended on the cultivar maturity, Junee was superior at Wagga to either Dalkeith (earlier maturing) or Woogenellup (softer seeded). Winter cleaning, using selective herbicides (fluazifop, simazine) to remove grasses and weeds, was advantageous in achieving a high content (> 90%) and productivity of subterranean clover, provided that the legume content of the pasture was at least 28%, or > 20% of total ground area before herbicide application in winter. In winter-cleaned swards, legume growth increased by up to 80%, legume biomass was improved by up to 46% and legume content increased from < 50 to > 95%. The main disadvantages of winter cleaning were increased areas of bare ground and reduced total biomass for several weeks after herbicide application, and the rapid development of ryegrass that was resistant to at least 1 of the herbicides used. The strategic use of observations to monitor the performance of pastures and their response to management is discussed.

Based on an empirical study conducted in Norway we address the following issue: "What do faculty members of the Norwegian Business Schools consider to be their responsibilities in preparing their students for leading positions in public and private organizations?" Moving on to interpreting the results from the survey, we discuss the empirical findings by comparing the data using four different theoretical perspectives; neo-classical economics, strategic management, corporate social responsibility and socio-economics.

J	Troutt, MD; Acar, W				Troutt, MD; Acar, W			A Lorenz-Pareto measure of pure diversification	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						multiattribute valuation; Pareto's principle; strategic management; diversification; organization theory	STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS	Several diversification and concentration measures have been proposed. These measures play an important role in both research and practice in the fields of strategic management, industrial economics, antitrust regulation, and organizational studies. Two problems with popular existing measures are their inappropriate performance on a benchmark example of the industrial organization literature and their lack of normalization into the unit interval. This note proposes a measure that overcomes these deficiencies. A distinction is drawn between two separate dimensions of diversification that we call scope and pure diversfication, respectively. We call attention to how such pure measures can be recombined with scope for the construction of special purpose multiattribute indices. Our proposed measure is simply related to the well-known Gini Index, but is entirely novel. A convenient relationship to Pareto's Principle permits flexible description and interpretation.

J	Brooks, L; Davis, CJ; Lycett, M				Brooks, Laurence; Davis, Christopher J.; Lycett, Mark			Organisations and Information Systems: Investigating Their Dynamic Complexities Using Repertory Grids and Cognitive Mapping	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTERACTION			English	Article						case study; cognitive mapping; communication gap; financial IS; managerial productivity; socio-technical design; strategic IT management		Starting from personal construct theory (PCT), this article explores the use of two complementary approaches to investigate the interdependence of organisations and information systems. These two techniques-repertory grid analysis (RGA) and cognitive mapping (CM)-were used to investigate the dynamics of this interaction. Changing business models and information technologies were investigated in two distinct work settings; in each case, the technique contributed substantial insight into the role of information systems in that context. The analysis shows that the techniques have matured to a stage where they provide a basis for improved understanding of the organisational complexities related to information technologies. The techniques focus on the social construction of meaning by articulating and interpreting the discourse that surrounds the development, implementation, and use of information technology in organisations. It is these ongoing discourses that creates the dynamic complexities in organisations as they play themselves out and develop over time. Current research has articulated and improved awareness of the issues and concerns that surround computer-based information systems. Despite the differing contexts and work processes, the findings from each case suggest that this has made managers more conceptually agile, leading to improved integration of organisational processes and technology. The article concludes by drawing out the idea of the development of a conceptual model to act as a framework for the analysis of cognitive schema and shared understanding. In developing and participating in this shared understanding, both organisational and technological communities could increase their awareness of each other's issues and concerns, thereby enabling them to improve the conceptual agility of the organisation.

J	Schnell, MCA				Schnell, MCA			Why do firms keep excess capacity? Testing hypotheses in the airline industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS			English	Article							ENTRY-DETERRENCE; DEMAND FLUCTUATIONS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PERFORMANCE; MARKETS; BARRIER; COSTS; INVESTMENT; MANAGEMENT; MONOPOLY	We review motivations to keep excess capacity as suggested by theory Thus, we derive hypotheses on the interaction between excess capacity and other strategic aspects of firm behaviour. Thereafter, we test for these relationships by using survey data collected from airline managers working with carriers based in liberalised markets, i.e. Australia/New Zealand, Canada, the European Union or the USA. Only the minority of respondents assess deliberate excess capacity as an effective means. Our results suggest that airlines intentionally keep idle resources as a response to uncertain demand, to anticipated growth opportunities and to competition.

J	Srinivasan, MS				Srinivasan, M.			Organizational Development: A Yogic Vision	JOURNAL OF HUMAN VALUES			English	Article								The term 'organizational development' is defined in management textbooks as a 'collection of planned change interventions built on democratic-humanistic values that seek to improve organizational effectiveness and well-being'. But we use the term in a simpler and broader sense as the evolution and development of an organization towards its highest potential. In this article we present the broad outlines of a strategic vision of organizational development based on the aims and principles of yoga. The word 'yoga' has now become well known all over the world. But the popular conceptions of yoga conjure up images of a hatha-yogi standing upside down or a hermit in the Himalayas. The deeper psychological and pragmatic significance of yoga is not fully understood. 'Yoga,' says Sri Aurobindo, 'is nothing but practical psychology' (Sri Aurobindo 1972b: 39). It contributes to the psychological and spiritual development of the human organism. Yoga is the scientific, psychological process or discipline by which the inner development of the human being is triggered and can be accelerated.

It is well known that an agent-based control approach performs according to both the negotiation mechanism itself and the single agent internal strategic policies. Mobile agent-based negotiation process (MANPro), which has been proposed in our previous work, concerns the first issue of the negotiation mechanism. This paper concerns the second issue of the single agent internal strategic policies. It explains how bids are generated and evaluated and how agents obtain mutual agreement in MANPro. First, the generic bid generation and evaluation framework for MANPro-based negotiation is proposed. Then, the generic framework is applied to a real-time scheduling system for a distributed shop floor control system (SFCS).

J	Gross, WH				Gross, WH			Consistent alpha generation through structure	FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL			English	Article								Successful money management over long periods of time rests on two foundations. The first is "a secular outlook" - that is, a three- to five-year forecast that forces one to think long term. The second is the "structural" composition of portfolio management - the portfolio's genetic makeup, how it is constructed without regard to short-term strategic decisions, principles that are longer than secular. Duration, curve, credit, volatility, and other tilts to-a portfolio's steady-state status are a, portfolio's inherent structure. Recognizing the structural elements of the investment equation will allow the investor to be the one walking away with a pile of chips.

J	Vanden, JM				Vanden, JM			Digital contracts and price manipulation	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS			English	Article							DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURE; OPTION PRICES; STANDARD DEVIATIONS; MARKET MANIPULATION; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; AGENCY COSTS; STOCK; INFORMATION; DETERMINANTS	Corporate insiders holding derivative contracts on their firm's stock have an incentive to engage in stock price manipulation. I examine several derivative contracts susceptible to manipulation and the price impact of the insiders' strategic behavior. Digital contracts, the basic building blocks for valuing complex financial derivatives, are vulnerable to manipulation. The impact of the strategies from holding digital contracts is consistent with an implied volatility skew and volatility clustering. Even seemingly innocuous derivatives, such as ordinary bull spreads, generate these manipulation incentives. This has strong implications for corporate policy, since firms often use option spreads in their stock repurchase programs.

J	Malloch, H; Redman, T				Malloch, H; Redman, T			A French model of craft training: its strategic relevance and recruitment issues for a UK firm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						engineering; International Journeyman Programme; Les Compagnons du Devoir; recruitment; vocational and educational training; young workers		This paper is a study of the recruitment to the first version of the International Journeyman Programme (IJP), a project to recruit and train young workers from the northeast of England for a craft and technician training programme in engineering organized by a French trade guild, Les Compagnons du Devoir (CdD). The initial version of the project was unsuccessful and the paper highlights the role played by UK state agencies and institutions in the recruitment process in the project's lack of success. The paper examines the strategic relevance of a model of French craft training to a UK firm, describes that system of training and development, and analyses the recruitment difficulties faced by the UP organizers when they attempted to launch the programme. The study finds that key elements of the UK VET system have severe problems in delivering high-skills training, and that there are in-built structural barriers that limit the extent to which such training can be easily imported.

J	Streufert, S; Satish, U				Streufert, S; Satish, U			Impact of allergic rhinitis on simulated real-world performance	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE; MANAGEMENT; DIPHENHYDRAMINE; FEXOFENADINE; IMPAIRMENT; COMPLEXITY; ALCOHOL; COST	A few studies have shown that untreated seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) may have unfavorable effects on performance. However, prior research has employed tasks of limited or moderate difficulty (e.g., verbal learning) or has focused on visual-motor efforts (e.g., driving a vehicle). The present research compared performance in the absence (asymptomatic) versus presence (symptomatic) of rhinitis, using the validated strategic management simulation (SMS). Obtained data indicated that whenever task-demands were contextual (e.g., cued by the environment), no differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions were obtained. Whenever task-demands were more difficult, untreated seasonal allergic rhinitis decreased effectiveness. To avoid loss of productivity and limit decrements in quality of life, treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis with medications without sedating effects appears of value.

J	Goolsby, R				Goolsby, R			Ethics and defense agency funding: some considerations	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						defense funding; ethics; research		The author, an anthropologist working in a military defense science and technology funding agency, offers four guidelines for social scientists for evaluating the ethical problems in defense funding opportunities. These guidelines address what social scientists need to know in order to evaluate the ethical risks involved in accepting defense funding: (1) the need to understand the code of ethics of social science organizations and their limits in dealing with ethical problems of new technologies; (2) the need to understand the implications of working in "classified" contexts; (3) the need to understand the funding program's goals and objectives; (4) the need to develop an ethical imagination about technological advances and research and develop an appropriately supportive environment for promoting ethical behavior in the scientific community.

J	Natarajan, R; Sethuraman, K; Surysekar, K				Natarajan, R; Sethuraman, K; Surysekar, K			Reducing incremental costs associated with the delegation of incentive contracting decisions: An analysis of planning and control decisions in a manufacturing setting in the presence of moral hazard	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						decision analysis; organization theory; agency theory; heuristics	CONTROL-SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; UNITS	We compare and contrast two specific regimes involving the centralization and delegation of the incentive contracting decision in manufacturing organizations. In the centralization regime, a single individual simultaneously makes the allocation of demand to production facilities and determines the incentive compensation scheme for the managers at the facilities. Under the delegation regime, the demand allocation is decided upon initially by a superior and the incentive contracting decision is subsequently made by a subordinate, who is neither of the two managers in charge of the production facilities. Using the principal-agent paradigm, which assumes that the managerial efforts are unobservable, we demonstrate that the centralization regime performs no worse than the delegation regime. For situations where strategic or other requirements necessitate firms to opt for the delegation of the incentive contracting decision, we propose a heuristic that significantly increases the likelihood of mimicking the allocation and contracting decisions made under the centralized regime.

J	Eapen, G				Eapen, Gill			Value-Based Management in Biosciences Research and Development	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article								In industries such as biosciences, the range of uncertainty and managerial flexibility make traditional financial analysis such as discounted cash flow and decision tree analysis largely irrelevant for strategic decision-making. In place of such traditional methods, this article proposes the use of decision options analysis, a real-options-based methodology that holds out the promise of better investment and portfolio decisions with fewer data requirements. Moreover, decision options analysis can be implemented with software tools that allow systematic application of these techniques. This article presents case studies that outline the actual application of real options analysis in licensing transactions and portfolio management in biosciences companies.

It describes some key characteristics of the function, drawing on a comprehensive survey of public affairs departments in late 2003. The function has become more senior and strategic, more closely aligned to business imperatives and with stable or growing budgets. It identifies areas of increased attention for practitioners, including support for organization transformation and culture change, stakeholder relations as a line, as well as staff function, reputation management and sustainability reporting.

J	Cant, M				Cant, Michael			Collaboration in infrastructure services in regional retail centres: Value-added contribution of facilities management at the Birmingham Bullring	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bullring; regional shopping centres; infrastructure; change management; FM strategy		The original Bullring complex opened in Birmingham, UK, in 1960 and was the first covered retail centre in Europe. It heralded a new approach not just to shopping but also to city-centre life and development. Little was understood at that time of the wide-ranging effects of a move towards this model, and in its declining years the complex was all too real an illustration of some of the disadvantages of the initial vision. The Birmingham Alliance, comprising three major international property developers/investors, Birmingham City Council and numerous stakeholders, brought together their respective city-centre property holdings and interests, and worked together to create an exciting new vision of a city centre for the 21st century, a vision which would once again place the Bullring in the vanguard of urban renewal. This paper considers the story of the new Bullring and the role that the facilities management ( FM) approach has played in the success of the development to illustrate the way that infrastructure services for the complex can add strategic value rather than use up operational cost. It discusses four important challenges that the FM sector will need to address and resolve if the profession is to secure its position as a strategic value-added contributor to developers and investors in the global retail sector. Finally, it summarises a framework for the future management of regional shopping centres and the role of FM services within this sector.

A Snapshot in Time: ARL Libraries and Electronic Journal Resources	JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Academic research libraries; STM publishers; electronic resources; e-journals		For the past decade, ARL has been tracking its members' expenditures on electronic resources. In 2001/02, 92% of the almost $1.4 million spent by the typical university research library on these resources went to electronic journals. Due to this significant and increasing investment in electronic journals, ARL undertook an extensive survey of its members' electronic journal subscriptions in fall 2002 to better understand the issues libraries are facing in ensuring that electronic resources can be used effectively on campus. A second survey was conducted in 2003 to ascertain how libraries were dealing with their journal package renewals and what licensing issues were of greatest concern to the community.

The main purpose of the present work is to design a fuzzy controller to adjust sample sizes and frequency of sampling according to potential fuzzy bene fit/loss. A set of fuzzy rules is given where, depending on the antecedents, the sample size and/or sampling frequency may be decreased, remain static or be in creased. At any given moment the proportion of defects in the sample determines the firing strength of the rules suggesting an appropriate sample size and sampling frequency. The firing strength is then modified to include an analysis of the decision maker's belief that as sampling takes place and adjustments are being considered benefit or loss would be in corporated prior to any action or adjustment to sample size and/or frequency.

J	Emsley, M				Emsley, Margaret			A benefits analysis of'partnering: A case study of a community primary school in the UK	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Procurement; Partnering; Best value; Case study; Cost related issues; School		Partnering, which involves all members of the project team working together to improve performance through agreeing mutual objectives, is a construct; on procurement strategy encouraged by the UK Government, as it believed that such a strategy will provide best value, which is an aspect especially critical for public clients. Partnering may be strategic or applied to a specific project only. A regionally based main contractor (MC) constructed the Community Primary School (CPS) for a Metropolitan Borough Council (MBC) using a project partnering arrangement; such an arrangement was also in place between the main contractor and its key sub-contractors. The overall conclusion, derived from the analysis of a case study carried out on the project, is that the CPS project has been a very successful project. Broadly, it was completed ahead of schedule, an achievement which undoubtedly would not have been possible without the use of partnering which allowed an overlap of the design and construction activities, there was a slight overspend above budget, the health and safety of people involved in its construction was not compromised and the finished product is of a high quality, fit for purpose.

J	Erikson, T				Erikson, Truls			Idiosyncratic portfolio characteristics of seed and venture capital funds	JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Venture capital; Investment funds; Business formation; Norway		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to uncover the strategic nature of formal seed capital in Norway as opposed to equally sized venture capital firms. Design/methodology/approach - As the population of Norwegian seed capital firms is embedded in this study, a differential approach is taken when contrasting these seed capital firms with venture capital firms of approximately the same size. Findings - The findings indicate that seed capital firms take higher market risk than their counterparts, and that they diversify to a larger extent than comparable venture capital firms. The latter appears to be a function of the former. Originality/value - This study reviews previous categorizations of seed capital providers, henceforth building towards an overall taxonomy of seed capital.

Collecting at the Edge-Transforming Scholarship	JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Research libraries; cultural heritage; institutional repositories; edge collections		Libraries are the repositories of the scholarly record; however, few of our efforts are directed toward building unique collections outside of special collections and archives. As cultural heritage institutions, it is time to consider changing our role in the scholarly communication process by shifting our collection development emphasis away from traditional collections towards more up-stream materials- such as institutional repositories and edge collections. Through combined efforts at Vanderbilt University, three such collections have been created. (C) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey was developed and distributed to internal auditors to gather information on how their companies used performance measures. Findings - The results suggest that most companies tend to have an internal focus when using performance measures and place less value on benchmarking with competitors and suppliers. Originality/value - Based on the results of the survey, performance measures are used throughout the organization for numerous reasons from the determination of whether strategic goals are being met to evaluation of suppliers.

By focusing on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed firms that announced the formation of such alliances from 1996 to 2000, a sample of 140 firms is obtained using event study. The empirical results indicate that the effect of strategic alliance announcements on shareholder wealth is significantly negative for high-growth firms; while high-growth firms forming intra-industry alliances or partner with foreign companies have better announcement effects. For low-growth firms, inter-industry alliances and partnerships with domestic firms have better announcement effects. The findings also indicate that nonequity alliances are appropriate for high-growth firms, while more value accrues to low-growth firms where alliances with equity are involved. Finally, in the case of R&D alliances, the effect of the alliance announcement on shareholder wealth for high-growth firms is superior to that of low-growth firms.

J	Hunter, K				Hunter, Karen			Access Management: Challenging Orthodoxies	JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Open Access; digital resources; society publisher; commercial publisher; Elsevier		In the 1990s, academic libraries moved from collection development to collection management. The current evolution is to combine collectionmanagement with accessmanagement, with an emphasis on providing the right electronic resources to the user at the right time. This evolution has direct effects on scholarly publishers. To provide innovative and appropriate strategic product, service, and pricing options, publishers and librarians have to evaluate present orthodoxies (rules and beliefs) and out-of-the-box alternatives. This presentation explores sixteen such orthodoxies. (C) 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Khosrowshahi, F; Howes, R				Khosrowshahi, Farzad; Howes, Rodney			A FRAMEWORK FOR STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING BASED ON A HYBRID DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						executive management; artificial intelligence; building; decision support tools; executive information system; management decision structure; artificial neural network		The performance of a contracting company is closely linked with the quality of the decisions at the strategic level. However, the increasing complexity of organizations' internal and external environments and the unstructured nature of decisions at the strategic level make the decision making a very complicated task. The number of influential variables is so large and their effects are so varied that any attempt to encapsulate them in a rational manner can indeed hinder the decision making process. To this end, this research explores the advantages of decision support tools and the benefit these tools can yield for the strategic management. Some of these tools are deterministic and structured: they rely on straightforward calculation or optimisation techniques. The solution to the unstructured problems, however, has relied on heuristic approaches and judgement of the decision-maker. While deterministic problems have to a large extent been addressed and appropriate models and algorithm have been developed for them, the unstructured problems have remained relatively unattended and the research works in this area tend to focus on single issues. This paper conceptualizes an umbrella framework using a "Viable Systems Diagnosis" VSD Model and a "Decision Framework", within which strategic decision making research applicable to construction can be coordinated and developed, thus avoiding wasteful duplication and gaps in knowledge. To this end, the research highlights the relevance and potential use of artificial intelligent techniques in assisting the managers with unstructured decisions. Further, it is argued that a strategic decision support system should assume an integrated structure, as many decision nodes, within the overall decision making structure, share common attributes and the inter- connection amongst these decision nodes has a complex structure. Therefore, the object oriented approach will provide an efficient structure for the development of the overall framework.

J	Kodama, M				Kodama, Mitsuru			Innovation through networked strategic communities: case study on NTT DoCoMo	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Knowledge management; Japan; Communities		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify key factors for generating new knowledge creation in the fields of high tech requiring the integration of a variety of technologies and business models. Design/methodology/approach - The case study will center on NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile communications carrier, where the author has had extensive experience in service development. The author has collected rich data related to development processes and uses the grounded theory-based approach to analyze seven concepts and the cause and effect relationships among them. Findings - In a short period of time, a strategic team at DoCoMo formed strategic communities (SCs) outside the company including customers, and then formed a network that transcended the SCs' boundaries. Orginality/value - The synthesizing capability of the leadership-based SCs comprising community leaders inside the networked SCs enabled DoCoMo to build new business models aimed at customers and achieve successful new product and service development ahead of its competitors.

In the coming 30 years, China's GDP growth will be around 7% annually, and the continuation of rapid economic growth could result in a number of difficult issues such as energy security, environment protection and CO2 emission reductions. China should solve these problems through its own efforts. The first step is to establish an empowered actor, and then to establish a comprehensive and coherent energy strategic system. Energy conservation should be promoted as a national policy with the highest priority. Measures such as the development of renewable energy, diffusion of international commercialised cleaner coal technologies and establishing an emergency response system, should be conducted with higher priority. At the same time, international cooperation such as establishing an Energy Community in the Northeast Asian region, is also an important strategic option.

J	Mueller, J; Williams, D; Higgins, A; Tou, M				Mueller, J.; Williams, D.; Higgins, A.; Tou, M.			The measurement of responsible governance and management of NPOs in New Zealand: an evaluation tool for NPOs, donors and government "If you have no money you have no mission"	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						New Zealand; Governance; Non-profit organizations		In New Zealand, as in many other developed countries around the world, news is made not just by those many organizations with superb performance records, but also by the few whose achievements fall far short of donor expectations and public perceptions. One of the core competencies of NPOs should be the ability to build strong donor relationships (Lewis, 1998), to create a sustainable income model which allows the organization to focus on their operational efforts. Funding uncertainties affect the ability to operate, to motivate and to plan for the future. Research (Mueller et al., 2004) was undertaken to determine how the relationship between NPOs and donors can be improved. This work focused on the identification of areas where NPOs need support to improve their governance and management functions. Both donors and NPOs were investigated, and the results were used to speculate in which areas external support would be most helpful and where donor/NPO perceptions differ. NPOs and donors indicated that they are aware that NPOs require both governance and managerial support. Both the NPOs and the donors indicated that an objective evaluation system would be valuable to them as evidence of credibility. Such a system would also help to guide the internal assessment process. These findings led to the development of the Looking Glass Evaluation Tool(LGET) which measures an organization along the following dimensions: effective management, strategic planning, advocacy, legal framework, governance and fundraising. The dimensions were derived partly from the work of Lester Salamon from the Nathan Cummings Foundation, New York. The LGET questions an organization about its levels of understanding, planning and implementation of governance and managerial functions and provides a snapshot of the organization's structural effectiveness. The tool does not test the outcomes of the organization's work; but speculates that an organization with poor internal structure will be less likely to perform sustainably, especially in the area of creating strong donor relationships. The tool is completed through a guided self-assessment process, which is then reviewed with the organization to assure a clear understanding of the review objectives. From this snapshot of performance in a wide range of areas, organizations can focus resources on specific parts of their work for improvement. The LGET has been trialled in its prototype form in a number of NPOs in New Zealand, including a Maori charitable trust and has been favorably received.

J	Pai, JC; Lee, GG				Pai, JC; Lee, GG			Towards a strategic information architecture (SIA) and its initial application	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						strategic information architecture	KEY ISSUES; SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT; INFRASTRUCTURE; FRAMEWORK	As e-business strategies have increasingly attracted the attention of industrial managers, information architecture (IA) is considered as an important blueprint for implementing a successful e-strategy. Furthermore, numerous information architectures have been proposed in recent years by researchers. However, these architectures focus on information systems (IS) and information technology (IT) perspectives, but neglect integration with the information management (IM) strategy. As the complexity of IS/IT applications in an e-business environment grows, effective IM strategy should be considered in developing information architectures. This study proposes a strategic information architecture (SIA) that integrates IS, IT and IM strategy while the IM strategy stresses three dimensions of business conditions and capabilities to cope with IS and IT strategy, including organizational structure, managerial activities and information use. The proposed SIA was initially assessed in a large hospital in Taiwan to examine its usefulness. The implications for IS practice and directions for future research are also discussed.

Performance management: outsourcing and behavioural dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						performance management; outsourcing; action inquiry; supply chains; intra-group relationships; group dynamics; exchange relationships		Empirical research captured information from a multinational EU leader in the financial services sector during the early stage of outsourcing IT services and an action inquiry methodology surfaced the embedded web of meanings relating to changes and effects on working relationships. The results identified the importance of addressing strategic performance issues and inter/intra relationships between parent company team members and their outsource counterparts. Conclusions indicate that behavioural issues such as psychological contracts within inter/intra work groups, power and trust are highly significant managerial performance issues when perceiving the success or failure of an outsourcing strategy, such that they potentially outweigh economic factors and corporate performance imperatives specified in the service level agreement.

We argue that alliances would be more valued by investors at the early stages of a process of convergence between two markets, whereas acquisitions would be more valued in the later stages. Using a sample of alliances and acquisitions carried out by European telecom firms, our hypotheses have been confirmed.

J	Shih, HA; Chiang, YH; Hsu, CC				Shih, Hsi-An; Chiang, Yun-Hwa; Hsu, Chu-Chun			Exploring HR outsourcing and its perceived effectiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						HR outsourcing; environmental dynamism; company strategy; contractor relationship		This study tries to explore the impact of HR outsourcing on its corresponding perceived effectiveness. Meanwhile, four variables, namely environmental dynamism, company strategy, HR involvement in the company's strategy process, and contractor relationship were employed to test the moderating effect between HR outsourcing and its effectiveness. Empirical data are collected from high-level HR executives in 153 large Taiwanese companies. Dynamic environment, prospector company strategy, and good contractor relationship are found to moderate positively the relationship of HR outsourcing and its perceived effectiveness. HR function's involvement in the company's strategic process is found to moderate negatively in the relationship between HR outsourcing and perceived effectiveness. Implications and limitation of this study are discussed.

J	Vedd, R; Kouhy, R				Vedd, Rishma; Kouhy, Reza			Interface between Management Accounting and Strategic Human Resource Management: Four Grounded Theory Case Studies	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						Management accountants; HR strategy; Communication	CONTROL-SYSTEMS	The objective of this research project was to ascertain the role of management accountants in relation to strategic human resource management (SHRM) and the information provided for SHRM. To achieve this objective four case studies (two UK and two Canadian organisations) were conducted using a grounded theory approach. The two most important HR strategies in these cases were training and leadership development, which were linked to the overall goals of each organisation. Management accountants played a key role in providing information for the SHRM planning process in all four cases. The role of management accountants during the strategic planning process was very much as integral team members with a facilitating role. In all four cases management accountants provided HR managers with information for decision making. Management accountants were involved in helping to set HR targets, measuring HR performance, reporting and communicating to HR managers. From the cross- case analysis of these cases, four hypotheses or conclusions emerged. The overall conclusion is that management accountants in these four cases had several roles in relation to SHRM. Management accountants (as well as HR and other managers) agreed that, in the future, management accountants needed to develop even further their business partnership role with HR managers.

Integral Sensemaking for Executives: The Evolution of Spiritually-based Integral Consciousness	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SPIRITUALITY & RELIGION			English	Article						Spirituality; Integral Management; Sensemaking; Consciousness	STRATEGIC ISSUES	This article presents philosophy and theory supporting an integral approach to executive sensemaking and problem solving, which is beginning to emerge as a result of the continuing evolution of consciousness. Integral sensemaking is contrasted with the mental-rational approach that has characterized management practice in the industrial and post-industrial eras. The two approaches to sensemaking are applied to the organizational context in five key areas: leadership, strategy formulation, organizational culture, ethical culture, and human resource management. Implications of the evolution of consciousness on management and spirituality and on organizations are discussed.

Rating and Evaluating the Combined Financial and Environmental Performance of Companies in the Metals and Mining Sector	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Benchmarking; financial/environmental screening; rating and ranking		The basic intent in financial performance evaluation is to appraise current business operations internally and to benchmark them against similar business operations externally in order to identify best-in-class practices. In this paper, a new positive environmental/financial screening approach that can simultaneously include a wide combination of regulatory, technological. operational and event dimensions is created for the analyzing, rating, ranking, benchmarking. and selecting of companies from an industry sector. A method is provided that advances the use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for rating and ranking diverse groups of companies using a combination of both financial and environmental performance measures. This novel approach proceeds by first stratifying the sector into comparably efficient groups of companies through the construction of a series of efficient DEA frontiers, and then by ranking each company within these groups relative to DEA-based contextual attractiveness measures calculated from the different partitions. The method is illustrated through an application to a group of companies from the Metals and Mining Industry sector.

J	Chiang, PC; Gates, TK				Chiang, PC; Gates, TK			Strategic river water quality planning using calibrated stochastic simulation	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article						water quality; rivers; simulation; uncertainty analysis; Colorado; stochastic models	LONG-TERM; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL	Coordinated application of empirical and physically based stochastic models, based upon diverse and variable field data, creates a method for river water quality planning that is calibrated to account for parameter uncertainty. The models are applied to assess interventions for improving the quality of river flows diverted for irrigation along a 190-km segment of the South Platte River in Colorado. Eleven different pollution control strategies are considered, alone and in combination. Statistics of total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved nitrogen (N) species, and fecal coliform concentrations are modeled, along with associated probabilities of violation of recommended criteria and the spatial and temporal uniformity of these probabilities. Over a 25-year horizon, for example, combined pollution control measures are predicted to achieve average reductions from 27 to 36% and from 31 to 39% in mean concentrations of TDS and N, respectively, for the 11 irrigation diversions located along the 53-km stretch just downstream of Denver. Uncertainty in predicted concentrations, as measured by the coefficient of variation, is considerable. An average decrease of 18 percentage points in the probability of violation for TDS is predicted, while. the estimated average decrease for N and fecal coliform is a modest 6 to 8 percentage points.

J	Van Merode, F; Nieboer, A; Maarse, H; Lieverdink, H				Van Merode, F; Nieboer, A; Maarse, H; Lieverdink, H			Analyzing the dynamics in multilateral negotiations	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						multilateral negotiations; decision making; phase-differences; continuity of participation; cluster analysis; dynamic analysis	NETHERLANDS; CHOICE; MODELS	The purpose of this article is to examine phase-differences in the patterns of actors involved in decision making. Two phases are distinguished, the negotiating phase, and the decision-making phase. During the first phase the agent's primary goal is to influence the policy position of other agents, whereas during the second phase the agent's goal is to find a solution (especially if there is a credible threat of a worse outcome). Convincing others is easier in a bilateral setting than in a multilateral one, and thus the decision-making phase is expected to result in an increase in multilateral interactions. To reveal the participation pattern of agents, we discuss methods for quantitative analyses of complex negotiations. A dynamic analysis of participation in multilateral negotiations gives insight into the continuity and change of participation during a negotiating process. The process of determining prices for specialized medical. care in The Netherlands is used as a case study. The quantitative methods seem to be useful for analyzing such a complex case. Following our hypothesis, in the case study multilateral contacts are, shown to be more frequent over time as compared to bilateral negotiations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dessureault, S				Dessureault, S			Justification techniques for computer integrated mining	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY			English	Article							MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES	Computer Integrated Mining (CIMG) is a process of using computer networks to transform islands of enabling technologies into a highly interconnected mining system. CIMG involves the integration of advanced technologies at various levels in the mine business to achieve higher flexibility, better quality of processes and control, and improved profitability. justifying the benefits of CIMG are difficult as many of the advantages are derived from improved flexibility, quality, and control. justification is based on the evaluation of the benefits to be gained, compared to the required capital investment. Management tools used in mining are currently inadequate in assessing the value of advanced technology whose benefits are primarily qualitative. A key aspect of successful implementation is management acceptance, which has to be won through the capability to justify the technology's financial costs and the true value of all of its benefits. The manufacturing industry faced similar justification difficulties when adopting advanced technology in factories. A significant amount of funding and research was invested in developing management strategies and approaches to justification. Many of the problems that faced the transformation of the manufacturing industry in the late Eighties and early Nineties are now facing mining. The solutions derived for manufacturing may help mining in its transition to an increased reliance on integration technology. Reviewing the industrial history of computer integrated manufacturing identifies several tools and strategic frameworks that can be adapted for mining.

J	Kosaka, H				Kosaka, H			Japanese managerial behavior in strategic planning - Case analyses in global business contexts	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						behavior; culture; collectivity; globalization; management; Japan		Although globalization urges corporations worldwide to pursue economic efficiency, culturally induced differences in corporate behavior persist in a globalized business world. This paper explores the behavior of Japanese corporations in this context. Interviews were conducted to investigate the internal decision-making process in major Japanese firms. Their outcome provides the basis for the following hypothesis: A unique characteristic of Japanese companies, which can be different from that of Western firms, is that they have similar managerial behavior with other Japanese companies in the same industry. The collectivity culture exists behind it. This hypothesis is attested by case analyses of historical events of two Japanese industries in the global market in the past half century. Japanese firms in the automotive and electronic industries exhibited similar behavior in their entries to foreign markets either in marketing or production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Louis, GE				Louis, GE			Using strategic risk management to maximize the benefit-cost ratio of community water projects	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								Infrastructure projects in rural communities usually cost more and benefit fewer people than similar projects in urban or large communities. Because they have relatively low ratios of benefits to costs, small-scale investments in water and sanitation infrastructure are difficult to justify by standard benefit-cost ratio criteria. Strategic risk management (SRM) enhances standard cost-benefit analysis by including economic, social, and environmental benefits and subtracting the value of volunteer labor from costs. When the life-cycle benefits of small projects are factored in, their benefit-cost ratio increases, as does their appeal as public investments. SRM was applied to a program in Virginia (Self-Help Virginia [SHV]) that helps residents of small rural communities secure funding and implement solutions for local development problems. Since its establishment in 1998, SHV has helped small and low-to moderate-income communities build water and sanitation infrastructure, spending just $3.1 million on projects conventionally estimated to cost $8.8 million. Program funds pay for the hardware required, and the community provides labor and other resources needed to complete the project, gaining skills, experience, and other benefits in the process. SRM is a perfect match for SHV programs because the risk-based approach includes both these overlooked benefits as well as the hidden costs of risk avoidance when an infrastructure problem goes unresolved. For state-level decision-makers, the enhanced cost-benefit analysis provided by SRM makes small-scale projects more competitive and easier to justify. Utility managers can use SRM analysis to better evaluate competing projects and effectively leverage their investments.

The company was initially structured as a distributor of new information technologies to the French and European market which secondarily provided training in the use of its products. Valtech now positions itself as a pure knowledge-transfer firm which instructs clients in the strategic use and development of cutting-edge electronic technologies. Valtech organised itself according to KM principles in 1993, but only became aware of KM as a formal organising framework in 1998. While the adoption of KM is often `pushed' onto companies by the academic or consulting communities, Valtech pulled itself toward KM organising logics by the New Age of business it defined for itself. The following introduces Valtech and traces its development over nine years.

J	Kuo, HC				Kuo, HC			Strategic change for the banking industry under financial deregulation: implications from Taiwan evidence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						financial deregulation; strategic change; operational environment; top management team (TMT)	TOP MANAGEMENT TEAM; ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; PERFORMANCE; RENEWAL	Through progressive financial liberalisation, banks are now facing more competition than ever before. In response to the impact of deregulation, strategic changes have been initiated within the banking industry. This study concentrates on the impact caused by Taiwan's financial deregulation on banks' new operational environment and their top-management-team (TMT) members. This deregulation is responsible for banks' strategic change when under the control of technology innovation and market competition. The findings indicate that government regulation and law, product market and demand, industrial technology, and TMT characteristics are all significantly associated with banks' strategic change. Specifically, the results indicate that banking deregulation, the change in market competition and customer demand, the dispersion of TMT tenure, and the TMT industrial seniority are positively associated with banks' strategic change. On the contrary, banks' MIS improvement is negatively associated with banks' strategic change. This paper further finds that a TMT member who is in the 'deposits' or 'loans' profession will be in a hurry to respond to market competition, and thus mobilise in order to permit the bank's strategic changes.

Five input variables were selected for sensitization: Unit Mission Costs, Average Acre Costs, Net Value Change, Production Rates, and Escaped Fire Limits. A stratified random sample of 32 national forests was selected, according to the distribution of nationalforests within Forest Service regions and fire frequency classes, on the basis of historical fire data. NFMAS database tables were obtained and manipulated, with each variable increased and decreased at six levels (+/-25, +/-50, and 100%). Results indicated that Production Rates was always the most influential variable, Unit Mission Costs was always least influential, and the influence of the other variables depends on the choice of model outcome. In general, greater sensitivity changes resulted in greater changes in model outcome, but no consistent pattern of influence could be found regarding program option.

Biotechnology is the most research-intensive economic activity in existence today. Inter-firm collaboration is a major support of research, since most biotech firms are unable to secure all the research resources they need on their own. The ecology of biotech collaboration and its importance is considered firstly, along with the various collaborative modes and their causes. A second part then addresses the question of whether inter-firm collaboration actually strengthens research intensity. Two main types of collaborative arrangements, strategic research alliances and subcontracting, are considered. Insights into the importance of inter-firm collaborative relationships for research are provided, based on extensive empirical analyses of US commercial biotech establishments. Establishing inter-firm collaborative relationships is considered to be vital as commercial biotechnology research becomes more independent from academic research.

The resources are placed within an unconstrained floor space and the position and orientation of each resource are to be determined. A known analytical technique for the FLP, based on the univariate search method with controlled convergence, is extended to account for this type of FLP. A novel material handling cost function is introduced, which incorporates more realistic assumption than the ones previously found in the literature. Finally, an example to illustrate the heuristic procedure is presented, as well as computational results. Significance: Facility layout design is a strategic decision-making process, due to its long-term impact on the costs and operational efficiency of the associated production system. The FLP model proposed in this paper extends previous works by taking into account more realistic assumptions regarding the resources in the layout.

J	Brooker, P				Brooker, P			Future air traffic management: strategy and control philosophy	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							SAFETY	The aim is to explore the philosophy of air traffic management with different strategic visions of the future: to answer the key question: 'Who is to prevent mid-air collisions and how are they to accomplish this?' The best strategic vision may just be the one that has the best match with the consensus on the desired strategic direction. Nevertheless. it must satisfy the main safety, financial, human performance etc. constraints. To explore the question, a blend of concepts from a range of disciplines has been used. These include risk analysis, financial decision-making, 'cognitive engineering' research and simple cybernetics. 'full delegation' - with pilots being responsible for all the tasks related to separation assurance - appears to meet most of the constraints. Some important issues for safety analyses of full delegation are sketched. Research into the nature and rate of future conflicts in a full delegation environment, using models of error processes, is crucial.

Aim: To judge the effectiveness of a given lesion design, definite endpoints are necessary to ascertain the completeness of the line of block produced. Methods and results: We report validation criteria for long linear lesions in the right atrium in 42 pts, that combine both conventional and 3D mapping information (CARTO). Transferring from the validation of bidirectional block of the cavotricuspid isthmus line for atrial flutter, we validated 2 additional long linear lesions in the right atrium (anterior line and intercaval line). In addition to a complete isthmus line in all 42 pts, in 28 pts a complete anterior line was achieved and validated by both conventional and CARTO criteria. A complete intercaval line was deployed in 11 pts with complete anterior and isthmus lines (with a characteristic shift for the intercaval line) and in 5 pts without a complete anterior line (without characteristic shift). Conclusions: Conventional catheters placed at strategic locations on opposite sides of the intended ablation line, can depict a sudden characteristic change in the activation sequence. Using a combination of both techniques, deployment and validation of long linear lesion can be facilitated.

J	Benita, C				Benita, C			Accountability lost: the rise and fall of double entry	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						double entry book keeping; accounting information systems; events accounting; strategic information systems planning	SYSTEM	This paper discusses the need for modern accounting systems to meet the criteria of both 'accountability' and 'usefulness' and argues that the traditional double entry book keeping system serves as a constraint on the achievement of system usefulness. We look at the problems associated with the double entry book keeping system and argue for its replacement with an events accounting system (EAS) model which is more appropriate to current business requirements. We also consider the need to extend the EAS model to more adequately meet the criterion of system usefulness. It is suggested that the integration of an EAS approach with that of a strategic information systems planning approach, facilitates the meeting of this objective. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Barnes, GR; Cerrito, PB; Levi, I				Barnes, GR; Cerrito, PB; Levi, I			Construction of well separated interaction semigroups to refine the modeling of social networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						social networks; interaction; semigroup; kernel		The techniques developed in this paper suggest an objective standard for the process that refines the generation of interaction semigroups associated with social networks. A constructed interaction semigroup S is assessed with respect to measurements used in the original construction. This information, summarized in the pair (m(1), m(2))(S) associated with the semigroup S, is a comparison of the closeness of the elements of the same class as compared to the closeness of the elements from distinct classes of S. It is desirable to have more separation between the elements from distinct classes and more "closeness" between the elements within a class. We use this idea to produce a separated interaction semigroup with more separation between distinct classes. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Sporting literature is replete with studies on the relationship between sport participation and academic achievement. This paper is concerned with the general malaise evident in the sporting lives of both the staff and students at the two public universities in the Northern Province of South Africa and the factors and reasons contributing to this. These universities have much in common in terms of their histories, geographical location, academic programmes and objectives. The sport problems discussed in this paper are the concerns expressed by members of the Strategic Planning Task Team on Sport and the Sport and Recreation Advisory Committee regarding the delivery of sport and recreation on the two campuses. The other concerns include the lack of a viable sport and recreation programme, inadequate sport and recreation infrastructures and personnel, low level of values associated with individual and community sport participation, poor funding and poor government commitment to sport. Suggestions are proffered for developing, fostering and indeed, sharpening people's passion for sports and recreation and for raising the standard of sport development in universities.

It also explores the complementarities between two theoretical perspectives of social and economic networks, The context within which this research is located is Esprit, the European Strategic Programme for Research in IT. The empirical evidence is based on a success story of a UK main contractor in Esprit. The main finding is that formal collaboration networks in Esprit emerge out of informal personal networks, rather than vice versa.

J	de Leeuw, BJ; de Wolf, P; van den Bosch, FAJ				de Leeuw, BJ; de Wolf, P; van den Bosch, FAJ			The changing role of technology suppliers in the pharmaceutical industry: the case of drug delivery companies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technology collaboration; pharmaceutical industry; product development; appropriability	INNOVATION; INTEGRATION	In this paper preliminary results of a research project on strategies of drug delivery companies (DDC) is presented to discuss the changing role of technology suppliers in the pharmaceutical industry. Changes in the pharmaceutical industry are presented briefly and related to developments in the drug delivery industry. The early observations are contrasted with existing views from the literature on outsourcing in general and outsourcing of R&D activities in particular. The importance of the accessibility of `complementary activities', and `appropriability regimes' in the pharmaceutical industry and its role in the creation of strategic opportunities for the DDCs is then elaborated upon. Propositions concerning the shift of drug delivery companies to become fully integrated pharmaceutical companies are forwarded on observations of the current status and recent developments in the drug delivery industry. The strategic path for DDCs is outlined based upon three sets of motives: pharmacotherapy improvement related motives, financial motives and strategic motives.

Case studies reported here exemplify that CI and quality enabling factors have been inseparably linked. It was concluded that the CI process within R&D can have an influence at three levels: project, process and strategic. In each of these levels CI enabling mechanisms have been identified and the functioning of these within an Integrated Quality Management System are discussed.

J	Roberts, JH; Morrison, PD				Roberts, JH; Morrison, PD			Assessing market structure and company fit based on consumer perceptions in dynamic information technology markets	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						new product; market structure		Convergence between computing, home entertainment, and telecommunications has become a technologically driven reality during the nineties. However, little attention has been paid to how consumers will evaluate products resulting from the combination of these industries. Ultimately, it is consumer choice that will drive the economic success of companies participating in these markets and a precursor to that choice is high perceived utility. Utility in turn is determined by consumer beliefs about product attributes. This paper examines consumer perceptions of various existing electronic information product categories and calibrates preference for manufacturers that compete within them. It shows how manufacturers can be represented in the same perceptual space as categories, and it estimates the preference drivers of both product categories and suppliers overall, as well as supplier performance in specific categories. Analysis of the existing market provides a platform from which to examine how consumers will evaluate new categories. In particular, we examine the convergence of television sets and personal computers, and estimate how well different suppliers are positioned to take advantage of this evolving market, including strategic alliances between similar and diverse manufacturers.

Romney and associates to analyses of endogamy, and discusses the more general themes explored in these endogamy studies. The techniques used in these papers are relevant to many types of analysis of contingency tables, and to other settings such as social mobility. Some of these connections are explored here, all with a view to the importance of the margins of the table for different kinds of analysis. In particular, the paper discusses descriptive and analytical uses of classical iterative proportional fitting (IPF), some specific log-linear models, and the margins of sociomatrices. The paper also includes analyses of example data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yamaguchi, K				Yamaguchi, K			The structural and behavioral characteristics of the smallest-world phenomenon: minimum distance networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						minimum distance networks; small-world phenomenon; rational choice of network ties; Nash equilibria	SOCIAL NETWORKS; MODEL; INFORMATION	This paper clarifies the structural and behavioral characteristics of minimum distance networks of diameter 2 and the relationship between the formation of minimum distance networks and the small-world phenomenon. These networks are evaluated in terms of efficiency of indirect contact/ communication, parsimony in the use of edges, non separability, and expected inefficiency under the random elimination of a single node. Related existing graph-theoretic theorems are reviewed and are integrated into a description of these networks. In addition, a rational choice theory of ego-centric network ties is introduced to evaluate the relevance of minimum distance networks for the small-world phenomenon. In particular, Nash equilibria derived from utility models of ego-centric network ties for rational actors are described. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V.

A set of recommended guidelines suggest where to position, how to dimension and when to replenish both safety and strategic stocks. Trade-offs between stock positioning and dimensioning and between stock positioning and replenishment order triggering are outlined. The study reveals also that most of the decisions are system specific, so that they should be evaluated in a quantitative manner through simulation. A case study is reported, where the benefits from adopting the new proposed methodology lie in-achieving the target service level even under peak demand conditions, with the value of safety stocks as a whole growing only by about 20 per cent.

J	Foster, RS; Gupta, A; Deshpande, S				Foster, RS; Gupta, A; Deshpande, S			Evolution of the high-end computing market in the USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						high-end computing; supercomputing; technology strategy; government research	INNOVATION	This paper focuses on the technological change in the high-end computing market. The discussion combines historical analysis with strategic analysis to provide a framework to analyse a key component of the computer industry. This analysis begins from the perspective of government research and development spending; then examines the confusion around the evolution of the high-end computing market in the context of standard theories of technology strategy and new product innovation. Rather than the high-end market being 'dead', one should view the market as changing due to increased capability and competition from the low-end personal computer market. The high-end market is also responding to new product innovation from the introduction of new parallel computing architectures. In the conclusion, key leverage points in the market are identified and the trends in high-end computing are highlighted with implications.

Based on a study of the implementation of Knowledge Management to support the e-Banking activities of a retail bank, a framework of competence-based Knowledge Management practice is proposed combining tacit and explicit forms of knowledge and collective forms of learning in the context of work practices. A conceptualization of the type of technological support required for the realization of the Knowledge Management practice framework is also provided through the case study discourse. The framework constitutes for organizations and especially banks an innovative proposition for Knowledge Management with clear methodological and technological implications.

The primary findings of this study are: 1) different business strategies result in different levels of dependence on design attributes; 2) design attributes comprising design for image, design for features, design for use, design for cost, design for market, and design for quality were commonly found and highly performed by all five firms; 3) the higher the degree of strategic alignment perceived by the design manager, the greater the number of utility patents and design patents registered by the firm. In addition, four ways to examine the alignment between design and strategy have been proposed.

J	Tang, V; Lee, MH				Tang, V; Lee, MH			International joint venture of two giants in the CRT industry: strategy analysis using system dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International Joint Venture (IJV); strategic alliance; system dynamics; business strategy; competitive strategy; Cathode Ray Tube (CRT); display devices	ALLIANCES; COOPERATION; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; INSTABILITY; EVOLUTION; PROFITS; FUTURE	The past decade has seen a dramatic rise in the number international joint ventures (IJV) and a great majority of them fail. Although the research literature continues to expand, there is an imbalance to the attention paid to the process and operational management side of IJVs. We begin this article with a survey of the literature and we segment the research stream into the life cycle phases of an IJV: the IJV input, process, and output schools of investigation. Then, we present an overview of the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) industry and the competitive forces that influenced LG and Philips to form a strategic joint venture. Next, which is the core of this article, we use the disciplines of system dynamics to perform strategy analyses of the dynamics of the LG-Philips IJV. The fundamental intent of this paper is to demonstrate how system dynamics is an effective analytic instrument to derive strategic measures, as well as countermeasures to strengthen the IJV operations and to weaken competitors and blunt the impact of their actions. We show how we can model technology-intensive businesses, in the context of industries and markets, by means of systems with intricate and technology-idiosyncratic feedback characteristics, but whose complex system behaviour is substantially more easily discernable from their graphic representations. Fourth, we close this article with a discussion on the limitations of our analysis and potential areas for further research.

J	Brandolese, A; Cartegni, E; Cigolini, R				Brandolese, A; Cartegni, E; Cigolini, R			Improving productivity by using strategic inventories: theoretical issues and field results	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							SUPPLY CHAIN DYNAMICS; MRP SYSTEM NERVOUSNESS; DEMAND; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; POLICIES; MODEL; DESIGN; STOCK	The study investigated the effectiveness of a new proposed inventory control technique to improve materials productivity for make-to-order and/or assembly-to-order companies. This new model is designed to manage peaks of finished products market demand, allowing the operative working capital to be reduced. The model fits real-life manufacturing environments where a satisfactory level of return on investments in capital goods is a prerequisite. Furthermore, the model can face the changing external environment and the parameters upon which production system performances depend. This is particularly true when the control technique is required to react to a reduction of the delivery lead-time, which is commonplace of the majority of competitive markets. Finally, a multistage production system environment is analysed early and the applicability of the model in various real-life industrial environments is suggested. To this purpose, a set of case histories of Italian companies belonging to different branches of industry is reported.

The goals of crisis management include survival, maintaining quality and service, learning issues and impacts, supporting the team, and preparing for the aftermath as the crisis subsides. Survival calls for a commitment by leaders to remain focused, and to maintain and support the management team. Pharmacy directors must be able to adapt to chaos and to the limited information disseminated by senior leadership. Identifying the underlying cause of the crisis, which may not be directly related to the measures taken to resolve it, is also critical to survival. Among the keys to maintaining quality and service are keeping the staff focused on patient care and maintaining credibility by sharing all information that is available. Pharmacy directors need to maintain the confidence of their staff members and to encourage them to do the best they can with the resources available. Taking the initiative to acquire appropriate data, to translate that data into relevant information, and to seek benchmarks for comparison is also important. Once the crisis has passed, attention must be given to updating and maintaining databases, supporting the staff, and improving morale. Scenario planning can help identify measures that might be taken if another crisis should develop. Using principles of managing up can prepare pharmacy directors for optimal response to an institutional financial crisis.

Since actions on water supply systems are usually at the local level, this is an area where individual citizens can become highly involved if motivated and energized with financial incentives. Community education is vitally important for sensitization and mobilization of the rural communities so as to achieve commitment and sustainability. The theme of this discussion is that water-using development projects should fulfil the real local needs for improved production, social conditions and cultural achievement. consequently, a strategic approach for managing water resources sustainably is essential to the actual planning, development and implementation of water-related development activities.

A concentrated effort on the front end of projects is necessary to expertly set priorities appropriately so that timelines are realistic and achievable. Some of the major components critical to the mix are the organization, planning, and execution of start-up activities in clinical operations, the development of sound strategic planning by project management, a cohesive project team, solid and consistent leadership and constant interaction between all departments and disciplines, and training. The development of a solid project plan as a foundation to include tools to adequately assess anticipated potential risks with contingency plans will provide the basis for successful implementation and execution. It is also a key component to identify study staff with relevant skills and experience appropriate to work on specific projects to achieve an overall fit. Development of a training program to prepare the internal and field project members must be designed in order to effectively execute strategies. Also critical to the mix, priority must be given to the development of effective modes of communication to ensure seamless interactions among the members of the project team internally and externally, and to track key study parameters in order to measure the true progress of a program at any given moment. In this article, tools to prepare strategic project plans, effective management of all study staff, manipulation of timelines to achieve on time completion of studies, and strategies to minimize queries to accelerate study and database closure at the conclusion of studies will be discussed.

The traditional design has been a bureaucracy with a hierarchical management structure. As individual hospitals develop new business relationships to form health systems, there is a need for innovative solutions that provide the flexibility and responsiveness necessary for successful health care management. One traditional business model, the SBU, or strategic business unit, may serve as a template for the development of product or service lines.

J	Atkins, EM; Duffy, MC; Bain, DJ				Atkins, EM; Duffy, MC; Bain, DJ			The practice characterization model: The importance of organizational life cycles and targeted interventions in general medical practice	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						general practice; organisational development; facilitation		In response to a climate of constant change and increasing demand for services, general practice in the UK has undergone significant modification over the last 10 years. It has become a multi-disciplinary organisation encouraged by funding bodies to plan for service delivery using a more structured team based approach. In Tayside in 1996, practices were charged with producing formal Practice Development Plans (PDPs) which would focus on priority areas aligned with the Health Boards own strategic plan-those were teamwork, information management and technology, and clinical service delivery. The University of Dundee's Department of General Practice successfully applied for funding to develop ways of facilitating practices so that they could a) identify their own development priorities, and b) plan and implement action and learning to see these priorities through. Using action research methodology, the project attempted to create a climate for change, provide support and training to see the changes implemented, and ensure commitment to the changes from all members of the practice team. The Facilitator adopted a flexible style varying her role between expert, guide and support. Analysis of progress made by different practices. coupled with the Facilitator's in depth knowledge of them, suggested the importance of certain key aspects of practice organisation and culture. A practice characterisation model identified practices which were stable, currently coping, proactive and ready to face the challenge of change as best placed to engage in a full scale development programme. Other profiles suggested a range of alternative interventions as more likely to be acceptable and productive.

J	Kharbanda, VP				Kharbanda, VP			Strategic technology management and international competition in developing countries - The need for a dynamic approach	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article								The present scenario of free trade, globalization and intense international competition calls for a strategic development of technology management particularly in the developing country enterprises to enable them to quicken technology capability building and compete in the international market. The present paper explores the need and measures to adopt such a strategy and build up technology innovation systems to leap-frog and meet the above objectives taking a few examples from Indian scenario. It is argued that the ITC of a country is the sum total of TM capabilities of the firms in that country. Moreover, both TM and ITC are cumulative, incremental and are therefore evolutionary in nature. It is necessary, therefore, to talk about dynamic indicators of ITC. Such dynamic indicators are captured best in the mechanisms of selections - of choices and preferences on structures of incentives and strategies. We argue that national indicators of ITC are the same as the firm level indicators of dynamic TM; and indicators of dynamic TM are the indicators of choices and preferences on structures of incentives and strategies.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						General Electric; corporate succession; Jack Welch; corporate strategy		Succession in large established corporations is a difficult process, particularly after a charismatic leader. This paper discusses the succession at GE, after 20 years of leadership by Jack Welch. One theory states that GE is built to last and the 'GE System' will take care of the transition from Welch to his designated successor, Jeffrey Immelt. The second theory states that Welch is a unique leader who controls GE's destiny and will be difficult to follow. The challenges to Immelt and two strategic alternatives that he could adopt are discussed.

At the same time, industry competitive relationships are changing, business models being challenged, delivery mechanisms changing, and content formats proliferating. Asset and media management systems pose particularly difficult investment decisions because of their central role in the production infrastructure and their cost. After reviewing rite business issues, the paper suggests that content management sq,stems should expect to work in distributed, federated, and collaborative contexts. This implies specific requirements on content management systems for content location and identification, for version and configuration management, and/or project and task control systems.

J	Mohanty, RP; Deshmukh, SG				Mohanty, RP; Deshmukh, SG			Business process reengineering: Value innovation in industrial engineering practices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						BPR; change management; innovation; process design; productivity	PROCESS REDESIGN	Business organizations across the globe have become crazy in implementing business process reengineering (BPR) projects during 1990s. Global management consulting firms are inducing and motivating many companies, both manufacturing and services to be in the race for sustaining competitive advantages by adopting BPR as the strategic purpose. But, the fundamentals leading to the success of BPR projects live in radical innovations in multiple dimensions, because innovations can only lead to transformation and vice versa. Industrial engineering (IE) as a discipline has made enormous contributions in bringing changes in organizational practices. In this paper, BPR is conceptualized as a set of comprehensive value innovations in Industrial Engineering practices. Therefore, it is needed to refocus, restructure and integrate the sporadic and stand-alone innovative contributions of IE and to make committed attempts to implement BPR Successfully. This paper is an attempt to explore the state-of-art in IE practices and put forth some conceptualizations and experiential learning.

This analysis can serve to explain diverse distributional structures, including the coexistence of vertically integrated firms and independent retailers.

J	Wang, HF; Chang, WY				Wang, HF; Chang, WY			Fuzzy scenario analysis in strategic planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						strategic planning; scenario analysis; fuzzy set theory; possibility		The aim of this study is to investigate the properties and method of fuzzy scenario analysis. In order to cope with the issues of data shortage and linguistic expression of an expert in a strategic planning, this study incorporates the concept of fuzzy set theory into scenario analysis, so that the uncertainties involved in a strategic planning can be considered. Based on Brauers and Weber's method in scenario analysis, we propose a method of the fuzzy scenario analysis. It includes: (1) the analysis of factors, (2) the possible analysis of outcomes, (3) the compatible analysis of scenarios, (4) the possible analysis of scenarios, and (5) the determination of the main scenarios. Following this structure, we can describe main pictures of future developments (usually 2 to 4) with their degrees of possibilities. Then we shall compare the proposed method with Brauers & Weber's method.

J	Park, MC; Lee, SW				Park, MC; Lee, SW			A new venture performance model in the Korean information and telecommunications industry	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article							ENTREPRENEURIAL; BUSINESS; STRATEGY; IMPACT	In this paper, we investigate on the determinants of new venture performance empirically and suggest a new venture performance model in the Korean Information and Telecommunications (IT) industry, A total of seven hypotheses is established and tested using a combination of factor analysis, cluster analysis, analysis of variance, and correlation analysis, Ninety-two sample ventures in the Korean IT industry were investigated and analyzed to test hypotheses, We found that new ventures performance depends on their environment, strategy, internal resources factors, and, most importantly two-way and three-way interactions of these factors. These findings could be interpreted as supporting the general strategy theory that when environment and internal resources are fitted, performance might be maximized and, further, strategy is the means that make internal resources and environment fit. The venture performance model presented in this paper can explain how new ventures achieve their successes. The strategic implications to the venture firms are also discussed.

J	Flood, E; Ramachandran, N				Flood, E; Ramachandran, N			Integrating active and passive management - To produce superior investment results.	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EFFICIENT CAPITAL-MARKETS	Many investors think of active and passive management as mutually exclusive approaches in investment management; they are proponents of either active or passive management. In the view of the authors, it is more useful to think of these investment management approaches as lying along a continuum, with passive management using index replication at one end of the continuum, and active management using aggressively concentrated portfolios at the other end. Both investment management approaches have benefits and shortcomings. By combining active and passive approaches to investment management, plan sponsors, foundations, and endowments can maximize the benefit potential and may minimize the shortcoming; of each to improve overall portfolio results. The authors compare the two approaches, discuss their historical performance, and present a framework for combining the two on a strategic (long-run), tactical (medium-run), and dynamic (short-run) basis.

JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Strategic asset allocation studies often deal with international assets on an unhedged basis. The potential hedging of international investments is either not considered at all or is left as a secondary decision after the overall commitment to international assets is established. The authors argue that this practice introduces a systematic and substantial bias against international investing and the use of hedging to reduce currency risk.

J	Lawrence, A				Lawrence, A			Changing architectural practice paradigms and their implications for professional education	JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH			English	Article								The intent of this paper is twofold: to reflect on the architectural profession's varied responses to changes that occurred in the business environment over the last half of this century and to explicate key curricular concepts that educators can engage in the development and implementation of informed architectural pedagogy that acknowledges strategic responses that were initiated by practitioners in order to gain market advantage. Of fundamental concern is the gradual change irt market demand for architectural services that began in the early 1960s and became more pronounced due to prevailing economic pressures during the early 1990s. This change, still in progress, impacts architectural education because it is being fueled by mt increasing demand for architectural services that are integral to strategic management-dependent project delivery systems in contrast to traditional creative design-dependent approaches to building design. Because in a chain of events education models incorporate concern for progressive and viable practice models, this paper examines the changing contexts of professional practice and recent developments in methods of project delivery, which are causing a fundamental restructuring or paradigm shift within the profession of architecture. The implications of consequentially emerging practice paradigms for professional education are also considered by exploring means by which corresponding relationships between these can be enhanced.

J	Chatterjee, J				Chatterjee, J			Managing customer relationships in the e-business economy	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article								Old business practices built around traditional product marketing and sales are being rapidly modified or replaced by customer centric relationship marketing in which share of customer is the economic driver. Technology has reached a state where quantum leaps can be made toward the ultimate competitive form of relationship building, one-to-one marketing. In this new paradigm, customer data is both a strategic asset and critical success factor. Relationship marketing in its best competitive expression, one-to-one marketing, rests on three very simple ideas about reducing costs and increasing long-term profitability: customer loyalty, scope and efficiency. ECRM, i.e., Customer Relationship Management at the convergence of e-business is a discipline as well as a set of discrete software and technologies which focuses on automating and improving the business processes associated with managing customer relationships in the areas of sales, marketing, customer service, and support. eCRM software applications not only facilitate the coordination of multiple business functions (sales, marketing, customer service, and support) but also coordinate multiple channels of communication with the customer-face to face, call center and the we-so that organisations can accommodate their customers' preferred channels of interaction.										0	2	2	2	7	NATL INST SCIENCE COMMUNICATION	NEW DELHI	DR K S KRISHNAN MARG, NEW DELHI 110 012, INDIA	0022-4456			J SCI IND RES INDIA	J.

J	Hankey, RH				Hankey, RH			The 41st John Arthur Wilson Memorial Lecture: How to be competitive in the new millenium	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN LEATHER CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								It is important For the leather industry, in the developed world in particular, to understand "How to be competitive in the new Millennium". Although there have been booming stock markets, much of the industry has moved to the developing world. This has been as a result of following the labour intensive shoe and garment industries. The difference in labour cost is so significant that where price alone dominates, namely in commodity products, then the lower labour-cost countries have distinct advantage. However, upholstery, wet-blue, niche products and the "Made in Italy" cache seem to have bucked the trend, therefore it can be done. In today's rapidly changing world tanners must first recognise the need to change. Doing what you've always done will result in decline. No change is not an option. The primary answer for competitive advantage rests with the calibre, training, motivation and goal alignment of the PEOPLE involved. The issue is business wide and the approach depends upon the Business fundamentals, namely the functions of the business, and the Managerial fundamentals or the how we operate. The discussion of managerial fundamentals, strategy, leadership, people and culture explores many aspects. Key topics for inclusion in the strategic vision are identified. Leadership skills throughout the structure are essential because in a change environment experienced, able risk takers are needed. Decision making and motivation theory are explored including Maslow, McGregor and Hertzberg. Management must establish a no fear, creative culture based on mutual trust, giving people the freedom to innovate. The Business fundamentals include Marketing, Sales, Innovation, Manufacturing, Raw Material and Finance. Marketing identifies the key differentiators as Brand, Innovation and Price. Innovation "The Creation of Change" is discussed including views on people, culture and approach of senior management. Manufacturing needs to be "Better, Faster and Cheaper" and the 20 keys approach is reflected upon together with Deming methodology and statistical process control. In conclusion, leather makers can achieve competitiveness. They need to change their approach and their culture. Innovation is the life blood. The remaining question is time - "Can you change quickly enough?" Time will tell!.

J	Spiguel, CP				Spiguel, CP			The pharmaceutical industry in the 21(st) century: Surviving in the e-business environment	DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL			English	Article						pharmaceutical industry; e-business; Internet; information management; information technology		e- . . . the electronically enabled exchange and management of information to execute (. . .), is at the core of the most impactful societal change in history, the so called "Information Age." The pharmaceutical industry likes to think of itself as an innovator and rightly so in its life science disciplines (so we do not address these areas in this article). However the story is a little different in the core competency of information management (IM). In IM, the pharmaceutical industry has been conservative at best, if not recalcitrant in adapting to the changes that have already reshaped other industries such as finance, automobile, and aerospace, all of which share with pharmaceuticals some key IM characteristics. Hence the challenger How does the pharmaceutical industry survive the exhilarating pace of change that is bringing about the e-business imperatives of the Information Age marking the beginning of this new century? This pager introduces seven trends which are major drivers in determining the way that global markets are taking shape in the Information Age, and outlines some CEO strategic imperatives to address those drivers in various industries, including some of those mentioned above. It then attempts to suggest what could be pharmaceuticals CEOs' concerns in terms of their organizations' core competencies, to bring the industry into the new century, given its very historically conservative approach to information management. Finally, it concludes with an account of how the industry's highly regulated environment has reflected the coming of the Information Age, exemplified by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, and how the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America has positioned itself to partner in this transition. A model outlining the various phases to be undertaken is offered in closing.

J	Nanda, SK; Rivas, AL; Trochim, WM; Deshler, JD				Nanda, SK; Rivas, AL; Trochim, WM; Deshler, JD			Emphasis on validation in research: A meta-analysis	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article							INTERDISCIPLINARY	The emphasis of validity as a publication content was investigated in dissertations and journal articles. The time of first publication, longitudinal publication profile, ratio of articles to dissertations, and time lag between dissertations and articles emphasizing validity were compared within and among various fields. A three-decade gap separated the first field adopting validity-related contents in its dissertations from the latest fields that did so. The longitudinal data suggested three groups of fields (Agricultural Sciences, Applied Sciences and Social Sciences) which showed consistent differences among groups and consistent similarities within groups in their emphasis on validity-related content. Adoption of validity-related content in dissertations always preceded adoption of validity-related content in journal articles. On average, less than 4% of journal articles included validity-related content across fields. These findings support the hypothesis that validity has been introduced and disseminated within fields following patterns predicted by diffusion of innovations theory. It is argued that this pattern is inconsistent with an efficient and interdisciplinary utilization of available knowledge.

J	McKendrick, JH; Bowden, A				McKendrick, JH; Bowden, A			Equipped for the 21st Century?: audio-visual resource standards and product demands from geography departments in the UK	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						audio-visual resources; geography; education; geography departments; Information and Communication Technology (ICT)		Mass consumption of image-capture and image-(re)presentation technologies affords opportunities for improved teaching and learning in disciplines which utilise audio-visual data. This paper reports on a survey of geography departments in the UK in which baseline data were collected on the availability, use and opinion on the role of audio visual resources (AVRs) in teaching and learning. AVRs are regarded positively and, on the whole, hardware is readily available. However, the provision of software is uneven and there is considerable variation in the strategic commitment toward, and management of AVRs. Furthermore, larger departments and those whose research was rated more favourably in the last Research Assessment Exercise were found to be better resourced. There are signs of an emerging resource gap with regard to more specialised AVR equipment. The findings are used to propose audio-visual resource standards and to identify audio-visual products for which there is market demand. There is demand for audio-visual products that support fieldwork activity and it is recommended that further investment is required in digital camcorders and PC-OHP projection units.

J	Amintas, A; de Swarte, T				Amintas, A; de Swarte, T			The Internet age and the role of telecommunication operators: the case of France Telecom	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internet; Intranet; telecommunications operators; information system; strategic planning; customer processes; strategic adaptation; France; Telecom	CONTROL-SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATION; STRATEGY	In the Internet era, telecommunication operators clearly appear as strategic actors. This paper focuses on some fundamental issues for both management science and FRANCE TELECOM, particularly from the point of view of techno-organizational management. On one hand, our methodology relies on a long-term in-depth inductive case study which was begun in the early 1990s and, on the other, we adopt an analytical approach using a constructivist theoretical framework. The first part deals with the three-dimensional uncertainty which characterizes I;RANCE TELECOM in the context of its privatization and internationalization. The second pare shows why strategic planning can no longer be considered as the touchstone for adaptation to the external environment in the context of a coordinated strategy centred on customer processes. Our third part focuses on FRANCE TELECOM and its Information System (IS). What is the path dependency? What dilemmas are they faced with? How can FRANCE TELECOM evolve from a monopolistic network operator into a 'Net Company'?.

J	Enserink, B				Enserink, B			The entrenchment of controversial technology: a framework for monitoring and mapping strategic alignments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product innovation; strategy; monitoring; concurrent engineering; biotechnology; niche management		Chances for successful social entrenchment of innovative products can be increased by timely anticipation of problems of public acceptance and regulation. In this article a framework for analysis is presented as a first step for designing a management approach aimed at mitigation of such entrenchment problems. The message is that monitoring the selection environment, anticipating outside events and consequently being able to design hedging strategies improves the chances for successful marketing of controversial technological products. Active monitoring and mapping of the selection environment is considered a prerequisite for successfully creating the required strategic alignments and for successful niche management. The focus of the article is on the framework for monitoring and mapping these alignments which is illustrated by a case study on a genetically modified cut flower: the white chrysanthemum 'Moneymaker'.

J	Khandelwal, VK				Khandelwal, VK			What the Australian CEOs want from IT	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						critical success factors; MIS planning; MIS strategic planning	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT; ISSUES; TECHNOLOGY; EXECUTIVES; ALIGNMENT	This paper discusses the results of a Critical Success Factors (CSFs) study carried out to determine the key IT management needs of Australian CEOs. In the past several studies to determine the IT management needs have been carried out, but they have aimed mostly at the IT managers, not the CEOs. This study fills this gap, and by comparing the CSFs of the CEOs with those of the IT managers shows the areas of misalignment in the management of IT in Australian enterprises. It is concluded that to achieve ongoing alignment the CEOs and senior executives need to gain management level understanding of IT. But perhaps even more important is for IT managers to develop a business oriented perspective for the success of their enterprise.

J	Sabourin, V				Sabourin, V			Technological revolutions and the formation of strategic groups	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						configuration of strategic groups; technological revolutions; competitive strategy		Technological revolutions transform the dominant geographical market scope of industry and have a corresponding effect on the formation of strategic groups. Large-scale dedicated processes facilitate the formation of producers with a large national scope competing with centralized production capacities, while small-scale flexible processes lead to the formation of strategic groups with medium-size manufacturers competing with a narrower regional market scope and decentralized production capacities. The diffusion of radically new technological changes has a significant impact on the configuration of strategic groups in industry. Changing the nature of the barrier to mobility could facilitate or impedes the formation of strategic groups with specific positioning in the industry in terms of production scale, degree of vertical integration and product diversification, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Burn, JM; Szeto, C				Burn, JM; Szeto, C			Effective management of information technology - Closing the strategic divide!	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article								A study to determine whether there are any significant differences in perspectives of IT and business managers with regard to the factors which contribute to successful strategic alignment using Henderson and Venkatraman's strategic alignment model as the research framework has been reported.. A general survey was undertaken over a range of industries and results indicate that the two perspectives were largely equivalent except for their overall perception of the factors which contributed to success in strategic alignment. However, detailed case studies on three container terminal operators showed very different patterns of alignment which suggest that successful alignment of IT in industries which are highly IT dependent would require very different perspectives from both IT and business managers although these perspectives were still convergent within the organisation.

Pasture establishment and production, botanical composition changes, and plant and soil nutrient status were measured during a 2-year field trial. Highly significant pasture responses were obtained to increased fertiliser inputs. Heavy rates of fertiliser (1000 kg ha(-1) superphosphate) were required to raise Olsen P soil levels during the establishment phase whereas half that rate was found to be sufficient for the maintenance phase. An improved seed mixture, containing superior pasture cultivars, established more quickly and out-yielded the existing seed mixture by 58%. The two seed mixtures responded differently to sowing rates; the higher rate increased pasture yields of the improved pasture species but decreased the existing seed mix yields. Liming at 5 t ha(-1) significantly increased soil pH and clover content and reduced pasture manganese concentrations from possibly toxic levels. Nitrogen concentrations in pastures were below optimum throughout the trial and the strategic use of nitrogen fertiliser is recommended as a useful management option.

J	Li, F; Williams, H; Bogle, M				Li, F; Williams, H; Bogle, M			The 'Millennium Bug': its origin, potential impact and possible solutions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						computers; computer programming; year 2000 problem; Millennium Bug		Back in the 1960s and 1970s, computer programmers commonly identified each calendar year by its last two digits to save internal memory and disk space. However, this practice has made it impossible to identify the year 2000: computers reading only the last two digits of the year will either treat it as 1900 or shut down completely. The potential consequences can be catastrophic, given that a high proportion of the world's essential services are now controlled by computers. This is known as the 'Year 2000 (Y2K) problem', or the 'Millennium Bug'. Many of the bug's effects are already being felt today. Eradicating the bug involves not only many complex technical problems but also numerous practical constraints and operational difficulties. It requires the full involvement of top management and has to be addressed at the strategic level. The effort to solve this problem is now seriously behind schedule, and urgent action is needed to recover the lost ground. However, this is happening against a background of limited IT resources and an ever-increasing demand on IT staff in most organisations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Year 2000 problem and explore its potential scale and impact if not resolved in time. From an information management perspective, the complex program coding options and techniques and software tools needed to resolve the problem will also be reviewed, and some relevant management and organisational issues will be discussed. An important lesson from this is that some decisions may seem 'rational' under the circumstances of a particular period, but when the circumstances change, these decisions can have profound, unintentional, long-term consequences. Therefore, rational decision making must take into account not only the pros and cons of the decision for the current period, but also for the long term. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	McCue, J				McCue, J			Balancing the aims of geological conservation with coastal defence requirements	JOURNAL OF THE CHARTERED INSTITUTION OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coastal defence; geological conservation; shoreline management		There are many examples, both natinoally and internationally, where coastal-defence structures have impeded the natural erosion of cliffs and have thereby reduced the geological importance of a particular site. These problems have arisen where piecemeal defence schemes have been adopted as remedial measures to protect property or infrastructure from erosion. The recent onset of 'shoreline management plans' in the UK have attempted to redress this issue by reducing 'myopic' planning and, instead, seeking to promote more strategic thinking towards the impact of carrying out such work on the natural environment. This paper has been written to make coastal engineers aware of the importance of this topic within the 'shoreline management plan'.

J	Collins, PD; Ryan, LV; Matusik, SF				Collins, PD; Ryan, LV; Matusik, SF			Programmable automation and the locus of decision-making power	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; CENTRALIZATION; ORGANIZATION; COMPUTERS; ROLES	Computer-based technology is often credited with making decentralized decision-making possible, helping firms to respond rapidly to changing marker conditions. Research on this subject, however, shows contradictory effects: some studies support decentralization and others support centralization. This longitudinal study examines how one form of computer-based technology, programmable automation (PA), affects centralization. Unlike previous studies, it attempts to clear up some of the confusion surrounding technology's effect on centralization by distinguishing between strategic and operating decisions, and between decision-making authority and influence. As expected, PA flattened the hierarchy. It had no effect on strategic decision-making power, but surprisingly, did influence centralized line-operating authority and influence. This finding is particularly striking because firms with decentralized line-operating decision-making are more likely to adopt PA.

J	Roberts, JM; Liedka, RV				Roberts, JM; Liedka, RV			On summary measures of binarized dominance data	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							HIERARCHIES	Data on outcomes of dominance contests in groups of animals are often binarized (the original matrix of counts transformed into a matrix of ones and zeros indicating, for each pair, which animal won more contests). Various measures attempt to summarize the structure of the binarized data. We discuss uncertainty in such summary measures, and suggest ways to account for this uncertainty. We consider the summary measure both for an observed finite sample and for the unobserved underlying probability structure. We illustrate the general ideas with one particular summary measure, Appleby's K, and one data set, Appleby's red deer data. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, a careful review of the literature reveals that there is a need for more empirical studies using different theoretical perspectives. In this paper, we add theoretical insights from strategic management and analyse some of the determinants of executive compensation within a multidisciplinary framework. Using data from a relatively large sample of metal mining firms in the Canadian mining industry, we examine and discuss the effects of innovation and other firm strategies, as well as firm size and performance, on executive compensation.

J	Thor, CG; Jarrett, JR				Thor, CG; Jarrett, JR			Benchmarking and reengineering: alternatives or partners?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						benchmarking : reengineering; goal-setting; process mapping; strategic planning; productivity; customer satisfaction; quality		Both Benchmarking and Reengineering are widely practised around the world, but they are not often found together. They sound quite different to the untrained ear. Benchmarking sounds like a heavily intellectual exercise to generate more realistic goals, many good anecdotes, and an occasional good idea. Reengineering sounds like the management equivalent of slash-and-burn agriculture; major downsizings are made in operations under the banner of better customer services. Actually, the two techniques have much in common, and reengineering can greatly benefit from integration with benchmarking. The benefit comes mainly in two areas: (1) targeting the processes to reengineer is done better guided by systematic benchmarking studies than through casual or arbitrary selection by executives or consultants and (2) reengineering's technique of creating a new customer-oriented approach through use of mainly internal thinking would be greatly enhanced by systematic input of benchmarking partners' experience.

J	Wei, LP; Chen, Y; Wong, GG				Wei, LP; Chen, Y; Wong, GG			The evolution of China's optical fiber networks	BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								With China having the world's fastest growing economy in the last decade, its demand for telecommunications is growing exponentially. Optical fiber-based transport networks, serving as information superhighways, are essential for this sudden telecommunications expansion in China. This paper presents the historical evolution of China's optical fiber networks, their present status, and their future. We first review the journey that China has taken to build state-of-the-art fiber optic transport networks in the past 10 years. Major milestones are covered, such as China's strategic decisions regarding fiber selection, leapfrogging from plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) to synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) and the transition from SDH to wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). This paper analyzes the present transport network architecture and the major issues that China is facing in national network survivability and management strategy. We present a vision of China's optical transport networks going into the next century, which includes optical cross connect, optical access, and an Internet protocol (IP)-based optical network. We summarize with projections for China's optical fiber networks in the year 2000 and beyond.

J	Austin, Z; Boyd, C				Austin, Z; Boyd, C			Development of a sequenced strategic thinking assignment syllabus for a senior-level professional practice course	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION			English	Article								In order to develop and improve critical thinking and writing skills, a sequenced assignment syllabus was developed for a senior-level pharmacy practice course. Working in groups of eight, students completed a series of eight assignments, each becoming gradually more complex and progressively more demanding than the preceding one. Topics ranged from management of overdose situations to the design of continuing education units for pharmacists, and were all linked to contemporary practice issues. Within their groups, students selected a specific role: the primary writer, the secondary editor, or a contributing researcher. This incremental approach allowed students to extrapolate from previous assignments and incorporate lecture material and personal experience in creative, self-directed ways. Student feedback regarding this sequenced assignment syllabus was mixed. While students enjoyed the topics discussed and perceived the course to be relevant to practice, there were concerns expressed regarding the distribution of workload and the equity of group work forming the basis for an individual's final mark.

J	Kajanus, M; Kurttila, M; Pesonen, M				Kajanus, M; Kurttila, M; Pesonen, M			A simultaneous-equation model for predicting the production frontier of a forest holding	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE			English	Article							EFFICIENCY; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT	Strategic forest planning is the term used of the process involving determining the production possibilities of a forest area. Stand-level simulation is often used to produce a forest-holding-level production function, e.g., a linear programming model. However, stand-level data are not always available, and the planning process has to be carried out using forest-holding-level data. The system of simultaneous equations developed in this study can be used to predict the production frontier of a forest holding. The said simultaneous equations were constructed using simulated data of the points of the production frontiers of a total of 1367 nonindustrial, private forest holdings. Auxiliary models are used to produce data on the allowable cut over two management periods (short- and long-term horizons) to help the decision maker in adjusting the cutting objectives to lie within a feasible range. The simultaneous equations constructed compute the production frontier of a forest holding for given sets of exogenous variables. The endogenous variables involved include volume of standing timber after two management periods and annual regeneration area during the management periods. The predicted values of the forest-holding-level variables produced by the model can be interpreted in economic terms and used as input data when dealing with other issues considered in strategic analysis.

J	Tan, JK				Tan, JK			A model for achieving total quality-management information technology infrastructure within an integrated delivery system	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article							CARE	The strategic development and deployment of a health management information technology infrastructure is discussed from two perspectives for radiologists and for other medical technologists: the integrated delivery system (IDS) perspective and a total quality-management (TQM) perspective. On the one hand, an IDS perspective is important because of the need to prepare radiologists and other medical practitioners to thrive within rapidly changing health organizational models and evolving health service delivery partnership systems. On the other, a TOM perspective is important due to the need to realize an appropriate, efficient, and cost-effective health information infrastructure for developing seamless, integrated radiological and other medical imaging services. Apart from intelligently pursuing an aligned organizational business strategy with the organizational information system strategy, senior radiological managers and medical technologists of health organizations need to pay particular attention to key quality principles for effecting changes in organizational structures and processes to fit changes in information technological requirements, implementations, and innovations.

J	Barney, JP; Smith, TR				Barney, JP; Smith, TR			How local dairy communities can compete in the global marketplace	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						dairy development; virtual dairy community; economic development		For several years, the US government has been lowering its price supports on dairy products. The result has been a relatively good balance nationally between supply and demand. However, some seasonal shortages of local and regional supplies of milk are beginning to emerge. As deregulation continues, communities will be forced to take actions to ensure an adequate local supply of milk and to rationalize the systems of production, processing, and marketing. To address issues of competitiveness and capacity, it is useful to view the dairy community as a socio-economic unit composed of several systems and sub-systems that together compete with other communities for segments of the global market. These systems involve complex interrelationships and multiple disciplines. The community has both place and virtual characteristics. Some of the tools used to construct a world class dairy community from its component sub-systems include community economic development, total quality management, strategic planning, and strategic alliances. The global information systems used to transfer technology to dairy communities are often urban based and come with urban values and points of view that can be inappropriate in a rural culture. If local dairy communities are going to be world class competitors, then the members of the local, virtual, and global communities involved must have an appreciation of the cultural differences. Successful dairy communities of the future will use production and information technologies and management systems to compete in the global marketplace.

These include Standards Australia, which is formally linked to the International Organisation for Standards (ISO), the National Health Information Management Group, which deals with the government sector and several statutory organisations such as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the National Centre for Classification in Health. The different constituencies involved with each of these organisations, the scope of healthcare informatics and the rate of organisational and technological change in the industry present a significant challenge in ensuring that the standard setting process is highly visible, responsive and capable of demonstrating its value through effective implementation. Creating awareness and ensuring broad dissemination of healthcare informatics standards is a key component in meeting this challenge. This can operate at a number of levels from strategic to operational. At the strategic level, it requires active engagement and commitment of the key decision-makers, both political and professional. This may require directly lobbying and promoting the benefits of standardisation to those decision-makers but can be achieved even more effectively by creating industry awareness and demand through carefully targeted presentations on the impact of standards to broader health industry forums. At the tactical level, the standards development medium itself can be used to engage and gain commitment from government, professionals, vendors and the health industry by operating as an inclusive, open and effective process. At the operational level, there is the opportunity for much more efficient use of technology to create awareness of both these processes and their outcomes. The establishment in Australia of a web enabled National Health Information Knowledge base built around ISO standards is one example of the type of development which will assist in the acceleration of awareness of standards and standardisation, which is needed to cope with the increasing demand.

J	Broady-Preston, J; Hayward, T				Broady-Preston, J; Hayward, T			Turbulent change: strategy and information flow in UK retail banks	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								This paper is based on the results of the initial stage of a British Library Research and Innovation Centre funded project which investigates the role of information in the strategic management process in UK retail banking. The results presented are based on questionnaires and interviews conducted with senior managers responsible for strategic planning in the banks. It was found that information is viewed as a source of competitive advantage in this sector, but that the 'formalised' information gathering process was ad hoc. Typical information sources were viewed as of secondary importance, i.e. online databases, journals, CD-ROMs. Managers preferred to commission external information, such as PEST (political, environmental, social and technological) analyses, and to rely upon internally-generated information from colleagues. Performance analysis models, such as the balanced scorecard, helped companies to confront information problems, but blockages in the now of customer information were acknowledged.

J	Nakao, K				Nakao, K			Sociological work in Japan	ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						Japanese sociology; content analysis; theoretical trends; methodological trends		The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of contemporary sociology in Japan. The sociological discipline in Japan has made remarkable progress since World War II. The rapid economic growth during the 1960s, which was prompted by Western influence, had an effect on the direction of the discipline's development. After providing a brief overview of historical events, I consider scholarly publications during the last 30 years to illuminate substantive trends in sociological research. As might be predicted, the changing substantive interests of Japanese sociologists have been in many ways a response to societal changes and needs. I also examine the trends in theory, methods, and empirical research. A content analysis of articles published in the major Japanese sociological journals shows the growing emphasis on theoretical scholarship and the decreasing emphasis on empirical research in recent years. The conclusion presents some considerations concerning the future direction of Japanese sociology.

The authors examine the TQM experience at Xerox as a synergistic combination of three strategic thrusts: Customer focus, total involvement, and process improvement. Over the course of more than a decade, TQM at Xerox has evolved from a special emphasis to a fundamental business principle. Xerox's success with TQM allowed the company to regain market share without government assistance and positioned the company well for the 21st century. Other companies experimenting with TQM can learn valuable lessons from Xerox's experience.

J	Bond, AJ; Brooks, DJ				Bond, AJ; Brooks, DJ			A strategic framework to determine the best practicable environmental option (BPEO) for proposed transport schemes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BPEO; strategic environmental appraisal; transport; sustainable development; methodology		Against a background of greater commitment towards sustainable development at a national, European and world-wide level, and a recognized need for more guidance in strategic appraisal methodologies, a framework has been developed for the strategic appraisal of transport plans in the United Kingdom. This framework has been designed to be quick and easy to use. The importance of social as well as environmental variables has been stressed and these are an implicit part of the framework, which seeks to identify the best practicable environmental option (BPEO). As such, it is a methodology for identifying the best alternative from a range of transport options and locations, prior to the application of project-level environmental impact assessment (EIA). Research techniques and indicators are recommended for the users of the framework. Care has been taken in the development of the framework to keep the analysis transparent. It seeks to present a full analysis in a clear and concise way; as a result, the final choice of alternative is clear to all participants and the decision is left entirely to the decision-makers. It is considered that the framework could provide a suitable starting point for appraisals of transport schemes throughout the U.K. and, when it is considered that social impact assessment principles developed in the United States have been modified for use in this framework, the framework should have potential applications in other countries with further modification. Wherever it is applied, the framework will get better as people use it and develop it. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

J	Bukszar, E				Bukszar, E			The impact of time lags in competitor response on competition	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION			English	Article							COOPERATION	Strategic management theory suggests that when time lags occur between one firm's action and another firm's reaction, the firm initiating a strategic move may gain a significant advantage over its rival. As a result, competitive activity is stimulated as rival firms apply tactics that have the potential of creating ag effects. Implicit in this conception of lag effects is the belief that first-mover advantages may enable the initiating firm to establish a competitive advantage by creating long-lived advantages, in branding or distribution, for example. However, time lags may matter in and of themselves, that is, absent first-mover advantages, time lags may stimulate competition. Time lags increase the cognitive complexity of the task of tracking and sorting out competitive actions/signals, which inhibits tacit collusion. The results of two experiments using business executives as subjects support the notion that even absent first-mover advantages, time lags stimulate competition. They also suggest that when a time-lagged variable (for example, a nonprice variable) is studied in conjunction with a nonlagged variable (price), competition is stimulated on both variables.

As a consequence of this result, the existence of equilibria in a class of infinite signaling games is established. Since equilibria satisfying the Never-a-Weak-Best-Response test also satisfy various other refinements, e.g., the Intuitive Criterion and the Universal Divinity test, the existence results in this essay hold for those refinements as well.

J	Mitchell, JA				Mitchell, JA			Basic principles of information technology organization in health care institutions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IAIMS Consortium Symposium	SEP   27, 1996	VANDERBILT UNIV, NASHVILLE, TN		VANDERBILT UNIV			This paper focuses on the basic principles of information technology (IT) organization within health sciences centers. The paper considers the placement of the leader of the IT effort within the health sciences administrative structure and the organization of the IT unit. A case study of the University of Missouri-Columbia Health Sciences Center demonstrates how a role-based organizational model for IT support can be effective for determining the boundary between centralized and decentralized organizations. The conclusions are that the IT leader needs to be positioned with other institutional leaders who are making strategic decisions, and that the internal IT structure needs to be a role-based hybrid of centralized and decentralized units. The IT leader needs to understand the mission of the organization and actively use change-management techniques.

Its ultimate objective was to provide small-medium enterprises (SMEs) with advanced software modules supporting long-term (strategic) planning, medium-term (materials and resources) planning, short-term (shop-floor) planning, and the underlying models of product and process. Interfaces between the RUMS modules and popular commercial MRP packages have been studied, to interact with purchasing and inventory management modules. To suit the typical SME manufacturing organisation, production planning software must take into account requirements and constraints that are generally not found in larger enterprises. Moreover, SMEs have difficulties in adopting the expensive and burdensome set of solutions that are presently needed to cover all the planning functions. A strong and continuous interaction with real cases at different SMEs has been carried out, both for validating the model and for measuring its impact on the enterprise organisation.

J	Kane, JS; Freeman, KA				Kane, JS; Freeman, KA			A theory of equitable performance standards	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Performance standards are reconceptualized as the interface between measurement and evaluation. A job's performance standards are theorized to be equitable to the extent that they require levels of effectiveness equal to those collectively viewed as justified by the standing of the job's pay rate relative to the labor market median. Methodology for creating equitable performance standards is presented, and the implications of implementing such performance standards are discussed in reference to compensation strategy and practice and to the potential financial benefits to organizations.

J	Lennon, SJ				Lennon, SJ			The management of technology in a South African power utility	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technology; management; electric; utility; research; decision-making; organization; characteristics		In a changing South Africa there is increasing competition for scarce resources for social reconstruction, economic development and environmental benefaction. It is therefore critical that resources are optimally allocated through good management practices. Technology management is seen to play a major role in this regard. This is particularly so for a capital and technology intensive industry such as a power utility. This paper describes the technology management influences in a large power utility and discusses how these may be addressed via the application of the Management of Technology (MOT). The relevant decision making factors and organization characteristics for effective MOT are detailed. It is concluded that MOT should be an integral part of business management in playing a major role in defining the strategic direction and business efficacy of any technology dependent organization.

Basically, it consists of a series of informative maps, which are constructed during interactive mass meetings by the participants. In this way essential information is shared throughout the organization and even beyond. However, when going through the various phases, management and workers are cooperating according to rules that are different from those they are used to in the formal hierarchical setting: the first steps are set to change to managerial culture. Part II (p. 102) explains how the leading manager can consolidate these changes in culture.

Characterizing optimality in the prisoners' dilemma	JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION			English	Article								Social scientists from a variety of disciplines have long been captivated by the simplicity and elegance of the two-person, binary choice prisoners' dilemma (2 x 2 PD). Over the years, the domain of the research has been extended and applied to events that are neither two person nor binary. We use a defining characteristic of the 2 x 2 PD to identify situations under which full levels of contribution are suboptimal. We propose, on the basis of that characteristic, an extended definition and categorization of prisoners' dilemmas to n-person and nonbinary situations. The new distinction is shown to point to differing normative and strategic imperatives for the different categories of games.

J	Dou, JM				Dou, JM			French small business information through the internet: A comparison with US organizations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Small business is taking a more and more impressive place in French employment. The south of France. and particularly the region of Marseille. has been hit hard by the economic crisis: the heavy industry factories have closed one after another and the unemployment rate has increased to 25 per cent of the active population. The emergence of dynamic small or medium-sized enterprises and industries (SME/SMrs) seems to be one of the solutions to creating business in this geographic area. The concurrence between the different public local small business information providers has created a complex situation in which strategic information is completely hidden. Of course the dissemination of small business information is not simple and depends on the local characteristics. The investments in the information superhighway are one of the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region's characteristics. This article shows how the United States' administration has used the Internet to diffuse various types of small business information. This is followed by an explanation of the local problems of French small business resources. Finally, the first steps of a small firms help initiative is presented and some future developments are proposed in order to create a real small business help centre in Marseille.

This article briefly describes the outcomes produced and under development by these collaborations and delineates and discusses some characteristics we now hypothesize will predict successful academic/practice collaboration. These collaborative projects with public health organizations in Alabama, Indiana, and New Mexico have produced outcomes that influenced the organization of the agencies and the allocation of resources within the agencies. The collaborations also have contributed to the body of literature concerning management processes in public health agencies and influenced the teaching of strategic management to students of health services. Our experiences and interactions led to the identification of 10 characteristics we believe predict successful academic and practice collaborations, discussed in three groups as (1) characteristics of successful academic collaborators, (2) characteristics of successful collaborating public health organizations, and (3) characteristics of successful collaborative projects.

J	Kanter, SL				Kanter, SL			Information management of a medical school educational program: A state-of-the-art application	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							COMPUTER DATABASES; CURRICULUM	Quality in the design and management of a medical school education program depends on the ability to access and analyze relevant information in a timely fashion. The components of a medical-education information system should support learning and instruction as well as the administrative and research responsibilities of the program. A system capable of meeting these needs requires core, operational, and strategic components. This article discusses a conceptual schema of the medical school environment and reports the results of 3 1/2 years' experience developing core, operational, and strategic components at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The value of a simple conceptual schema as a design and development instrument was confirmed. Limitations of the system are discussed along with potential solutions.

J	Blum, TC; Milne, SH; Spell, CS				Blum, TC; Milne, SH; Spell, CS			Workplace characteristics and health care cost containment practices	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS; LABOR-MARKETS; INSURANCE; MODEL; OPPORTUNITY; LESSONS; STATES; CHOICE; HMOS	Working from an institutional perspective, this study tested hypotheses about the relationships between workplace characteristics and health care cost containment practices. The analyses show that urban location of the workplace, number of employees, and education level of the workforce are related to three different cost containment strategies: the management of utilization with traditional indemnity insurance plans; offering of alternative health insurance plans (HMOs); and employee development relative to health care consumption. Workplaces with greater proportions of black or female employees were less likely and those with older workers were more likely to engage in employee development practices. The race, gender, and age variables were not significantly related to the other strategies. Unionization was not significantly related to any of the three strategies in the multivariate model. These findings are proposed to have implications for human resource management, as well as for health care policy and reform efforts.

The approach utilises a computer-based tool to support a methodology which guides companies through the strategic regeneration process. The methodology recognises the importance of involving company staff fully in the improvement process, and, in this way, improves ownership and commitment to the solutions generated. The methodology described has been used successfully by a number of small and medium-sized firms to achieve radical improvements in their performance. This has been achieved by applying acknowledged best practices, improving the performance of the company whilst at the same time developing and training the management team in new manufacturing tools, techniques and technologies.

J	Johannsen, CG				Johannsen, CG			Strategic issues in quality management .1. Theoretical considerations	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								Strategic management has been an important topic in library and information services (LIS) since the 1980s. In the 1990s, quality management has played a similar role. This paper examines the relationship between these two management concepts in a LIS sector setting. After the presentation of different conceptual frameworks, a new strategic quality management (SQM) framework - inspired by the Japanese hoshin kanri or policy deployment approach - is developed, emphasising that strategic management and total quality management (TQM) should be treated as one integrated management process. Then TQM-based and strategic management methodologies are compared in order to identify common traits and differences. Finally, it is discussed how the theoretical considerations made may influence the validity of practical managerial advice found in the library management literature. Based on the conceptual framework of this article, empirical data from the 1995 Nordic SQM survey of business information services (corporate information centres, special libraries and academic libraries) are presented in the next issue of the Journal of Information Science.

The discussion draws on the experiences of four smaller component suppliers who are part of a research project into the impact of changes in supply chain relationships on the operation of some small and medium sized manufacturing firms in the West Midlands. The article explains why such component suppliers in the automotive supply chain are being forced to make strategic decisions regarding their future role. A typology is introduced which distinguishes innovation in work organization with that based upon technological change and strategies based on market concentration or market diversification. The four case studies illustrate why component suppliers are having to make these types of strategic choices and their likely impact upon future competitiveness.

Evidence and results from the manufacturing sector in Taiwan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						factory automation; productivity; production function; return on investment; return on productivity		Study findings conducted at the macro level using aggregate industry data or at the micro level using firm level data, have not shown convincing evidence that investment in automation will improve productivity and provide high enough return on investment. Problems of mismeasurements, mismanagement, time lags, and redistribution of profit may account for part of the reasons for the so-called 'productivity paradox'. Complexity, interactions, mixtures of strategic and operational issues makes it extremely difficult to isolate the effect of automation investment even at the firm or enterprise level. This empirical study is based on a survey conducted by the Statistics Division, Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taiwan on the status of automation in the manufacturing sector at the factory level that allows a better resolution of productivity. Two variations of the Cobb-Douglas are specified to model the production function of the 18 industries in the manufacturing sector. The results show that automation investment provides high enough return on investment (ROI) and return on productivity (ROP). Cross industry analysis indicates that for those industries with higher output capital ratios, the ROI and ROP will also be higher. Investment in automation may provide synergistic effect, if it will improve the output-capital ratio of the automation capital that in turn will lead to increasing ROI and ROP for both the automation and non-automation capital.

J	Ulhoi, JP				Ulhoi, JP			Towards a theoretical and methodological corporate technology management framework. The strategic perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technology management theory; technology management tools	INNOVATION	This article analyses and discusses the development and achievements of the corporate technology management (TM) field. Based on an extensive survey, it is found that Technology Management in its present form, has existed since the early 1980s, but its roots can be traced back to the early 1970s under such labels as Strategic Management, Engineering Management, Innovation Management, and R&D Management. It is argued that the field of TM has matured to such a degree as to entitle it to be classified as an independent subfield of corporate management.

J	Wang, Q				Wang, Q			The exploitation of a multidisciplinary approach in studying the R&D/marketing interface with some empirical evidence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Forum on Technology Management	JUN 07-08, 1995	HELSINKI, FINLAND			multidisciplinary research approach; motivation for cross-functional interaction; technology-based product development; R&D management; marketing of high technology	PROJECTS	In this article the author argues that previous literature addressing the R&D/marketing interface is revealing only in particular aspects of the interface. She proposes that a more complete understanding of its complexity, in terms of: (1) the scope of the interface and (2) the ways in which the interface may be facilitated or impeded, requires a multidisciplinary approach. Consequently a conceptual framework is developed, where two key multidisciplinary issues regarding the R&D/marketing interface are identified. They include interface motivation and expectation difference. The results of 48 in-depth interviews with managers in four multinational pharmaceutical firms show that there exist two types of interface motivation, i.e. motivation for long-term strategic relationship and motivation for short-term operational transaction. The former has led to a more effective interface due to shared expectations, whereas the latter has a greater potential for conflict due to big expectation difference.

Strategic decision making can be compared with the journey of the mythical Greek Argonauts who sailed in the Argo in search of the golden fleece. Like the Argonauts, strategic decision makers explore the terra incognita of existential problems. This paper describes the design parameters of ARgo, a conceptual information system for supporting strategic decision making in groups. ARgo draws on theories of strategic information resources management (SIRM). GDSS, garbage can decision making models (G.Can). and small group (SG) theory.

This paper presents a case study of a recent hostile takeover that disproves the conventional wisdom and shows that careful implementation processes enable the company, not only to overcome post-merger integration barriers due to culture clash, but also to maximize strategic benefits from those cultural differences. It shows that integration can be achieved through a process in which only some specific cultural dimensions are integrated while others are preserved.

Systems analysts' primary concern is to secure information requirements that are stable over the duration of the project. The reality of the profession has shown that obtaining information requirements which reflect users' true information requirements and which remain stable over time is not always an easy matter. In this study, we attempted to validate an information requirements determination (IRD) theoretical model. Developed by Naumann and Davis (1978), this model defines the best IRD strategy as a function of the uncertainty present in the project. Three hypotheses were derived from the model and tested using data collected on 67 IS projects. Established measures were used to measure the variables of the model. Statistical tests led to the rejection of the hypotheses relating project size, task structure, and the congruence variable to user satisfaction. The results obtained show that human factors are the most important in an information system development project.

Mathematics methodology is required for the analysis of associated words. One example shows technology themes concerning food products that were obtained in this way. A second example suggests the same methodology for strategic technologies involved in waste-water purification. The article covers one means of disclosing the strategic features of a technology through simple analysis (which is neither too random nor too difficult to set up) of complementary patents.

To this end, some networks of innovation counsellors were established in order to promote industrial cooperation. As the programs analysed were partly financed by public institutions, evaluation surveys took place. The main result of the evaluations pinpoints the lack of impact of these programs on industrial companies and the appearance of interesting spin-offs. Many reasons are mentioned to explain this lack of success, in particular the lack of information on behaviour and needs of industry as far as technology transfer is concerned, which could have been avoided by conducting an 'ex ante strategic' evaluation.

J	IACOBUCCI, D; HOPKINS, N				IACOBUCCI, D; HOPKINS, N			DETECTION OF EXPERIMENTAL EFFECTS IN SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							SOCIOMETRIC RELATIONS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; CENTRALITY; ROLES; DISTRIBUTIONS; BLOCKMODELS; CONFORMITY	Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques exist for the analysis of social networks, but to date the inferential methods have been limited to the comparison of one network to its hypothesized population parameters (analogous to a one-sample t-test), or the comparison of multiple relational structures measured on the same group of actors (analogous to a correlation coefficient). In this paper, we explore techniques for comparing network structures when each network comprised an entirely different set of actors (analogous to a two-sample t-test or a between-subjects analysis of variance). Such methods for between-group comparisons are critical in theory testing, where a researcher varies an experimental factor for the purposes of studying its impact on some dependent variable (e.g. the resulting network structure). This ability to test the significance of manipulated factors (like ANOVA) would provide another important means by which social network analyses would be an aid to researchers. We propose several such statistical methods for comparing network interactions. There are many areas of substantive research in which groups are examined under different operating conditions, and it seems reasonable to study these inter-related actors as players in a network, and test the significance of the factors that had been experimentally manipulated, thereby capitalizing on the strengths of both network analyses and the logic of analysis of variance and experimental design.

This paper describes how Ricardo is meeting this challenge through the integrated development and application of computer aided engineering (CAE) methods. The weaknesses of traditional approaches to the management of CAE innovation are discussed and the need for a more strategic approach is identified. Examples are given of CAE research, development and applications carried out by Ricardo. Conclusions are presented outlining the key elements of an effective CAE strategy.

J	CAULFIELD, J				CAULFIELD, J			RESPONSES TO GROWTH IN THE SUN-BELT STATE - PLANNING AND COORDINATING POLICY INITIATIVES IN QUEENSLAND	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article								Queensland's population growth phenomenon has demanded responses from the state government for greater intervention in planning land use and resources utilisation. Planning, especially regional planning, represents an area of traditional policy neglect in Queensland, explained in part by the division of powers such that local authorities, rather than the state, have the major responsibility for land-use development and physical services. Local government jurisdiction in planning poses a challenge for the state government in how best to strategically manage regional growth, while at the same time respecting local authority autonomy in planning decision-making. Over the last three years, the Goss government has undertaken both administrative reforms and a comprehensive and innovative planning exercise to shape urban development in south-east Queensland, the area of greatest population density and growth. In particular, it has adopted a model of corporate government as a framework for the planning process. The corporate model promotes a ''whole of government'' approach to strategic planning, emphasising efficient and effective outcomes for clients. The model's client orientation has elevated and formalised the role of community input in decision-making, and provided a process for negotiation between the players in planning policy development. In an intergovernmental environment, consultation with local authorities is important but the managerialist aspects of corporate government are likely to encourage central control of the planning policy agenda. Both are necessary for improved urban outcomes, yet it remains to be seen how these potentially conflicting processes can be reconciled in practice.

A process of evolutionary change, initiated during the 1980s, may not suffice because the current thinking on management theory - upon which information management is defined - is changing significantly. The salient points of this shift in the paradigm of strategic management are outlined and an indication is given of how this will impact the management of information technology. An outline of an adapted model is attempted, using a simple four-component framework: The most influence will be felt in the area of information technology planning. Systems acquisition will need to develop new, proprietary methods. The character of the day-to-day management is also significantly affected, mainly by an increased use of external agents in what will probably be new and innovative forms of alliance. The idea of an information technology keiretsu is used as an example of how such alliances could be structured.

J	EILON, S				EILON, S			A METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYSIS OF CORPORATE PERFORMANCE	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						CORPORATE PLANNING; STRATEGY; MODELING; DIAGNOSTIC MODELS		Analysis of corporate performance is an essential exercise for strategic management of an industrial enterprise. The analysis consists of two areas: the first is that of diagnosis, which aims at providing an understanding of how the enterprise works and an explanation of changes that have taken place in its past performance; the second is that of planning, with the purpose of determining future courses of action and ascertaining their implications in terms of improved performance. The methodology described in this paper uses incremental calculus and, instead of being solely concerned with absolute measures, it largely focuses on relative changes in performance. This approach stems from two reasons: first, it is relative changes (usually expressed in percentage terms) that managers are mainly preoccupied with, and secondly the methodology involves the use of non-dimensionless variables and relationships, which allow general results to be derived. A further feature of corporate performance is that it is rarely measured by a single criterion but is evaluated by a series of ratios, and it is therefore important to determine how changing operating conditions, or changes in the external environment, affect the criteria chosen for scrutiny, and how these criteria affect each other.

J	SCHREUDER, H				SCHREUDER, H			TIMELY MANAGEMENT CHANGES AS AN ELEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article								This article uses the results of empirical research into the factors determining the differential success of firms in dealing with severe conditions at the industry level. A matched pairs comparison of successful and unsuccessful firms under these conditions reveals very different patterns of strategic measures taken. One of the significant differences is that the successful firms make changes in the management area very early, while the unsuccessful firms make them very late. The results are used for a theoretical reflection focusing on the following two questions: (1) Are organizations basically inert of adaptive? and (2) What is management's role in organizational change? The central theme of the discussion is that in the literature too little attention is paid to timely management changes as an element of organizational change strategies.

J	LARSSON, T				LARSSON, T			DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR ROBUST ENERGY-SYSTEMS .2. APPLICATION TO CO2 RISK MANAGEMENT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						ENERGY PLANNING; STRATEGIC PLANNING; CARBON DIOXIDE; ROBUSTNESS; SWEDEN; MARKAL		One of the most important determinants for the design of the future energy system is whether or not constraints on CO2 emissions will be imposed. Here, this issue is treated as a decision under uncertainty. Three strategies have been considered: immediate action to adapt to a future emission constraint (Commitment), business as usual (No Hedging), and hedging(Hedging). In the case of hedging, preparations are made outside the energy system, but the energy system itself is allowed to develop according to baseline assumptions until the uncertainity has been resolved. The IEA-MARKAL model has been used to show how efficient and robust the three strategies arc under different developments. The development of the Swedish energy system has been studied for two rates of economic growth in combination with three nuclear policies and two CO2 policies. The value of preparations for meeting a possible restriction on CO2 emissions, i.e., following either the Commitment or the Hedging strategy, is considerably higher when the energy demand increases rapidly. In the low growth case, the choice of strategy is largely dependent upon the decision maker's estimate of the likelihood of an emission cap. In the high growth case, this likelihood must be considered to be very small in order to choose the No Hedging strategy, even with reinvestments in nuclear capacity beyond 2010.

To participate in decisions on the use of technology in their institutions, pharmacists must practice strategic management. This process includes environmental scanning, analysis of clinical and pharmacoeconomic data, and development of clinical management approaches. It is ideal for analyzing biologic response modifiers such as filgrastim and sargramostim. Emphasis must be placed on maximizing the fit among the products, the institution, and the health care environment. Pharmacists will find plentiful opportunities for clinical management with biotechnology agents. Practitioners who specialize in determining the total cost of care by using pharmacoeconomic methods are needed, as are practitioners trained to monitor the complicated biotechnology agents. Also, the institution needs to forecast accurately the impact of emerging biotechnology agents. If pharmacists can develop and control clinical, pharmacoeconomic, and reimbursement information databases for biotechnology agents, the pharmacy profession will be in a strong position to meet the challenges of biotechnology and realize the inherent opportunities.

J	NUTT, PC				NUTT, PC			DIAGNOSTICS FOR STRATEGIC DECISIONS	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						DECISION MAKING PROCESS; STRATEGY	DETERMINANTS; ISSUES	Decisions were analyzed to identify how diagnostics and types of direction influence the success of decision making. Diagnostics compare performance to norms, creating quantitative or qualitative performance gaps, or make impressionistic observations. Directions were set as an idea, problem, target or reframing. Decision adoption rates, decision value, and timeliness were used to determine the success of these diagnostics and direction setting types. Reframing was found to be the most successful type of direction but was seldom used by decision makers. Targets were also quite successful. Directions based on problems and ideas were the least successful but these tactics were used far more often than targets or reframing. The diagnostics applied by decision makers also influenced decision success, with quantitative performance gaps producing the best results. Decision makers using an idea direction prefer qualitative diagnostics, although quantitative diagnostics were more successful. Problem directions were somewhat more successful with qualitative diagnostics, but were very inefficient. Target directions were successful only with quantitative diagnostics. Unlike the other types of directions, reframing was very successful when used with each diagnostic.

J	FULLER, D; ROFFEY, B				FULLER, D; ROFFEY, B			IMPROVING PUBLIC-SECTOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article								This paper examines current public sector accountability arrangements within Australia and identifies factors which have inhibited progress towards public sector accountability. It is argued that there are a number of key areas which serve as necessary prerequisites to accountability arrangements within the public sector. These include an improved strategic approach to budgetary arrangements, infrastructure support for these arrangements in the form of greatly improved management information systems, and systematic advances in relevant performance measurement. Required improvements in these areas arc principally the responsibility of chief executive officers (CEOs) and supporting executive management levels. Without such essential underpinning it is further argued that moves toward management and administrative devolution are unlikely to succeed in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector organisations.

The objective for the analysis of such a problem has been to minimize the net present worth of the capital costs as well as the streams of operating and transportation costs. MLPSTP is a mixed integer programming problem involving both binary and continuous variables. The continuous variables relate to the transportation of commodities from site to market. The binary variables problem relates to the size, location and time-phasing of the projects. In this paper, an attempt has been made to analyse the problem by using hierarchical decomposition procedures. The approach has been to construct a two-level hierarchy; the first level identifying the distinct geographical areas as independent subproblems, and the second level being the coordination level which aims at synthesizing the solutions of the area subproblems.

Central-local relations are still cooptive as well as cooperative, continuing to provide safety nets in the event of local mistakes. Austerity and recurring financial crises have necessitated new management orientations and organizational adaptation among local governments. The mode of learning (and unlearning) is highly contingent:in some circumstances a quick process based on opportunism, in others having been fuelled by entrepreneurial forces. The development of strategic organizational capabilities still encounters great difficulties.

What types of organizations are most involved in the use of formal strategic planning systems? How is the planning process conducted? How have organizations used the planning process to improve operations? These were the central issues of a strategic planning survey recently conducted among the largest organizations in the water industry to determine how strategic planning has evolved to become an integral part of the management process. This evolution is measured by how long the organization has been planning, how many people are involved in the planning process, how well the strategic plan is communicated to the rest of the organization, and how well strategic planning is finked to other management systems such as budgeting and compensation.

Nevertheless, a modest population-wide fall in the concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins leads to substantial numbers of preventible heart attacks and deaths. Other strategic considerations are to lower non-lipid cardiovascular risks (hypertension, clotting tendency) and to prevent other diet-related disease (such as cancer) through interventions which lower plasma lipids. The major nutritional changes which achieve this are optimising energy balance, reducing total fats and saturated fatty acids and increasing plant foods which are rich sources of unsaturated fatty acids, fibre and antioxidants. Each of these contributes to optimising the low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration. Antioxidants (vitamins C and E mainly) may inhibit LDL oxidation. The strategy for lowering plasma triglyceride, especially in the context of atherogenic lipoprotein phenotypes, is mainly through energy balance, reduced saturated fat and alcohol. Correcting overweight especially in those with abdominal obesity, may normalise raised plasma triglyceride, low high density lipoprotein (HDL), abnormal LDL and even glucose intolerance and hypertension, which may be associated. The scientific basis for the lipid optimising effects of the different nutrients will be discussed.

An historical, institutional and political introduction clarifies the problem context and frames the policy conclusions the study offers. The key strategic and competitive factors in Canadian brewing are listed and evaluated. A mathematical programming model of the brewing industry is described which uses constraints to create four cases which represent alternative regulatory regimes. The relaxation of interprovincial sales barrier constraints characterizes the free market cases. Optimal decisions for a dominant competitor are computed for each case. Results suggest that significant returns to regulatory reform can be expected. These results have distinct policy implications, since current national costs of regulatory compliance with the interprovincial sales restrictions alone is estimated to be in excess of 100 million dollars per year. When combined with the costs of other regulatory controls, the overall regulatory compliance costs are in excess of 150 million dollars per year for this industry.

J	ROSEGGER, G				ROSEGGER, G			COOPERATIVE STRATEGIES IN IRON AND STEEL - MOTIVES AND RESULTS	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						STEEL INDUSTRY; JOINT VENTURES; TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER; BUSINESS STRATEGY		During the past quarter-century, the American iron and steel industry has undergone far-reaching structural changes. Until the mid-1980s the established, integrated producers responded to these changes with essentially defensive measures. Then they began to embark on a radically new strategy-the establishment of joint ventures with foreign, especially Japanese, competitors. So far, these ventures have been concentrated in the production of flat-rolled, galvanized steels, for which the automotive industry is the main customer. American firms were motivated mainly by the belated recognition of a technology gap and by the prospect of infusions of capital from their partners. The Japanese producers saw in strategic partnering a hedge against protectionism and an opportunity to supply the growing coated-products market, which included increasing numbers of Japanese "transplant" automobile manufacturers. While it is too early to assess the implications of these moves in terms of the steel industry's potential globalization, it seems clear that the joint ventures have upgraded domestic firms' technological and managerial capabilities, as well as providing customer industries with improved products. For policy-makers, they have raised questions about the meaning of "the national interest" as a justification for protecting an industry like iron and steel.

THE PLANNING PROCESS	JOURNAL OF NURSING ADMINISTRATION			English	Article							STRATEGIC CHANGE; ENVIRONMENT	Planning is identified as a key activity of hospital management. Planning processes are examined for 75 hospitals in the national Strengthening Hospital Nursing Program (SHNP). The nature of the planning process is presented with a focus on professional participation in planning, differences between single and networked hospitals, and the development of planning teams. The importance of certain elements for planning teams is considered. Part 2 (June 1992 issue) will examine the planning characteristics between Phase 2 selected and nonselected hospitals. Part 3 will explore the differences among professional disciplines in planning.

J	BOYD, JP				BOYD, JP			RELATIONAL HOMOMORPHISMS	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							SEMIGROUPS	A problem with relational systems as social science models is that there seems to be no universally agreed upon definition for a structure-preserving map, or "homomorphism". The variants used in social networks are shown to be special cases of existing concepts in mathematics and logic. It is argued that a promising way to unify and generalize homomorphisms is to follow a definition from universal algebra. This definition reduces to the usual homomorphisms of algebraic systems, such as groups and lattices.			BOYD, JP (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF IRVINE,SCH SOCIAL SCI,IRVINE,CA 92717, USA.

J	CULNAN, MJ				CULNAN, MJ			PROCESSING UNSTRUCTURED ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSACTIONS - MAIL HANDLING IN THE UNITED-STATES-SENATE	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION PROCESSING; TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEMS; CUSTOMER SERVICE; UNITED-STATES-SENATE	SYSTEMS; BEHAVIOR	The conventional view of transaction processing, which has focused primarily on highly structured transactions, oversimplifies the information processing environment confronting most organizations. This exploratory field study investigates how U.S. Senate offices answer constituent mail on legislative issues. The study develops a model which views transaction processing systems (TPS) as an organizational information system. Using this model, the paper next develops the position that when TPS are viewed this way, the design and functioning of all TPS may be analyzed using the answers to three questions: (1) what transactions will be accepted by the organization for processing, (2) what rules will be used for processing transactions, and (3) how will feedback about these transactions be routed upward? Unlike most structured transactions, mail transactions are designed by the correspondent rather than the organization. As a result, the task of answering mail is characterized by low analyzability and high variety not found in most other routine transaction processing applications. Implications for the design of systems to support the processing of unstructured transactions in other contexts are discussed.

J	STREIB, G				STREIB, G			STRATEGIC CAPACITY IN COUNCIL-MANAGER MUNICIPALITIES - EXPLORING LIMITS AND HORIZONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article								Over the past ten years interest in strategic decision making has grown exponentially. To a great extent, the writers who have dealt with this topic have taken a strong prescriptive tone, suggesting that the technique is synonymous with sound management practices. This study accepts the desirability of strategic decision making but questions the feasibility. Findings are presented from an exploratory survey of city managers and mayors suggesting that barriers currently exist to effective use of strategic decision making. In particular, there is a need to gain greater control over the external political environment. The author suggests a stronger client focus as a possible remedy for this problem.

First, it sets forth a theoretical framework which reasons that: 1) strategic planning is a fundamental activity engaged in by business entities; 2) strategic planning has a direct impact on the processes which companies employ for effecting management and task control, as well as shaping the overall risks which inhere in the strategies followed; and 3) independent auditors should be knowledgeable about the strategic planning process in order to fully understand a client's business and conduct effective audits. Second, it empirically tests auditor awareness of the dimensions which differentiate strategic planning from management and task control. Third, it examines the extent to which such awareness varies with individual differences, specifically the cognitive style and experience of the independent auditor. Based on both in-depth interviews with independent audit-firm partners, and a case study experiment that entailed eliciting the perceptions of 120 practitioners, it is concluded that independent auditors are generally sensitive to strategic planning with some notable exceptions that are conditioned by the individual differences examined.

J	KALUZNY, AD				KALUZNY, AD			COMMUNITY CANCER PROGRAMS AS STRATEGIC ALLIANCES - CHALLENGES AND GUIDELINES FOR ACTION	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Article							CARE	This paper assesses the utility of strategic alliances as a way of expanding and improving the quality of cancer care provided in communities with limited access to major treatment centres. Alliances provide an organizational model for future community-based cancer programs by accommodating a growing need for interdependence among organizations and providers while permitting substantial independence and autonomy. Five managerial challenges to ensuring effective and efficient delivery of cancer services are identified: to secure mutually reinforcing exchanges between and within all levels of cancer care, to develop protocols and programs relevant to the unique characteristics of patients and providers, to provide treatment and cancer control services, to involve interdisciplinary teams of providers at all levels of care and to achieve quality assurance, improvement and evaluation. In addition, the paper includes a set of guidelines to facilitate the implementation of community cancer programs as strategic alliances: reaffirm the role of community oncologists, primary care physicians and nurses as partners in the program; define the structure and culture necessary for commitment rather than simply compliance; redefine the role of management; establish data-monitoring systems; modify reward systems; and set realistic time frames and expectations.

J	VEHSE, RC; NYGREN, SF; BUTHERUS, AD				VEHSE, RC; NYGREN, SF; BUTHERUS, AD			MANAGING AN RES AND DEV CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT	AT&T TECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article								Formal project-management procedures, required for U.S. Government contract execution, provide a basis for management of R&D-intensive projects within AT&T. A $19.7-million R&D contract, awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), provided an opportunity for the gallium arsenide (GaAs), integrated-circuit (IC) project team to develop basic project-management procedures that extend well beyond the realm of government-contract management. For example, the project-management approach developed for execution of the DARPA contract is directly applicable to the product-realization process, to emerging quality and productivity initiatives, and to fiscal accountability in AT&T's strategic business units (SBUs). Baseline planning becomes the cornerstone for critical SBU projects, and formal milestone tracking and control ensure high-level visibility of project progress. Product-development teams become customer champions for specific deliverables, and the core strength of a project-management department emphasizes a business-like approach to the R&D challenges of the 1990s.

Computer-Aided Analysis of Office Systems	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Office systems; computer-aided analysis; requirements specifications		Computer-aided support in the analysis and design of office information systems is discussed. The support system described includes a language for description of office practice, analysis and database maintenance systems, and analysis report generation software. The system components are consistent with a general model of office interactions. The objects and relations unique to he office environment are supported in the terminology for description of both manual and automated office activities. Analysis support providing consistency and completeness evaluations and alternative views of the system serve the analysis activity. A case study is briefly overviewed and conclusions are drawn concerning the utility of the tools. The major utility of the tools was perceived by management and analysts to be the application as a dynamic and structured documentation with consistency evaluation.

The development of FAMIS involved the application of innovative organizational and technological approaches which contributed significantly to the success of the project. For example, the University utilized a systems, user, and management team in its design of FAMIS. Also, the technological approach involved use of a Dictionary/Directory Facility (DDF) developed by the University's Administrative Systems group. The use of the DDF proved to reduce significantly the amount of conventional computer programming required to develop FAMIS. Furthermore, it proved to be a valuable aid in facilitating systems, and user and management interaction.

J	Fowler, FP				Fowler, F. Parker, Jr.			THE EXECUTIVE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM AS A DESIGN STRATEGY	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Information systems design; health information systems; executive intelligence system		The failure of the MIS idea to achieve its ultimate goal of informing managers rests in the single wrong assumption that the manager can define his information needs prior to the time for decision making. If the assumption were true, then management could be implemented by automata. Because it is not true, the conventional MIS maximum capability is to produce hackneyed status reports based upon technocrats' perceptions of what the manager needs; its minimum capability is coughing up answers to irrelevant, unasked questions. This spectrum from impotence to mediocrity cannot be usefully extended to meet managements' needs because the design strategy is wrong. A proper design strategy for providing managers with relevant information for choosing courses of action recognizes the principle of variety reduction, and that human beings have unique and peculiar ways of reducing variety in noisy information circumstances. Assuming that the distinguishing feature, beyond luck, of the successful executive vs. the controller, is creativity, including novel and non-structured uses of information, then any structured reporting system will fail to meet his needs. This article describes the design criteria for and the successful implementation of a system to support decision making in an information rich and volatile environment: the Independent Practice Association form of Health Maintenance Organization. Issues of cost and quality of medical care, the measurement of professional practice, the assumption of risk, etc., combine with an abundance of difficult data processing procedures to make this job a worthy challenge, and its successful implementation a model for complex organizations.
