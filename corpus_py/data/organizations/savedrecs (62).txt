J	Iveroth, E				Iveroth, Einar			The Sociomaterial Practice of IT-Enabled Change: A Case Study of a Global Transformation	JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IT-enabled change; sociomateriality; organizational change; case study	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIC CHANGE; KNOWLEDGE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; POWER; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; ICT	This article applies a sociomaterial perspective to IT-enabled change. The empirical data consists of in-depth interviews and internal documents from a longitudinal case study of the telecommunications company Ericsson. They managed to successfully transform their finance and accounting (F&A) unit from a highly decentralized structure into a so-called shared service centre (SSC) structure. The transformation was executed within three years and was enabled by an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The findings consist of a framework with four dimensions that explains that IT-enabled change is a practice that is both social and material: a sociomaterial practice. The contribution of this article is that it shows that it is in the entanglement of the social and material elements across time where we can find a deeper understanding of IT-enabled change.

J	Jones, M; Liddle, J				Jones, Martin; Liddle, Joyce			Implementing the UK Central Government's policy agenda for improved third sector engagement Reflecting on issues arising from third sector commissioning workshops	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public sector organizations; Non-profit organizations; Service delivery; United Kingdom	CIVIL-SOCIETY; PUBLIC-SERVICES; PARTNERSHIP; PROCUREMENT	Purpose - As many states recognise the need to enter into new relationships with the third sector, strategic commissioning of services has moved up the political agenda. The establishment of the Office of the Third Sector in the UK Cabinet Office heralded a commitment to engage the "voice" and "choice" of third sector organizations in designing, delivering and measuring public service delivery. This paper seeks to report on the findings gathered from a series of workshops and other data collection on public sector commissioning of third sector service delivery, and to highlight some tensions and emerging issues in this policy field. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data from workshops were supplemented with observations, interview data, existing research, and secondary data from a number of government agencies and third sector representative organizations. Findings - The findings from the workshops and other data collection methods will feed into future design and development of training programmes for public sector and third sector officers. They should also inform the policy debate and enhance understanding of some of the tensions and problems facing practitioners in this policy field. Originality/value - Little research exists on third sector or public sector commissioning, and this work will be of value to policy makers, practitioners and academics concerned with strategic commissioning. The paper augments existing theory on state and non-governmental relationships and the contribution of third sector agencies to public service delivery.

J	Sanzo, MJ; Vazquez, R				Jose Sanzo, Maria; Vazquez, Rodolfo			The Influence of Customer Relationship Marketing Strategies on Supply Chain Relationships: The Moderating Effects of Environmental Uncertainty and Competitive Rivalry	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING			English	Article						customer relationship marketing; loyalty toward suppliers; communication; satisfaction; trust; environmental uncertainty; competitive rivalry	RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; ORIENTATION; SATISFACTION; CHANNEL; DETERMINANTS; MANUFACTURER; COMMITMENT; MODEL; FIRM; CAPABILITIES	Purpose: A firm's customer relationship marketing strategy also may affect its attitudinal loyalty toward its main supplier. Furthermore, environmental uncertainty and competitive rivalry could moderate this relationship. This research investigates both questions. Methodology/Approach: The empirical study involves a structured survey of 141 industrial firms. A structural equation technique with EQS 6.1 estimated the causal model. Multi-sample analysis revealed whether environmental uncertainty and/or competitive rivalry act as moderators. Findings: The influence of customer relationship marketing on attitudinal loyalty toward the main supplier is positive but indirect, working through effective communication, satisfaction, and trust. However, when environmental uncertainty is high, the negative direct effect becomes significantly more intense, and when competitive rivalry is high, the positive indirect effect through satisfaction and trust is less intense. Originality/Value: This study explores potential new paths in the relationship marketing field. Most scholars focus on the influence of a firm's relationship marketing strategy on customers' loyalty, but no previous works consider its potential influence on the firm's relationship with other partners in the supply chain, notably its strategic suppliers. Research Implications: Structured academic research on this topic is lacking, even though many firms have implemented customer relationship programs. Supply-side researchers must evaluate the effects of such programs. Furthermore, this study combines different theoretical approaches. Practical Implications: Practitioners can use the findings to segment their customer base and develop specific programs adapted to each target.

J	Laforet, S				Laforet, Sylvie			Brand names on packaging and their impact on purchase preference	JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							CONSUMER PRODUCT RESPONSES; CORPORATE ASSOCIATIONS; EXTENSIONS; PORTFOLIOS; QUALITY; LEADERS; CHOICE	This study examines whether appearance of corporate, product and dual brand names (or a combination of brand names used together) on packaging influence consumer purchase preference. The face-to-face survey consists of consumers rating their purchase preference on a 7-point scale sixteen random brand names, and combinations of brand names on packaging along with three different prices, each for two product categories: chocolate and cereals a total of 4032 observations are examined. Hypotheses are tested using multiple linear regression models. The findings show corporate, product and dual brand names have little impact on purchase preference per se, instead brand category dominance influence consumer choice, and corporate names do not add value as previously thought. The study suggests trends and contexts in which, a corporate name and a product brand name may be extended to optimise consumer brand associations and influence purchase, as well as strategies for extending in remote product categories. Future research needs focusing on international consumers' response on brand linkages in the international arena, and the issues of brand building and brand equity maintenance in international markets. The study makes contribution to brand extension, brand portfolio management and strategic brand management research. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Lawton, T; Rajwani, T; O'Kane, C				Lawton, Thomas; Rajwani, Tazeeb; O'Kane, Conor			Strategic reorientation and business turnaround: the case of global legacy airlines	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decline; Strategic reorientation; Turnarounds; Strategic change; Legacy airlines	EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION; MANAGEMENT; DECLINE; FIRMS; ATTRIBUTIONS; EVOLUTION; CRISIS	Purpose - This paper aims to illustrate how legacy airlines can reorientate to achieve sharp recoveries in performance following prolonged periods of stagnation, decline and eroding competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a qualitative analysis of five longitudinal case studies of legacy airlines that embarked on strategic change between 1997 and 2006. Data collection spanned ten years and included archival data, public documents, news clippings, accounts in specialist books and internal company documentation. Findings - The paper identifies two distinct approaches for reorientation in the legacy airline industry. Companies that have fallen behind and are in risk of failure focus on regaining customer trust and loyalty, and restructuring route networks, business processes and costs in an "improvement and innovation" reorienting approach. Underperforming airlines, for whom growth has declined in traditional markets and who note that opportunities exist elsewhere, focus on product and service development and geographical growth in an "extension and expansion" reorienting approach. Practical implications - The paper develops a framework for successful reorientation in the legacy airline industry. This framework encourages executives to focus on and leverage profit maximization, quality, leadership, alliance networks, regional consolidation and staff development during periods of strategy formulation and reorientation. Originality/value - This research addresses the dearth of understanding and attention afforded to the concept of reorientation in the literature on strategic turnaround. The research also serves to emphasize the presence and importance of reorientation as a strategy of change within the legacy airline industry. Furthermore, in demonstrating how this strategy can be implemented in a sharp-bending or performance improvement context, this study illustrates how reorientation is intertwined with the broader turnaround process.

J	Lindvall, J; Iveroth, E				Lindvall, Jan; Iveroth, Einar			Creating a global network of shared service centres for accounting	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE			English	Article						IT-enabled management control change; Organizational transformation; Globalization; Shared service centre; Finance function; ERP system; Organizational restructuring	MANAGEMENT CONTROL-SYSTEMS; RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEMS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the practice of IT-enabled management control change, in particular how IT-driven change is made possible from a practical perspective in a global context. It does so by investigating the redesign of the telecommunications company Ericsson's global finance and accounting function from an independent structure of numerous national chief financial officer units into one interdependent global network of shared service centres. Design/methodology/approach - Ericsson's transformation was followed by drawing mainly on interviews and documents. The data were analysed using narrative and temporal bracketing strategies for theorising from process data. Findings - The paper illustrates how IT-enabled management control change unfolds as a continuous interaction between a dynamic organisational structure (social dimension) and a less, but still, dynamic IT (material dimension) across time. The study also highlights how such a process is metaphorically similar to the form of a hermeneutic spiral rather than the common perspective of an arrow from the present to the future. Research limitations/implications - The focus of the paper is on positive organisational change and how transformation is possible from a strategic and managerial point of view. Hence, less focus is placed on the employee perspective. Practical implications - This paper stresses the importance of pre-understanding, an openness to trials and learning, and a dynami stance towards the moving targets of IT and organisation. Originality/value - The paper provides rich empirical material. The analysis includes contemporary issues, and the practice of IT-enabled management control change.

J	MacIntosh, R; Beech, N				MacIntosh, Robert; Beech, Nic			Strategy, strategists and fantasy: a dialogic constructionist perspective	ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategic management; Social interaction; Role play	ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY; CORPORATE-STRATEGY; EXPERIENCE; MANAGEMENT; SCIENCE; STORY; SHAPE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute a constructionist perspective to debates in the strategy literature about the ways in which managers conduct strategy work. The authors build on observations that fantasy plays a central role in strategy work and aim to focus on the ways in which fantasies of self and other operate in the identity work of participants in the process of developing strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The study presents an inductive approach based on extended participant observation in two different organizations. Each engagement lasted about three years and the analysis is based on data gathered in meetings, workshops, focus groups, interviews and other informal settings. Findings - The paper presents four different types of fantasy, which were observed in the data set. These fantasies are labeled: helpful pairing; the arms race; the eternal optimist and the merchant of doom. It is also suggested that there are three useful dimensions that might be used to unpack the ways in which fantasies operate. These are role playing and role taking; temporal place and associated value; the relationship between fantasy and evidence. Research limitations/implications - The authors propose that future research on strategy should entail an understanding of the role of fantasy in what people say and do. Originality/value - The paper offers four types of fantasy construction as a contribution to the extant literature and three analytical dimensions which can be used to consider the ways in which fantasy operates in the identity work of strategists.

J	Oh, SH; Lee, HS; Kim, SJ				Oh, Sang Hyun; Lee, Hwa Suk; Kim, Su Jin			The Effects of Service Quality and Relationship Benefits on Relationship Commitment and Customer Loyalty in Membership Fitness Club	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Service quality; Technical quality; Functional quality; Relationship benefits; Relationship commitment; Customer loyalty		Relationship marketing is not a new phenomenon, but is now one of the most important topics in marketing academia and the business community. For marketing practitioners, greater benefits may arise by perceiving relationship marketing as an underlying philosophy of caring for customers. In the Academy, many scholars have suggested a new marketing paradigm based on relationship marketing. The rationale behind relationship marketing is to create, enhance, and maintain relationships with customers. Increasing and securing loyalty is central to many corporate strategies because obtaining new customer is costly and customer retention is connected to long-term profitability. Commitment is recognized as the key component in the relationship marketing paradigm and social exchange theory. The health care industry is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries. The modern health care sector is divided into many sub-sectors, and depends on interdisciplinary teams of trained professionals and paraprofessionals to meet health needs of individuals and populations. The objective of this paper is to establish a theoretical basis for evaluating a strategic increase in customers' perceptions of service quality (technical quality and functional quality) and relationship benefits - specifically in terms of an increase in relationship commitment and customer loyalty in membership fitness club and to test this theoretical basis empirically. The present study focuses on relationship commitment. Also this study identifies antecedents and consequences of relationship commitment. In so doing, the aim is to underline the effect that service quality and relationship benefits have on relationship commitment and customer loyalty. The present study empirically tests the formulated model - to establish the effects of service quality and relationship benefits on relationship commitment and customer loyalty in membership fitness service setting. Research model was tested sub-sector of health care industry. The basic objective of the empirical part is to test the model among users of the services of gym, health and fitness. More specifically we chose the users of two membership fitness clubs, located in Daegu (Korea). Research fitness clubs operate fitness and recreational sports facilities featuring exercise and other active physical fitness conditioning or recreational sports activities, such as swimming, racquet sports and golf. Firms are also involved in facilities management and fitness instruction. The selection of the sample was random, a random route in each fitness club being established for each of the interviewers. The average duration of the interviews was ten minutes. Finally, 254 usable responses were gained. To test the hypotheses in this study, we estimated the fit and parameters of the models through covariance structural analysis. The parameters of the overall model used maximum likelihood estimation, and the fit of the model resulted as chi(2) (94 d.f)= 329.52(p=.000), GFI=.94, AGFI=.93, RMR=.022, NFI=.92, CFI=.94. Compared to general evaluation standards, this failed to meet the chi(2) value. But it's enough to explain the relations among variables since GFI, NF1, CFI turned out to be .95, .92, and .94, respectively. All hypotheses are supported by the data. They suggest that technical quality, functional quality, and relationship benefits significantly influence relationship commitment toward using fitness club. Relationship benefits directly influence relationship commitment and customer loyalty, and indirectly influence customer loyalty through mediator of relationship commitment. Also, the empirical results confirmed that relationship commitment plays a strong, central role in determining customer loyalty. Sound expertise performance (technical quality) is a necessary but not sufficient condition to retain customer. Because of the general lack of knowledge among customers, the service provider needs to recognize that all service provider-customer interaction takes on added significance and value to customer. For such services the traditional marketing functions can only operate at the strategic level - the people operating at the boundary between the firm and the external environment are the ones who must re-mix the service in interaction with customer. Their technical capabilities and interpersonal skills are the source of service differentiation, satisfaction and ultimately, customer retention. Next, regular and effective communications with customer is essential in order to reduce perceived risk and uncertainty, shape expectations, educate the customer, resolve any misunderstandings and explain the options in a jargon-free way. Given the pivotal role of functional quality in impacting on relationship commitment, intensive training in interpersonal and communications skills would seem warranted. Finally, it needs to be appreciated that effective interpersonal communication has the potential to, over time, result in strong social and emotional bonds between adviser and client, and thereby increase the switching barriers to exiting the relationship. A reciprocal influence may exist between relationship strength and relationship benefits. A long-term relationship results in certain relationship benefits that strengthen the ties and results in a continued relationship. There are some limitations of this research that should be considered when interpreting its findings. Our model does not take into account personal characteristics (e.g., attractiveness of alternatives, length of patronage, skill level and experience) that also may have an impact. Thus, expanding the scope of antecedents is an important next step toward our understanding of the factors that enhance membership service area. Future research could also address the moderating role of the length of the relationship and how it influences the connection between relational benefits, service quality, and loyalty. Other moderator variables can also affect such relationships, such as income, age, gender, and customer experience.

J	Pasche, M; Magnusson, M				Pasche, Maximilian; Magnusson, Mats			Continuous innovation and improvement of product platforms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						continuous innovation capability; product platforms; decision making; management of knowledge; strategic flexibility; component innovation; architectural innovation; improvement; product architecture; stability; dynamic environment; modularity	KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN; FLEXIBILITY; STRATEGIES; MODULARITY; MANAGEMENT; FAMILY; FIRM	Product platforms are applied in order to increase the stability of the product architecture and to reap benefits of scale and scope. However, many firms face a dynamic environment with quickly changing market demands. In such an environment, firms may have to continuously renew and improve their product platforms to achieve desired flexibility. The modifications comprise two types of innovations, component as well as architectural innovations. Combining these types to simultaneously achieve stability and strategic flexibility demands continuous innovation capability. This paper provides a viable approach to coordinate architectural and component innovations. The paper is based on a case study of an international truck manufacturer. Two major issues, decision-making and the management of knowledge, stand out as important for realising continuous innovation and improvement of product platforms. Moreover, product platform management needs to consider modularity and its related economies of substitution.

J	Salhieh, L; Abu-Doleh, J; Hijazi, N				Salhieh, Loay; Abu-Doleh, Jamal; Hijazi, Nada			The assessment of e-banking readiness in Jordan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Jordan; Banks; Services; Electronic commerce; Virtual banking; E-banking; IT infrastructure; Assessing E-readiness; Bankers' perception; E-banking services		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose and validate a framework that can be used for assessing the level of banks' readiness for providing e-banking services in Jordan. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-based data-gathering technique, descriptive, and analytical analyses are used. Findings - This study has used three constructs to propose a framework that can assess e-banking readiness: perceptions of bankers, perceptions of customers, and IT infrastructure in banks. However, there is evidence in this paper to support that e-banking has achieved a degree of strategic and operational importance among bank managers. Also, customers are positive about embracing new banking channels. But it seems that technological aspects and IT employees' skills are paramount concerns. Research limitations/implications - This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to gauge banks' readiness to offer e-banking services. Also, it suggests that future work could entail investigating the readiness from financial aspects, and the effect of marketing campaigns on customer's acceptance of using e-banking services. Practical implications - The findings presented in this paper can be used by banks to evaluate their readiness to provide e-banking services to their customers. Also, banks can create a readiness profile, in order to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses of their e-banking services. Originality/value - This paper adds to readiness studies by providing a framework to assess e-banking services. It is of interest to researchers to add to this framework and of interest to banks to evaluate services provided to customers.

J	Vaz, EDN; Caetano, M; Nijkamp, P				Vaz, Eric de Noronha; Caetano, Mario; Nijkamp, Peter			Trapped between antiquity and urbanism - a multi-criteria assessment model of the greater Cairo Metropolitan area	JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE			English	Article						land use change; cultural heritage endangerment; Giza pyramids; urban growth; Landsat imagery	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; LAND-COVER CHANGE; SAN-FRANCISCO; GROWTH; GIS; DELTA	This article attempts to provide systematic policy information regarding land use/land cover change in the vicinity of the Giza Pyramids in Egypt. As a result of the rapid urban growth Cairo has experienced in the past couple of decades, a surrounding enclave of urban development seems to be forming around the Pyramids and the highly valued historical legacy of the area, designated in 1979 as a World Heritage site. Hence, assessing land use changes and future urban sprawl prediction is of major importance for strategic planning and avoiding further endangerment. The data used in this study are derived from remote sensing imagery, taken by Landsat MSS satellite on 31 August 1972 and on 20 September 1984 by Landsat TM as well as Landsat ETM+ imagery from 11 November 2000. The use of the different bands of that imagery allowed the classification of the land cover classes: urban, vegetation, desert and water. A temporal comparison of the different types of land cover indicates which land use changes that have occurred over the years considered are associated with the potential for endangering the Giza complex in the study area.

J	Wang, R; Song, J				Wang, Rui; Song, Jing			Business Marketing in China: Review and Prospects	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING			English	Article						business-to-business marketing; China	INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS; CHANNEL RELATIONSHIPS; CUSTOMER ORIENTATION; CONTINGENT VALUE; EMERGING MARKET; PERFORMANCE; GUANXI	Purpose: Given the growth in research on business marketing in China, there is an imperative need to provide a comprehensive understanding of business marketing issues in China. Thus the authors attempt to conduct a comprehensive review to obtain that understanding and to address the following questions: How much progress has been made in understanding business marketing issues in China, and how much progress has been made regarding theory development in this domain? Methodology/Approach: The review covers a total of 153 research articles from 23 key marketing and management academic journals from 1990 through 2009. The authors also propose a theoretical framework consisting of three theories to review the fragmented literature: a theory of Chinese business marketing; a theory of Chinese comparative business marketing; and a Chinese theory of business marketing. Findings: The review enhances our understanding of the theoretical development in the domain of business marketing in China. The review on studies using China as a research sample suggests that most research attempts to exemplify extant business marketing theories in the Chinese context. The review on studies using China as a comparison object shows that marketing is a relatively new phenomenon in China, and thus many business marketing activities in China are different due to the cultural, institutional, and economic situations. The review on studies using China as a unique object documents distinctive business marketing phenomena in China such as guanxi (personal connections) and xinyong (personal trust) and provides theoretical understanding of these phenomena. Originality/Value: The authors develop a new theoretical framework to review the literature: a theory of Chinese business marketing, a theory of Chinese comparative business marketing, and a Chinese theory of business marketing. The framework contributes to the literature by understanding different usages of a context in business marketing research and by suggesting possible theoretical development in this domain. The review identifies potential topics and theoretical development for future research in each of the three areas. The review also provides important managerial implications for practitioners by offering a comprehensive understanding of how business marketing practices are operated in China.

J	Wu, Y; Wei, ZL; Liang, QZ				Wu, Yong; Wei, Zelong; Liang, Qiaozhuan			Top management team diversity and strategic change The moderating effects of pay imparity and organization slack	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Managers; Team working; Pay structures; Resource management; China	FIRM PERFORMANCE; UPPER ECHELONS; HETEROGENEITY; INTERDEPENDENCE; DIFFERENCE; DISPERSION; RESOURCES; MEDIATOR	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the building of a theoretical model to explore how team pay disparity and resource slack moderate the effects of top management team (TMT) diversity on strategic change and if the moderating effects of resource slack differ in firms with a low or high level of Pay disparity. Design/methodology/approach - Nine hypotheses are proposed and tested with a sample from 391 listed Chinese firms. Archival data are collected from annual reports to form the sample. The hypothesized model relationships are tested through regression analysis. Findings - The findings show that pay imparity negatively moderates the effects of TMT diversity and resource slack also has important moderating effects. Furthermore, the moderating effects of resource slack differ in firms with low and high team pay imparity. Originality/value - TMT demography diversity has an important effect on strategic change. However, two conflicting views exist on the relationship. Although some literature suggests that diversity may be sources of explorative activities such as strategic change, others suggest that diversity may cause integration difficulty and thus has a negative effect on strategic change. This paper contributes to extant debate regarding the effects of TMT diversity on strategic change by including TMT pay imparity and resource slack to explain that the effect of diversity on strategic change is contingent on the level of pay imparity, resources slack, and their interactive effects. This research also contributes to understanding organization slack by reasoning that the moderating effect is contingent on pay imparity level.

J	Zhang, MJ				Zhang, Michael			Firm-level performance impact of IS support for product innovation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Company performance; Competitive advantage; Information systems; Product innovation		Purpose - This paper seeks to assess the bottom-line (profitability) impact of information systems support for product innovation at the firm level, based on the current resource-based view of the competitive role of information systems (IS). The paper also explores the role of firm-specific information and knowledge that complement IS support for product innovation in moderating the performance impact of the IS support. Design/methodology/approach - Both survey and archival data were used to assess the profitability impact of IS support for product innovation. Data tapping IS support for product innovation and firm-specific, complementary information and knowledge were collected from a survey of senior IS executives from 760 large companies operating in different industries in the United States. The profitability data were obtained from the Research Insight database. Hierarchical regression analyses were employed to test the research hypotheses. Findings - Providing IS support for product innovation alone did not improve profitability as measured by return on sales and return on assets. Only when complemented by firm-specific information and knowledge would IS support for product innovation lead to profitability gains. Research limitations/implications - the use of cross-sectional data collected from single informants and the coarse scales to measure the key variables may limit the usefulness of the research findings. Practical implications - It is not sufficient for a firm to simply focus on selecting or designing IS that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its product development process. Rather, the firm and its managers need to pay equal attention to the deployment of firm-specific information and knowledge resources which would not only facilitate the use and implementation of IS for production innovation, but also make such IS less susceptible to imitation by competitors. Originality/value - This article provides further evidence for the positive influence of IS-based product innovation on the bottom-line performance of firms and uses the resource-based view of the strategic impact of IS to identify one condition under which such influence may occur. Unlike prior research that gauges the performance effects of IS support for product innovation at the project or department level, this research generates evidence for profitability gains accruing from IS support at the firm level.

J	Cadden, T; Humphreys, P; McHugh, M				Cadden, Trevor; Humphreys, Paul; McHugh, Marie			The influence of organisational culture on strategic supply chain relationship success	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article							JOINT VENTURE; COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES; CORPORATE CULTURE; TRANSACTION COST; PERFORMANCE; TRUST; MANAGEMENT; FIRM; DETERMINANTS; ALLIANCES	The purpose of this paper is to explore and develop the general proposition that organisational cultural compatibility between strategic supply chain partners results in improved performance outcomes for each participant in the chain. A theoretical framework is proposed of the relationship of differing organisational cultural elements (practices, values, behaviours and norms) to supply chain performance. A number of propositions are presented along with conclusions and suggestions for further research. This paper is one of the first to deconstruct differing organisational cultural elements and present a model linking them to a diverse range of strategic supply chain partner performance outcomes throughout the supply chain.

J	Parker, SC				Parker, Simon C.			A PREDATOR-PREY MODEL OF KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP	STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL			English	Article						knowledge spillovers; entrepreneurship; predator-prey	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FIRM SURVIVAL; INNOVATION; EVOLUTION; ECONOMICS; MOBILITY; DIFFUSION; RETURNS; ENTRY; TIME	Knowledge spillovers are known to generate positive benefits for entrepreneurs, but may come at the expense of knowledge creation by the incumbent firms which generate them. This article develops a predator prey model of knowledge spillovers which captures the interdependence between idea-creating incumbents and knowledge spillover-appropriating entrepreneurs. The values of the model's parameters determine whether these two populations of firms settle down in a stable equilibrium; cycle over time with entrepreneurs doing well when incumbents do badly and vice-versa; or drive each other to extinction. This sheds light on disparate industry life cycle patterns observed in previous research and generates some novel insights relating to public policy. In particular, the model suggests that governments ought to adopt a dynamic policy stance, initially implementing policies which favor incumbents before shifting their intervention efforts toward encouraging entrepreneurs.

Addressing the information gaps associated with valuing green infrastructure in west Michigan: INtegrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services Tool (INVEST)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						benefit transfer; economic valuation; ecosystem services; green infrastructure; spatially-explicit	BENEFIT TRANSFER; MANAGEMENT; DECISION	Land use change is profoundly influencing the environmental resources of the Great Lakes region. In West Michigan, population growth and rapid land use change have resulted in urbanization and a loss in the diversity of green infrastructure that provides a variety of benefits ecosystem services to regional residents and visitors. To address these changes in land use and cover in ways that are objective, transparent, and defensible, local policy makers need tools to help inform local and regional land use decisions. An interdisciplinary team, engaged by a regional policy organization, developed one such online tool, the INtegrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services Tool (INVEST). INVEST utilizes static GIS maps, graphs, and tables, to help educate local and regional decision-makers about the underlying values of ecosystem services associated with green infrastructure, particularly those services that do not pass through traditional commercial markets. In this article we provide a general overview of the development of INVEST and examine its current application as an educational tool, including the specific challenges associated with addressing the information gaps.

J	Mao, WG; Rychlik, I; Storhaug, G				Mao, Wengang; Rychlik, Igor; Storhaug, Gaute			Safety Index of Fatigue Failure for Ship Structure Details	JOURNAL OF SHIP RESEARCH			English	Article						fatigue; damage analysis; safety; loads	SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT; LIFE PREDICTION; UNCERTAINTY; DAMAGE; LOADS	One way to assess the uncertainty in fatigue damage analysis is to use a so-called safety index. In the computation of such an index, the variation coefficient for the accumulated damage is required. In this paper the expected fatigue damage and its coefficient of variation are firstly estimated from measured stress. Secondly, when suitable stress measurements are not available these are computed from models for damage accumulation and sea states variability. Stresses during the ship sailing period are regarded as the nonstationary, slowly changing, Gaussian processes, and hence damage accumulation, during encountered sea state, can be approximated by an algebraic function of significant wave height, ship speed, and heading angle. Further, the space time variability of significant wave height is modeled as a log normal field with parameters estimated from the satellite measurements. The proposed methods to estimate uncertainties in the damage accumulation process are validated using full-scale measurements carried out for a container vessel operating in the North Atlantic.

We examine how founders' past experience in their prior employer (their parent firm) affects their tenure in the new venture. Founders coming from more successful parent firms, with more prior affiliations among the venture's cofounders and with prior start-up experience are more likely to remain with the new venture after founding. These effects are more pronounced in cases where the technologies employed by the start-up are more uncertain. Copyright (C) 2010 Strategic Management Society.

The large-scale applicability, reliability, and validity of Vickrey auctions as an incentive-compatible method for eliciting WTP in a real-world setting were tested empirically. The results of 6,548 sealed bids in 28 auctions of costly durables on a popular auction Web site show that regular on-line shoppers have little problem understanding and applying the Vickrey auction bidding strategy. As a result, Vickrey auctions can easily produce a reliable and valid distribution of WTP based on several thousand consumers. A comparison of Vickrey auctions with the more commonly used English or eBay auctions shows, both conceptually and empirically, that the latter formats do not fully reflect the complete range of potential customers' WTP and, therefore, lead to systematic overestimation of price-demand functions. In contrast, WTP information elicited through Vickrey auctions is undistorted by strategic behavior such as bid-sniping and incorporates the full range of WTP information, suggesting that it is better suited for estimating realistic price-demand functions for market research purposes.

J	Miller, SC				Miller, Susan C.			A Model for Successful Nursing Home-Hospice Partnerships	JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							CARE; ENROLLMENT; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; IMPROVE; STAFF; LIFE; PAIN; END	Background: While benefits of hospice care in nursing homes have been documented, interorganizational challenges such as staff conflicts regarding planned care or their respective roles have also been documented. Through case studies, this research aimed to characterize the partnerships of successful nursing home-hospice collaborators. Methods: Six nursing homes and hospices with self-identified successful collaborations were studied. Interviews of care providers and chief executive and financial officers collected information on practices relating to seven domains identified as critical to the collaboration. The organizational factors and activities relating to infrastructure development and care collaboration and provision most common across sites were identified. Results: Nursing home-hospice collaborators were philosophically and otherwise aligned; they had similar missions, understood their differing approaches to care, and administrators demonstrated an openness and support for the collaboration. Hospices developed infrastructures to correspond to the uniqueness and complexity of the nursing home environment. For example, they hired nurses with nursing home backgrounds, created teams dedicated to nursing home care, and trained hospice staff in problem solving and conflict resolution. Care collaboration processes focused on the importance of two-way communication by actively soliciting and sharing information with nursing home staff and responding to nursing home staff and administrators' concerns. Conclusion: While successful collaborators were organizational aligned, hospice leaders' acknowledgement that palliative care provision in nursing homes is complex and unique was important to success. Accordingly, the prevalent partnership model was a product of strategic efforts by leaders aimed at matching their staffing to the nursing home environment and promoting good communication and skills needed for problem solving.

Objective: The aim of this study was to enhance understanding about computer-assisted health-risk assessments from physicians' perspectives after completion of a trial at a Canadian, urban, multi-doctor, hospital-affiliated family practice clinic. Methods: A qualitative approach of face-to-face, in-depth, semi-structured interviews was used. All interviews were audio recorded and field notes taken. Analytic induction and constant comparative techniques were used for coding and analyses. Interpretation was facilitated by peer audit and insights gained from the social exchange theoretical perspective. Results: Ten physicians (seven female and three male) participated in the interviews. Three overarching themes emerged in relation to computer-assisted health-risk assessments: (1) perceived benefits, (2) perceived concerns or challenges, and (3) feasibility. Physicians unanimously acknowledged the potential of computer-assisted health-risk assessments to open dialogue on psychosocial health risks. They also appreciated the general facilitative roles of the tool, such as improving time-efficiency by asking questions on health risks prior to the consultation and triggering patients' self-reflections on the risks. However, in the context of ongoing physician-patient relationships, physicians expressed concerns about the impact of the computer-assisted health-risk assessment tool on visit time, patient readiness to talk about psychosocial issues when the purpose of the visit was different, and the suitability of such risk assessment for all visits to detect new risk information. In terms of feasibility, physicians displayed general acceptance of the risk assessment tool but considered it most feasible for periodic health exams and follow-up visits based on their perceived concerns or challenges and the resources needed to implement such programs. These included clinic level (staff training, space, confidentiality) and organizational level (time, commitment and finances) support. Conclusions: Participants perceived computer-assisted health-risk assessment as a useful tool in family practice, particularly for identifying psychosocial issues. Physicians displayed a general acceptance of the computer tool and indicated its greater feasibility for periodic health exams and follow-up visits than all visits. Future physician training on psychosocial issues should address physicians' concerns by emphasizing the varying forms of "clinical success" for the management of chronic psychosocial issues. Future research is needed to examine the best ways to implement this program in diverse clinical settings and patient populations.

J	Hooks, G; McQueen, B				Hooks, Gregory; McQueen, Brian			American Exceptionalism Revisited: The Military-Industrial Complex, Racial Tension, and the Underdeveloped Welfare State	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						welfare state; military-industrial complex; political sociology; American exceptionalism; critical juncture	NEW-DEAL; POLITICS; DECLINE; MODELS; POLICY	We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home, the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show that World War II mobilization played an important role. First, Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered significantly greater losses where both non-white population and aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.

J	Lee, JYH; Panteli, N				Lee, Joyce Y. H.; Panteli, Niki			Business strategic conflict in computer-mediated communication	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						conflict; computer-mediated communication; email; inter-organisational collaborations; coopetition; media selection	ELECTRONIC MAIL; RICHNESS; MODEL; BUYER; EQUIVOCALITY; PERCEPTIONS; SELECTION; EMOTION; SYSTEMS; EMAIL	In this paper, we introduce the concept of business strategic conflict and examine its influence on communication media selection and use in inter-organisational collaborations. In doing so, we show the inherent complexities in the computer-mediated interactions between synergistic companies in the same industry. The work draws on a field study carried out for 5 months in a case of a product design collaboration between two large high-tech corporations in Taiwan and Korea. Findings show that at an early stage of the collaboration, the use of media has shifted substantially from FTF meetings to email, while it is also found that, due to the competitive nature of the inter-organisational collaboration involved, business strategic conflict significantly influences media selection and, in turn, it is influenced by the selected media. Our results contribute to media selection theories that have so far neglected the coopetitive inter-organisational environment.

Alberta Prov Project Outcome Asses	Timing of nonemergent coronary artery bypass grafting and mortality after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome	AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL			English	Article							ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; CONSERVATIVE STRATEGIES; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CARDIAC-SURGERY; UNSTABLE ANGINA; RISK MODEL; DISEASE; REVASCULARIZATION; MANAGEMENT; DATABASE	Background The purpose of this study was to determine the association between time to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mortality among patients admitted with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). Patients are increasingly being referred for CABG soon after NSTEACS, although few data exist to guide the optimal timing of bypass surgery. Methods We identified a cohort of all patients who underwent nonemergent CABG within 60 days of hospitalization for NSTEACS in the province of Alberta, Canada, from 2000 to 2004. Time from admission to CABG was categorized as early (2-7 days), intermediate (8-14 days), or late (15-60 days-reference group). The primary outcome was mortality occurring within 30 days of surgery. Results Of the total cohort of 1,454 patients, 213 (14.6%) underwent early, 637 (43.8%) underwent intermediate, and 707 (48.6%) underwent late CABG surgery. In the final adjusted model time to CABG was not statistically significant as an independent predictor of short-term mortality. Compared to late CABG, there was a nonsignificant increased risk of mortality for those undergoing early (hazard ratio 2.36, 95% CI 0.72-7.76) and intermediate (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% CI 0.76-3.72) CABG surgery. Conclusions Time from admission to CABG was not associated with an increased risk of short-term mortality. However, there was a trend toward increased mortality with early CABG, and this study does not exclude the presence of a modest risk association between timing of CABG and short-term mortality.

J	Taliberti, H; Zucchi, P				Taliberti, Helena; Zucchi, Paola			Direct costs of the dengue fever control and prevention program in 2005 in the City of Sao Paulo	REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			Portuguese	Article						Dengue; dengue/prevention and control; health economics; costs and cost analysis; health policy, planning, and management; epidemiologic surveillance; Brazil		Objective. To estimate the direct costs associated with the control of Aedes aegypti and prevention of dengue fever in the City of Sao Paulo Dengue Control Program, Brazil, in 2005. Method. The following items were considered: human resources, uniforms, field materials, individual protection equipment, spraying equipment, strategic supplies (insecticides and larvicides), and vehicles. The costs associated with laboratory tests for entomological surveillance and dengue fever diagnosis were also calculated, as well as costs relating to information and printed materials for educational campaigns. Results. The total direct costs of the City of Sao Paulo Dengue Fever Program in 2005 were R$ 21 774 282.82 (US$ 12 486 941.34 considering the dollar/real exchange rate in December 2009). Of this amount, 59.4% were directed to human resources, 38.3% to epidemic control measures, and 2.2% to capital expenditure. The cost per capita was R$ 1.99 in 2005. Conclusions. The control of dengue fever is essential given the growth of epidemics. Knowledge about the costs of strategies and priority items employed in dengue fever control and prevention programs can guide decision-making regarding the application of budget resources in both the City of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole.

Results showed that the laser welding with Ti filler improved the tensile strength of welded joints. Moreover, the laser welding with in situ reaction effectively restrained the pernicious Al4C3 forming reaction in the interface between aluminum matrix and reinforcement particles. Simultaneously, the reaction-formed TiC phase distributed uniformly in the weld. This permitted SiCp/AlSi7Mg composite to be successfully welded by Nd:YAG laser.

J	Rahim, Y; Refsdal, I; Kenett, RS				Rahim, Yousif; Refsdal, Ingbjorn; Kenett, Ron S.			The 5C model: A new approach to asset integrity management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING			English	Article						5C model; Asset integrity; Technical integrity; Asset management; Asset integrity management		As organizations grow more complex in operation and more global in scope, assets and technical integrity become key success factors. A company's asset integrity business process needs to be mapped in order to 1) provide a proper overview of operation and business processes, 2) identify all critical interfaces and 3) ensure that all gaps and overlaps in processes are eliminated. Achieving asset integrity requires companies to sustain their activities and identify the hazards, weaknesses and objectives of their strategic assets. Technical integrity emphasizes a complete overview of technical conditions and related information, and the ability of the companies to document the technical state of its assets. It is based on an integrated view of the current state of operations, and the identification of all critical interfaces, in order to ensure that all gaps and unnecessary overlaps in processes are eliminated. Companies look increasingly at their asset integrity management system as a means to extend the life of their assets, beyond the original design conditions and production capacity. Establishing an asset integrity management system requires the documentation of the company's technical integrity management, a strategy and the processes for carrying it out, identifying gaps; selecting corrective interventions and conducting follow up actions. The paper discusses various aspects of asset integrity management, including its planning and implementation. We begin with an introduction to asset technical integrity, provide some theoretical backgrounds, present a model we call 5C and conclude with a summary and discussion. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bryceson, KP; Slaughter, G				Bryceson, Kim P.; Slaughter, Geoff			Alignment of performance metrics in a multi-enterprise agribusiness Achieving integrated autonomy?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance measures; Supply chain management; Agricultural products	MEASUREMENT SYSTEM-DESIGN; SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; BALANCED SCORECARD; STRATEGY; IMPACT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the disconnect that can develop between corporate goals and those of individual intra-organisational business units arranged as an internal supply chain within a large vertically integrated agribusiness. It also aims to explore and discuss the development of a holistic performance metrics system that facilitates internal supply chain coordination and cohesion, while allowing synergies to develop across the company. Design/methodology/approach - A case study approach involving a participative action research component was used to examine the disconnect between internal business unit (operational) goals and overall corporate (strategic) goals and to develop a conceptual performance assessment model addressing both operational and strategic contexts. Findings - The findings show that appropriate performance indicators and measures can be created that relate directly to logical operational outcomes, thus encouraging a more tightly integrated internal supply chain, a stronger coherence among the components and a better aligned set of operational and corporate goals. Research limitations/implications - Only financial information and data obtained from a participative managerial decision-making simulation were used to explore performance goal incongruence between operational and corporate managers, compared with the need for multiple contextual performance measurement metrics that the literature suggests provides a best practice system. Originality/value - The rapidly developing corporate agribusiness sector provides a unique operating environment in that these companies deal primarily in self-regenerating assets such as livestock. Additionally the development of performance metrics for improving the coordinated integration of autonomous business units is explored for the first time and the concept of "Integrated Autonomy" is suggested as a way to describe the resulting situation.

J	Esturilho, CG; Estorilio, C				Esturilho, Clever G.; Estorilio, Carla			REGULAR PAPERS The deployment of manufacturing flexibility as a function of company strategy	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flexible manufacturing systems; Automotive industry; Quality function deployment		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a method to help companies identify the resources needed to provide manufacturing flexibility and meet the demands of their potential consumers while complying with company strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The literature related to flexibility is reviewed and a classification based on the following four levels is proposed: abilities, dimensions, elements and resources that provide flexibility. Based on this taxonomy and using the principles of quality function deployment, a method is proposed that shows the correlation between these four levels, starting with customer demand and company strategy. To show its applicability, the method was used in a manufacturing process in an automobile manufacturing company that produces nine models of vehicles. Findings - The findings of the study include a taxonomy geared towards manufacturing flexibility and a method that enables the resources that provide flexibility in an industrial production line to be identified in order of importance. After being tested in an automobile manufacturing company, the method was found to be an effective aid to the deployment of flexibility and to help highlight the main resources that needed to be introduced in the manufacturing process in order to ensure the flexibility required by the market in keeping with the company brand. Originality/value - The proposed method is based on the structure described by Olhagen and West. However, a taxonomy involving the deployment of other levels of flexibility identified by Kara and Kayis is added, making the method more complete as well as ensuring that it addresses strategic company issues.

The analysis used sales data about 246 global large-scale retail stores from diverse industries and countries of origin. We found that both strategies have positive effects on retail sales volumes. The two strategies interact such that the positive effect of market expansion on retail sales volumes is larger for retailers who also follow a strategy of greater product category diversity.

J	Graf, A; Koeszegi, ST; Pesendorfer, EM				Graf, Andrea; Koeszegi, Sabine T.; Pesendorfer, Eva-Maria			Electronic negotiations in intercultural interfirm relationships	JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						National cultures; Multinational companies; Negotiating	FACE-TO-FACE; MEDIA RICHNESS; VIRTUAL TEAMS; BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS; SOCIAL-CONTEXT; COMMUNICATION; INDIVIDUALISM; COLLECTIVISM; INFORMATION; CULTURE	Purpose - Intercultural interfirm relationships have become a new challenge for international management. The purpose of this paper is to explore differences in computer-mediated negotiation behavior between participants who come from nations which differ as regards two major cultural values: individualism and collectivism. Design/methodology/approach - This is an empirical study with a sample containing 170 negotiators with different cultural backgrounds; it comprises content analysis; and multivariate analysis of variance models. Findings - Comparing negotiators from Asian, North American, and European cultures, it is found that people who come from an individualist culture exhibit different negotiation strategies to individuals from a collectivist culture. Practical implications - Based on the results management may sensitize negotiators in intercultural interfirm relationships to their counterparts' communication strategies. Originality/value - The paper highlights how negotiators' cultures affect their strategic orientation.

To describe the management of dyslipidaemia in patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and patients with a history of CVD identified by screening for diabetes in general practice in Denmark, concentrating on prescription of lipid-lowering drugs. Moreover, to analyse predicting factors for starting lipid-lowering drugs related to patient and general practice characteristics. Design. Population-based cross-sectional study with follow-up. Setting. A total of 139 general practices from three of five Danish regions, totalling 216 GPs. Subjects. The study population comprised 4986 patients with a high risk of CVD and dyslipidaemia and 764 patients with a history of CVD and dyslipidaemia out of a population of 16 572 patients who completed screening for diabetes but were cleared for diabetes in the ADDITION study. Results. Of patients with a high risk of CVD and dyslipidaemia not receiving lipid-lowering drugs at the time of screening (n = 4823), 20% started lipid-lowering therapy within the follow-up period (median 2.1 years). This percentage was 45% (n = 536) for patients with CVD and dyslipidaemia (median follow-up period 1.6 years). Age over 50, high cholesterol, impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance, minor polypharmacy, use of heart/circulation drugs, and cholesterol measurements after screening predicted the prescription of lipid-lowering drugs for patients at high risk of CVD. For patients with CVD, male gender, high cholesterol and use of heart/circulation drugs predicted the prescription of lipid-lowering drugs. No general practice characteristics were associated with different prescription habits. Conclusion. There is a gap between the recommended lipid-lowering drug therapy and current practice, with a substantial under-treatment and a considerable delay in the first prescription of lipid-lowering drugs.

J	Kerrigan, F; Graham, G				Kerrigan, Finola; Graham, Gary			Interaction of regional news-media production and consumption through the social space	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						regional news media; Web 2.0; Service-Dominant Logic; co-creation	WORD-OF-MOUTH; PARTICIPATION; COMMUNITIES; CHALLENGES; CREATION; AGE	News-media organisations are operating in increasingly competitive and fragmented markets for audiences and advertising revenues. Through the advent of the Internet, regional news media are experiencing a revolution in their production and administrative processes, such that their survival depends on their ability to find a workable online business model. A growing army of bloggers and amateur citizen journalists now delivers - but rarely edits - content for all media platforms, while new media technologies, combined with the changing structure of regional news industries, are radically changing the ways in which a news-media organisation functions and achieves profitability. Our research seeks to answer the question of how the Internet is impacting on producer/consumer value activities in the regional news media. To answer this question, 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted at three regional newspapers, followed by a focus group with London-based news-media organisations (including radio and television) and bloggers, which aimed to expand our analysis from its initial focus on the impact of the Internet on print media (paid-for and free newspapers) to that of online co-creation activities. Our findings show that regional news media face fierce competition for audience and advertising from an ever-growing host of other media and advertising mediums, both new and traditional. There is a strategic gap in terms of media organisations' use of the Internet (despite their developing multimedia portfolios) such that they are not fully harnessing the unique potential of social media to deliver engaging user experiences. Regional news-media organisations will probably continue to survive if they can fill the strategic gap through online marketing operations, which offer a highly personalised and 'hyper local' community service with instant interaction and self-organising co-creation activities.

Corporate governance and board practices by Greek shipping management companies	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Corporate governance; Boards of directors; Freight forwarding; Greece; Marine transport	CEO DUALITY; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; STOCK OWNERSHIP; STRATEGY; DIRECTORS; AGENCY; SIZE; CONSEQUENCES	Purpose - Corporate governance is an area of interest to researchers, stakeholders and the general public. In recent times, there has been an increased concern about the effectiveness of the board within corporate organizations due to corporate scandals and accounting irregularities of some well known firms, which highlighted the inefficiency of monitoring corporate boards and the overseeing of managerial decision making. This paper aims to investigate the effects that a number of factors such as organisational demography, organisational size, ownership type, board size, CEO duality and CEO dependence/independence have on board configuration. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the literature on organisational demography and board structure characteristics. Primary data were gathered from 27 management shipping companies having their head office in Greece. Findings - Findings show high levels of influence of the CEOs on the Board of Directors, since in most cases the CEO is the Chairman of the Board and high levels of control asked by the top management teams in almost all strategic decision processes. Originality/value - The paper's contribution lies primarily on investigating issues relating to corporate governance in an extremely dynamic, highly extrovert, truly international and at the same time family owned sector; the shipping industry.

J	Liang, Z; Xue, L				Liang, Zheng; Xue, Lan			The evolution of China's IPR system and its impact on the patenting behaviours and strategies of multinationals in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China's IPR system; patent system; multinationals; patenting behaviours; patent strategies	PROTECTION; FIRMS	This paper first reviews the evolution of China's IPR system with an emphasis on the patent system, which is mainly shaped by three forces including the transition to a market economy, the opening of the domestic market and the national initiatives for cultivating indigenous innovative capabilities. Then by using some unique data both at the national level and firm level, it analyses the patenting behaviours and strategies of foreign multinationals in China in comparison with local firms, which has yielded some interesting findings. First of all, the patent deployment of multinationals in China is mainly market-oriented and strategic. Although the negative perception of China's IPR system has led multinationals to act defensively, they have been able to adapt to the Chinese system and maximise their economic benefits, in addition to gaining competitive advantages. Also, while multinationals' patenting in China has created some obstacles for local firms to catch-up, it has also forced some of them to find new ways to innovate and develop their own capabilities.

The paper argues that some urban developments are more economically efficient in generating innovation and knowledge than others. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the debate between urban density and infrastructure. Drawing on empirical evidence and economic production theory, it explores the spatial links between economic growth, innovation and knowledge productivity It argues that the growing role of human capital in the production process has linked productivity to a city's mix and levels of infrastructure and amenities. It reviews five key infrastructure types for knowledge-based developments. Findings - This paper finds that the positive contribution of density to urban vibrancy and human connectivity is constrained by a city's infrastructure and amenity levels. It concludes that urban development cognisant of an appropriate mix and level of infrastructure and amenities will more likely enhance regional knowledge development and innovation than those which are not. Social implications - The evidence presented in this paper has a broad range of strategic and practical socio-economic implications, and contributes towards understanding how urban form can leverage social aspects of a city for economic growth. Originality/value - Using an inter-disciplinarian approach, this paper provides invaluable insights into the types of infrastructure and importance of urban form for knowledge-based development. It contends that well-planned knowledge-based developments can be leveraged to ensure the successful implementation and delivery of national innovation and productivity priorities.

J	Panizzolo, R; Biazzo, S; Garengo, P				Panizzolo, Roberto; Biazzo, Stefano; Garengo, Patrizia			New product development assessment: towards a normative-contingent audit	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Product design; Critical success factors; Organizational performance; New products; Product development		Purpose - A large amount of research deals with the identification of management practices related to new product development (NPD) success. To this purpose, assessment tools capable of helping enterprises to set up improvement processes are of extreme importance. The aim of this paper is to build a product development assessment model based upon a normative-contingent approach. Design/methodology/approach - First, a literature review of the main approaches and models used in NPD assessment was carried out. Second, the tool was tested in five firms. The case studies allowed the authors to test the tool in its prototypal phase in order to assess both its limits and potential and also to highlight possible improvements. Findings - The assessment tool developed yields a clear understanding of the current state of product development process in an organization in order to facilitate a shared understanding of the weakness and deficiencies, to enable effective process management, to develop implementation plan to support change initiatives and to support process improvement using metrics. Originality/value - The product development assessment model is based upon a normativecontingent approach meaning that the prescriptive requirements are defined according to the logic of coherence: requirements vary in relation to contextual conditions. In particular, there are two important context factors which are considered to have a significant influence on NPD process: the complexity of the product-market interface and the enterprise's NPD strategic orientations.

J	Piercy, N				Piercy, Niall			Improving marketing-operations cross-functional relationships	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						operations; marketing; cross-functional	STRATEGIC VISION; MANAGEMENT; ORIENTATION; CONFLICT; SERVICE; ORGANIZATION; INTERFACE; CONSENSUS; SUCCESS; QUALITY	Collaboration between marketing and operational areas is critical to business success. Despite this, in practice most companies suffer hostile and adversarial relationships between these functions. Existing research has not sufficiently addressed methods for improving this situation outside of the large corporation or manufacturing sector. This paper seeks to address this shortcoming, investigating mechanisms to support better cross-functional relationships in the small-medium enterprise and in the service sector. Five case studies are presented of companies that displayed a-typically good relationships between marketing and operations groups. A cross-comparison is conducted to identify key themes and approaches that provide for and support good crossfunctional relationships. Three key methods are presented and proposed as sources of positive marketing-operations relationships: (1) manipulation of pay/reward mechanisms; (2) clear strategy and strategic leadership; and (3) an explicit focus on bringing people together.

At this private university hospital in Pakistan an elaborate information system exists. This study aimed to make best use of available data for better performance management. Applying the modified Delphi technique an expert panel of clinicians and hospital managers reduced a long list of indicators to a manageable size. Indicators from existing documents were evaluated for their importance, scientific soundness, appropriateness to hospital's strategic plan, feasibility and modifiability. Panel members individually rated each indicator on a scale of 1-9 for the above criteria. Median scores were assigned. Of an initial set of 50 indicators, 20 were finally selected to be assigned to the four BSC quadrants. These were financial (n = 4), customer or patient (n = 4), internal business or quality of care (n = 7) and innovation/learning or employee perspectives (n = 5). A need for stringent definitions, international benchmarking and standardized measurement methods was identified. BSC compels individual clinicians and managers to jointly work towards improving performance. This scorecard is now ready to be implemented by this hospital as a performance management tool for monitoring indicators, addressing measurement issues and enabling comparisons with hospitals in other settings Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Revere, L; Robinson, L				Revere, Lee; Robinson, Leroy, Jr.			How Healthcare Organizations Use the Internet to Market Quality Achievements	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SERVICE QUALITY; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS; STORE LOYALTY; INTENTIONS; RETAILER	The increasingly competitive environment is having a strong bearing on the strategic marketing practices of hospitals. The Internet is a fairly new marketing tool, and it has the potential to dramatically influence healthcare consumers. This exploratory study investigates how hospitals use the Internet as a tool to market the quality of their services. Significant evidence exists that customers use the Internet to find information about potential healthcare providers, including information concerning quality. Data were collected from a random sample of 45 U.S. hospitals from the American Hospital Association database. The data included hospital affiliation, number of staffed beds, accreditation status, Joint Commission quality awards, and number of competing hospitals. The Study's findings show that system-affiliated hospitals do not provide more, or less, quality information oil their websites than do non-system-affiliated hospitals. The findings suggest that the amount of quality information provided oil a hospital website is not dependent oil hospital size. Research provides evidence that hospitals with more Joint Commission awards promote their quality accomplishments more so than their counterparts that earned fewer Joint Commission awards. The findings also suggest that the more competitors in a marketplace the more likely a hospital is to promote its quality as a potential differential advantage. The study's findings indicate that a necessary element of any hospital's competitive strategy should be to include the marketing of its quality oil the organization's website.

J	Serra, FR; Ferreira, MP				Serra, Fernando; Ferreira, Manuel			Emerging determinants of firm performance A case study research examining the strategy pillars from a resource-based view	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Corporate strategy; Business performance; Leadership; Competitive advantage	USEFUL PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study advance four factors - strategy pillars - that help explain firms' success: leader and top management team; strategic focus; trust in the future; and resources support. Design/methodology/approach - These factors were identified in five case studies of well-known multinational corporations often referred to in the strategy literature and research. Findings - The paper proposes the four pillars from a resource-based view (RBV) as a departure point for the identification of strategic resources. Research limitations/implications - Limitations derive from case study methodology, such as difficulty of generalization. The paper helps clarify how to look at the resources and how the strategy pillars may embody the four characteristics VRIN. Practical implications - The role of the chief executive officer entrepreneur as a core strategic pillar. Social implications - To deepen understanding of strategic leadership succession, namely to avoid firms' decline once the founding father retires. Originality/value - The paper not only uses the RBV to help identify strategic resources and understand the major strategic pillars of competitive advantage, but it also contributes to the debate on where lies the source of competitive advantage.

J	Solberg, CA; Olsson, UH				Solberg, Carl Arthur; Olsson, Ulf H.			Management orientation and export performance: the case of Norwegian ICT companies	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Norway; Communication technologies; Companies; Exports; Customer relations; Management strategy	MARKET ORIENTATION; CUSTOMER; FIRMS; INNOVATION; INTERNATIONALIZATION; ANTECEDENTS; INDUSTRIAL; PRODUCTS; STRATEGY; WINNERS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contrast three management orientations relevant for exporters: export, technology and customer orientations. The general hypothesis is that all orientations covariate positively with export performance. However, an alternative hypothesis regarding customer relations is propounded (negative impact on performance). Design/methodology/approach - Regression-based techniques are used. Findings - The results support the hypotheses that export performance increases with export commitment. Technology orientation correlates positively with export performance. On the other hand, the much venerated customer orientation shows negative correlation with export performance. Originality/value - This paper argues that customer orientation may turn into what might be called customer obsession, without due attention to cost consequences and strategic orientation. Also, too much customer orientation may lead the firm away from its ability to innovate, leaving the company behind its competitors in the longer term. The interaction between customer and technology orientation gave no effect.

J	Sung, HW; Kincade, DH				Sung, Hee Won; Kincade, Doris H.			Typology of Korean Eco-sumers: Based on Clothing Disposal Behaviors	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Eco-sumer; Clothing disposal behavior; Green marketing; Environmental friendly product; Market segment		Green or an environmental consciousness has been a major issue for businesses and government offices, as well as consumers, worldwide. In response to this movement, the Korean government announced, in the early 2000s, the era of "Green Growth" as a way to encourage green-related business activities. The Korean fashion industry, in various levels of involvement, presents diverse eco-friendly products as a part of the green movement. These apparel products include organic products and recycled clothing. For these companies to be successful, they need information about who are the consumers who consider green issues (e.g., environmental sustainability) as Part of their personal values when making a decision for product purchase, use, and disposal. These consumers can be considered as eco-sumers. Previous studies have examined consumers' purchase intention for or with eco-friendly products. In addition, studies have examined influential factors used to identify the eco-sumers or green consumers. However, limited attention was paid to eco-sumers disposal or recycling behavior of clothes in comparison with their green product purchases. Clothing disposal behaviors are ways that consumer can get rid of unused clothing and in clue temporarily lending the item or permanently eliminating the item by "handing down" (e.g., giving it to a younger sibling), donating, exchanging, selling, or simply throwing it away. Accordingly, examining purchasing behaviors of eco-friendly fashion items in conjunction with clothing disposal behaviors should improve understanding of a consumer's clothing consumption behavior from the environmental perspective. The purpose of this exploratory study is to provide descriptive information about Korean eco-sumers who have ecologically-favorable lifestyles and behaviors when buying and disposing of clothes. The objectives of this study are to (a) categorize Koreans on the basis of clothing disposal behaviors; (b) investigate the differences in demographics, lifestyles, and clothing consumption values among segments; and (c) compare the purchase intention of eco-friendly fashion items and influential factors among segments. A self-administered questionnaire was developed based on previous studies. The questionnaire included 10 items of clothing disposal behavior, 22 items of LOHAS (Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability) characteristics, and 19 items of consumption values, measured by five-point Likert-type scales. In addition, the purchase intention of two eco-friendly fashion items and 11 attributes of each item were measured by seven-point Likertype scales. Two polyester fleece pullovers, made from fabric created from recycled bottles with the PET identification code, were selected from one Korean brand and one US imported brand among outdoor sportswear brands. A brief description of each product with a color picture was provided in the survey. Demographic variables (i.e., gender, age, marital status, education level, income, occupation) were also included. The data were collected through a professional web survey agency during May 2009. A total of 600 final usable questionnaires were analyzed. The age of respondents ranged from 20 to 49 years old with a mean age of 34 years. Fifty percent of the respondents were, males and about 58% were married, and 62% reported having earned university degrees. Principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to identify the underlying dimensions of the clothing disposal behavior scale, and three factors were generated (i.e., reselling behavior, donating behavior, non-recycling behavior) To categorize the respondents on the basis of clothing disposal behaviors, k-mean cluster analysis was used, and three segments were obtained. These consumer segments were labeled as 'Resale Group', 'Donation Group', and 'Non-Recycling Group.' The classification results indicated approximately 98 Percent of the original cases were correctly classified. With respect to demographic characteristics among the. three segments, significant differences were found in gender, marital status, occupation, and age. LOHAS characteristics were reduced into the following five factors: self-satisfaction, family orientation, health concem, environmental concem, and voluntary service. Significant differences were found in the LOHAS factors among the three clusters. Resale Group and Donation Group showed a similar predisposition to LOHAS issues while the Non-Re, cycling Group presented the lowest mean scores on the LOHAS factors compared to the other segments. The Resale and Donation Groups described themselves as enjoying or being satisfied with their lives and spending spare-time with family. In addition, these two groups cared about health and organic foods, and tried to conserve energy and resources. Principal components factor analysis generated clothing consumption values into the following three factors: personal values, social value, and practical value. The ANOVA test with the factors showed differences primarily between the Resale Group and the other two groups. The Resale Group was more concerned about personal value and social value than the other segments. In contrast, the Non-Recycling Group presented the higher level of social value than did Donation Group. In a comparison of the intention to purchase eco-friendly products, the Resale Group showed the highest mean score on intent to purchase Product A. on the other hand, the Donation Group presented the highest intention to purchase for Product B among segments. In addition, the mean scores indicated that the Korean product (product B) was more preferable for purchase than the U.S. product (Product A). Stepwise regression analysis was used to identify the influence of product attributes on the purchase intention of eco product. With respect to Product A, design, price and contribution to environmental preservation were significant to predict purchase intention for the Resale Group, while price and compatibility with my image factors were significant for the Donation Group. For the Non-Recycling Group, design, price compatibility with the factors of my image, participation to eco campaign, and contribution to environmental preservation were significant. Price appropriateness was significant for each of the three clusters. With respect to Product B, design, price and compatibility with my image factors were important, but different attributes were associated significantly with purchase intention for each of the three groups. The influence of LOHAS characteristics and clothing consumption values on intention to purchase Products A and B were also examined. The LOHAS factor of health concern and the personal value factor were significant in the relationships with the purchase intention; however, the explanatory powers were low in the three segments. Findings showed that each group as classified by clothing disposal behaviors showed differences in the attributes of a product, personal values, and the LOHAS characteristics that influenced their purchase intention of eco-friendly products. Findings would enable organizations to understand eco-friendly behavior and to design appropriate strategic decisions to appeal eco-sumers.

Predicting Structural Deterioration Condition of Individual Storm-Water Pipes Using Probabilistic Neural Networks and Multiple Logistic Regression Models	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								After several decades in service, the deterioration of storm-water pipe assets is inevitable. The deterioration of storm-water pipes is characterized by structural deterioration and hydraulic deterioration. Condition assessment using closed circuit television (CCTV) inspection is often carried out to assess the structural condition of pipes. However, the knowledge on the condition of storm-water pipe assets is still limited for strategic planning of maintenance and rehabilitation, because generally only a small sample is CCTV-inspected and in almost all cases, these pipes are inspected once only due to high costs. The challenge for researchers is to use the sample of CCTV-inspected pipes for developing mathematical models that can predict the structural condition of remaining pipes as well as the future condition of pipes. In this present study, the deterioration pattern of storm-water pipes is constructed on the basis that each pipe has its own deterioration rate due to its pipe factors. Based on this, two mathematical models using multiple logistic regression (MLR) and probabilistic neural networks (PNN) are developed for predicting the structural condition of individual pipes. The MLR model was calibrated using the maximum likelihood method and the PNN model was trained using a genetic algorithm (GA). The predictive performances of both models were compared using CCTV data collected for a local government authority in Melbourne, Australia. The results showed that the PNN model was more suited for modeling the structural deterioration of individual storm-water pipes than the MLR model. Furthermore, the use of GA improved the training results of the PNN model compared to the trial and error method.	[Perera, B. J.

J	Alpern, S; Katrantzi, I				Alpern, Steve; Katrantzi, Ioanna			Equilibria of two-sided matching games with common preferences	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						OR in biology; Game theory; Search theory	MUTUAL MATE CHOICE; RENDEZVOUS SEARCH; MARRIAGE	Problems of matching have long been studied in the operations research literature (assignment problem, secretary problem, stable marriage problem). All of these consider a centralized mechanism whereby a single decision maker chooses a complete matching which optimizes some criterion. This paper analyzes a more realistic scenario in which members of the two groups (buyers-sellers, employers-workers, males-females) randomly meet each other in pairs (interviews, dates) over time and form couples if there is mutual agreement to do so. We assume members of each group have common preferences over members of the other group. Generalizing an earlier model of Alpern and Reyniers [Alpern, S., Reyniers, D.J., 2005. Strategic mating with common preferences.J. Theor. Biol. 237,337-354], we assume that one group (called males) is r times larger than the other, r >= 1. Thus all females, but only 1/r of the males, end up matched. Unmatched males have negative utility -c. We analyze equilibria of this matching game, depending on the parameters rand c. In a region of(r, c) space with multiple equilibria, we compare these, and analyze their 'efficiency' in several respects. This analysis should prove useful for designers of matching mechanisms who have some control over the sex ratio (e.g. by capping numbers of males at a 'singles event' or by having 'ladies free' nights) or the nonmating cost c (e.g. tax benefits to married couples).

Image Effects and Rational Inattention in Internet-Based Selling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						Image effects; Internet-based selling; 9-ending prices; price points; rational inattention; strategic pricing; technology impact	PRICE-ENDINGS; ADVERTISED PRICES; EXTERNAL VALIDITY; 99-ENDING PRICES; ONLINE FEEDBACK; PRODUCTS; QUALITY; ODD; ENVIRONMENTS; INFORMATION	The frequency of occurrence of certain price points in Internet-based selling is investigated in order to determine what drives the observed regularities and variations. Theories based on consumer perceptions of price and quality images, and on rational inattention to price-endings are explored by specifying and testing empirical models for price-endings using more than 1.5 million daily observations on multiple product categories sold by 90 Internet-based retailers collected over a two-year period. The results show that a firm's on-line reputation and relative price levels affect the price-endings chosen in different product categories, and that 9-ending prices increase consumer purchases. These findings support an image theory of store quality and price. The use of 9-ending prices varies across Internet selling formats in a way consistent with differences in the rational attentiveness these channels engender in consumers. This research on the role of information technology in price-setting provides insights for marketers who wish to optimize price-setting decisions in the competitive environment of Internet retailing.

Modelling responses to nutritional, endocrine and genetic strategies to increase fertility in the UK dairy herd	VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						Fertility; Calving interval; Sustainability	IMPACT	The United Kingdom, as in most countries using intensive dairy management programmes, is facing serious challenges in terms of dairy cow fertility, as highlighted by a rapidly increasing calving interval (CI). A mechanistic, mathematical model is described that predicts the size of the future national dairy herd required to supply domestic requirements and its inherent sustainability in terms of production of replacement female numbers. The results from the model suggest that continuing! use of current management strategies may result in the national dairy herd being unsustainable due to increasing CI and reduced fertility in as few as 10 years. Adoption of nutritional, endocrine and genetic techniques that increase fertility can effectively and rapidly reverse this trend and reduce the required size of the national herd, thereby reducing methane emissions from dairy production.

J	Skanavis, C; Giannoulis, C				Skanavis, Constantina; Giannoulis, Christos			A training model for environmental educators and interpreters employed in Greek protected areas and ecotourism settings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY			English	Article						environmental educators' training; environmental interpretation; environmental education; non-formal environmental education; eco-tour guides; Greece		In Greece, environmental interpretation is in its infancy as an academic field. In particular, there are no nature guides or specific conservation objectives, and no professional training for non-formal environmental educators and/or interpreters. In view of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, this paper develops and recommends a training model for environmental educator/interpreter guides in protected areas and sensitive ecotourism settings in Greece. An investigation was undertaken into training programmes in developed and less developed ecotourism countries, where environmental interpretation is practiced in the sustainable management of sensitive areas. The proposed model is based mainly on interpretive training programmes of other developed and less developed countries. This model introduces the art of environmental interpretation as a form of non-formal environmental education, integrated in strategic communication in protected areas and sensitive ecotourism areas in Greece. The developed model takes into consideration the special social settings and biophysical environments of Greece. Moreover, a professional environmental interpreter group is recommended to support the role of management authorities in protected areas.

Productivity of Ephemeral Headwater Riparian Forests Impacted by Sedimentation in the Southeastern United States Coastal Plain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							FINE-ROOT DYNAMICS; CATION-EXCHANGE CAPACITY; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; SOIL COMPACTION; LEAF-AREA; WETLAND FORESTS; HARDWOOD FOREST; ORGANIC-MATTER; FLOODPLAIN	Riparian forests serve an essential function in improving water quality through the filtering of sediments and nutrients from surface runoff. However, little is known about the impact of sediment deposition on productivity of riparian forests. Sediment inputs may act as a subsidy to forest productivity by providing additional nutrients for plant uptake or may act as a stress by creating anoxic soil conditions. This study determined how sediment deposition affected riparian forests along ephemeral headwater streams at Ft. Benning, Georgia, USA. Above- and belowground productivity, leaf-area index (LAI), and standing crop biomass for fine roots, shrubs, and trees were compared along a gradient of present sedimentation rates in 17 riparian forests. Annual litterfall production was determined from monthly collections using 0.25- m(2) traps; woody biomass was determined from annual diameter at breast height (DBH) measurements using species-specific allometric equations; fine root productivity was determined using sequential coring; LAI was measured by expanding specific leaf area by annual litterfall production; and shrub biomass was determined using species-specific biomass equations based on height and root collar diameter. Significant declines in litterfall, woody biomass production, fine root production, LAI, and shrub biomass were found with as little as 0.1 to 0.4 cm yr(-2) sedimentation. We conclude that the levels of sedimentation in this study do not subsidize growth in ephemeral headwater riparian forests but instead create a stress similar to that found under flooded conditions.

J	Messina, DJ; Scotti, DJ; Driscoll, AE; Ganey, R; Zipp, GP				Messina, Daniel J.; Scotti, Dennis J.; Driscoll, Alfred E.; Ganey, Rodney; Zipp, Genevieve Pinto			The Relationship Between Patient Satisfaction and Inpatient Admissions Across Teaching and Nonteaching Hospitals	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CUSTOMER SATISFACTION	The need for healthcare executives to better understand the relationship between patient satisfaction and admission volume takes on greater importance in this age of rising patient expectations and declining reimbursement. Management of patient satisfaction has become a critical element in the day-to-day operations of healthcare organizations pursuing high performance. This study is guided by two principal research questions. First, what is the nature of the relationship between patient satisfaction (as measured by scored instruments) and inpatient admissions in acute care hospitals? Second, does the relationship between patient satisfaction (as measured by scored instruments) and inpatient admissions differ between teaching hospitals and nonteaching hospitals? Although not suggestive of direct causation, the study findings revealed a statistically significant and positive correlation between patient satisfaction and admission volume in teaching hospitals only. In contrast, a nonsignificant, negative correlation was seen between patient satisfaction and admission in nonteaching hospitals. In the combined teaching and nonteaching sample, a statistically significant, negative correlation was found between patient satisfaction scores and admission volume. With financial performance being driven in part by admission volume and with patient satisfaction affecting hospital patronage, the business case for a strategic focus on patient satisfaction in teaching hospitals is clearly evident. The article concludes with a set of recommendations for strengthening patient satisfaction and organizational performance.

J	Rocholl, J				Rocholl, Joerg			A friend in need is a friend indeed: Allocation and demand in IPO bookbuilding	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION			English	Article						Banking; IPO; Bookbuilding; Underwriting	INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS; STRATEGIC ALLOCATION; AUCTIONS; MARKETS	This paper uses proprietary data on European IPOs with detailed information on the demand at different points of time and allocation for institutional and retail investors. The nature of the data allows us to analyze the reason of why institutional investors as a group get more allocations of underpriced issues than retail investors. By explicitly examining institutional and retail demand for different kinds of stocks, we find that this is due to institutional investors' superior ability to detect underpriced stocks rather than the underwriter's preferential treatment. At the same time, the subset of domestic institutional investors supports the underwriter in issues with weak demand and receives in turn favorable allocations in underpriced issues. .

J	Bianchi, M; Chiesa, V; Frattini, F				Bianchi, Mattia; Chiesa, Vittorio; Frattini, Federico			Exploring the microfoundations of external technology commercialization A dynamic capabilities perspective	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Joint ventures; Companies; Information transfer; Group technology	KNOWLEDGE; INNOVATION; MARKET; PATENTS; ASSETS	Purpose - External technology commercialization (ETC) refers to the firm's transfer of technological assets, disembodied from products, to another organization involving a contractual obligation for compensation. The purpose of this paper is to identify the managerial and organizational antecedents that are capable of explaining superior capabilities in ETC. Design/methodology/approach - Starting from an in-depth analysis of the literature about technology commercialization and adopting the dynamic capabilities strategic perspective, the study develops a theoretical framework that shows how a number of concepts (resources, capabilities and microfoundations) may affect performance in ETC. A case study analysis is conducted with illustrative purposes. Findings - The paper shows that adequate management and organization of ETC activities are needed to successfully undertake ETC. Combining evidence from a case study and findings from prior studies, research propositions are developed regarding key process, organizational and human resource mechanisms that lie at the heart of superior capabilities in ETC. Practical implications - The paper provides technology and innovation managers with a number of suggestions for organizing and managing ETC that are likely to improve performance. Originality/value - Owing to the complexity of ETC related activities and the high transaction costs characterizing the markets for technologies, only few companies are reaping the gains from the commercialization of their technologies while the majority fail to realize their potential. This paper is the first attempt, to the best knowledge of the authors, which adopts the dynamic capabilities perspective to unearth the managerial levers driving superior performance in ETC.

J	Chasserio, S; Legault, MJ				Chasserio, Stephanie; Legault, Marie-Josee			Strategic human resources management is irrelevant when it comes to highly skilled professionals in the Canadian new economy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						business-to-business (B2B) technology services companies; highly skilled professionals; informal management; new economy; organizational commitment; strategic HRM theory	MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT; EMPLOYEE COMMITMENT; WORK; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; WOMEN; HRM	The goal of this paper is to explain the commitment behaviour of highly skilled professionals in Canadian business-to-business (B2B) technology services companies that do not have a formal and explicit managerial commitment strategy and to emphasize the need to take the organizational context into consideration when developing a theory that seeks to account for differences in employee's organizational commitment. Our contribution is to reappraise the relevance of the traditional organizational commitment definition in this organizational context, a new organizational form. We demonstrate that in the companies which are different from the traditional bureaucratic organizational forms and which employ highly qualified professionals, the employment relationship is based on a psychological contract that is not accounted for in the strategic HRM theory. Indeed, the basic principles of strategic HRM dictate that an organization's most valuable asset is its employees; it is therefore incumbent on management to do whatever is necessary to retain its workforce, readily described as a key resource, and to use human resources management (HRM) practices as tools to elicit commitment. In a study of highly skilled workers in Canadian business-to-business (B2B) technology services companies belonging to the so-called 'new economy', we observed that although the competitive advantage enjoyed by these companies depends to a large degree on the creativity and innovativeness of their workforce, these companies barely have any official HRM policies, and the HR department plays a very unobtrusive role. Yet, no one could say that the employees in these firms are not committed - on the contrary! This situation has several implications in terms of career for these professionals, in terms of HR practices for the employers. Nevertheless, until now, existing theoretical models of organizational commitment have shown little interest in highly skilled workers in general and even less in new economy professionals.

J	Chau, VS				Chau, Vinh Sum			Benchmarking service quality in UK electricity distribution networks	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Electricity industry; Benchmarking; Customer services quality; Performance management; United Kingdom	INCENTIVE REGULATION; UNITED-KINGDOM; POLICY; MANAGEMENT; DEPLOYMENT; OWNERSHIP; FIRM	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the evolution and development of customer service performance measures in the electricity sector since privatization in 1989, and then examine the impact of a specific recent energy regulatory requirement (known as information and incentives project (IIP)) on the organizational management of an exemplar electricity distribution company. Also discussed is how the sector has tried to learn from benchmarks from a number of such literary disciplines as economics, marketing service quality, and total quality management. Design/methodology/approach - The research first presents a survey of the historical development of performance standards based on archival documentation. It is then augmented by the employment of a longitudinal "tracer study", involving the isolation and firsthand real time qualitative observations of a company's key strategic and operational activities, to understand how they related to the other organizational phenomena at large. This process spanned an investigative period of two years. Findings - The paper finds that much of the early standards used in electricity immediately after the sector's privatization rested much on those in the water and gas safety sectors, which themselves were then admittedly inadequate in UK. The IIP, a complementary set of service quality standards, worked on these early problems, but the implementation of the new scheme proved problematic and warranted major organizational reengineering, as shown in the exemplar company, ElectriCo. IIP has impacted on organizational management mostly in the areas of: higher-level strategic change, causing noticeable internal confusion during strategic transitions, building a performance management system, improvements in performance data, and establishing more effective ways for management. Research limitations/implications - While the case example used in the research is a regional monopoly and is a good representation of the context in which the service standards operate, the findings are limited to the one company. It is a UK specific context without international comparison. Originality/value - The research has combined archival research with an innovative firsthand methodological approach (tracer studies). Its value is in how the story of service standards in electricity (and specifically distribution) has been augmented from the early customer service standards to the most recent IIP considerations. It also looks from within the company, which has been missing in longstanding research in the more traditional disciplines such as economics.

J	Fornes, G; Cardoza, G				Fornes, Gaston; Cardoza, Guillermo			Foreign exchange exposure in emerging markets A study of Spanish companies in Latin America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS			English	Article						Emerging markets; Foreign exchange; Latin America; Multinational companies; Spain	RISK; FIRM; DETERMINANTS; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMIES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at the impact that unanticipated changes in the exchange rate, specifically the currency crises that took place in Latin America between 1998 and 2004, had on the value of Spanish companies operating in this region. It also studies the strategies, decisions, measures and initiatives that these firms made to improve the effectiveness of their hedging activities. Building upon previous studies in industrialised countries, the study applies a broader perspective as it takes a cross-functional approach by including finance, strategic planning, marketing and operations management in the analysis. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses qualitative and quantitative analyses to reach its conclusions. The quantitative study involves a time series regression to calculate a foreign exchange exposure (FOREX) coefficient. The qualitative analysis uses a systematic approach to develop categories from the data gathered in the interviews. Finally, the conclusions from both analyses were summarised and combined. The data was collected from interviews containing structured and open-ended questions with senior managers and directors of the largest Spanish investors in Latin America. Findings - The research results suggest that foreign companies exposed to exchange risks in emerging markets gain resilience when they take a cross-functional approach for the assessment and implementation of hedging strategies along with the decentralisation to subsidiaries of the decisions and implementation of hedging initiatives. This helps companies in: elaborating scenarios, assessing the possible impact of exchange rate variations, designing pre-emptive measures and setting alternative strategies to mitigate potential impacts. This cross-functional approach to managing risks in emerging markets seems to offer companies higher flexibility and new knowledge that can be shared among subsidiaries working in similar economic and political environments. Originality/value - The results from this empirical study build upon previous works on FOREX and offer companies an alternative approach to minimise its impacts when operating in emerging markets.

Sliding Under the Radar: Passing and Power Among Sexual Minorities	JOURNAL OF LGBT ISSUES IN COUNSELING			English	Article						stigma management; identity management; homo-negativity; heteronormative; sexual minorities; queer; intentional passing; unintentional passing		This study investigated the role of intentional and unintentional passing in the lives of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and queer individuals. Qualitative data were collected through a series of nine focus groups and analyzed using grounded theory. Passing as straight allowed participants to maintain or achieve the privileges afforded to the dominant group, but not without costs. This experience was affected by individual factors, which impacted one's social distance from the hegemony, as well as contextual factors, such as perceiver characteristics and environment. In general, passing was seen as both a signifier of oppression and a strategic appropriation of power.

J	Iturrioz, C; Aragon, C; Narbaiza, L; Ibanez, A				Iturrioz, Cristina; Aragon, Cristina; Narbaiza, Lorea; Ibanez, Asuncion			Social responsibility in SMEs: a source of business value	SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Competitive strategy; Strategic alignment		Purpose - The aim of this paper is to analyse some of the main elements that affect the social responsibility (SR) business value generation in the small and medium firms (SMEs) context. In the SMEs, basically three elements are related with the business value of a SR approach: the top management SR orientation, the SR focus on the business critical issues and the SR alignment with the business strategy. Design/methodology/approach - In order to achieve this objective, different valid and reliable SR measurement scales are developed and an ad hoc survey is answered by a sample of 245 SMEs out of a population of 1,317 SMEs, a representative sample with a 5.76 per cent error. Findings - This paper concludes that SR can be a source of value for the business and that the business value generated by an SR approach is associated with certain conditions: the firm must believe in SR behaviour further than a mere economic and legal perspective; the SR activities must be focused on the critical issues that heavily conditions business competitiveness and, finally, the SR must be embedded in the firm's business strategy. Originality/value - The empirical evidence obtained would not only support theoretical development about SR and SMEs, but it is also relevant to practice. The study of how SR must be developed in order to generate value for the firm helps SMEs to engage more effectively in SR and generates incentives for the stable, coherent and long-term development of this kind of activity.

J	Johnston, K				Johnston, Kevin			Extending the marketing myopia concept to promote strategic agility	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						marketing myopia; strategic renewal; capabilities; systems; cognition		This paper proposes that many firms suffer from 'self-concept specificity'. This is an unconsciously self-imposed restriction on creative strategy formulation that is the result of a highly bounded concept of a firm held by its senior management. Recognising that this concept resonates with Levitt's seminal Marketing Myopia concept, the paper draws on Resource-based View and Network Organisations literature to add two further dimensions, Capability Myopia and Boundary Myopia respectively. The paper then explores insights that systems thinking and organisational learning literature may provide to help firms to escape the paradox of adaptation in which conflicting imperatives drive both specialisation and variety. Such insights may allow strategic managers to be made more aware of their current organisational selfconcept and its constraints, to challenge its assumptions and to reframe it, so generating more innovative strategic options.

J	Johnston, R; Staughton, R				Johnston, Robert; Staughton, Roy			Establishing and developing strategic relationships - the role for operations managers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supply chain management; Strategic alliances; Strategic management; Operations management	SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS; IMPACT; PERSPECTIVE; ALLIANCES; CONTRACT; SUCCESS; TRUST	Purpose - The objectives of this paper are, first to identify, from the literature, the key themes in the management of strategic relationships, second to apply those themes to understand how exemplary organisations establish and develop strategic relationships and third to determine the role of operations managers in this process. Design/methodology/approach - This empirically based research comprised four phases; interviews with managers to identify exemplars, interviews with managers from 27 organisations, data analysis and testing of the findings. Findings - From a theoretical point of view, a revised definition of strategic relationships has been proposed. Many previously disparate elements of relationships have been brought together into seven dimensions of strategic relationships. The scope and nature of exemplary relationships have been captured within each of these dimensions identifying 24 elements, and suggested the key roles for operations managers in establishing and developing their strategic business relationships. Research limitations/implications - This research has responded to the call to help operations managers understand the skill sets required to help them establish and develop strategic business relationships. It has contributed to the growing literature on business relationships and also provided practical guidance for operations managers. The research has a number of inherent weaknesses including the interpretative nature of the analysis and that the interviews were only carried out with one party to the exemplary relationships. The focus of the research was limited to exemplary strategic relationships and the study was conducted in one sector, though a range of types of organisations were involved. Practical implications - From a practitioner perspective, the outputs from the research have been summarised into a number of guidelines which flesh out the role for operations managers looking to identify, establish, evaluate or strengthen their role in establishing and developing strategic business relationships. Originality/value - The paper provides an original and detailed perspective into the nature of strategic business relationships, irrespective of their position in the supply chain, and identifies how such relationships can be established and developed.

J	Lefaix-Durand, A; Kozak, R				Lefaix-Durand, Aurelia; Kozak, Robert			Integrating transactional and relational exchange into the study of Exchange Orientation in customer relationships	JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Interfirm exchange; Customer relationships; Transaction marketing; Relationship marketing; Hybrid marketing practices; Exchange orientation	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; TRUST; COMMITMENT; NETWORKS; IMPACT; POWER; ANTECEDENTS; GOVERNANCE; STRATEGIES; MARKETS	The purpose of this paper is to propose a new conceptual and operational tool, exchange orientation (EO), which favours a better understanding of the coexistence of transactional and relational exchanges in contemporary marketing. First, the literature was reviewed across business management fields to identify the constructs that play a central role in interfirm exchange. The concept of EO was then developed and characterised according to levels of trust, cooperation, commitment, communication, time orientation, interdependence, proximity, coordination, regulation, and structure of exchange. A multiple case study was finally used to empirically investigate EO in 58 customers relationships from the perspective of three wood products manufacturers. This study of EO is a first step in eliciting "hybrid" marketing practices within the same business context. It also points to the need for the strategic management of customer relationships based on the actual and desired value and orientation of exchange.

J	Malshe, A				Malshe, Avinash			Strategic sales organizations: transformation challenges and facilitators within the sales-marketing interface	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						sales-marketing interface; qualitative; transformation; challenges; facilitators		As business firms embrace the emerging strategic sales organizations, they need to be mindful of the intra-organizational factors that may facilitate or challenge this transformation and its related strategic imperatives. Using depth-interview data collected from 38 sales and marketing executives, this study highlights the similarities and differences in sales and marketing personnel's perceptions about the role they and their counterparts may play in the strategic process. Drawing on these insights, it then brings forth the 'role-related' and 'process-related' factors that may facilitate and challenge strategic imperatives associated with the new sales paradigm. This paper thus highlights the nuances of the role expectations within the sales-marketing interface, and its impact on strategic imperatives that may determine the firm's movement toward a strategic customer management philosophy.

Specifically, it explores the extent of strategic management accounting (SMA) information elements usage among Malaysia's E&E companies. The results indicate that E&E companies use SMA information elements extensively. The results imply that companies are extending their management accounting information towards more externally focused and strategic material. This finding enriches our current knowledge about the extent of SMA information usage among organisations. It also supports the findings of several previous researches which suggested that companies operating in today's environment emphasise beyond traditional management accounting information.

J	Petersen, H; Vredenburg, H				Petersen, Henry; Vredenburg, Harrie			Corporate governance, social responsibility and capital markets: exploring the institutional investor mental model	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Capital markets		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of corporate governance, social issues and capital markets by distinguishing between the socially responsible investing phenomenon and mainstream investing with respect to social issues. It attempts to clarify the domain by casting it in the theoretical frame of prospect theory and mental modeling. With a qualitative study done among large institutional investors in the Canadian securities industry, the article derives a proposed mental model of these institutional investors' cognitive model of social issues as they impact investments. Findings - The institutional investors in this study know exactly where value is derived from social investments suggesting that there may be more alignment between directors, investors and societal expectations than has been previously suggested. Research limitations/implications - The limited number of organizations in the study reduces the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - Managers and directors must have an understanding of how shareholder value and responsibilities intersect. In our research, we have found that these executives positioned their firms as leaders on the social responsibility front. Interestingly, their major shareholders also understood how responsibility and shareholder value intersected and as a result, financial performance was not sacrificed. Originality/value - The findings fromthis research shed light on previous scholars' questions regarding the alignment of interests between managers, directors and social expectations. The firms analyzed make strategic investments that are considered to meet social expectations but that are also perceived to add value to the organization making the firm more attractive to institutional investors.

J	Reichel, A; Brandl, J; Mayrhofer, W				Reichel, Astrid; Brandl, Julia; Mayrhofer, Wolfgang			Departmental status in light of a growing proportion of female staff: the case of human resource management	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						HRM; human resource management; status; strategic integration; gender; education; experience	GENDER EGALITARIANISM; WOMENS SUFFRAGE; INTEGRATION; SEX; STRATIFICATION; ORGANIZATIONS; SEGREGATION; PERSONNEL; RIGHTS	Human Resource Management (HRM) has a history of striving for acceptance and legitimacy in relation to top and line management. The identification of factors influencing HRM status, therefore, is very important for the field. One of these relevant factors is gender. Oil the occupational level, there is evidence from various occupations that all increase in the proportion of women is associated with a status loss in these occupations. Besides one stream of literature that states that gender is an omni-relevant and -present category, there are also other approaches which hold that the category of gender has lost its relevance, and functional attributes are the dominant categories in the workplace today. Using a multilevel model of 1508 companies located in 17 countries, this study analyses the impact of gender composition and functional attributes on the organisational status of the HR department. It reveals that while gender still has a significant influence on status, education and experience are more important.

J	Ugarriza, JE				Ugarriza, Juan E.			Ideologies and conflict in the post-Cold War	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Ideologies (Philosophy); Conflict; National cultures; War; Congo; Afghanistan; Colombia		Purpose - The aim of this article is to apply a re-worked definition of ideology in order to account for cultural and political dimensions of contemporary armed conflicts. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyzes communiques, press releases, magazines, pamphlets, speeches, inter-views and other communicational media produced by insurgent organizations in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Colombia, particularly in the post-Cold War, in order to assess the characteristics of their ideological platforms. The extensive use of these primary sources aims at revealing the way the organizations see themselves, and how important ideological warfare is in their overall strategy. Findings - In the post-Cold War, and even in the early twenty-first century, armed guerrillas persisted in linking their armed struggle to ideological platforms, though in more flexible versions. Nationalism, fundamentalism and socialism are functional to their tactics and strategies, and have tangible effects at strategic and tactical levels. Research limitations/implications - Three sample cases have been revised exhaustively, but that methodology impedes the examination of a wider spectrum of post-Cold War insurgent organizations, which may balance the results here presented. However, the high relevance of the ideological component in contemporary armed conflicts, as shown in the Afghan, Congolese and Colombian cases, demonstrates the need for further academic works on this topic. Practical implications - Re-defining ideology, as the paper proposes, turns it into a powerful conceptual toot to be used in academic research, given that precisely the absence of comprehensive Categories of analysis has prevented scholars from providing a full picture of the political and cultural dimensions of contemporary armed conflicts. Originality/value - As economic-focused researches on armed conflicts have dominated the field since the 1990s, the paper underlines the need for scholars to approach a broader scope in peace studies.

J	Vecchi, A; Brennan, L				Vecchi, Alessandra; Brennan, Louis			Quality management: a cross-cultural perspective	CROSS CULTURAL MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Quality management; Culture; Strategic manufacturing; Cross-cultural studies	PERFORMANCE	Purpose - The aim of this paper is to present the results of a survey administered across 23 countries that examines quality priorities, practices and performance by adopting Hofstede's national cultural framework. The purpose of this study is to test the validity of the "culture-specific" argument as an explanatory construct for explaining quality management. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in 2006 as part of the IV iteration of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey. The methodology involved the use of a self-administered questionnaire to director/head of operations/manufacturing in best practice firms within the sector of firms classified by ISIC codes (rev.3.1) Divisions 28-35. Findings - From the findings it emerges that whereas differences in priorities can be affected by masculinity and uncertainty avoidance to a very small degree, all the four dimensions of culture significantly affect quality practice and three of the four dimensions affect performance to a greater extent. Practical implications - The paper contributes to the validation of the "culture-specific" hypothesis in relation to quality management by addressing its managerial implications. In particular it calls for a fuller appreciation of cultural dimensions which will in turn help firms to better align their quality practices towards the attainment of improved quality performance. Originality/value - Whereas the traditional literature on quality practices in its attempt to explain existing differences across countries addresses the issue of convergence or divergence of quality practices across countries, this paper analyses similarities and differences by comparing quality priorities, practices and performance across Hofstede's four cultural dimensions The paper also proposes an original interpretative framework where variations in both quality practices and performance can be explained by some identifiable mechanisms either of "better fit" or "compensation".

J	Webster, DE; Young, DJ				Webster, Duane E.; Young, DeEtta Jones			Our Collective Wisdom: Succession Planning and the ARL Research Library Leadership Fellows Program	JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						association; fellows; leadership development; research libraries; succession planning		Academic and research libraries are joining together to identify and better prepare the next generation of library directors. The Research Library Leadership Fellows (RLLF) Program takes a new approach to succession planning by engaging a select group of sponsoring libraries, approximately 20 emergent leaders, and the membership of the Association Research Libraries working collaboratively over a 2-year period. This approach assumes a well-developed set of management and leadership skills on the part of the fellow. The program focuses instead on deepening the fellow's understanding of core strategic challenges facing senior library leaders in a wide variety of campus settings. The RLLF embraces 3 5-day, on-campus institutes, 1-2 site visits to sponsoring libraries, and participation in the semiannual Association of Research Libraries (ARL) membership meetings. The program also provides network-building among the fellows, Web-based sessions on key issues, and access to ARL member-library directors as colleagues and potential mentors. To date, more than 60 librarians from ARL member libraries have participated in the program. This article describes the context for the development of the program, its operation, the experiences of the first 3 cohorts, and suggestions for the future of succession planning in research libraries.

J	Wood, A				Wood, Andrew			CAPACITY RATIONALIZATION AND EXIT STRATEGIES	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						capacity rationalization; barriers to exit; prospect theory; mergers and acquisitions	DECLINING INDUSTRIES; BRICK INDUSTRY; DECISION; STEEL	A case study of the response to chronic excess capacity in a small competitive industry (the manufacturing of clay bricks) permits a generalization of Bower's concentration hypothesis. Barriers to exit produced a free rider problem where only smaller and lower quality brick plants were shut when the efficient solution demanded major closures. The exit logjam was resolved by the strategic actions of growth-maximizing managers. They used major acquisitions as the basis for substantial reductions in firm and industry capacity while growing their own market share. The fall in industry capacity enabled other firms to follow suit while maintaining their market share as predicted by prospect theory. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

J	Yu, SM; Liow, KH				Yu, Shi Ming; Liow, Kim Hiang			Do retail firms benefit from real estate ownership?	JOURNAL OF PROPERTY RESEARCH			English	Article						corporate real estate; listed retail firms; incremental stock market performance; diversification; wealth management		In this study, we investigate the role of real estate as a contributor to retailers' corporate wealth. Employing a sample of 556 retail firms and data from 2001-2006, we first estimate and compare five popular stock market performance measures: median return, total risk, systematic risk, Sharpe Index and Jensen abnormal performance return index for the 'composite' and 'business' retail firms across three geographical regions and nine retail segments. Then we investigate if there is a statistically significant linear relationship between the relative property levels and incremental stock market performance measures. Overall, the results indicate that, although higher levels of real estate ownership are associated with better stock market performance, these incremental positive performance benefits are subject to diminishing return to scale. As retail firms do generally hold some form of real estate, these findings are significant for their strategic investment decisions.

J	Zierdt, GL				Zierdt, Ginger			Responsibility-centred budgeting: an emerging trend in higher education budget reform	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						budget; responsibility-centred budgeting		Higher education institutions in the United States are entering a new era in budgeting. Therefore, institutions are actively engaging in dialogues about the budgeting tools that will most effectively assist them in achieving institutional goals and objectives within their strategic plans and being accountable for the use of scarce resources, as allocated by State appropriations and/or received through student tuition fees. This paper introduces commonly used budgeting tools for higher education institutions and provides an expanded overview of one specific budgeting tool, responsibility-centred budgeting (RCB). Two public institutions that have adopted the RCB model are compared, and there is an overview of the development of the 'Allocation Framework' utilised by the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system.

J	Noble, G; Cantrell, J; Kyriazis, E; Algie, J				Noble, Gary; Cantrell, John; Kyriazis, Elias; Algie, Jennifer			Motivations and forms of corporate giving behaviour: insights from Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NONPROFIT AND VOLUNTARY SECTOR MARKETING			English	Article							PHILANTHROPY; MOTIVES	Although corporate support for many nonprofit organisations (NPOs) represents only a relatively small component of their overall income its importance is growing. As a consequence, the need to understand corporate giving behaviour in a way that supports the development of strategically targeted and successful marketing campaigns is of growing importance to marketing managers in many NPOs around the globe. This paper presents the findings of a study into the 'why' and 'how' of corporate giving behaviour in Australia. In the seven case studies examined, there was no strong evidence that Australian corporations give for other than strategic profit maximisation or political reasons. In contrast to the literature, altruistic and managerial utility did not emerge as strong motivational factors. This study also found that corporations are likely to have a number of corporate giving programmes each with its own underlying motivation and strategic purpose which network together to form a hierarchy of corporate giving programmes. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this research for NPO managers attempting to increase their level of corporate support. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Different factors like strategic location of the country along the central and eastern Himalaya, topographical and the climatic variations have given rise to diverse and unique assemblages of flora and fauna. Equally diverse are the people (59 ethnic groups), who have been interacting with these resources from the very beginning to adapt in the difficult Himalayan landscape. The knowledge as related to use, management and conservation of the animal resources, acquired during this long course of interaction, is transmitted orally from one generation to the next without being documented anywhere. The knowledge if harnessed properly could prove to be a valuable asset, which could be integrated into the modern development projects for fruitful results. But there is growing trend of depletion of biodiversity as well as cultural diversity in the country. Therefore, it is urgent to initiate organized scientific study and document such valuable and time tested ethnozoological knowledge before these culturally rich people and important faunal resources disappear.

J	Dalziel, M				Dalziel, Margaret			The seller's perspective on acquisition success: Empirical evidence from the communications equipment industry	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Acquisitions; Entrepreneurship; Serial entrepreneurship; Communications equipment; Innovation	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FIRMS; CAPABILITIES; KNOWLEDGE; EMBEDDEDNESS; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; INNOVATION; NETWORKS; MERGERS	This paper considers acquisition success from the seller's perspective and uses the seller's acquisition success criteria as an indication of their interpretation of the acquisition event. The argument is that sellers who use strategic and social criteria to appraise acquisition success interpret acquisitions as partnerships, while sellers who use financial criteria to appraise success interpret acquisitions as sales. Based on interview and survey data on the seller's perspective on acquisition success for 33 acquisitions in the communications equipment industry, we find that sellers use strategic and social criteria to appraise acquisition success and conclude that sellers interpret acquisitions as partnerships.

J	Metcalfe, M				Metcalfe, Mike			Pragmatic inquiry	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						pragmatism; problem solving; soft operational research; system of inquiry	SYSTEM; COMMUNITIES; SOFT	Inquiry into how people might act to solve a problem, which involves powerful communities of stakeholders, cannot be undertaken using only the principles of scientific inquiry. Science is useful for inquiry into physical activity but less so for inquiry into designing appropriate social systems such as a strategic plan or the appropriate solution to a social conflict. This paper argues that complex problem solving needs to draw on a set of pragmatic principles, which it explains. Pragmatism is an epistemology intended to deal with alternative interpretations of the same physical reality. It is increasingly coming back into the attention of soft operational researchers. After briefly explaining which thread of pragmatism is being drawn upon, this paper identifies five interrelated principles for undertaking a pragmatic inquiry. To explain these interrelations, the principles are designed into a linked system of pragmatic inquiry which is applied in a small case study.

J	Al-Shammari, M				Al-Shammari, Minwir			Toward a Knowledge Management Strategic Framework in the Arab Region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						knowledge management; knowledge management strategy; knowledge sharing culture; organizational learning		This article seeks to develop a framework for a Knowledge Management (KM) strategy in an emerging economy, viz. the Arab region, and to propose a framework for a successful KM strategy in such a sociocultural context. To achieve the objectives of the study, a conceptual KM strategy framework was proposed and described; it was then illustrated using a case study. The paper adopts a case study approach as a powerful source of understanding the KM specificities. Twelve interviews with executives of a telecommunications company were conducted and then systemically analyzed. Based on the findings of the study, a profile of KM in an Arab country is developed as well as a holistic and integrative KM strategy framework. The final framework concludes with a proposed a three-layer KM framework. The first layer includes KM drivers (market liberalization, technological advancements, and customers' preferences); the second, KM processes (knowledge strategizing, sourcing, composing, sharing, and using); whereas the third includes KM enablers (KM buying behavior, convergence of business and technology, source-data quality, project championship, process-based structure, and sharing culture). However, the proposed framework requires further testing through additional case study analyses to be able to capture the best practice of KM in this important region.

J	Azar, OH; Tobol, Y				Azar, Ofer H.; Tobol, Yossi			Tipping as a strategic investment in service quality: An optimal-control analysis of repeated interactions in the service industry	SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL			English	Article							SOCIAL NORM; TIP; ECONOMICS; FAIRNESS; BEHAVIOR; SERVERS	We present an optimal-control model in which tipping behavior creates a reputation that affects future service. Tipping and reputation can evolve in four path prototypes: converging to an interior equilibrium, converging to minimum tips and reputation, and two prototypes that start differently but end with tips and reputation increasing indefinitely. Analyzing the interior equilibrium indicates that when reputation erodes more quickly (capturing lower patronage frequency), equilibrium reputation is lower. Interestingly, however, tips may be higher. Increasing the minimal tip raises tips by the same increase and does not change reputation. A more patient customer leaves higher tips and reaches a higher reputation.

J	Christiansen, LC; Higgs, M				Christiansen, Liza Castro; Higgs, Malcolm			How the alignment of business strategy and HR strategy can impact performance A practical insight for managers	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper explores how the alignment of HR strategy and business strategy relates to organisational performance. It addresses the core question, "Does the alignment of business strategy and HR strategy impact performance?". Using Miles and Snow's theories of strategic typologies (defender, prospector and analyser) (Miles and Snow, 1978), strategic HR systems (Miles and Snow, 1984a) corresponding to these strategic types and dynamics of fit (tight fit, minimal fit and misfit) (Miles and Snow, 1994), the results of the current study found that organisational performance is best explained by the tight alignment and the minimal alignment of HR strategy and business strategy. One noteworthy result of the study is the viability of using a combination strategy where dimensions from two or more "pure" strategies in a typology can be combined and effectively implemented. Managers are recommended to develop a clear, internally consistent strategy for the firm, but at the same time, they should consider combining elements of different strategies to the extent that the firm's array of strategic resources permits them to do so.

J	Kim, YJ; Song, J; Koo, C				Kim, Yong Jin; Song, Jaeki; Koo, Chulmo			Exploring the effect of strategic positioning on firm performance in the e-business context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-business; strategy; strategic positioning; cluster analysis	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; INTANGIBLE RESOURCES; FIT INDEXES; E-COMMERCE; ORIENTATION; ENVIRONMENTS; CAPABILITIES; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK	This study investigates what strategic positions exist in the e-business context and how strategic positioning affects firm performance. The current study draws on the concept of fit between environmental factors and organizational factors. We collected survey data from both pure online and click-and-mortar companies and tested the model using 133 firm reports. Cluster analysis was performed to analyze survey data and to find groups of companies that pursue similar strategic positioning. The findings of the current study lend support to the hypothesis of distinctive grouping based on environmental factors and resources. The findings also support the hypothesis that strategic positioning influences firm performance. The major implication of this study is that innovative differentiation strategies together with technological resources strongly affect firm performance in the e-business context, a context where there is considerable turbulence in technological development.

Formulation of a strategy for the application of Duddingtonia flagrans to control caprine parasitic gastroenteritis	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY			English	Article							FREE-LIVING STAGES; NEMATODE PARASITES; NEMATOPHAGOUS FUNGI; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; SHEEP	Experiments on the influence of egg density and varying quantities of chlamydospores on the nematode-trapping ability of Duddingtonia flagrans, influence of D. flagrans on the larval translation of gastrointestinal nematodes, doses of chlamydospores required for the effective control of gastrointestinal nematodosis and the epidemiology of nematode parasites were conducted in goats, which generated baseline data required for strategic application of the biocontrol agent. The nematode-trapping ability of D. flagrans, measured by numerical enumeration of infective third-stage larvae developed in the faecal culture, revealed that the efficacy is dependent on both nematode egg and chlamydospore density. Pasture plot studies revealed that D. flagrans, if deposited at the same time as nematode eggs, prevents translation of third-stage larvae of caprine nematodes from the faecal pats onto the grass blades. Feeding of 1 X 10(6) chlamydospores per kg body weight and above to goats virtually eliminated larvae from the pasture. Application of as few as 1 X 10(4) and 1 X 10(5) chlamydospores per kg body weight had a profound impact on larval recovery. The effect persisted as long as the chlamydospores were fed. Monthly faecal worm egg counts of adult goats maintained under a semi-intensive management system on the Chhattisgarh plain and pasture larval burden revealed that June to August were the months of high risk for nematodosis. Haemonchus was the dominant species recorded throughout the year. The present data can best be utilized by formulating a strategic control measure when the larval challenge to the animal is maximum (June to August), so as to prevent establishment of patent infection. The observations reinforced the strategy to be adopted for nematode parasite control in goats by applying the biocontrol option at the onset of the monsoon.	[Sanyal, P. K.; Sarkar, A. K.; Patel, N.

We compare the impact of two types of change in TMTs - in member number and demographic heterogeneity - on subsequent strategic reorientation using data on the diversification activities of firms in the Japanese textile industry. Our findings suggest that executive succession does not trigger strategic change unless succession entails change in the values and interests of executives embedded in their demographic traits.

J	Hull, RB; Ashton, S				Hull, R. Bruce; Ashton, Sarah			Forest cooperatives revisited	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY			English	Article						sustainability; fragmentation; value-added; vertical integration; community economic development	MANAGEMENT; OWNERS; FUTURE	Forestry cooperatives provide strategies for reaching increasingly diverse and numerous forest landowners with forest management advice and profitable management services. Forestry cooperatives currently thrive in at least 17 countries. We use a case study method to compare four US-based entities, each using a different strategy that involves cooperation beyond the traditional landowner-harvester-processor-marketer chain of custody. Keys to successful co-ops include maximizing forest owner control and flexibility, emphasizing amenity and environmental qualities over short-term profits, cautiously integrating harvesting processing and marketing functions, accessing capital from public grants and private investors, and having good management skills and a sophisticated resource inventory system. Public forestry agencies, private forestry consultants, and forest scientists can support cooperative forestry ventures by implementing a few strategic initiatives discussed in the conclusion.

J.; Tinnila, Markku			Mapping the structural properties of production process and product mix	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						production capability; productability; operations strategy; manufacturing operations; product-process matrix; alignment of product and process choices; assessment tool	GENERIC MANUFACTURING STRATEGIES; PROCESS MATRIX; TECHNOLOGY; MODEL; LINK	The description and classification of production capabilities, referring to the kind of product mix that can be produced in a given type of facility, is a fundamental task in analyzing production strategy and economics. In practice, however, the concepts of product structure and process structure have been hard to operationalize since there are no generally applied measurement scales or indices to capture the degree of standardization or customization of products, for instance, or to characterize the configuration and type of control of a production line. The objective here is to provide a systematic approach for analyzing production capabilities, or productabilities for short, by mapping the structural properties of production process and product mix with a set of quantitative indicators acknowledging the different levels of reference (actual operations, existing or planned resources, and strategic intentions) as well as the disciplinary perspectives of marketing and manufacturing management. The new mapping method is illustrated in the context of the product-process matrix by Hayes and Wheelwright which links the two dimensions of productability and their alignment to the performance-oriented measures of production capabilities, such as productivity of plants or profitability of products. The use of the mapping method is demonstrated with some illustrative numerical examples of productability analysis and a case study of an individual firm. Further development and testing of data collection in the context of industrial surveys and statistical studies are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	van den Berghe, L; Guild, PD				van den Berghe, Larry; Guild, Paul D.			The strategic value of new university technology and its impact on exclusivity of licensing transactions: An empirical study	JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER			English	Article						strategic value; technology transfer; university technology; licensing; exclusivity; core competence	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; CORE COMPETENCES; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS; DETERMINANTS; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE	Commercialization of new university technology within the new product development process is an important tool by which established firms can expand their innovative capabilities. The strategic importance of the university technology to the firm, however, can vary considerably. An exclusivity agreement is a useful tool to protect the firm's investment and help ensure that value is appropriated through the commercialization process. An empirical study of 66 technology transfer projects in the information and communications technology industry reveals that licensing transactions are usually secured by some form of exclusivity agreements when the product innovation enabled by the new university technology is new-to-the-firm or new-to-the-market and the firm's perception of the strategic value of the new technologies is high.

Crop simulation models as tools for agro-advisories for weather and disease effects on production	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Agrometeorology and Food Security	FEB 18-21, 2008	CRIDA, Hyderabad, INDIA		CRIDA	Crop models; weather; disease; groundnut; maize; soybean	AFLATOXIN CONTAMINATION; WATER; DROUGHT; AVAILABILITY; LIMITATIONS; PNUTGRO; PEANUT; YIELD	Seasonal and daily variations in weather are major determinants of cropping practices, crop yield, diseases, and crop quality. Crop simulation models have capabilities to predict crop growth response to weather, soils, crop management, and genetic factors. We hypothesize that crop growth models can be used as strategic planning tools with historical weather to improve production or as in-season agro-advisories to advise oil weather-induced production problems, and disease management. The DSSAT V4.0 crop models wet e simulated for soybean and maize for 28 years at Patancheru, and for groundnut for 32 years at Anantapur, to hypothesize optimum sowing date, irrigation requirement, cultivar (soybean) and N requirement (maize). Optimum sowing for these crops was generally as soon as monsoon rains allowed. Across all sowing dates, the optimum soybean cultivar was Maturity Group 8 and yield was increased 1500 kg/ha with, irrigation. Maize yield increased up to 150 kg N/ha, producing 5800 kg/ha under early sowing. Irrigated maize yield was increased with later sowing dates, but irrigation requirement was high. Optimum sowing window for groundnut at Anantapur was 15 July to 15 Aug and yield was clearly water-limited. Concepts for linking dynamic disease simulation models to the CROPGRO model for predicting consequences of leafspot disease on groundnut production were discussed.	[Boote, K. J.; Jones, J.

AUTOMATED RETRIEVAL OF PROJECT THREE-DIMENSIONAL CAD OBJECTS IN RANGE POINT CLOUDS TO SUPPORT AUTOMATED DIMENSIONAL QA/QC	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Three-Dimensional Data; Laser Scanner; CAD Model; Automated Object Retrieval; Dimensional Quality Control		In construction, dimensional quality is critical but is very difficult to achieve, especially with built-in-place elements. As a result, dimensional Quality Assessment/Quality Control (QA/QC) must systematically be conducted, which often delays the value-adding work. Current methods for dimensional QA/QC are labor intensive, time consuming and therefore expensive. Comprehensive dimensional QA/QC approaches are thus often discarded for strategic ones, which may provide misleading dimensional QA/QC results, and result in future rework or failures. In the research presented here, the authors take advantage of new technologies available to the Architectural Engineering Construction & Facility Management industry-3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) engines, 3D positioning technologies and 3D laser scanners - to develop a method for automated retrieval of 3D CAD model objects in 3D laser scanner range images. This approach for automated CAD object retrieval allows for the automated and accurate segmentation of the as-built cloud corresponding to each project 3D CAD object, and it is robust with respect to occlusions. The quality of the output data is such that it is possible to use it to perform automated defect detection for dimensional QA/QC. In this paper, the authors first present the developed approach and demonstrate its efficiency through a simple experiment. Then, the authors discuss in more detail how the retrieval output data can be used to support automated dimensional QA/QC.

Design/methodology/approach - The information was obtained through structured interviews with a range of winery owners and managers in the four main wine regions of Western Australia. Findings - Whilst a set of universal management skills are identified by the industry participants, these are not universally held. The study examines skills and training issues highlighting the diversity of winery owners and managers. Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted using qualitative methodology in one state of Australia only. Practical implications - The findings require further quantitative testing, but strongly imply that managerial skills in the wine industry are limited, and most managers are more focused on technical expertise than financial, strategic, marketing or HR planning and management. Originality/value - The paper has benefit for the wine industry showing the strengths and weaknesses of its managers, and also for theorists who seek to understand management processes in a specific sector predominantly comprising small and medium sized enterprises.

Intra-functional conflict: an investigation of antecedent factors in marketing functions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						conflict; conflict management; conflict resolution	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; RELATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY; ORGANIZATIONAL-STRUCTURE; DECISION-MAKING; RISK-TAKING; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; IMPACT; FIELD; POWER	Purpose - The objective of this paper is to contribute empirical evaluation of the factors, behaviours; and processes that lead to intra-functional conflict, and in so doing to contribute to theory building on these issues, which have important contemporary relevance for theorists and practitioners. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 1,000 firms was conducted to elucidate the associations between both functional and dysfunctional intra-functional conflict and a number of intra- and extra-organisational variables. Findings - Evidence was found indicating that participative decision making (positively), heterogeneity and centrality of marketing (both negatively) are linked to functional intra-departmental conflict, while leadership quality of senior staff, team spirit and risk-taking proclivity are positively associated with functional intradepartmental conflict and negatively with dysfunctional intra-departmental conflict. No support was found for the claims that departmentalisation and Organisation size were associated with either form of conflict. Research limitations/implications - The study supplies an empirical contribution through conceptualising, and subsequently empirically verifying, a model of the antecedents of intra-functional conflict. Empirical contributions stem from findings that, while some parallels exist between the antecedents of intra-functional and inter-functional conflict, differences are evident, and in some cases even orthogonal. This study further reinforces suggestions that marketers have over-emphasised the negative dimensions of conflict and have overlooked the positive (that is, the functional) aspects of conflict. Practical implications - The findings of the study also have numerous implications for practitioners. At a strategic level, the study suggests that executives should acknowledge in their change processes that decisions at an organisational level could have a profound effect on both the functional and dysfunctional conflict in their organisation. Further, given the significant effect of inter-group dynamics, managers of functions may find it beneficial to manipulate a range of intra-functional variables to enhance functional conflict. Originality/value - The value of the current study centres on the conceptual and empirical contributions regarding the drivers of intra-functional conflict.

J	Hedge, JW				Hedge, Jerry			Strategic Human Resource Management and the Older Worker	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH			English	Article						Aging workforce; managing older workers; human resources	AGE	The aging workforce presents organizations with numerous challenges that will become more pronounced over the next several decades. As organizations grapple with this aging workforce, a strategic human resource management challenge will be to offer new and attractive opportunities that capture the desire of older workers to continue to contribute to organizational life in significant ways. This article examines some of the strategies that organizations might use to create structures, policies, and procedures that cultivate an environment supportive of older workers' performance, work attitudes and motivation, and physical and psychological well-being.

J	Hyder, AS; Abraha, D				Hyder, Akmal S.; Abraha, Desalegn			Institutional factors and strategic alliances in eastern and central Europe	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic alliances; Market economy; Organizational analysis; Government policy; Eastern Europe	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; PARTNER SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; SUBSIDIARIES; PERSPECTIVES; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMIES; KNOWLEDGE; ADOPTION	Purpose - The study deals with institutional factors that have impact on the operation of east-west alliances. Applying Kostova and Roth's terminology of institutional and relational contexts, this paper aims to address how alliance relationship based on resources, learning and performance organizes and functions, and how institutional factors influence the alliance relationship. Design/methodology/approach - To properly highlight the role of institutional factors, eastern and central Europe (ECE) is divided into four categories, namely fast adapters, high and low medium adapters and slow adapters. A total of 20 alliances operating in different country categories have been selected for the study. In all alliances, foreign partners are Swedish firms and engaged in the manufacturing industry, Semi-structured interviews containing both a fixed set of questions and a set of open-ended questions have been used for data collection. Findings - The impact of institutional factors on firms in slow-adapting countries was uniformly high, the initiatives taken were usually fruitless and ineffective. In the case of medium-adapters, the impact was largely mitigated over time as alliances passed through the different stages. The least impact was, as expected, observed among the alliances in fast-adapting countries. However, the result needs to be taken with some caution as the data include alliances where partners come from a single western country. Practical implications - For direct investment, managers need to take the institutional factors seriously as ECE countries undergo a transition period and the economical situations of these countries shows a wide variation. For example, if need of return is quick, the managers should invest in a fast-adapting country or in a medium-adapting country but not at all in a slow-adapting country. Originality/value - This paper makes a unique contribution by focusing institutional factors which affect strategic alliances in ECE. One future study can concern cultural impact on business environment and new business development in ECE. Another interesting area of research could deal with medium-adapting countries because the members of this group show different level of adaptation and performance.

The relationship between the cost of housing and affordability on the one hand, and interest rates, GDP and average incomes on the other was not proven to exist using the given statistical methods. The period of increase in the cost of housing in Lithuania over the last five years is exceptional and difficult to explain using fundamental economic factors and their fluctuation trends alone. The cost of housing has made a clear departure from the economic (business) cycle; the economy has grown, however at a much slower rate than rising costs in the housing market. The reasons for this situation are record lows in interest rates, good conditions to gain financing, the liberalisation of financial markets, speculative attitudes in expectation of the introduction of the Euro, and a divide between the supply and demand of housing that is available. It should be noted that the evaluation of the influence of these factors on fluctuations in costs in the housing market is more hypothetical in nature.

J	Lam, TYM				Lam, Terence			Optimisation of performance management for housing services	JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance management; Housing; Property management; Hong Kong; England		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how performance management control should be optimised for housing management services, through two different organisational contexts in the social housing sector. Design/methodology/approach - Case study methodology was used to examine the performance management control of one typical local authority in England where housing management services are run by a non-profit-making Arm's Length Management Organisation, and of another major housing organisation, the Hong Kong Housing Authority, where the services are contracted out to profit-making consultants. Findings - In a non-profit-making organisational context, housing management services should be measured by performance indicators related to the strategic objective of providing efficient and effective services. Benchmarking should be conducted to supplement performance control. In a profit-making organisational context, market competition should also be introduced so that more tendering opportunities are given to the best performers to optimise the performance of service providers. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this research are based on two cases representing the social housing sectors in England and Hong Kong. The research forms a conceptual baseline on which further research can be built to find out effective control to optimise the performance of property management services in many other housing and facilities management organisations. Practical implications - Performance management of housing management services can be optimised by benchmarking and market competition. Originality/value - This study contributes to performance management of housing management services by conducting empirical confirmatory testing of the validity of performance management theory.

J	Van Velsor, E; Ascalon, E				Van Velsor, Ellen; Ascalon, Evelina			The role and impact of leadership development in supporting ethical action in organisations	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Business ethics; Leadership; Leadership development; Social interaction		Purpose - This paper aims to argues that effective and well- designed leadership development can help successful managers stay on the right path, in terms of ethical behaviour. In addition to reviewing key research findings on the factors that lead to success and derailment in European organisations, the paper discusses key aspects and outcomes of well- designed leadership development initiatives and how those relate to the ethical issues and problems posed as "successful" managers move into more senior levels with the attendant demands and pressures. Design/methodology/approach - The paper involves a qualitative analysis of data on learning and goals set and achieved as part of an international leadership development programme held in Europe. Also included is a summary of previously published research on European success and derailment factors, to provide context for the programme data. Findings - What managers report learning in a leadership development programme, and the goals they set and achieve, are very much in line with theory on avoiding ethical failure in leadership roles. Leadership development supports ethical action by providing participants with opportunities for rich and comprehensive feedback, enhancement of self-awareness, time to reflect on personal and professional relationships, and improved understanding of the nature of strategic processes. Research limitations/implications - It was not possible to track actual ethical/unethical behaviour before or after the programme, a significant direction for future research. Practical implications - Well-designed leadership development may play a more important role than previously thought in supporting ethical action. Originality/value - Ethical violations are often committed by people who have a history of good behaviour, but who are generally not well prepared to face complex issues and the increased power and privilege of the upper ranks. There is little known about the relationship between leadership development and ethical action, and this paper presents results that are provocative of what further research along these lines may produce.

Strategic pathways for the sustainable management of water treatment plant residuals	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article						residuals; filter backwash water; clarifier solids; sustainable development	FILTER BACKWASH RECYCLE; TREATMENT WORKS SLUDGE; REMOVAL	In North America, the rapid movement away from the direct discharge of water treatment plant (WTP) residual streams to receiving environments has resulted in considerable benefits to the drinking water industry in terms of enhancing environmental stewardship practices and supporting source water protection strategies. Over the past 20ayears, application based research on appropriate technologies to treat residual streams such as filter backwash water (FBWW) has promoted the development of integrated process design that presents recycling as a viable residual management option. However, as utilities continue to develop and expand their main process lines to comply with more stringent government regulations encompassing both water quality and residual disposal practices, the development of sustainable residual management practices is expected to become a more prominent issue for this industry. The purpose of this paper is to present, from a critical point of view, the matrix of issues that currently exist regarding WTP residual streams and strategic pathways that would enhance future decision making processes for achieving long-term residual management solutions for the drinking water industry.

The issues such research addresses are important, but do not fully describe routinization processes or account for all the characteristics that generate them. Based on a study of an innovative course, we explore organizational factors that affect the diminished routinization of innovations, the loss of core components of the innovation while it is being routinized.

J	Loertscher, S				Loertscher, Simon			Horizontally differentiated market makers	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article							FULTON-FISH-MARKET; BERTRAND COMPETITION; 2-SIDED MARKETS; MIDDLEMEN; OUTCOMES; PRICE	I analyze a model of competition between two market makers who are located at the opposite ends of the Hotelling line, both of which are also occupied by a search market. Buyers and sellers are uniformly distributed between the two market places, yet can only trade at one of them. In equilibrium, market makers net a positive profit and trade with buyers and sellers close to them, while buyers and sellers further away participate in search markets. Interestingly, a duopolistic market maker nets a larger profit than a monopoly because search markets make the quantities market makers trade strategic complements.

J	Pasanen, M				Pasanen, Mika			SME GROWTH STRATEGIES: ORGANIC OR NON-ORGANIC?	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING CULTURE			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL GROWTH; VENTURE PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY STRUCTURE; MANAGEMENT; SUCCESS; ENVIRONMENT; REVOLUTION; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; FAILURE	This paper focuses on factors affecting the growth and performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The aim was to identify strategic factors differentiating two types of growth firms, organic growth SMEs and acquisition growth SMEs. The comparison was based on the empirical data of 20 acquisition growth SMEs and 90 organic growth SMEs. The analysis revealed strategic differences, with important implications, between the two groups. The most noteworthy differences were related to their scale of operation, firm age, founders, and product and customer structures. The results increase our understanding of the factors affecting SME growth and performance in two different contexts of growth strategies. They suggest that firm growth pattern is associated with SME characteristics, and thus has managerial implications.

J	Kang, SM				Kang, Soong Moon			Equicentrality and network centralization: A micro-macro linkage	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						equicentrality; network centralization; degree centrality; micro-macro linkage	STRUCTURAL BALANCE; SOCIAL NETWORKS; DENSITY; MODELS	This paper investigates a linkage between micro- and macrostructures as an intrinsic property of social networks. In particular, it examines the linkage between equicentrality [Kang, S.M., 2007. A note on measures of similarity based on centrality. Social Networks 29, 137-142] as a conceptualization of a microstructural process (i.e., the likelihood of social actors to be connected with similarly central others) and network centralization as a macrostructural construct, and shows that they have a negative linear association. In other words, when actors are connected with similarly central alters (i.e., high equicentrality), the overall network centralization is low. Conversely, when highly central actors are connected with low-centrality actors (i.e., low equicentrality), the overall network centralization is high. The relationship between degree equicentrality and degree centralization is more significant in observed networks, especially those evolving over time, as compared to random networks. An application of this property is given by venture capital co-investment networks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Andresen, M; Lichtenberger, B				Andresen, Maike; Lichtenberger, Bianka			The corporate university landscape in Germany	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING			English	Article						Corporate universities; Learning methods; Germany; United States of America		Purpose - The paper seeks first to present an overview of the corporate university landscape in Germany contrasting it with the US-American corporate university market and, second, to outline the development in Germany during the last 15 years and to have a look at future trends such as learning alliances. Design/methodology/approach - The comparison in the paper is based on empirical data of the largest corporate universities in the USA and Germany gathered by interviews with the heads of the institutions and by evaluations of data such as homepages, brochures, and presentations by the companies. In addition, reference is made to surveys and case studies published by other researchers. Findings - The paper works out major differences between Germany and the USA regarding the educational level, target groups, strategic directions, partnerships, alliances with external vendors, accreditation, focus on internal versus external job market, and organisation that can be led back to the stronger strategic orientation of German corporate universities. It presents the business model of a learning alliance as a potential solution to the major challenges German corporate universities are facing. Research limitations/implications - Research data being based on interviews and corporate data risk being biased due to marketing purposes. Future research should include internal observations and evaluations. Practical implications - The paper gives an example for a learning alliance in practice that could be of relevance for a larger number of institutions. Originality/value - The comparative study helps to understand the US-American and German corporate university markets as well as their specificities and investigates future developments.

J	Charlebois, S; Camp, RD				Charlebois, Sylvain; Camp, Ronald D., II			Environmental uncertainty and vertical integration in a small business network The case of Natural Valley Farms Inc.	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES OF GLOBAL ECONOMY			English	Article						Bovine spongiform encephalopathy; Uncertainty management; Vertical marketing; Animal husbandry; Canada; Entrepreneurship		Purpose - The paper intends to identify and explain key managerial principles for vertical integration in the cattle industry during a key period of environment uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach - Following Yin's advice on using case studies for exploratory theory development, this study builds on existing theories of vertical integration through a case study that explores potential prospects for cattle producers in a uniquely uncertain environment and the execution of a higher degree of vertical integration in a mature market. Findings - The creation of NVF is a result of a well-groomed uncertainty management scheme designed to attain a higher degree of vertical integration within an enterprising community. Some key managerial principles have been identified that can be applied to a thriving vertical integration endeavour in the cattle industry. History has proven that such an undertaking is taxing. Nevertheless, by looking at NVF's business model, it can be seen that environmental uncertainty can facilitate vertical integration projects in the cattle industry, given the right community-oriented doctrine. Research limitations/implications - This case study does not include cases where cattle producers were not so successful. Practical implications - It provides advice for managing vertical integration by networks of small business owners in the cattle industry. The BSE crisis seems to have triggered efforts to decrease dependency, especially by outside stakeholders. NVF focused its members on building a business model and long-term objectives beyond the specific uncertainties created by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), such as whether the border reopened or stayed permanently closed to foreign markets. Domestic consumers were their core marketing priority at the outset. In addition, future plans were set in motion to create a strategy to seek other foreign markets, including the EU. Originality/value - The casestudy presented in this paper provides an example of vertical integration as a strategic response to market uncertainty enhanced by a political and economic crisis in a rural community. This paper also outlines key events of the Canadian BSE crisis, the Canadian beef industry and surrounding communities, and the relevance of past research on environmental uncertainty and vertical integration in explaining why vertical integration has been strategically unnatural to cattle producers but occurred in this situation.

J	Cousins, KC; Robey, D; Zigurs, I				Cousins, Karlene C.; Robey, Daniel; Zigurs, Ilze			Managing strategic contradictions in hybrid teams	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						virtual teams; hybrid teams; dualities		It has become a common practice to organize work teams to include members in multiple geographic locations. In contrast to co-located teams and purely virtual teams, these 'hybrid' teams combine face-to-face communication with computer-mediated interaction. In this paper, we report a qualitative study of management practices in three hybrid teams in one organization. We adopt the theoretical approach of strategic contradiction, in which apparently contradictory pairs of elements can be managed by attending to their possible synergies or clarifying their distinctions so as to make balanced trade-offs over time. Our data reveal four sets of paradoxical frames in hybrid teams: remoteness-closeness, cultural uniformity-cultural diversity, rationality-emotionality, and control-empowerment. In referencing these paradoxical frames, teams engaged in three cognitive processes: (a) integrating to produce synergies between opposing tensions, (b) differentiating to clarify distinctions between opposing tensions and to balance trade-offs over time, and (c) polarizing to remove tensions between opposing elements by using one element to reduce the effects of another. Both integrating and differentiating processes were found to be instrumental to sustaining contradictions as interdependent dualities, whereas polarizing processes were found to preserve contradictions as dualisms. Our findings advance the understanding of managing strategic contradictions by showing how managers influence cognitive processes that paradoxically emphasize remoteness and closeness, cultural uniformity and cultural diversity, rationality and emotionality, and control and empowerment.

J	Ezingeard, JN; McFadzean, E; Birchall, D				Ezingeard, Jean-Noel; McFadzean, Elspeth; Birchall, David			Mastering the art of corroboration A conceptual analysis of information assurance and corporate strategy alignment	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information control; Strategic alignment; Corporate strategy; Data security	BUSINESS; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; FIT; PERFORMANCE; PERSPECTIVE; SECURITY; SUCCESS; ISSUES	Purpose - The paper seeks to investigate how the information assurance (IA) efforts of organisations should be aligned with their business strategy. From this analysis, a conceptual model of alignment is presented. This framework shows several organisational factors that can influence alignment. Design/methodology/approach - A number of published works on alignment are discussed in order to develop a conceptual model of IA fit. In addition, Venkatraman's six perspectives of alignment are used as a framework to suggest future research in this area. Findings - The paper presents a definition of information assurance and proposes various reasons why IA is a strategic issue and should be aligned with both IT and corporate strategy. From the literature, a conceptual model illustrating the variables that can influence alignment is presented. Research limitations/implications - A clear conceptualisation of alignment is needed. Six potential research models and associated research questions are proposed. Practical implications - The paper concludes with a number of management and research implications. In looking at the implications for managers, it is argued that any alignment framework should include adequate metrics for checking the strategic fit on a continuous basis. Originality/value - This paper is an initial attempt to fulfil an identified gap in the literature, namely the lack of research undertaken on IA and corporate strategy alignment. It offers practical help for management so that they can improve the fit between IA and business strategy. It also offers several avenues of potential future research using Venkatraman's six perspectives of fit.

J	Ford, EW; Hughes, JA				Ford, Eric W.; Hughes, Julia A.			A collaborative product commerce approach to value-based health plan purchasing	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						health services; supply chain management; patients; safety; strategic alliances		Purpose - Collaborative product commerce (CPC) techniques are being applied with greater frequency in the health care sector. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential barriers to their success in influencing cost and quality. Design/methodology/approach - The health care supply chain (SC) is analyzed and five national health initiatives attempting to apply CPC techniques are described. Findings - Five national-level programs designed to improve health care quality and control costs use a variety of CPC techniques to create incentives and/or disincentives to influence suppliers' behavior. Six barriers to success are identified that threaten healthcare CPC initiatives. They include: widespread resistance to change; information system limitations; the Health insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the required time investment; lack of commitment to CPC principles; and the sustainability of the CPC business model. Research implications/limitations - Investigation into the barriers to success is warranted to develop evidence-based solutions to improve effectiveness of CPC approaches in health care. Practical implications - No national health care initiative to date can be described as an unqualified success in terms of its ability to align the SC. Nevertheless, individually, and to some extent collectively, the aforementioned programs are making some headway. Originality/value - This work is one of the first to present information on how collective CPC efforts are taking shape in health care and to describe key national-level projects currently underway in the field.

Quality management implementation across different scenarios of competitive structure: an empirical investigation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						competitive forces; environment; decision-making; quality management	ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT; STRATEGIC CHANGE; PERFORMANCE; TQM; IMPROVEMENT; ADVANTAGE; ISO-9000; IMPACT	This study aims to determine if there are differences in quality management (QM) implementation across competitive environments and if so, how and why they differ. With these objectives, we develop several propositions relating the competitive environment to QM implementation practices. To test our propositions, we gathered a sample of 273 European managers. We presented 16 different factors of competitive structure to members of the sample and elicited their likelihood of implementing different QM practices. The research findings indicated that high buyer and customer power were associated with a preference for cost reducing-oriented QM practices. We also found that the managers are more likely to try to boost profitability by focusing on QM practices aimed at differentiation when intensity of competitive rivalry or threat of new entrants is high. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications of our results.

J	Karandikar, H; Nidamarthi, S				Karandikar, Harshavardhan; Nidamarthi, Srinivas			Implementing a platform strategy for a systems business via standardization	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Strategic management; Standardization; Automotive industry		\Purpose - The benefits of a platform strategy in volume product businesses are well established. Such a strategy can also pay dividends in a low-volume systems or projects business. The benefits include increased engineering efficiency, higher solution reliability and reduced direct costs. The purpose of this paper is to describe the mechanism for the implementation of such a platform strategy via a design standardization initiative and discuss the technical challenges involved. The paper describes the case of the automotive powertrain assembly line business. Design/methodology/approach - For the past three years, the authors were an integral part of the engineering teams at four systems businesses, automotive suppliers with a global footprint, driving the process of standardization and engineering platform development. The concepts presented in the paper were developed and validated during the course of this effort. Findings - Implementation of an engineering platform can succeed via a design and work process standardization initiative embedded in a strong business context. The problems involved - technical, organizational, and cultural - must be dealt with simultaneously and comprehensively. Practical implications - The practical steps that need to be taken and the comprehensive approach required to implement platform concepts in a systems/projects business are highlighted. Originality/value - There is considerable literature on the planning and design of product platforms. However, there is less discussion of how to implement these platforms in practice considering the organizational constraints and legacy products. Further, there is even less published literature on platform development for complex systems treated as products.

J	Kunnanatt, JT				Kunnanatt, James Thomas			Impact of ISO 9000 on organizational climate - Strategic change management experience of an Indian organization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER			English	Article						ISO 9000 series; strategic management; organizational culture; change management; organizational processes; India	QUALITY MANAGEMENT; WORK-ENVIRONMENT; PERCEPTIONS	Purpose - ISO 9000 yields visible and concrete benefits to organizations in the form of sustained product quality, enhanced market image, increased customer satisfaction, and long-term profitability. However, the derivative impact of ISO 9000 on the human side of the organization, especially its impact on the internal human environment, has been only scantily researched. The purpose of this study is to explore how the process of ISO 9000 implementation transforms the components of organizational climate, particularly the climate motives existing in an organization. Design/methodology/approach - ISO 9000 system was deemed as the independent variable that could induce changes in organizational climate, the dependent variable. Climate was measured both before and after the implementation of ISO 9000, using Pareek's MAO-C instrument. Based on the scores obtained for the constituent climate motives, the patterns of organizational climate that prevailed in an organization both before and after ISO implementation were deciphered. Findings - Results reveal that as a result of ISO 9000 implementation the dysfunctional organizational climate motives such as control, dependency, and affiliation undergo a u-turn transformation giving way to the functional and conducive climate motives such as achievement, expert influence, and extension. Originality/value - The study endeavors to throw light on the favorable impact that ISO 9000 may have on organizational climate of organizations. The findings tend to prognosticate that when implemented well the ISO 9000 system could function not just as a quality enhancement instrument but in addition as a useful tool for strategic change management that could truly hold the potential for transforming both the character and performance of organizations.

J	Kutvonen, L; Ruokolainen, T; Metso, J				Kutvonen, Lea; Ruokolainen, Toni; Metso, Janne			Interoperability Middleware for Federated Business Services in Web-Pilarcos	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						federated architecture; interoperability; middleware; service-oriented architecture; virtual organisation management		Participation in electronic business networks has become necessary for the success of enterprises. The strategic business needs for participating in multiple networks simultaneously and for managing changes in these networks are reflected as new requirements for the supporting computing facilities. The Web-Pilarcos architecture addresses the needs of managed collaboration and interoperability of autonomous business services in an inter-organisational context. The Web-Pilarcos B2B middleware is designed for lowering the cost of collaboration establishment and to facilitate management and maintenance of electronic business networks. The approach is a federated one: All business services are developed independently and the B2B middleware services are used to ensure that technical, semantic and pragmatic interoperability is maintained in the business network. In the architecture and middleware functionality design, attention has been given to the dynamic aspects and evolution of the network. This article discusses the concepts provided for application and business network creators and the supporting middleware-level knowledge repositories for interoperability support.

Markov chain Monte Carlo exact inference for social networks	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						adjacency matrices; exact conditional test; Markov chain Monte Carlo; metropolis-Hastings algorithm; reciprocity; triad census	DISTRIBUTIONS	The uniformly most powerful unbiased test of reciprocity compares the observed number of mutual relations to its exact conditional distribution. Metropolis-Hastings algorithms have been proposed for generating from this distribution in order to perform Monte Carlo exact inference. Triad census statistics are often used to test for the presence of network group structure. We show how one of the proposed Metropolis-Hastings algorithms can be modified to generate from the conditional distribution of the triad census given the indegrees, the out-degrees and the number of mutual dyads. We compare the results of this algorithm with those obtained by using various approximations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nordlund, C				Nordlund, Carl			Identifying regular blocks in valued networks: A heuristic applied to the St. Marks carbon flow data, and international trade in cereal products	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						network analysis; regular blockmodels; valued networks; regular blocks	EQUIVALENCE	While the concept of regular equivalence is equally applicable to dichotomous as well as valued networks, the identification of regular blocks in regular blockmodels is somewhat problematic when dealing with valued networks. Applying the standard procedure for identifying ties in such blockmodels, a procedure perhaps most suited for dichotomous networks, does tend to generate block images and reduced graphs that differ from intuitive notions of such structures. This paper outlines a formal heuristic procedure for identifying regular ties in valued networks where the "significance" of ties is related to each actor's role sets. Combined with measures for block criteria fulfillment, the procedure yields reduced graphs, which seem more sensitive to patterns, rather than strengths, of ties. Two data sets are used as examples in this paper: the St. Marks carbon flow web dataset, and a new dataset containing international trade flows of cereals and cereal products based on Comtrade data.

J	Sundgren, M; Styhre, A				Sundgren, Mats; Styhre, Alexander			Creativity and the fallacy of misplaced concreteness in new drug development A Whiteheadian perspective	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pharmaceuticals industry; Innovation	INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONS; ENVIRONMENT; PHILOSOPHY; MODEL	Purpose - A dominating view in the literature of organizational creativity is to treat the creativity as an ex post facto construct rather than a process that may be subject to systematic and thoughtful managerial practices. Drawing on Alfred North Whitehead's writing, the paper seeks to examine how creativity is conceptualized in the pharmaceutical industry. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a series of interviews with managers and scientists in three pharmaceutical companies. Findings - Although researchers and managers designate the role of organizational creativity as the most important strategic capability of the firm, there is almost no communication about it. The respondents point out a gap between understanding and action in the innovation process, i. e. what precedes it in new drug development. This gap is clearly illustrated - creativity is what makes the difference for the companies - but hardly anyone talks about it. Practical implications - From a management perspective this paper concludes that organizational creativity in new drug development can become a more actionable concept by capturing images and narratives relevant to the organizational reality. Originality/value - In contrast to the dominated individualistic centered view of creativity, this paper argues that creativity does not occur at a single point in time but is rather the outcome from a series of interconnected events and undertakings. A process-based view of creativity can thus escape the misplaced concreteness that the mythology of creativity postulates. Whitehead's process philosophy may form a fruitful foundation from which organizational creativity can be understood and exploited.

J	Teng, BS				Teng, Bing-Sheng			Managing intellectual property in R&D alliances	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Intellectual Property (IP); R&D alliance; opportunistic learning; patents; trade secrets	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; COOPERATION; PROTECTION; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; TRUST; SLACK	This paper deals with the management of Intellectual Property (IP) in R&D alliances, with a focus on two key IP types - patents and trade secrets. Since IP is both inputs to and outputs of R&D alliances, the key is to simultaneously achieve two objectives - IP protection and IP generation. As research inputs, IP could be devalued by partners' opportunistic learning. Thus, IP needs to be carefully selected and protected through mechanisms such as equity arrangement, non-disclosure and non-compete agreements, and monitoring and auditing. Meanwhile, the performance of R&D alliances is mostly measured by their IP outputs. Partner firms face new issues, such as IP classification and ownership. They must decide whether to patent or keep their R&D outputs confidential.

J	Wu, HL				Wu, Hsueh-Liang			Exploring the sources of privatization-induced performance changes	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						privatization; performance measures; Taiwan	OPERATING PERFORMANCE; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; PUBLIC-ENTERPRISE; FIRMS; STATE; OWNERSHIP; PRIVATISATION; EFFICIENCY; INTENSITY; LESSONS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the variance of post-privatization performance outcomes by three institutional arrangements taken place in the process of ownership transfer in Taiwan. Design/rnethodology/approach - The logistic regression models were used for the study to link the likelihood of performance improvements after privatization with a set of explanatory variables. Findings - The findings from the research suggest an indispensable role of supportive policy measures, including market openness, post-privatization involvement of government and corporate reforms prior to privatization, in the performance effects of privatization. Research limitations/implications - Both the sample size and time frame available for a quantitative analysis are constrained by the progress of Taiwan's privatization. A questionnaire survey, as part of a more integrated model, is suggested to follow this study and probe into organizational or strategic changes after privatization. Practical implications - The study shows that performance improvement of privatized firms cannot be taken for granted merely by ownership change; instead, the performance gains of privatization could be realized only in concert with other institutional arrangements, including market openness, the modest and short-term bureaucratic control after privatization, and corporate health prior to privatization. Originality/value - The study aims to add to the body of literature by identifying sources of performance changes in privatized firms, based on Taiwan's experience in privatization. Taiwan represents an interesting example of a country in the process of catching up in terms of economic development, as well as one whose institutional environment stands between western and transition countries. As such, the use of Taiwan's data may lead to an assessment of the generalizability of conclusions drawn from prior research conducted in both kinds of countries.

J	Awazu, Y				Awazu, Yukika			Managing technology alliances: The case for knowledge management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technology alliances; knowledge management; knowledge; technology		Organizations need to form alliances with external entities in order to acquire or access resources outside ones bounds. In recent times, we have seen an increased number of alliances geared towards acquiring technology capabilities. Alliances for technology capabilities include software application licensing agreements, access to technological infrastructure, and accessing technological know-how. While a lot of attention has been paid to the financial, economic, legal, and architectural issues of such arrangements, one dimension has been under debated and discussed-the knowledge component. Knowledge is the critical resource that is exchanged, managed, and integrated, in technology alliances. Managing knowledge in and around technology alliances is of utmost importance if we want to reap the strategic and operational benefits of such engagements. In this case study analysis, we share crucial knowledge management concerns to bear in mind while constructing, governing, and terminating technology alliances. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Roy, A; Kim, N; Raju, JS				Roy, Abhik; Kim, Namwoon; Raju, Jagmohan S.			Assessing new empirical industrial organization (NEIO) methods: The cases of five industries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING			English	Article						competition; empirical game theory; industrial organization	TIME-SERIES; COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR; MARKET POWER; OLIGOPOLY; MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM; PROMOTION; BOOTSTRAP; TESTS; MONEY	The methods proposed in the new empirical industrial organization (NEIO) literature have made significant contributions to our understanding of competitive behavior. However, these methods have yet to be compared with each other for their performance in explaining and diagnosing competitive market conduct. This inter-method comparison is important because conclusions about competitive behavior based on these methods have significant strategic as well as policy implications for firms. Our objective in this paper is to examine the performance of these different NEIO methods in terms of their discriminatory power, ability to identify strategic variables, and robustness in estimation. For empirical demonstration, we use data from diverse industries such as microprocessors, personal computers, facial tissue, disposable diapers and automobiles. Our results suggest that two commonly used NEIO methods-conjectural variation and non-nested model comparison-exhibit quite good convergence with each other and are consistent with a traditional time series method. This suggests that simpler methods such as conjectural variations deserve more credit. We also find that using these methods in tandem provides valuable additional information that may not be available when using any one method alone. While the emphasis in this study is on comparing different methods of analyzing competitive interaction, the findings also reveal some substantive insights about each market studied.

J	Yiu, TW; Cheung, SO; Mok, FM				Yiu, Tak Wing; Cheung, Sai On; Mok, Fung Man			Logistic likelihood analysis of mediation outcomes	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction management; dispute resolution; mediation; logistics	CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR; STRATEGIC CHOICE; CONFLICTS; DISPUTES; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; SELECTION; MODEL	Dispute persists in all building and construction projects. Alternative dispute resolution methods are now commonly used as a means to resolve construction disputes. Mediation, interalia, is the popular choice in Hong Kong due to its cost-saving, flexible, speedy, confidential, and voluntary attributes. In mediation, tactics used by a mediator is central in driving desired outcomes. This paper reports a study that employs logistic regression (LR) to predict mediation outcomes respective to the tactics used. To achieve this, three main stages of work are involved. First, taxonomies of mediator tactics and mediation outcomes were developed. With these, the second stage included the development of logistic regression models each with a mediation outcome taxonomy as dependent variables and the taxonomies of tactics as independent variables. In the third stage of the study, the LR models were validated using an independent set of testing data. The LR models suggested that "win-win settlement," "progress," "improvement," and "time advantage" are responsive to mediator tactics of "ice-breaking," "trust building," "encourage for self-improve," and "process control," respectively. In addition, it is observed that these relationships are positively correlated.

Purpose: To explore whether a depression disease management program has a comparable impact on clinical outcomes over 2 years in patients treated in rural and urban primary care practices and whether the impact is mediated by receiving evidence-based care (antidepressant medication and specialty care counseling). Methods: A preplanned secondary analysis was conducted in a consecutively sampled cohort of 479 depressed primary care patients recruited from 12 practices in 10 states across the country participating in the Quality Enhancement for Strategic Teaming study. Findings: Depression disease management improved the mental health status of urban patients over 18 months but not rural patients. Effects were not mediated by antidepressant medication or specialty care counseling in urban or rural patients. Conclusions: Depression disease management appears to improve clinical outcomes in urban but not rural patients. Because these programs compete for scarce resources, health care organizations interested in delivering depression disease management to rural populations need to advocate for programs whose clinical effectiveness has been demonstrated for rural residents.

Is infrastructure: The influence of senior IT leadership and strategic information systems planning	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						senior IT management; strategic information systems planning; information systems infrastructure	CORPORATE-STRATEGY; SUCCESS; ORIENTATION; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; INTEGRATION; CONSTRUCT	The integration of information systems (IS) across the entire enterprise has become one of the most important technology management challenges in complex organizations. Many companies have placed the development and implementation of a highly integrated IS infrastructure among the top concerns of their overall IT management practice. This paper reports on an empirical investigation of the influence of senior IT leadership and strategic information systems planning (SISP) on the level of implementation of the IS infrastructure. The resulting model shows the importance that SISP plays in the relationship between senior IT leadership and the extent of an integrated IS infrastructure. The findings indicate a moderate relationship between the factors of senior IT leadership (the importance of the CIO and the presence of a varied IS advisory committee) and SISP, and a strong relationship between SISP and three aspects of IS infrastructure (technical integration, application functionality, and data integration).

The mapping of processes and outcomes show that functional departments based in Colombia and the United States became more open to communications and higher levels of trust than that experienced previously. The study relates directly to the causal mapping literature in strategic management. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Miller, D				Miller, Dale			Strategic human resource management in department stores: An historical perspective	JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES			English	Article						Human resource management; Business strategy; Retail history		The department store as a retail format created special demands on the organization of staff and the creation of a harmonious and productive workplace. Despite a lack of theoretical knowledge of human resource management strategy, early 20th century department store owners used the business strategy to guide strategic decisions about internal communication and staff training. The most obvious area of training was in selling. However, the more innovative department stores also recognized the need for management development programs. This study examines how the business strategy which embraced business growth, efficiency and effectiveness, building the firm's image and creating a supporting culture, strategically guided selected human resource management policies and practices in an Australian department store.

J	Sen, B				Sen, B			Market orientation: a concept for health libraries	HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL			English	Article							BUSINESS PROFITABILITY; FOCUS	Objectives: This paper is the result of exploratory research forming part of ongoing study into the value and relevance of market orientation as a strategic option for library managers. The aim of the study is to gain an understanding of the concept of market orientation relative to the health library sector. Methodology: A focus group was used to gather data from health librarians working at different levels in the sector. The data was coded and categorized by an expert panel and analysed using a taxonomic map developed during the study. Results: Health library professionals define and understand market orientation in the same way as the concept is defined in the management literature. Their understanding of the concept is developing. A greater emphasis is given to some aspects of market orientation than others. Conclusions: There are implications for further research. Methods used to measure market orientation in other domains are likely to be relevant for libraries. Research should be extended to different sectors to explore any cross-sector differences. Fostering an organizational culture that supports market orientation has implications for service management and development.

J	Eldomiaty, TI; Choi, CJ				Eldomiaty, Tarek Ibrahim; Choi, Chong Ju			Corporate governance and strategic transparency: East Asia in the international business systems	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						International business; Corporate governance		Purpose - This paper aims at discussing the determinants of strategic transparency and the governance structure of the East Asian firms. The relatively weak institutional infrastructure in East Asia raises the question about the adaptable governance structure and transparency in the East Asian firms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents theoretical underpinnings of the literature on corporate governance, corporate strategy and international business. This paper argues that one of the common factors that determine the success of corporate governance structure is the extent to which it is transparent to the market forces within particular institutional arrangements. Findings - When the institutional arrangements favor mandatory versus voluntary corporate disclosure, this study suggests a reform measure for the East Asian corporate governance system that relies, inter alia, on the percentages of long-term and short-term financing to total financing. The higher the percentage of long-term financing, the more we can infer the extent of outside investors' confidence in the future of the East Asian firms. When more active role of banks involvements with the firms' business is permitted and an effective banks' and firms' strategic transparency can be assured, the East Asian banks and stock market can both lead firms to long-term favorable achievements. This study also suggests that the protection of both shareholder's rights and creditors' rights can go in parallel lines with the latter is to be given first priority until the investors' confidence in the near and far future of East Asia corporate governance system is built. Originality/value - This paper extends the value of corporate governance structure to the East Asian firms through advocating the determinants of strategic transparency in East Asia.

J	Galende, J				Galende, J			The appropriation of the results of innovative activity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						knowledge protection; patents; mechanisms for appropriating the results; innovative process	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; TECHNOLOGY POLICY; MARKET-STRUCTURE; PATENTS; FIRM; APPROPRIABILITY	The aim of this paper is to analyse the five fundamental alternatives within reach of the innovator for achieving a better appropriation of the results of technological activity. These are patents, industrial secret, cost and time for imitation, continuous innovation and complementary resources. We seek to contrast which factors determine the firm's choice of one method or another. By applying a model and different working hypotheses to a sample of 152 Spanish innovative firms, we establish how and to what degree the Spanish firms protect their technology and which resources and innovative characteristics determine the firm's choice of method of appropriation of innovative results.

J	Haapasalo, H; Ingalsuo, K; Lenkkeri, T				Haapasalo, Harri; Ingalsuo, Kari; Lenkkeri, Timo			Linking strategy into operational management A survey of BSC implementation in Finnish energy sector	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Strategic management; Business development; Performance measures; Balanced scorecard; Energy industry; Finland		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to find a means of connecting strategic management and operative performance measurement. Design/methodology/approach - The paper focuses on the balanced scorecard (BSC), its levels of use and utilization, the influence of specific features, the most used metrics and features of successful implementation of the BSC in the energy sector. The paper is based on empirical interviews with 16 locally operating energy companies and business units of larger corporations. BSC is a wide spread strategic management system which originated in the early 1990s. The aim of the BSC is to facilitate in depth discussion about a company's vision, strategy and critical success factors and translate theminto specific measures and objectives in action. Findings - The study shows that maintaining a vision and a strategy has not been very prevalent in Finnish electricity companies. However, the deregulation of the energy markets in Finland, from the mid-1990s, has increased the competition and made maintaining a strategy all the more important. Adjustment to this deregulation and the large number of different businesses are special features of the electricity sector. It can be concluded that benchmarking on other industries, where BSC has been in use, leads to better results faster in the energy sector. However, it has to be noted that strategy and management have to be seen as a unique set of activities. In the construction phase of the BSC, the process of searching for the metrics is more important than finding them. Originality/value - The paper offers insights into linking strategy into operational management.

J	Hsu, PF				Hsu, Pi-Fang			Developing a new model for selecting public relations firms in the high-tech industry	JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public relations; Analytic hierarchy process; Modelling	DECISION	Purpose - This study develops a new model for selecting public relations (PR) firms based on high-tech industrial perceptions. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed model comprises two parts. The first part employs the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for criteria weighting. The second part applies the grey relational analysis (GRA) to rank alternatives and select the optimum PR firm in the high-tech industry. Findings - Analytical results indicate that high-tech enterprises consider criteria in the following order of priority: media ability, campaign ability, strategic planning, service team, cost consciousness and relationship maintenance. Furthermore, this study uses the example of a renowned high-tech communications manufacturer in Taiwan to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in PR firm selection. Originality/value - The proposed model helps high-tech enterprises to effectively select PR firms, making it highly applicable in academia and commerce.

J	Jonassen, D				Jonassen, David			Accommodating ways of human knowing in the design of information and instruction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING			English	Article						knowledge representation; ontology; epistemology; knowledge structures		The ways that we organise and represent knowledge in curricula, learning environments, and information and knowledge management systems are known as ontologies. Ontologies are meant to reflect the types of knowledge being represented in the system. The most commonly used ontologies reflect ontological knowledge types (declarative, structural, and conceptual knowledge) in hierarchical lists of subject matter topics. Ontologies may also reflect epistemological knowledge types (procedural, situational, and strategic knowledge) based on how processes are performed or phenomenological knowledge types (tacit, compiled, socio-cultural and experiential knowledge) based on human experiences. Ontological representations describe knowing that, while epistemological representations describe knowing how. Phenomenological (experiential) knowledge representations in the form of stories are the most natural, comprehensible, and memorable representations of knowledge. Why is the least meaningful form of knowledge representation the most commonly used to design knowledge-based systems?

J	Mouzas, S				Mouzas, Stefanos			Marketing action in networks	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						business-to-business marketing; marketing; product development; networking; Germany	MENTAL MODELS; STRATEGIC GROUPS; REAL OPTIONS; EMBEDDEDNESS; CAPABILITIES; MANAGERS; RIVALRY; FIRMS	Purpose-The aim of this paper is to describe and explain how organizations develop and implement marketing action within their surrounding business networks. Design/methodology/approach-The paper is an empirical case study research that covered periods 1993 to 1998 and 2002 to 2003 in manufacturer-retailer networks in Germany. A conceptual model is developed and its applicability is illustrated. Findings-The paper finds that marketing action is seen as an inventive stream of finding and doing what is possible for each organization in its respective network. Whilst organizations react to events as they unfold, marketing action in networks takes the form of creating and exercising a number of options that best reflect organizations' strengths and their capacities derived from network membership. Research limitations/implications-Although based on marketing episodes related to the development and introduction of new products in a manufacturer-retailer network, the proposed model has far wider managerial implications. The efficiency of the model is achieved through the reduction into three generative stages of the complexity of marketing action in networks. Practical implications-The model is explained in some depth, and its practical implications explained via the case study. Originality/value-The development of a model of marketing action in networks based upon a network/option view of business-to-business marketing.

J	Oubina, J; Rubio, N; Yague, MJ				Oubina, Javier; Rubio, Natalia; Jesus Yaguee, Maria			Strategic management of store brands: an analysis from the manufacturer's perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Generics; Brands; Strategic management; Merchandising; Spain		Purpose - The main aim of this research is to provide empirical analyses about the store brand management by manufacturers and retailers from the manufacturer's perspective, in the current context, which is one of intense competition between manufacturer and store brands. Particularly, this research pursues to analyse the profile of store brand manufacturers, their perceptions about the retail management of these brands and their own product management of the same. Design/methodology/approach - A postal survey was carried out directed at manufacturing business units of mass consumer products in Spain. Multivariate techniques are used in the information analysis such as contingency tables, variance and principal component analysis. Findings - The results highlight the differences between manufacturers and non-manufacturers of store brands in their competitive position and in the type of manufactured product; the consensus of both groups regarding the perception of favourable merchandising for store brands; the greater number of production and market motivations versus the relational motivations in the manufacture of store brands; the no convenience of producing store brands for leading manufacturers, and the slight differences in the manufacturing process between manufacturer and store brands. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this research is the fact that only the manufacturers' perceptions have been considered. It would be beneficial in future research to consider the opinion of retailers about their own management of these brands. Originality/value - The main value of the paper is the empirical analyse of the store brand management from the manufacturer's perspective. This subject has been analysed from a general and basically theoretical perspective until now.

J	Simmonds, D; Pedersen, C				Simmonds, David; Pedersen, Cec			HRD: the shapes and things to come	JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING			English	Article						Human resource management; Change management		Purpose - To redefine contemporary HRD through a discussion of its conceptual development from "training and development" to a holistic "orchestra". Design/methodology/approach - HRD is often defined as being merely the training and development aspect of human resource management and this form of definition is commonly associated with "hard" forms of HRD which focus on the practical and strategic or "structured" elements of organisational functioning. However, it is change, and especially the rate at which change occurs, that largely influences the HRD hybrid that any organisation adopts. This paper systematically considers the professional discussions in a number of countries to trace HRD through four key phases: the "Duet", the "Trio", the "Quartet", and concluding with the "Orchestra" and a holistic definition of HRD. Findings - HRD is a combination of structured and unstructured learning and performance-based activities which develop individual and organisational competency, capability and capacity to cope with and successfully manage change. The future of HRD now lies squarely in the need for the profession to consider and embrace the inextricably interrelated paradigms of movement (where people have developed from); change (and especially the rate of change); dynamism (provided from leadership); harmony and unity (resulting from cohesive partnerships) - the "Orchestra". Originality/value - There has been limited critical review and development of Human Resource Development (HRD) theory in the past two decades. This paper presents a sequential discussion of the chronological development of HRD and concludes that contemporary HRD involves a holistic approach involving both hard and soft elements - an "Orchestra".

J	Sundberg, HP; Sandberg, KW				Sundberg, Hakan P.; Sandberg, Karl W.			Towards e-government: a survey of problems in organisational processes	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Organizational processes; Insurance companies; Social benefits; Electronic commerce; Sweden		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at process initiatives in the Swedish social insurance administration, focusing on the problems of crossing functional boundaries, co-ordinating processes over inter-organisational boundaries and the issue of whether to aim for radical or incremental change. Design/methodology/approach - The survey involved data collection including a study of internal documents and 16 individual personal interviews. Findings - The organisation experiences collaboration problems when cross-functional work and processes collide with the traditional and hierarchical command and control structures. These are not easily dismantled, meaning intensive work to change the culture and break functional mind-sets. Furthermore the administration struggles with and can benefit from co-ordination of processes over the inter-organisational boundaries. Changes in the customer front-line affect the rest of the organisation and its processes. The study has shown that both functional units and support processes deep inside the organisation, like the systems development process, are affected, and that deficiencies in the underlying structure and organisation are revealed. The process efforts so far are scattered, but it may be more important for organisations to deploy process change, as a continuous strategic initiative, rather than embarking on huge radical redesign programmes. Originality/value - Little information regarding processes and the public sector exists, and problems likely to be encountered by other public organisations are pointed out. The survey also puts light on support processes -not only business processes -required for e-government.

J	Voelpel, SC; Leibold, M; Tekie, EB				Voelpel, Sven; Leibold, Marius; Tekie, Eden			Managing Purposeful Organizational Misfit: Exploring the Nature of Industry and Organizational Misfit to Enable Strategic Change	JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fit; misfit; innovation; value creation; strategic fitness	BALANCED SCORECARD; DOMINANT LOGIC; INNOVATION; CAPABILITIES; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; SEARCH; VIEW; FIT	The article argues that organizations need to seek and effectively manage purposeful 'misfit' to traditional industry and organizational norms and behavior, if they are to develop unique new value and enable successful change in highly innovative environments. The complexity and uncertainty of the early 21st century business environment requires fundamental transformation in organizational thinking and practices. The 'conventional' competitive advantage envisaged in achieving a continuous 'fit' between the organization and the competitive environment, or attaining optimal 'fit' between an organization's resources and capabilities and market opportunities, is waning fast due to rapid changes in industry and organizational boundaries. Rather, organizations need to create new customer value and innovation through purposefully becoming a 'misfit' to traditional 'ways of thinking' and 'ways of doing business' in industries and business models, thereby 'leapfrogging' competitors instead of just out-competing them. This involves collaboration, experimentation and risk-taking, and ambidextrous managerial capabilities, in the search for application of business practices that transcend traditional industry boundaries and business models. The concept of industry and organizational 'fit' is reviewed critically and contested. The paper describes what is meant by creating 'purposeful misfit', and identifies five managerial implications in achieving purposeful organizational misfit: balancing the risks of misfit experimentation; co-shaping new value with supply and demand chain members; managing the paradox of fit and misfit simultaneously; implementing a redefined concept of 'strategic fitness'; and measuring performance through systemic scorecards.

Adapt or adapt: lessons for strategy from the US telecoms industry	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Using multiple measures of performance, we related performance differentials between the most and least adaptive firms in the telecommunications equipment industry in the United States to differences in their alignment properties. We found that winners excel uniformly in terms of internal alignment as well as external alignment as compared to losers on all the performance measures considered. However, the contribution of the alignment characteristics to different dimensions of performance varies. This finding has important managerial implications for how these characteristics could be configured for superior strategic adaptation in a rapidly changing industry.

J	Karlsson, C; Loven, E				Karlsson, Christer; Loven, Eva			MANAGING NEW TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION: INTEGRATING SOFTWARE IN MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Integration; software; manufactured products; hardware; obstacles; new technology		Development processes in which software is integrated in hardware products are explored with the aim of finding obstacles to the development process and hypothesising how they can be dealt with. Empirical data are based on case studies in nine manufacturing companies chosen to have a varied amount of software in their products and experience of technology integration. Results indicate that obstacles in experienced companies concern processes, structures and resources but few culture-related issues. In companies with short experience of software integration in hardware development, cultural aspects were important. Where new technology played a strategic role in the product function, organisational issues such as structures, processes and cultural differences formed obstacles. Where technology only had a supporting role, resource-related obstacles such as lack of competencies were more important. Managerial measures tended to be partly related to the different types of obstacles, partly to the strategic situation of the company.

J	Ghanbarpour, MR; Hipel, KW; Abbaspour, KC				Ghanbarpour, MR; Hipel, KW; Abbaspour, KC			Prioritizing long-term watershed management strategies using group decision analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								There is a growing consensus that an effective way of enhancing long-term water resources management and environmental sustainability is through locally based planning at the watershed scale. Managing watershed resources for particular uses requires interactive dialogue among all stakeholders who have different objectives. Therefore, the resolution of inter-group conflict should be an acknowledged task of the planning process. In this paper, an integrated framework for prioritizing watershed management strategies is proposed. A case study is employed to highlight the challenges of using group decision analysis in strategic planning and to illustrate the interaction between different stakeholders on watershed issues. In particular, two group decision-making approaches are used to assess and analyse different stakeholders' preferences for various strategies and alternatives. Professional experts, government agencies and community leaders constitute the different parties included in the framework. The main focus is on the application of group decision analysis in the long-term watershed planning process. The results of the overall preference analysis show that water resources development is the most important strategy followed by agricultural and range management.

J	Audea, T; Teo, STT; Crawford, J				Audea, T; Teo, STT; Crawford, J			HRM professionals and their perceptions of HRM and firm performance in the Philippines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Human Resource Management Workshop	NOV, 2002	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA			strategic HRM; the Philippines; perceived firm performance	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; DETERMINANTS; EMPLOYMENT; LINKAGES; MALAYSIA; STRATEGY; SYSTEMS; GUANXI; IMPACT	This paper reports the findings of a study conducted in the Philippines that examines the extent of adoption of human capital-enhancing human resource (HR) and industrial relations (IR) practices. Differences between locally owned and other organizations in these practices and their relationship to firm performance were also investigated. Questionnaire responses were obtained from managers and union representatives from 128 organizations located in the Philippines. The results indicated that there was, on average, a fairly high level of adoption of practices consistent with a strategic approach to human resource management (HRM), with foreign-owned firms tending to show a slightly higher level of adoption of such practices. A scale representing the adoption of a more conciliatory and union-friendly IR approach was found to be a significant predictor of perceived firm performance. Surprisingly, the level of strategic integration between HRM and business planning and most human capital-enhancing HR practices were not significant predictors of perceived firm performance. Research and practical implications in relation to the role of HRM in enhancing firm performance are discussed.

J	Cardno, C				Cardno, Carol			Leadership and professional development: the quiet revolution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Professional education; Academic staff; Management development; New Zealand		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a model for holistic professional development as an alternative to practices that have been piecemeal and curriculum focused ignoring, in particular, the critical dimension of management development. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework for considering professional development needs is provided in the form of an holistic model. The model, with its meshed infrastructure of appropriate educational leadership, performance management and strategic management suggests that four essential dimensions - curriculum, management, school and personal development - can be adapted as a basis for planning and evaluating a school's professional development programme. Findings - Leaders at both system and school level should be interested in the insights provided and challenged to think differently about current practice and the implications for strategic management when the active management of professional development is made a priority. Originality/value - The paper fulfils a need to provide educational managers with conceptual tools for planning and evaluating professional development programmes.

In this paper we report on the results of a study of communication patterns in letters to shareholders of a sample of firms that achieved successful turnaround. The results indicate that replacement of the CEO is a common but not essential element of successful turnaround. Results show distinctly different patterns of attribution and communication in turnaround firms that replace the CEO versus those that do not. From these results we identify patterns of communication that seem related to successful turnaround. Implications for over-identification with a firm and management reasoning are discussed.

J	Evans, JR				Evans, Joel R.			Are the largest public retailers top financial performers? A longitudinal analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Retailers; Organizational performance; Financial performance; Profit maximization; Financial management; United States of America		Purpose - To empirically study the performance of large retailers in terms of the strategic profit model and the retail performance index over time. Design/methodology/approach - This study looks at how well the largest public US retailers performed financially from 1982 to 2001. Several measures are employed, including sales and profit growth, profit margins, asset turnover, return on assets, financial leverage, and return on net worth. The performance of Wal-Mart is broken out. Findings - As a group, the largest public US retailers have not performed very well across a number of measures. They have not been "high performers." Wal-Mart has outperformed other very large retailers for virtually every financial measure. It has been a "high performer" by not losing its edge as it has grown. Research limitations/implications - Only public retailers were included in the study. Retailers reported financial data using different fiscal years. The federal government converted its data from SIC to NAICS codes during the time frame of the study; the data were converted based on a model from Retail Forward. Practical implications - As the largest firms seek to heighten their marketplace concentration, they have to be careful not to fall into a growth trap. They need to be more devoted to driving up their financial performance. Originality/value - The paper reports the results of a comprehensive longitudinal study of the largest public retailers, and focuses on applying two under-researched retail performance tools: the strategic profit model and the retail performance index.

J	Meyer, M; Kolbe, LM				Meyer, Matthias; Kolbe, Lutz			Integration of customer relationship management: status quo and implications for research and practice	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						Customer relationship management; integration; theories of the firm	RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; TRANSACTION COST; ORGANIZATION; STRATEGY; MARKETS; IMPACT; FIRM; SATISFACTION; CAPABILITIES; PERSPECTIVE	This paper assesses the state-of-the-art research on CRM integration. After introducing the concepts of customer relationship management (CRM) and integration, it argues that CRM integration is vital to corporate performance on the project or enterprise level. Based on results of own and third-party market studies as well as on a systematic literature review of selected papers in top journals spanning five disciplines, it shows that research has mainly been confined to the specifics of those domains. Interestingly, applicable theories of the firm are not widely employed as a foundation from which to explain CRM integration. This paper identifies research gaps for researchers and practitioners alike and suggests areas that need further consideration in future.

J	Roper, A				Roper, Angela			Marketing standardisation: tour operators in the Nordic region	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						Standardization; Marketing management; Tourism; Scandinavia	STRATEGY; ADAPTATION	Purpose - This paper aims to evaluate the marketing decisions made by European tour operators. It seeks to assess the extent of marketing standardisation/adaptation across and within the Nordic region and to identify the centric profiles of the sample firms in terms of marketing decision-making. Design/methodology/approach - A multiple case study approach was employed and the research design combined a range of empirical data gathered from regional headquarters and one subsidiary. Findings - These indicate that the case study firms manage marketing regionally, at the same time; certain activities are adapted to local market and competitive conditions. It is clear that the "think regional-act local" philosophy or "cooperative centralisation" is a challenge for tour operators to manage and that the level of international marketing standardisation is affected by situation-specific factors such as product and industry characteristics. Research limitations/implications - Any bias in the research as a result of basing findings only on the views of executives interviewed and upon company documentation is tempered with reports from outside sources. Further research needs to be undertaken at the corporate level, in other source markets, and longitudinally. It would also be interesting to carry out a comparative study of other types of firms. Originality/value - This paper contributes to our knowledge of marketing standardisation/adaptation from the perspective of a regional market-place by investigating the strategic approach chosen for the establishment of marketing decisions. In exploiting the concept of centricity, it is more conceptually grounded than some previous studies.

J	Tennant, C; Tanoren, M				Tennant, Charles; Tanoren, Murat			Performance management in SMEs: a Balanced Scorecard perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						performance management and measurement; Balanced Scorecard (BS); Hoshin Kanri; policy deployment; Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs); strategic management		There have been substantial changes in business performance measurement in the last 20 years, which has led to the development of new performance-measurement frameworks, of which the Balanced Scorecard (BS) concept is considered to be among the most popular. The BS has been widely implemented in large organisations all around the world as a performance measurement framework and a strategy implementation methodology. This paper presents research of the BS from the perspective of manufacturing Small- to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) based in the West Midlands region of the UK. The results suggest that SMEs are not aware of the BS and hence, the usage rate is very low compared to large companies. Furthermore, SMEs were found to be oriented towards day-to-day activities resulting in largely ineffective performance management of important but intangible assets such as employees, information systems, organisational learning and innovation. A BS implementation plan for SMEs is proposed, which adopts the catchball process from the Japanese strategy implementation technique known as Hoshin Kanri or policy deployment.

J	Yeo, R				Yeo, Roland			Problem-based learning: lessons for administrators, educators and learners	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Focus groups; Higher education; Lifelong learning; Problem-based learning; Singapore		Purpose - The paper aims to explore the challenges of problem-based learning (PBL) as an unconventional teaching methodology experienced by a higher learning institute in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach - The exploratory study was conducted using focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews. Four groups of people were invited to participate in the research involving administrators, management personnel, lecturers and students. Findings - Key findings of the research point to three pertinent enablers in developing PBL in higher education. They are the role of people, process and purpose in the implementation of PBL. These three areas are interconnected in many ways but their relationship is not entirely linear. Research limitations/implications - Although the study is limited by the single context from which data were drawn, it offers considerable implications for research in higher education as PBL has been regarded as an emerging paradigm. Much discussion and debate of PBL have centered on the compatibility of subjects, backgrounds of students and the level of preparedness institutions are willing to adopt such an approach. Practical implications - Implications for practice and policy include strategic communication of PBL rationale, appropriate structuring of PBL lessons, careful allocation of resources, identification of suitable PBL facilitators and ensuring of the right mixture of students in PBL group formations. Originality/value - Although a number of studies have been carried out in Singapore, very few have concentrated on how PBL has been implemented in engineering education. More importantly, while current studies center on the pedagogical aspects of PBL, this study provides a fresh perspective on educational management.

J	Peterson, RB				Peterson, RB			A call for testing our assumptions: Human resource management today	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INQUIRY			English	Article						human resource management; unilateral management decision making; employees; nonunion; private sector	PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY	This essay tests some of the assumptions behind the recent focus by academicians and practitioners regarding the efficacy of strategic human resource (HR) management and our present concern with linking HR programs and bundles to corporate performance measures only. We call for broadening our perspective so that employee priorities and needs are given equal attention to those of top management when undertaking such programs as a part of the agenda of high-performance work organizations. We lay out a set Of implications for HR policy and practitioners, as well as for useful research for HR, organization behavior (OB), and social issues academicians.

J	Nathan, ML				Nathan, ML			How past becomes prologue: a sensemaking interpretation of the hindsight-foresight relationship given the circumstances of crisis	FUTURES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Probing the Future	JUL 11-13, 2002	Glasgow, SCOTLAND				ORGANIZATIONS; DEFINITION; MODEL	Foresight is rooted in deep understanding [A.N. Whitehead. Lecture notes from address to the Harvard Business School, 1931]. Such understanding requires that we shall have first looked back to the past before venturing forward into the future. This paper uses Weick's and colleagues' sense making perspective in order to explore this critical relationship between the past and the future [Communication Monographs 44 (1977) 171; Strategic Management Journal 9 (1986) 559; Human Resource Management 34 (1, Spring) (1995) 27; Academy of Management Journal 33 (1990) 286; K.E. Weick, The Social Psychology of Organizing, 2nd edn, Random House Inc., New York, 1979; K.E. Weick, Sense Making in Organizations, Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, California, 1995]. In particular, key sense making properties will be applied to a crisis, an occurrence of school-place violence that occurred in the United States in 1999. We shall then ask how this organization and its diverse external stakeholders used their understanding of this event to learn how to prevent such crises from occurring in the future. In other words, how capably was hindsight constructed and then how was it used to strengthen foresight into the future? This paper will conduct a theory-based empirical examination of a crisis event and its aftermath to understand how hindsight can be sharpened and then used to improve organizational foresight.

J	Brauninger, T				Brauninger, T			When simple voting doesn't work: Multicameral systems for the representation and aggregation of interests in international organizations	BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ECPR 2001 Meeting	2001	CANTERBURY, ENGLAND	ECPR			GLOBAL COMMONS; MAJORITY-RULE; VETO PLAYERS; POWER; BICAMERALISM; INSTABILITY; CORE; SET	This article analyses the origins and consequences of multicameral representation and voting in international organizations. It is argued that the existence of visible and durable conflicts in an issue area can make standard procedures such as unicameral majority voting ineffective with respect to the functioning of the regime. Applying spatial models of strategic decision making, it is asserted that multicameralism is more likely to be effective than unicameralism if chambers consist of key groups with distinct interests. Empirical evidence is provided by studying the multicameral voting rule in the Council of the International Seabed Authority (ISA). I compare likely decision-making outcomes under unicameral and multicameral voting rules from 1996 to 2002 and find that multicameral outcomes are more likely to be stable and supported by those actors critical for the effective functioning of the regime.

J	Coffey, D; Tomlinson, PR				Coffey, D; Tomlinson, PR			Globalization, vertical relations, and the J-mode firm	JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS			English	Article						globalization; hierarchy; J-mode firms; production coordination; strategic decision-making; vertical relations	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; MODERN CORPORATION; WESTERN ECONOMICS; ESSENCE; JAPAN	This paper is concerned with two overlapping issues. In the first instance, we consider the apparent tensions between the visible effects of globalization upon the Japanese economy and the claims of successive commentators that novel Japanese production systems of coordination and vertical supply are particularly conducive to both national and regional industrial stability. Second, we set out a critical reassessment of the lessons that the literature has drawn to date from both the evident successes and current difficulties of Japan's post-World War II economy; taking as the frame of reference contributions such as Aoki (1988; 1990b; 1994) on the J-mode firm, Katzner (1999) on comparative economy and culture, and Porter et al. (2000) on Japans present economic crisis. This paper argues that (1) the basis for many of the claims of historic novelty in forms of material organization in Japanese industry is surprisingly weak, (2) these claims have encouraged an unwarranted tendency toward neglect of the problems posed for the national and regional economy by the globalizing activities of Japan's large transnational corporations, and (3) analysis should dwell less on the supposed novelties at the point of interface between production unit and market or in the conduct of vertical supply relations, and more on the lessons to be drawn from a careful study of the past achievements of and current political-economic impasse in, state strategic planning and the role of industrial policy.

J	Glezer, C				Glezer, C			A conceptual model of an interorganizational intelligent meeting-scheduler (IIMS)	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						meetings; group-tasks; meeting-scheduling; interoperability; human resource management (HRM); calendars; software agents; inter-organizational systems (IOS)	INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE; SYSTEMS	This article proposes and evaluates a comprehensive agent-based architecture for an Interorganizational Intelligent Meeting-Scheduler. The article extends and generalizes the Intelligent Meeting-Scheduler conceptual model [EXPERSYS 95-Proc. Seventh Intl Conf. Artificial Intelligence Expert Syst. Aopl. (1995) 279; J. Organizational Comput. Electron. Commerce, 9 (1999) 233] which focused on intraorganizational meeting scenarios. First, the article reviews several academic meeting-scheduling prototypes and commercial software packages. Based on this review, it is demonstrated that only an integrated approach that supports interoperability in all three dimensions of the meeting-scheduling problem (calendar, scheduling, and communication-management) can succeed in achieving interoperability among heterogeneous calendar and scheduling systems. The next part of the article provides a specification of an agent-based system that attempts to address the interoperability challenge. The specification comprises of the following elements: environment, behaviors, symbol-level, and knowledge-level architectures [IEEE Trans. Syst., Man, Cybernet. 25 (1995) 852]. The inter-organizational meeting-scheduling process is articulated as an iterative negotiation process where knowledge and symbol level units ('the IIMS system') interact with the system's end-users ('the environment') by exhibiting behaviors that address end-user requirements. The IIMS conceptual model is evaluated empirically and related to relevant literature on adoption difficulties of inter-organizational systems. It is evident that the IIMS faces a plethora of technological, organizational, sociological, behavioral, and psychological challenges that hinder its successful adoption.

Continuing adaptation to the market can only be achieved efficiently if the planning and control processes are both optimized horizontally (Automatic Control Systems) and vertically (Management Control Systems). The desired improvement in performance and the realization of global enterprise objectives require a tight integration of the units of the enterprise. The close monitoring of the operational performance of various plants, manufacturing shop-floors/cells/machines, as well as their associated instrumentation and control is of increasing strategic importance. Failures can lead to increased costs and reduced product quality, consistency and production, and to plant shutdowns and increased environmental impact. There is a real need for advanced monitoring technologies to be applied, and their potential demonstrated, on complex industrial plants. The planning and scheduling of manufacturing systems integrated into virtual enterprise architectures requires the implementation of new General Master Production Planning and Scheduling techniques and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) functions. This paper discusses some key issues on the SCADA-oriented open system for virtual enterprise architecture.

J	Siebens, H				Siebens, H			Concepts and working instruments for corporate governance	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						accountability; board; business model; checklist; committee; corporate governance; director; external director; independent director; scorecard; self-regulation; transparency		Enterprises seem to entirely operate on their management. But behind the scenes directors play a very important role. On a strategic level (in the long term) they will determine the direction of the company. Even though on the level of daily management a great deal of quality instruments and control systems exist, this is not the case on the highest level, the board. It is in this specific area that the idea of corporate governance must be situated. In 2000 the Association of Christian Employers and Executives in Flanders (VKW) facilitated the formation of a consultation committee consisting of leading employers and business executives, having the task to translate this idea of corporate governance into useful working instruments. The author of this paper was the secretary to this consultation committee. One of the main questions in this area considers the ethics of the board. The other way around corporate governance is a very important instrument realising more responsible business, because it depends on the specific business model in the board and the firm. The first results were presented in February 2001. In February 2002 a first update was published, with some new insights, information and working instruments.

J	Hailey, VH				Hailey, VH			Breaking the mould? Innovation as a strategy for corporate renewal	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Dutch HRM Network Conference	1999	ERASMUS UNIV, ROTTERDAM SCH ECON, ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS		ERASMUS UNIV, ROTTERDAM SCH ECON	innovation; HRM; change management		In contrast to studies of HRM and innovation within hi-tech industries or greenfield sites, this paper uses longitudinal data to analyse the attempts of two mature corporations to shift from business strategies of 'cost reduction' and 'growth by acquisition' towards organizations that compete through innovation. The case studies describe how human resource management interventions and the structure of the HR function itself are used as change levers to support the shift in business strategies. By analysing the different organizational contexts, the paper identifies the complex microprocesses that either facilitate or constrain such organizational change. Its contribution lies in considering strategies concerned with innovation in both product and sales and marketing; in tracking these change processes over time using in depth case studies; and in considering innovation as a strategic trigger for corporate renewal.

J	Hough, JR; White, MA				Hough, JR; White, MA			Using stories to create change: The object lesson of Frederick Taylor's "pig-tale"	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MANAGEMENT	Just over 100 years ago, Frederick Taylor conducted the pig-iron handling experiments. After reviewing discrepancies in Taylor's accounts of these experiments, some have concluded that the episode was no more than a "pig-tale." Through the use of historiographic approaches, including evaluation of Frank Gilbreth's 1912 filmed recreation, this research supports Taylor's use of the "pig-tale." Taylor told the story to persuade listeners that even the most basic processes could be improved for the joint prosperity of employer and employee. When evaluating historical records, we must not allow relatively minor discrepancies to overshadow the object lesson of the story. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Further, it introduced computational, or simulation, modeling as a means to investigate theoretical questions about the behavior of organizations. This article validates aspects of those early studies. More importantly, the authors extend our understanding of the roles that routines play in an organizational view of the firm and how routines can account for the economic behavior and performance in a duopoly.

J	Ramaswamy, EA; Schiphorst, FB				Ramaswamy, EA; Schiphorst, FB			Human resource management, trade unions and empowerment: two cases from India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						human resource management; trade unions; industrial relations; trade union democracy; India	INDUSTRY; HRM	This paper discusses the introduction of schemes aimed at employee empowerment within a context of strong industrial relations in India. The pressure put on profit margins by a competitive business environment is forcing an increasing number of Indian enterprises to view employee empowerment as a serious strategic option. Getting workers to take responsibility for shop-floor decisions over quality, safety, productivity and material use appears, at first sight, an alluring prospect. It would seem that men and women at the bottom of the pyramid cannot but be warmly appreciative of power-sharing arrangements from which they have something to gain, but there are forces at work which can actively obstruct or quietly subvert attempts at redistributing power. In this paper the focus is on some of the motives a trade union might have to do so.

J	Clarke, S; Lehaney, B				Clarke, S; Lehaney, B			Mixing methodologies for information systems development and strategy: A higher education case study	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						information systems; functionalism; interpretivism; critical systems; social theory; total systems intervention; education; case study	INTERVENTION TSI; FRAMEWORK; THINKING; CHOICE; DESIGN; MODEL	Although informed approaches from an interpretivist perspective have been widely promoted over the last two decades information systems development is largely informed by a functionalist perspective, into which human-centred or interpretivist issues are incorporated as they are seen to be required. By treating such developments as critically informed social systems, this paper offers an alternative viewpoint. Firstly, a theoretical justification for such an approach is offered, drawing on developments in Critical Management Science, themselves based on a strand of Critical Social Theory. Secondly, an action research-based intervention is detailed, demonstrating the practical applicability of such an approach, an applicability that has hitherto been questioned. The outcome is a synthesised approach to operational and strategic information systems development, within a critical framework, which, it is argued offers a greater potential for success than the currently promoted approaches.

J	Hussain, SS				Hussain, SS			Green consumerism and ecolabelling: A strategic behavioural model	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article								The ethos of "green" marketing is to affect tastes and perceptions so that those individuals for whom the attribute of environmental-friendliness is significant can signal this preference by choosing the "green" alternative. This paper presents a strategic behavioural model of interactions between two agents, a firm and consumer under conditions of incomplete information. The outcome of the model is that, unless some restrictive and (arguably) unrealistic conditions apply, some proportion of "green" marketing campaigns will be misleading; "green" marketing is not restricted to "green" products, and "green" consumers only adapt their purchasing habits some of the time. Ecolabelling schemes can be used sts a means of ameliorating. this inefficiency in, information transfer Whether state intervention to make ecolabelling mandatory for "green" products is welfare-improving depends on the balance between the deadweight losses from the process and the gains in terms of facilitating the expression of "green" preferences.

J	Waters, J				Waters, J			Achieving innovation or the Holy Grail: managing knowledge or managing commitment?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						management of innovation; knowledge management; commitment to innovation; knowledge creation; cognitive style; cognitive climate; problems with conventional thinking on innovation; distinguishing capacity and style	ENTRAPMENT; TECHNOLOGY; SITUATIONS	Recent: literature asserts that knowledge is the source of innovation and, consequently, that knowledge management is a key to innovation management. However, the literature is not informative about how knowledge actually leads to innovation. Knowledge, that is no more than a potential for action, cannot explain the acquisition and use of knowledge in innovation. This paper argues that achieving innovation, like the search for the Holy Grail, is primarily about generating commitments. This contention is supported by analysis of the role of commitment to innovation from both strategic and internal process viewpoints, and by presenting the elements of a theory of commitment to innovation.

These methods have been influential and applied successfully to many industrial decision-making and strategic-planning settings. Fisheries management has not yet embraced these innovations, which involve the "scientific method of problem-solving" and which offer considerable opportunity for improved fisheries decisionmaking. Fisheries science and management can be integrated with management science in what we term "fisheries-management science". The broader framework allows management in the face of uncertainty and, at the spatial and temporal scales, is appropriate for the complexity of fisheries systems. This paper presents an implementation plan for fisheries-management science in a commercial fishery. The implementation plan is presented as a possible remedy for issues that have plagued fisheries management to date. It is argued that decision theory methodologies are needed to analyse the management problem context, including strategic planning and objectives setting, appropriate spatial and temporal scale definition, interdisciplinary systems modelling methods, the assessment and management of risk, and ongoing in-season decision-monitoring. The fisheries-management science problem-solving context also provides a basis for reshaping the central agency responsible for fisheries into a more action-orientated organization consisting of multidisciplinary teams acting in support of participative, real-time decision-making through enhanced industry and stakeholders' responsibility for resource sustainability. Fisheries institutions are often hindered by rigid, disciplinary organizational structures and decision-making processes that are unable to account, in a timely fashion, for the multiple and conflicting objectives and the inherent variability that characterize a fishery system. The fisheries-management science approach addresses these issues by focusing on the problem-orientated nature of fisheries management, by managing according to objectives, and by supporting a holistic view for stock conservation and resource sustainability.

A fisheries-management model with eight components was used to structure the recommendations for change. The components are strategic planning, annual planning, fishing entitlements, catch and effort monitoring, enforcement, service delivery, socio-economic analysis, and resource analysis. For each component, a brief synopsis of the major problems identified during the review is provided, and subsequent changes (1995-1998) to address problems are summarized. In spite of unclear and conflicting objectives, the conservation objectives under a rebuilding strategy are generally being met for the open fisheries, at least recently. This is a direct result of improvements in the overall management system. By transferring responsibilities for several aspects of management to the fishing industry, there has been a reduction in institutional uncertainty. Introduction of a combination of enterprise allocations, individual transferable quotas and community quotas has permitted a reduction of fishing capacity without government assistance. However, the reduction in participation level in the open groundfish fisheries has led to social unrest as some participants received small quota shares. For fisheries that have been closed since 1993, little progress has been made in improving the management system. The resource base is not recovering owing to continued levels of poor recruitment, and there is a lack of scientific consensus on the relative contributions of fishing and ecosystem changes to the poor recruitment observed during the past decade. The groundfish fisheries-management system of the Scotia-Fundy area provides an interesting case history on the degree to which conservation objectives can be achieved despite considerable institutional and ecosystem uncertainty.

J	Cutcliffe, JR				Cutcliffe, JR			Qualified nurses' lived experience of violence perpetrated by individuals suffering from enduring mental health problems: a hermeneutic study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article							AGGRESSION; MANAGEMENT; STAFF	The incidence of violence within the National Health Service is rising and attention to the issue is increasing. Due to the ramifications in terms of physical, psychological and economic cost, the need to understand all the dynamics and variables involved in violence becomes evident. If nurses can provide care that reduces the frequency, intensity and negative consequences of violence, then clients, nurses and the organisation all benefit. This study attempted to discover the lived experience of nurses who experience violence perpetrated by individuals suffering from enduring mental health problems. It adopted a hermeneutic, phenomenological, method and produced an emerging theory comprised of the three key themes; Personal construct of violence, Feeling equipped and Feeling supported. Furthermore, the author suggests relationships between exposure to violent incidents and the nurse's ability to deal with the incidents therapeutically and how formal support systems for nurses influence this relationship.

J	Bennett, D; Vaidya, K; Zhao, HY				Bennett, D; Vaidya, K; Zhao, HY			Valuing transferred machine tool technology - Relating value to product attributes and preferences of acquirers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; machine tools; survey; technology transfer; value		The value of technology and the appropriate form of transfer arrangement are important questions to be resolved when transferring technology between Western manufacturing firms and partners in industrialising and developing countries. This article reports on surveys carried out in the machine tool industries in the UK and China to establish the differences and similarities between owners and acquirers of technology regarding the relative importance of the factors they evaluate, and the assessments they make, when considering a technology transfer. It also outlines the development of a framework for technology valuation. The survey results indicate that the value of product technology is related to superior technical performance, especially on reliability and functionality, and the prospects of premium prices and increased sales of the technology transfer based machine tools. Access to markets is the main objective of UK companies, while Chinese companies are concerned about improving their technological capability There are significant risks especially related to performance in the market, and while owners and acquirers have benefited in the short term, the long term collaboration required for strategic benefits has been difficult to achieve because of the different priorities of the owners and the acquirers.

J	Carayannis, EG; Alexander, J				Carayannis, EG; Alexander, J			Secrets of success and failure in commercializing US government R&D laboratory technologies: a structured case study approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						technology transfer; commercialization; case studies; metrics; evaluation; reengineering		With the end of Cold War, the US government started encouraging defence conversion and commercialization activities. Although currently highly contested in the political arena for their tangible short-term economic benefits, these activities have fostered multiple high-tech government-university-industry partnerships and helped shape regions of emerging clusters of high-tech entrepreneurship, such as the Rio Grande Technology Corridor in the southwestern United States, where Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories are located, or the Austin, Texas technopolis. This paper studies, compares and contrasts case studies of high-tech strategic alliances, spin-offs, CRADAs, and other related modalities of technology transfer and commercialization, it aims to enhance the understanding of the role and potential of a case study to produce powerful new 'performance metrics' which could complement structured, quantitative metrics in a hybrid approach to assessing and reengineering technology transfer and commercialization efforts. It could further lead towards the formulation of an effective mid-range theory for technology transfer and commercialization combining micro-level with macro-level elements and concepts.

J	Fuller, JB; Hester, K				Fuller, JB; Hester, K			Comparing the sample-weighted and unweighted meta-analysis: An applied perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							VALIDITY GENERALIZATION; ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT; SITUATIONAL SPECIFICITY; CREDIBILITY INTERVALS; JOB-SATISFACTION; METAANALYSIS; TURNOVER; VARIANCE; REFINEMENTS; PERCEPTIONS	An extensive comparison of the sample-weighted method (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990), and a newer unweighted method (Osburn & Callender, 1992) of meta-analysis is presented using actual data. Several of the advantages of the unweighted method predicted by Osburn and Callendar's simulation research did not always hold in actual application. Specifically, the unweighted method did not always produce larger estimates of observed variance, credibility intervals, and confidence intervals than the sample-weighted method when large sample outliers are present. Also, Osburn and Callender's research on mean sampling variance formulae did not generalize to meta-analysis using the average correlation estimator to measure sample error variance. Finally, results show that while both methods may generate similar parameter and variance estimates in primary meta-analysis, they may lead researchers to reach different substantive conclusions in the analysis of moderators.

J	Mair, A				Mair, A			Learning from Honda	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article							DESIGN SCHOOL DEBATE; STRATEGY	The case of the Honda Motor Company has been cited frequently in the strategic management literature. A review reveals that Honda's strategy has been used to illustrate and support apparently contradictory positions on a series of conceptual dichotomies, namely analytical planning versus learning, market positioning versus resource-based and, within the last of these, core competencies versus core capabilities. A critical analysis of this literature reveals empirical inaccuracies and a focus on Honda's strategic successes to the neglect of its failures. More significantly, explanations and general strategy implications are couched in terms of reductionist one-sided theories, a tendency which is only deepened when strategy thinkers debate 'the meaning of Honda'. This theoretical approach is particularly ill suited to Honda, an important strategic capability of which appears to be precisely the reconciliation of dichotomous management concepts. Western strategy thinkers have therefore missed the opportunity to develop a more appropriate and productive paradigm for learning from Honda.

The strategic management of technology is described as an approach that helps to link business strategy to technology strategy, and allows then the ranking of R&D subject priorities in coherence with the firm's overall strategy. Some strategy analysis models are assessed to show how this problem is incorporated and dealt with in the management literature. Then, the need for an integrated approach is pointed out, and an analytical method is developed to help firms in selecting their priorities in technology development and the way to investment in them. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated through its application to a French company.

These joint ventures or strategic alliances have a number of benefits that accrue to the various partners in the relationship. The difficulty is how to manage these relationships effectively across cultures and differing organizational/management philosophies. What is recommended is the development of a virtual management perspective and five different types of virtual relationships are examined.

J	Desai, C; Wright, G; Fletcher, K				Desai, C; Wright, G; Fletcher, K			Barriers to successful implementation of database marketing: A cross-industry study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SYSTEMS	This paper analyses perceived barriers to the deployment of database marketing (DBM) Systems in the financial services, retail and travel industries. Cost is perceived as a primary barrier to adoption across the three industries, However, retail and travel place relatively more importance on organisational and strategic barriers to adoption than do financial services organisations, The financial services industry, by contrast, views barriers to DBM deployment as, generally, technical in nature. We infer that such a view indicates that the future deployment of more sophisticated, strategically orientated, DBM systems within the financial services industry will be impeded. Within the retail and travel industries, use of increasingly sophisticated systems was found to be linked to an increasing recognition of the importance of a variety of organisational and strategic barriers, and in particular the existence of a database marketing strategy. We infer that the implementation of DBM in both retail and travel industries is driven by strategic issues and, as such, organisations in these industries are generally more likely to gain competitive advantage from their IT investment than organisations in the financial services industry.

J	Martin, JL				Martin, JL			Structures of power in naturally occurring communities	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; NETWORKS; EXCHANGE; POSITIONS; MODEL	This paper uses the sample of communes from Zablocki's study [Zablocki, Benjamin, 1980. Alienation and Charisma: A Study of Contemporary American Communes. The Free Press, New York] to test formal models of how interpersonal power relations are structured. Three alternative possibilities are explored-that observed power relations are derived from a single underlying status dimension, that they are derived from a differentiated status structure, and that there is no underlying structure at all. Some communes have latent status dimensions, others do not, but none have differentiated structures. Gel-rain causes and effects of the production of such status orders are explored.

Draws on research and experiences with firms in the region in order to enhance understandings of competitive dealings with two business networks that dominate the Southeast Asian economies - the Overseas Chinese and the Overseas Indians, collectively referred to as "the Networks". Measures the sparring rings in Asia through the historical conditions that contributed to the Networks' fighting stances and to Asian business environments. Proceeds to place the two Asian competitors under the spotlight by highlighting cultural differences between the Networks. Predicts the Networks' movements by elaborating on their unique management and strategic decision-making styles and discusses, finally, the implications of the Networks' business practices for MNCs' strategies and organizational restructuring in the Asian arena.

J	Powell, JM; Unger, PW				Powell, JM; Unger, PW			Alternatives to crop residues for sustaining agricultural productivity and natural resource conservation	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE			English	Article							LEPA IRRIGATION SYSTEM; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; ACID SANDY SOIL; PEARL-MILLET; WATER CONSERVATION; FURROW EROSION; SORGHUM STOVER; TILLAGE; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN	When left in fields after grain harvest, crop residues enhance nutrient cycling, soil and water conservation, and subsequent crop yield. However, many agricultural systems rely on crop residues for other uses, such as livestock feed, fuel, and construction material. This paper examines the key functions of crop residues in mixed crop-livestock farming systems and suggests alternatives to crop residues for sustaining agricultural productivity and natural resources. Various soil management and related practices allow crop residues to be removed without adversely affecting the soil environment. These include the introduction of alternative crop genotypes that produce both sufficient grain and residues of good quality; the partial rather than total removal of crop residues through selective crop residue harvest/return practices; provision and strategic use of chemical fertilizer and animal manure; substituting forages for crop residues; use of clean or reduced tillage; use of structural and support practices that complement tillage; and application of surface soil-amending materials. Not all practices are adaptable to all conditions, but one or more practices should be suitable for sustaining land productivity under most conditions where crop residues are limited or used for other purposes.

Industries and Market Power. In: Schmalensee, R., Willig, R. (Eds.), Handbook of Industrial Organization. North Holland, Amsterdam.] to estimate exchange rate pass-through in price and advertising. Price-cost margins, market structure and firm conduct are estimated endogenously, allowing for precise estimation of the degree of, and reasons for, incomplete pass-through. I demonstrate that price and advertising pass-through are functions of demand, cost and market conduct in the short run. In the long run, the market conduct and cost technologies are, in turn, determined by the exchange rate movements. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Powell, JH				Powell, JH			An application of a network-based futures method to strategic business planning	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						management; networks and graphs; strategic planning		An analysis of the possible future development paths for the business environment of a medium-sized company operating in the advertising and media sector has been carried out using extended field anomaly relaxation (EFAR). It indicates that a number of development paths exist for the company, the main issues confronting it being location and share structure. The constraints imposed by the environment on the choice of these two conditioning factors are severe and less freedom of action is evident than was perceived to be present before the analysis. For example, the option of relocating to Central London can be seen clearly to be consistent with only a major share sale amounting to exiting the business. The option of a majority or minority share deal together with a relocation to a single site and retaining a London front office emerged as an attractive option for the company. Certain structural characteristics surrounding the share structure are observed. Development of the situation continued after the analysis was reported, leading to confirmation of the validity of the method.

J	Woehr, DJ; Miller, MJ				Woehr, DJ; Miller, MJ			Distributional ratings of performance: More evidence for a new rating format	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EQUIVALENCE; TESTS	We examined the extent to which performance ratings obtained using a distributional rating format differ from ratings obtained using a more typical global rating scale format We sought to determine whether a distributional format actually elicits different information than a global format and the extent to which measures of within performance variability derived from distributional ratings are related to levels of interrater agreement on global rating scales. Confirmatory factor-analyses of three models of measurement equivalence indicated that a model of tau-equivalence in which the two rating formats provided similar measurements but with differing levels of measurement error provided the best fit to the data. Further we found a large, significant relationship between measures of within dimension performance variability and interrater agreement. Our results suggest that a distributional rating format is a viable alternative rating format that may provide a richer source of information than do more typical global rating scales.

J	Orbell, J; Zeng, LC; Mulford, M				Orbell, J; Zeng, LC; Mulford, M			Individual experience and the fragmentation of societies	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article							COOPERATORS ADVANTAGE; EVOLUTION; TRUST; EXIT	We use computer simulations to show how social fragmentation and consequent social loss can result from six innocuous cognitive and behavioral assumptions. These assumptions govern individuals' choices with respect to each other and are independent of processes associated with fragmentation in various classical literatures. We model ''society'' as a set of individuals who encounter each other in circumstances that permit potentially productive bur also risky relationships with each other. Individuals (1) have the option of playing Prisoner's Dilemma games with others they encounter, but they do nor have to; (2) have preferences over mutual cooperation and free-riding outcomes; (3) have expectations about each other's play; (4) have observable cateogry ''tags''; (5) can modify their future responses to ''tagged'' individuals based on experience; (6) can search out partners they believe represent good prospects for productive relationships. In these terms, the only condition necessary for fragmentation to emerge is that some circumstance makes the probability of encounters across ''tagged'' categories unequal, and a difference in sizes of categories, however slight, is sufficient to do that. Same difference in category sizes is, for practical purposes, inevitable, and thus so are pressures toward fragmentation.

J	Everett, MG; Borgatti, SP				Everett, MG; Borgatti, SP			Exact colorations of graphs and digraphs	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article							REGULAR EQUIVALENCE; EXCHANGE NETWORKS; POWER; COLORINGS	A coloration is an exact regular coloration if whenever two vertices are colored the same they have identically colored neighborhoods. For example, if one of the two vertices that are colored the same is connected to three yellow vertices, two white and red, then the other vertex is as well. Exact regular colorations have been discussed informally in the social network literature. However they have been part of the mathematical literature for some time, though in a different format. We explore this concept in terms of social networks and illustrate some important results taken from the mathematical literature. In addition we show how the concept can be extended to ecological and perfect colorations, and discuss how the CATREGE algorithm can be extended to find the maximal exact regular coloration of a graph.

Previous investment in advertising can lower a firm's cost to introduce new products allowing it to credibly preempt potential entrants. Entrants may not have enough residual share to find it profitable to enter later, and incumbents find it profitable to keep new products in the marker even if entrants choose to enter. I present empirical evidence from the RTE cereal industry.			Thomas, LA (corresponding author), UNIV PENN, WHARTON SCH, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104 USA.

J	Kettinger, WJ; Teng, JTC; Guha, S				Kettinger, WJ; Teng, JTC; Guha, S			Information architectural design in business process reengineering	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Business process reengineering and information architecture share a common strategic and business process focus. Both can be mutually supportive of each other's objectives. Information architecture design can produce a stable IA capable of supporting existing as well as improved business processes. Reciprocally, business process redesign (BPR) provides a high profile business justification for the IA endeavour. Given proper collaboration between corporate and IT strategic planners, both BPR and IA efforts should produce a number of valuable common outputs. These include the identification of business processes within an organization, the prioritization of these processes based on their strategic relevance, the establishment of process performance measures, and the modelling of these processes and their supporting information resources. A synergistic model of IA and BPR is presented and selected IA techniques and modelling methods are recommended. Future research is suggested concerning the need to test the relationship between BPR and IA.

J	Fulghieri, P; Nagarajan, S				Fulghieri, P; Nagarajan, S			On the strategic role of high leverage in entry deterrence	JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE			English	Article						debt; predatory pricing; asymmetric information	CAPITAL STRUCTURE; INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; AGENCY COSTS; REPUTATION; PREDATION; FIRMS	This paper examines the strategic role of high levels of debt and bankruptcy threats in deterring entry into monopolistic markets. In the context of an infinite horizon entry game, we show that if a potential entrant has access to debt financing with limited liability, the unique sub-game perfect equilibrium involves the entrant successfully issuing a high level of debt, entering the market and being met with cooperation. If, in addition to the entrant, the incumbent also has access to debt with limited liability, it will be highly levered and will completely pre-empt any entry in equilibrium. Finally, if the incumbent faces a variety of potential entrants with differing abilities to capture market shares, its optimal capital structure will help pre-empt the entry of the tougher entrants, while allowing the weaker ones to share the market. The results of extreme leverage are also shown to hold in an alternative formulation analyzed by Kreps and Wilson (1982) and Milgrom and Roberts (1982), and thus are robust to model specifications. The empirical implications and possible application to high leverage industries are briefly discussed.

J	BACK, WE; BELL, LC				BACK, WE; BELL, LC			QUANTIFYING PROCESS BENEFITS OF ELECTRONIC DATA MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article								Establishing and maintaining a strategic advantage in a globally competitive business environment requires focus on electronic data management (EDM) technologies that facilitate work-now automation and process reengineering. Effective implementation of EDM technologies requires a strategic, innovative, and cooperative approach to electronic document management. To date, a methodology for quantitative analysis of time and cost benefits attributable to EDM technologies has been difficult to structure due to the complexity of predicting the organizational changes resulting from their implementation. Additionally, implementation of EDM technologies will impact individual work task durations, work-now precedence, and resource (labor) requirements. This is particularly true when multiple technologies are considered for concurrent implementation. This research developed a methodology for quantifying the time and cost benefits attributable to implementation of EDM technologies when applied to the major functional process of materials management. Data provided by leading engineering/construction companies were incorporated into four process models, each representing a distinct level of corporate information integration. The research shows that time and cost process benefits attributable to EDM technologies are significant.

J	TOMBAK, MM				TOMBAK, MM			MULTINATIONAL PLANT LOCATION AS A GAME OF TIMING	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						STRATEGIC PLANT LOCATION; GAMES OF TIMING	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; UNCERTAINTY; TECHNOLOGY; MODEL	We study the problem of when firms should switch from exporting to producing at an onshore plant which will cater to a local market. The model incorporates factors such as rivalry, differences between costs of domestic and offshore production, differences in consumer preferences for offshore and domestically produced goods, and the capital costs associated with switching to domestic production. We find equilibrium timing patterns where there is a leader and a follower (diffusion equilibria) to be most typical. Furthermore, we find that a firm with lower switching costs has a competitive advantage in the determination of which firm will lead. It is found in the duopoly model that market growth and production and transportation unit costs have a relatively greater impact on the timing of the switch than do changes in demand elasticities or changes in the fixed costs of switching. With more firms and increased competition, however, the effect of changes in fixed costs become relatively greater.

J	GATTIKER, UE				GATTIKER, UE			FIRM AND TAXPAYER RETURNS FROM TRAINING OF SEMISKILLED EMPLOYEES	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							PERSONNEL PROGRAMS; UTILITY ANALYSIS; JOB; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; SEPARATIONS; WAGES	In response to the increasingly rapid occurrence of skill obsolescence, governments are exploring programs to provide incentives for worker training. Net present value analysis was used to assess the benefits of subsidized computer training for semiskilled officer workers in Canada. Results suggest that government sponsorship yielded positive returns for taxpayers and firms, provided training was general and not firm-specific. High turnover made firm-specific training unattractive, A combination of on-the-job training for practice and classroom instruction for general training appears most beneficial for both employees and firms. The findings shed new light on the applicability of human capital theory in a rapidly changing work environment.

J	MARTINSONS, MG; TSENG, CS				MARTINSONS, MG; TSENG, CS			HIGH-TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT IN CHINA - A CASE-STUDY OF THE SHANGHAI SUCCESS STORIES	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER; HIGH-TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT; QUALITY CONTROL; PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA; SHANGHAI; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; JOINT VENTURES	JOINT VENTURES; RISKS; EAST; WEST	An Open Door Policy has encouraged foreign direct investment (FDI) into the People's Republic of China (PRC) since the late 1970s. Cultural affinities and geographic proximities help to explain the dominant investment role of the Nanyang Chinese to date. The PRC is now actively seeking greater participation from Western and Japanese firms, Their technology is deemed critical for further modernization in China, Higher-technology firms are being lured to Shanghai, a city with a cosmopolitan past, a solid industrial tradition and a strategic location. In their own cross-cultural research venture, the authors examined seven pioneering higher-technology joint ventures in greater Shanghai. Each has a Western partner and has achieved success by designing, realizing and maintaining a delicate venture-level equilibrium within a dynamic macroenvironment. These exemplars are used to provide high-technology venturers in liberalizing economies with a comprehensive and empirically-based prescription for success.

For the hypothetical data considered in this paper, a likability methods factor produced significant changes in estimates of the structural parameters relating the predictors to the criterion. Regression analyses using two methods factors as covariates yielded similar results. The advantages of employing the more complicated LISREL analysis versus more familiar regression analysis are discussed and some suggestions for future research using the structural equations approach are presented.

J	FUMERO, F; VERCELLIS, C				FUMERO, F; VERCELLIS, C			CAPACITY ANALYSIS IN REPETITIVE ASSEMBLE-TO-ORDER MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Workshop on Project Management and Scheduling	JUL, 1992	COMO, ITALY			ASSEMBLE-TO-ORDER; PROJECT MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTION PLANNING; LAGRANGEAN RELAXATION; CAPACITY ANALYSIS	COMPANIES; SIZE	The application of traditional make-to-stock planning tools to manufacturing to orders often results scarcely effective, since the strategic and tactical goals, the available control levers and the features of the markets may substantially differ in the two contexts. Alternatively, production to order has been organized and run by means of project management methods, such as precedence networks. However, also these classes of techniques often weaken their efficiency when applied in a repetitive manufacturing environment, since they do not fully exploit the specificity of assemble-to-order production systems. In this paper we develop a hierarchical planning approach for assemble-to-order capacity planning based on Lagrangean relaxation, which allows to integrate the management of earlier production stages, in which inventories of subassemblies are maintained, with the final assembling stages, providing greater control over the lead times.

J	JONES, RA				JONES, RA			AMBIVALENT CARTESIANS - DURKHEIM, MONTESQUIEU, AND METHOD	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article								Recent scholarship has emphasized Durkheim's early debt to German social science. Why, then, did Durkheim write his Latin thesis on Montesquieu, insisting that the latter had ''laid down the principles of the new science''? The answer is twofold: first because Montesquieu himself was extremely ambivalent about the French Enlightenment's confident legacy of Cartesian rationalism and second because this made Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws the ''perfect forge'' within which Durkheim could explore his own ambivalence about the relative merits of French rationalism and German empiricism, and thus shape the tool-the comparative method-he applied in The Division of Labor in Society.

It was determined that additional revenue could be produced from salvageable jewelry if the value of the items could be accurately determined. This meant the jewelry had to be appraised by experienced gemologists to determine the most profitable disposition. The gemologists' productivity suffered because the appraisal was extremely labor intensive. To address this problem, an automated multimedia system utilizing electronically linked measuring instruments, voice recognition, and interconnected LAN databases was developed, Although the unique voice recognition feature of the system was later abandoned, the use of the system enhanced productivity. This paper describes the systems development, its subsequent evolution, and the lessons learned from the process.

J	DANIEL, SJ; REITSPERGER, WD				DANIEL, SJ; REITSPERGER, WD			STRATEGIC CONTROL-SYSTEMS FOR QUALITY - AN EMPIRICAL-COMPARISON OF THE JAPANESE AND UNITED-STATES ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article							PERFORMANCE; ATTITUDES	Management control systems should be designed to complement the strategies pursued. Few empirical studies, however, have focused on management control systems for quality control and zero-defect strategies. This study compares quality strategies and their relationships with management control systems in the Japanese and U.S. electronics industry. The results indicate that the quality strategies of U.S. manufacturing managers reflect adherence to zero-defect philosophies more than those of the Japanese managers. However, fewer U.S. managers receive management control information to support these zero-defect strategies. Tests linking quality strategies to management control information provide limited evidence that those U.S. managers who have adopted zero-defect strategies are more likely to receive modified management control information than U.S. managers who have not adopted zero-defect strategies. In contrast, the data suggest that Japanese managers are provided with goal-setting and feedback information about quality performance regardless of their adherence to a zero-defect versus a traditional quality management strategy, thus focussing workers' attention on continuous quality improvement.

However, there are still some questions left unanswered. What specific dimensions of the organization and strategy should be considered? When should they be considered? How could they be interrelated during the process of implementation? This article tries to look at these questions through (1) the development of a conceptual model linking the organization, technology, and strategy through management, (2) the division of the implementation process into four stages, and (3) the proposal of a general framework of the implementation guide.

These tend to focus on problems of 'integration' or 'control' at the point of production. But this neglects the interplay between organizations and the wider structure of IS expertise; the latter being shaped by the evolving computer technology regime and the IS occupation's ability to colonize technological knowledge. In this context, the management of expertise is better viewed as an evolving series of 'problem-solutions'.

The development of strategic information systems: some case studies and research proposals	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							DECISION-PROCESSES; USER INVOLVEMENT; TOP MANAGEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; SUCCESS; POWER	The strategic potential of information systems (IS) is widely recognised. However, there is a need to understand better the process leading to strategic IS applications and the way in which it may be affected by the context. This paper presents four case studies of the decision making, design and development, and implementation processes leading to strategic, intra-organizational systems. These cases are used to develop a set of general and contingency propositions about the strategic IS development process. The general propositions represent a longitudinal model of the role of senior management during various phases of the process, while the contingency propositions relate the nature of the process to four contextual factors, namely the organization's size, environmental uncertainty, the sector to which the organization belongs, and the maturity of its IS function. These propositions should serve as a basis for future empirical research on strategic IS development.

Unfortunately, it is also a high-risk initiative. The planning, development and implementation of such a system is a very difficult process. The presence of an individual to advocate and guide an SIS project from its genesis to realization is essential. This article considers the characteristics of the individuals who champion these high-risk and high-reward projects, examines their specific role in the successful adoption of a strategic information system and discusses how modem business can identify and cultivate such individuals.

J	ROBINSON, RV				ROBINSON, RV			ECONOMIC NECESSITY AND THE LIFE-CYCLE IN THE FAMILY ECONOMY OF 19TH-CENTURY INDIANAPOLIS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							MANUFACTURING CENSUSES; CHILDREN; WOMEN; WORK	The hypothesis that economic strategies (wives' employment, children's employment, and taking in boarders) were adopted out of necessity by working-class families and at the point in the family life cycle when need was greatest is tested on a sample of families living in Indianapolis from 1860 to 1880. Loss of husband's income led some wives to seek employment, but generally did not lead families to use other strategies. Middle-class families were as likely as working-class families to use economic strategies. Families did, however, make more use of economic strategies as they moved through the most financially stressful stage of the life cycle-when the largest number of children lived at home. Thus, all three economic strategies showed a rise-and-fall pattern as families moved through the life cycle.

After a long spell of crisis management, urban planners have come to realize the need to plan with uncertainty. That implies an explicit understanding of the implications of quantitative as well as qualitative uncertainty. Various approaches for this type of planning have been experimented with, in different urban communities. This paper discusses the application of futures studies in the Municipality of Vasteras and of the strategic choice approach in the Municipality of Koping. The aim of the comparative study is to relate the experience in applying the two methodologies and to evaluate the issues as well as contexts to which the two methodologies can be applied.

J	CONLON, EJ; STONE, TH				CONLON, EJ; STONE, TH			ABSENCE SCHEMA AND MANAGERIAL JUDGMENT	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ABSENTEEISM	Two studies investigated the cognitive categorization of absences by managers. In study 1, managers produced absence patterns for hypothetical employees who were labeled as having excellent, typical, uncontrollable, and controllable absence-prone attendance records. In study 2, managers rated the reliability of employees with absence patterns like those found in study 1. Study 1 found the distinction between excellent and absence-prone employees was related mainly to the total days absent and absence-episode parameters of prototypical absence records. The controllability distinction affected the proportions of absences reported as excused or adjacent to scheduled days off. Study 2 obtained results generally consistent with study 1 but found that the adjacency manipulation produced the hypothesized results only for experienced managers.

The system, which we have labelled as an organizational effectiveness system (OES), is designed to ensure the health and well-being of an organization in an increasingly complex and turbulent world. Its purpose and net effect are to allow the organization to be flexible and responsive. PRISM, a system developed at Federal Express Corporation, is an imitable example of such a system. As an advanced multi-technology system, it includes core personnel functions, expanded personnel and organizational functions, and extensive external interface features. The PRISM system permits significant and constant interactions with all managers and all employees. This paper describes PRISM in considerable detail, as well as its impact and benefits. By extrapolating from the Federal Express experience, critical success factors are derived for the development and implementation of organizational effectiveness systems in other organizations.

Specifically, the study focuses on three structural characteristics of the acquiring and acquired firm's market to explain the change in the systematic or environmental risk of the acquiring firm. These structural factors are the level of competition in the acquiring firm's industry, the level of competition in the acquired firm's industry, and the growth rate of the acquiring firm's industry. The findings suggest that vertical mergers are effective at reducing systematic risk particularly when the acquiring firm competes in a concentrated market. Further, this result appears to be stable across life cycle stages.

By focussing on what Williamson (1985) calls the 'incentive limits' of firms, conditions that should exacerbate the problems facing these firms as they diversify are identified. Empirical testing of hypotheses drawn from this discussion is conducted using a sample of nonutility, nonregulated subsidiaries of 54 electric utilities. The analysis, using both linear regression and event history methods, confirms the connection between the characteristics of the regulated parent company and subsidiary performance. The paper concludes with a discussion of how further research might extend the state of knowledge on the topic of the economic losses of bureaucracy.

CQI involves a chain of events: Improvement in quality leads to decreased costs because of less rework, fewer mistakes, fewer delays, and better use of people and materials; productivity improves; better quality and lower price facilitate capturing the market, staying in business, and providing more jobs. The implementation of CQI within an organization involves the development, standardization, and deployment of standard methods and the use of daily management, cross-functional management, policy management, departmental management, and quality control circles to maintain, improve, or innovate standard methods. An organization's standard methods, key indicators (indicators for measuring performance of the organization's key functions), and standards emanate from its vision and mission statements and midterm and short-term strategic plans. In a quality control audit, an agreed-upon method, as monitored through a key indicator, is used to measure a result against an established standard; when a problem is detected, a quality control diagnosis is conducted and the method is changed if necessary. Use of this process requires the creation of standard methods for all important aspects of the organization's services, including operations, clinical services, and training of personnel. Health-care managers can use the principles of CQI in assessing the quality of care provided.

J	PAVIA, TM				PAVIA, TM			PRODUCT GROWTH STRATEGIES IN YOUNG HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIRMS	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							INDUSTRIAL; INNOVATION; SUCCESS; PERFORMANCE; FAILURE; MODEL	This article presents an analysis of the strategies, business practices and growth patterns of 68 small, young, high-technology firms. These firms manufactured high-technology goods or produced advanced computer software products, had at most 100 employees and reported under $30 million in annual sales. In reporting the results of her study, Teresa Pavia writes that neither a technological growth path (new products to existing customers) nor a market-expansion growth path (existing products to new customers) is superior. Practices that minimize strategic dependencies and produce a high-quality product that suits the customer's needs directly (needing no further modifications after the sale) are associated with success. Firms that have used market expansion to grow demonstrate higher levels of systematic planning and describe their industry as rapidly changing. Furthermore, they describe themselves as technologically innovative and their customers as well informed about the products they buy.

J	ARMENAKIS, AA; MOSSHOLDER, KW; HARRIS, SG				ARMENAKIS, AA; MOSSHOLDER, KW; HARRIS, SG			DIAGNOSTIC BIAS IN ORGANIZATIONAL CONSULTATION	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ORGANIZATIONAL DIAGNOSIS; DIAGNOSTIC MODELS; HEURISTICS	STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING; JUDGMENT; GROWTH	This article is intended to improve consultation practice by explaining the significance of models, heuristics, and diagnostic aids in organizational diagnosis. The role of diagnostic models in determining the consultant's frame of reference is explained. Evidence that organizational consultants consciously use diagnostic models is provided by citing two independent studies that revealed about 70% of the consultants reported that a diagnostic model was used. The availability, representativeness, and anchoring heuristics used by diagnosticians are summarized and examples of their use are cited. Readers are warned that bias occurs from misapplying the heuristics. However, guidance on correctly applying the heuristics is provided. The development and improvement of diagnostic expertise is explained from the perspective of learning through education as well as feedback received from clients, colleagues (as shadow consultants and as consulting team members), and self. Thus, written from the perspective of a consultant, the article provides a practical presentation on diagnostic bias, supported by theory and empirical research. It should appeal not only to a consulting constituency (i.e. practicing consultants, consultant trainers, and novice consultants), but also to the large number of potential clients (i.e. organizational decision-makers). Future research directions are discussed in terms of (1) the research that has identified relationships between consultant characteristics (e.g. Jungian constructs) and diagnostic information, and (2) the potential of expert systems in organizational diagnosis.

Approaches to Strategic Planning for Information Resource Management (IRM) in Multinational Corporations	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Strategic planning; Information Resource Management; office automation; telecommunications; multinational coordination practices; key requirements; key ideas; framework and components		Multnational corporations (MNCs) face increasingly higher rewards and risks when choosing amongst alternative investments for their computer and communications based information systems. The multi-layered management and technical issues and decisions confronting multinational corporations are seemingly endless and require new insights. A rapidly growing number of MNCs are utilizing computer based information systems, office automation and administrative support systems, telecommunications systems, factory information systems, and home information systems as critical fools in managing and monitoring their global businesses. As the resources, scope, and criticality of the "information commodity" grow, more senior managers are being forced to concentrate on better ways of planning for rapid changes to capitalize on new opportunities and reduce their risks. The conclusions and recommendations presented in this article are based on an examination of the actual information resource management (IRM) planning and coordination practices of 25 large multinational corporations as well as an indepth review of two case studies.

J	Tubaro, P				Tubaro, Paola			Whose results are these anyway? Reciprocity and the ethics of "giving back" after social network research	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Research ethics; Reporting results to study participants; Reciprocity; Communication outside academia; Social network research; Network visualization	METHODOLOGY	Bridging the social networks, field methods and ethics literatures, I make the case that the process of reporting research findings is an ethical issue, and recommend elevating it in the research design. I draw on a reflective account of three research experiences with settings in, respectively, online health communities, economic or-ganizations, and the mainstream media. I proceed in steps, discussing release of personal network results to individual participants, of whole network results to the researched community, and finally of general results to wider audiences, under a unifying idea that a reciprocity obligation underlies the reporting process. I claim that communication should follow an iterative rather than a linear approach to reach all relevant stakeholders, thereby mitigating the vulnerabilities that arise from research.

J	Trivedi, A; Jakhar, SK; Sinha, D				Trivedi, Ashish; Jakhar, Suresh Kumar; Sinha, Daneshwar			Analyzing barriers to inland waterways as a sustainable transportation mode in India: A dematel-ISM based approach	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Inland waterways; DEMATEL; ISM; Decision support; Sustainable transport	BAYESIAN NETWORK; WASTE MANAGEMENT; PORT; NAVIGATION; IMPROVE; DESIGN	Finding sustainable measures for maritime transport has long been a significant issue owing to a rising global population and the internationalization of supply chains. In Indian contexts, it has become imperative to shift from highly congested and polluting road and rail transport to a more sustainable Inland Waterway Transport (IWT). Inland waterway transportation has numerous limitations and chal-lenges in its implementation. This study aims to study the barriers to the implementation of IWTs in India by establishing and analyzing the complex interrelationships between them. Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methods are employed to analyze the cause-effect relationship among the barriers and to further identify the key influential barriers from an identified set of factors. The results reveal that governance issues, policy bias, high cost requirements, and lack of river-interlinking are the most critical inhibitors for IWT development in India and the policymakers should focus on eliminating these 'key' inhibitors to ensure effective imple-mentation of IWT in India. The findings of this study provide useful insights from a strategic and policy -making perspective. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Thomas, LDW; Ritala, P				Thomas, Llewellyn D. W.; Ritala, Paavo			Ecosystem Legitimacy Emergence: A Collective Action View	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						ecosystem; legitimacy; emergence; ecosystem identity; collective action; process		Ecosystems-communities of interdependent yet hierarchically independent heterogeneous participants who collectively generate an ecosystem value proposition-often emerge through collective action, where ecosystem participants interact with each other and the external environment. When such organizational forms are emerging, they require legitimacy to overcome the "liability of newness." Adopting a collective action lens and taking a legitimacy-as-process approach, we propose a process model of ecosystem collective action, where an orchestrator, complementors, users, and external actors together drive ecosystem legitimacy. We identify three key legitimation processes-discursive legitimation, performative legitimation, and ecosystem identity construction-and demonstrate how these three processes together facilitate the emergence of ecosystem legitimacy and reduce the liability of newness of emerging ecosystems.

J	Choudhury, A; Behl, A; Sheorey, PA; Pal, A				Choudhury, Akanksha; Behl, Abhishek; Sheorey, Pratima Amol; Pal, Abhinav			Digital supply chain to unlock new agility: a TISM approach	BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Digital supply chain; Industry 4; 0; Total interpretive structural modeling (TISM); Redesign organization; Supply chain management; Customer satisfaction	MANAGEMENT	Purpose Traditional supply chain arrangements have failed to keep up with escalating customer demands and breakthrough innovations. The way forward is a flexible yet innovative network that leverages ecosystem partners and digital tools to unlock new agility. The paper aims at identifying and analyzing numerous critical success factors (CSFs) that may improve the efficiency of a digital supply chain. Design/methodology/approach Twelve CSFs are identified in this paper through an extensive literature survey. Expert opinion has been considered and the hierarchical structure built using total interpretative structural modeling (TISM) which highlights the interdependencies between these CSFs. Cross-impact matrix multiplication (MICMAC) is used to determine the driving and dependence power of each factor. Findings This study identified 12 CSFs through an extensive literature survey. The ISM model resulted in six different levels beginning from redesign organization at the bottom of the structure. The TISM model explained why redesigning the organization is pivotal to bringing about novel agility in the supply chain. MICMAC analysis confirmed that the following enhanced the success of a digital supply chain: Sales and Operation Planning Strategies, Strategic Sourcing Techniques, Smart Manufacturing Processes and Warehouse Management. Research limitations/implications Various other components contributing to the 12 CSFs identified in this paper may be discovered and detailed in future research. Additionally, further research is required to expand the existing technology-based services structural model to a more empirical form. Practical implications This study offers a comprehensive but not exhaustive list of CSFs essential to digital supply chain growth. It will enable market experts and leaders to concentrate on key factors leading to tactical decisions and maximum value for firms. Originality/value The paper seeks to add to the body of knowledge on real digitally-led supply chain transformation, which is still in its early stages. This study is one of the first, if not the first, to examine success factors critical to the improvement of the performance of the supply chain. It lays the foundation for further research in this field.

Enterprises are becoming more agile, adaptive, and ambidextrous in order to boost innovation in the current digital transformation era. Nowadays, "digital innovation" is closely associated with Industry 4.0 enablers and smart enterprises. Prior research has shown that while multinational enterprises-across many sectors-have already embraced the aforementioned advancements, their adoption by small and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has so far taken place mainly in the manufacturing sector. Thus, based on a sample of 280 self-tuned smart manufacturing SMEs and having utilized the structural equation modeling (SEM), this study was aimed to investigate how digital innovation is influenced by the three pillars of self-tuning models-agility, adaptation, and ambidexterity. Our paper has focussed on the digital systems in which SMEs, spurred by networking and open innovation solutions, operate and innovate in response to external triggers, displaying a balance between exploration and exploitation, and a strong agile capacity.

J	Wang, WJ; You, XY				Wang, Wen-jing; You, Xue-yi			Benefits analysis of classification of municipal solid waste based on system dynamics	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Municipal solid waste (MSW); Waste management; Classification; System dynamics (SD); Benefit assessment; Greenhouse gases	METHANE EMISSIONS; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; GENERATION; LANDFILL; FOOD; PERSPECTIVE; COLLECTION; REDUCTION	The problem of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) has become increasingly prominent that hinders the harmonious development of society. China recently regards the classification of municipal solid waste as one of the important strategies for national ecological civilization construction. However, the published references have not considered simultaneously on the classification effects of MSW in views of economy, resource, and environment. For this purpose, an integrated system dynamic model is developed for evaluating the impact of waste classification on the aspects of socio-economy, environment and resource. The application of the proposed model is shown using a case study in Tianjin, China during 2006-2017. The socioeconomic benefits show that as the separate rate increases, socioeconomic benefits change from negative to positive values and the maximum socioeconomic benefit could have reached to 0.36% of Tianjin's GDP. The environmental assessment indicates that the yearly reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2-equivalent) from 2006 to 2017 could have ranged from 1.03 to 1.46 million ton due to waste at classification. The results also reveal for every 1% increase in the separate rate, the range of yearly land saved could have been between 502.92 and 2918.59 m(2). The system dynamic model and present results are important to policy makers, strategic planners and researchers to realize and predict the importance of waste classification, which encourages residents to actively participate in the action of waste classification.

J	He, J; Mao, Y; Morrison, AM; Coca-Stefaniak, JA				He, Jie; Mao, Yan; Morrison, Alastair M.; Coca-Stefaniak, J. Andres			On being warm and friendly: the effect of socially responsible human resource management on employee fears of the threats of COVID-19	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational trust; Socially responsible HRM (SRHRM); Event system theory; COVID-19 event strength; Fear of external threats; Social support theory		Purpose This paper aims to investigate the influence of socially- responsible human resource management (SRHRM) on employee fears of external threats during the COVID-19 outbreak, based on social support and event system theories. COVID-19 caused sharp profit declines and bankruptcies of hotels, restaurants and travel agencies. In addition, employees faced threats to their health and job security. How to overcome employee anxieties and fears about the negative impacts of this crisis and promote psychological recovery is worthy of attention from researchers and practitioners. This research investigated the impacts of SRHRM on employee fears through organizational trust, with the COVID-19 pandemic playing a moderating role between SRHRM and employee fears. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses were tested through multiple linear regression analysis based on a survey of 408 employees in hospitality and tourism firms in China. Qualitative data were also gathered through interviews with selected managers. Findings The results showed that SRHRM had a negative influence on employee fears of external threats by enhancing trust in their organizations. In addition, the strength of the COVID-19 pandemic positively moderated the effect of SRHRM on employee fears. When the pandemic strength was more robust, the negative effects of SRHRM on employee fears were more significant. Research limitations/implications This research illustrated the contribution of SRHRM in overcoming employee fears of external threats in the context of COVID-19. It shed light on the organizational contribution of SRHRM to hospitality and tourism employee psychological recovery during the crisis. Originality/value This research explored strategic HRM by examining the effects of SRHRM on employee fears in the midst of a severe crisis, specifically COVID-19. The moderation effect of event strength and mediation effect of organizational trust were tested. It is of great value for hospitality and tourism firms to foster employee psychological recovery during a crisis such as COVID-19.

W.; Bao, Zhikang; Chi, Bin; Webster, Chris			Cross-jurisdictional construction waste material trading: Learning from the smart grid	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Construction waste; Cross-jurisdictional trading; Smart grid; Circular economy; Sharing economy	DEMOLITION WASTE; MANAGEMENT; CHALLENGES; SYSTEM; TRENDS; ENERGY; URBAN	Construction waste materials are resources misplaced. Trading them across different jurisdictions is an innovative way to reuse or recycle the materials, which in turn obtains "cleaner production" in the construction sector. It can achieve a win-win situation between the demand and supply sides, but several hurdles must be overcome first. A particular hurdle is that demand and supply of such materials arises sporadically in discrete sites, thereby matching the two sides is not always opportune. We find parallels in the energy sector, where smart grids have been developed to store power generated sporadically by small producers and distribute it to individual users based on their (erratic) needs. Learning from smart grids, this research aims to shed light on innovative institutional arrangements promoting the development of an effective cross-jurisdictional construction waste material trading market. Underpinning this research is a mixed-method approach including cross-sectoral learning and a case study encompassing a series of site visits and semi-structured interviews in China's Greater Bay Area. By comparing the commonalities between electricity and construction waste in terms of production, market, transmission, distribution, and consumption, we elaborate smart grid innovations and their possible applications to construction waste materials trading. Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on waste management, the circular economy, and the sharing economy. It will help establish a cross-jurisdictional waste material trading market in the Greater Bay Area.

J	Wolff, S; Bronner, M; Held, M; Lienkamp, M				Wolff, S.; Broenner, M.; Held, M.; Lienkamp, M.			Transforming automotive companies into sustainability leaders: A concept for managing current challenges	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Sustainability; Automotive; Manufacturers; Management; Transformation; SDG; Development	CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; PROJECT; GOVERNANCE; INDUSTRY; MODEL; CSR; RESPONSIBILITY; TECHNOLOGIES	Dieselgate and the public focus on sustainability raise the question to what extent sustainability is implemented in automotive companies. Although, mandatory reporting tracks companies' sustainability strategies and goals, this does not entail comprehensive operational measures to increase company sustainability. To analyze internal sustainability perspectives and measures, we examine benchmarking initiatives and corporate sustainability reports and compare them to interviews with employees of automobile manufacturers from management to operational level. This comparison shows that the transformation to sustainable companies is hindered by a lack of a common understanding of sustainability, a failure to assign responsibility, and the absence of measurable sustainability targets. To close the gap between the communicated strategy and operational implementation, we propose the concept of the "Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Owner". Analogous to the Product Owner (from Scrum) and Process Owner (from Lean Management) concepts, an SDG Owner is responsible for implementation and performance of sustainable products or process transformations by setting transparent, quantified, and well-defined defined sustainability goals. Thus, the SDG owner links the sustainability goals at management level with those at implementation level enabling a successful corporate transformation into sustainability leaders.

J	Luu, DT				Luu, Dung Tien			The effect of internal corporate social responsibility practices on pharmaceutical firm's performance through employee intrapreneurial behaviour	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Firm performance; Innovative behaviour; Micro-CSR; Strategic renewal behaviour; Venture behaviour	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; WORK BEHAVIOR; CSR; MEDIATION; STRATEGY; SUGGESTIONS; PERCEPTIONS	Purpose The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between employee perceived internal corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and pharmaceutical firms' performance with the mediating role of employee intrapreneurial behaviour. Design/methodology/approach The study sample consisted of 607 employees at pharmaceutical firms in Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam. The data was analysed by a structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings The results revealed that the model fitted well into the empirical data considering the goodness-of-fit measures. The estimates results revealed the significant total effects of employee perception of internal CSR practices on pharmaceutical firms' performances through the influencing mechanism of employee intrapreneurial behaviour. Practical implications Employee welfare is a fundamental factor for organisational performance. Ethical organisations might yield prosperity through innovation employee behaviour.

A few key cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have been robustly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Several novel biomarkers are very promising, especially blood-based markers. However, many biomarker findings have had low reproducibility despite initial promising results. In this perspective, we identify possible sources for low reproducibility of studies on fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease. We suggest guidelines for researchers and journal editors, with the aim to improve reproducibility of findings. Many fluid biomarker findings have had low reproducibility despite initially promising results. Here, the authors review possible sources for low reproducibility of studies on fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases and suggest guidelines for the biomarker community to agree on and implement.

Leveraging health system telehealth and informatics infrastructure to create a continuum of services for COVID-19 screening, testing, and treatment	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						telehealth; informatics; pandemic; health systems		Objectives: We describe our approach in using health information technology to provide a continuum of services during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 challenges and needs required health systems to rapidly redesign the delivery of care. Materials and Methods: Our health system deployed 4 COVID-19 telehealth programs and 4 biomedical informatics innovations to screen and care for COVID-19 patients. Using programmatic and electronic health record data, we describe the implementation and initial utilization. Results: Through collaboration across multidisciplinary teams and strategic planning, 4 telehealth program initiatives have been deployed in response to COVID-19: virtual urgent care screening, remote patient monitoring for COVID-19-positive patients, continuous virtual monitoring to reduce workforce risk and utilization of personal protective equipment, and the transition of outpatient care to telehealth. Biomedical informatics was integral to our institutional response in supporting clinical care through new and reconfigured technologies. Through linking the telehealth systems and the electronic health record, we have the ability to monitor and track patients through a continuum of COVID-19 services. Discussion: COVID-19 has facilitated the rapid expansion and utilization of telehealth and health informatics services. We anticipate that patients and providers will view enhanced telehealth services as an essential aspect of the healthcare system. Continuation of telehealth payment models at the federal and private levels will be a key factor in whether this new uptake is sustained. Conclusions: There are substantial benefits in utilizing telehealth during the COVID-19, including the ability to rapidly scale the number of patients being screened and providing continuity of care.

THEORIZING THE MULTIPLICITY OF DIGITAL PHENOMENA: THE ECOLOGY OF CONFIGURATIONS, CAUSAL RECIPES, AND GUIDELINES FOR APPLYING QCA	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Theoretical multiplicity; configurational multiplicity; causal recipes; the ecology of configurations; qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; BOARD COMPOSITION; MODERATING ROLE; CEO DUALITY; STRATEGY; INDUSTRY; AGILITY; ENTERPRISE	Faced with the challenge of multifaceted digital phenomena, researchers in IS and related fields have increasingly adopted qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). However, in the absence of explicit guidelines for how to use QCA for theory development, the popularity and proliferation of QCA possibly amplifies the risk of using QCA in an atheoretical manner, hindering theoretical advancement. In this paper, we offer a conceptual framework and prescriptive guidelines for applying QCA to develop causal recipes that account for complex digital phenomena marked by theoretical and configurational multiplicity. Causal recipes are formal statements explaining how causally relevant elements combine into configurations associated with outcomes of interest. We describe these causal recipes in terms of which causes matter (i.e., factorial logic) and how these causes combine into configurations (i.e., combinatorial logic) to produce target outcomes, and propose an ecology of configurations that elucidates the explanatory power of multiple configurations as well as their explanatory overlap. Further, we offer two illustrative empirical examples to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework and step-by-step guidelines for applying QCA to deductive theory testing as well as inductive theory development on phenomena marked by multiplicity.

The extensive research led to a scattered literature landscape. To organize the field quantitatively, we conduct bibliometric performance analyses and a bibliographic coupling analysis. Results show an increased interest in scenario research since 2009 and clear distinctions between strategic and operational as well as methodological and applied research. Future research can be expected to further enhance the method towards robust decision making and to combine it with methods searching for most likely scenarios, such as prediction markets, crowdsourcing, and superforecasting. Additionally, cognitive and behavioral aspects of using the scenario technique might draw further attention. The scenario technique is expected to be applied across all industries and will probably play an increasing role in currently underrepresented business functions such as marketing and innovation.

J	Waheed, A; Zhang, QY				Waheed, Abdul; Zhang, Qingyu			Effect of CSR and Ethical Practices on Sustainable Competitive Performance: A Case of Emerging Markets from Stakeholder Theory Perspective	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Ethical culture; Sustainable competitive performance; Emerging nations; Structural equation modeling	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; MANAGEMENT; CULTURE; DISCLOSURE; ADVANTAGE; ISSUES; COMMUNICATION; DETERMINANTS	An extensive work has been done on corporate social responsibly practices (CSRPs) that mainly emphasized the larger firms within developed nations. Nonetheless, still work is needed to observe the importance of CSRPs' and ethical cultural practices (ECL) in terms of sustainable competitive performance (SACP) that garnered far less attention by the existing literature. This study explores the impact of CSRPs on SACP with the mediating role of ECL from SMEs of two emerging nations, i.e., China and Pakistan based on stakeholders' theory and practices. The results using SEM affirmed the positive linkages of CSRPs-environment responsibility (EnvR), community responsibility (ComuR), customers' responsibility (CustR), suppliers responsibility (SupR), employee responsibility (EmpR), and Govt. rules & regulations' responsibility (GRulR)-on SACP. It found that CSRPs have positive relationships with ECL whereas ECL further positively correlated with SACP in the context of both countries. The findings revealed the positive mediating influence of ECL between CSRPs and SACP, respectively. This study furnishes insightful information for management on how firms may achieve sustainable performance by incorporating ethical cultural practices and corporate social responsibility practices as the strategic tools. The study reports numerous implications for management together with lines for future directions.

However, using conventional field methods to measure tree height is a laborious and time-consuming process. Despite the great interest in the past to facilitate tree height measurements, new, upcoming solutions are not yet thoroughly investigated. In this study, we investigated the applicability of different close-range remote sensing options for tree height measurement in a complex lowland deciduous forest. Six sample plots in a pedunculate oak forest were measured in detail using conventional methods. Close-range remote sensing datasets used in this study represent solutions from low-cost sensors used for hand-held personal laser scanning (PLShh), unmanned-borne laser scanning (ULS) and unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry (UAV(image)). Each tree in the sample plots was interactively measured directly from the point cloud, and correspondence of the field- and remote sensing measured trees was verified using tree positions collected during fieldwork. Cross-comparisons of different datasets were performed to evaluate the performances of different data sources in the tree height estimation with respect to crown class, tree height and species. All remote sensing data sources correlated well, e.g. biases between remote sensing sources were around +/- 1%. The field-measured tree height in general correlated well with remote sensing data sources. The uncertainties and bias of the field measurements were dependent on the tree height and crown class. Field measurements tended to underestimate codominant and intermediate trees at the approximately 1 m magnitude, whilst remote sensing data sources were robust to crown classes. Low-cost ULS used in this study, and very likely in general, may not have enough penetration capability when measuring low and mostly occluded trees, causing missed treetops. PLShh gave tree height estimates closer to the real tree height than those derived from conventional field measurements for trees above 21 m height.

Analyzing retirement decisions using linked survey and register data	JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING			English	Article						Working conditions; New management practices; Job satisfaction; Retirement		We analyzed the role of adverse working conditions and new management practices in the determination of employees' retirement behavior. The combined data contain both comprehensive information on perceived job disamenities, job satisfaction, and intentions to retire from two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys and information on employees' actual retirement decisions from longitudinal register data that can be linked to the surveys. Using a trivariate ordered probit model, we find that job dissatisfaction arising from adverse working conditions is significantly related to intentions to retire and that this, in turn, is related to actual retirement during an extensive follow-up period.

J	Kannan, KSPN; Garad, A				Kannan, K. Sumitha P. N.; Garad, Alaa			Competencies of quality professionals in the era of industry 4.0: a case study of electronics manufacturer from Malaysia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industry 4; 0; Quality; Competencies; Quality professionals; Smart factory	FUTURE	Purpose This study investigates the competencies required for quality management professionals to meet the needs of industry 4.0. The authors use a case study strategy at an electronics manufacturer in southern Malaysia, to adapt their role to be relevant in the industry 4.0 environment. In doing so, this study answers the following four questions: (1) How are the changing technological trends expected to impact the future role of quality in industry 4.0? (2) What are the competencies gap between current and future roles of quality professionals? (3) What are the views and practices related to quality roles? (4) How can the gaps identified be closed to meet the quality challenges of industry 4.0? Design/methodology/approach The research methods consist of a comprehensive review of literature on the technological trends towards industry 4.0 and the impact on the role of quality and competence that may be required in the future, as well as internal document review on the current roles of quality professionals in an electronics manufacturer in southern Malaysia, to identify the competence gap. Empirical data was collected based on surveys conducted on 64 quality professionals with a response rate of 96.88%. Interviews were conducted on three decision-makers from critical areas in the electronics manufacturer for viewpoints from three different perspectives: finance, operations and talent development. Findings Quality professionals will require technical competencies to interpret large amounts of data from processes to make strategic decisions, the use of new AR tools and be aware of data security risks. Methodological competencies will be required to use data to identify the source of problems, to access reliable sources of learning and the ability to use new tools for solving complex problems efficiently. Social competencies will be required in communications across multi-sites, suppliers and customers in new collaborative virtual platforms, with the ability to retain tacit and explicit knowledge, in a decentralized environment that will require leadership ability to make decisions. Personal competencies required will be the ability to work in a flexible workplace and time and more frequent work-related changes. Research limitations/implications The limitation of the study is based on what the authors currently know of the future, which may not be much for the quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer, who have not been exposed much to the technology yet. The potential for the future landscape to change dramatically with rapid technology changes may also result in a different set of skills for future quality professionals. The quality professionals who were involved in this study were the quality executives, engineers and managers, irrespective of their gender, age, length of service and experience in the field of quality. Therefore, these variables were not taken into consideration for this research. Practical implications This research helped to identify the role of quality in industry 4.0 and key competencies that the quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer will require to adapt to their role in industry 4.0. However, based on the questionnaire and the interview comments of key personnel, it can be concluded that quality professionals lack awareness of their new roles in industry 4.0. This could be due to the fact that the new technology is not implemented by quality professionals but by the innovation team based in Singapore headquarters, as was also advised by the operations head. Social implications The benefit of industry 4. 0 technology is clearly shown by Philips's new Dutch factory with robotized technology that was able to produce the same output with one-tenth of the workers of its China factory (Rifkin, 2014, chapter 8). Rojko (2017, p. 80) also shared a similar view that industry 4.0 is expected to reduce production costs by 10-30%, logistics costs by 10-30% and quality management costs by 10-20%. The importance of this research can be seen from the findings of "The Future of Jobs" (2018, p. 22), which suggests that the window of opportunity for organizations to leverage the new technology to re-skill is within the period of 2018-2022, in order to enable employees to reach full potential in the high value-added tasks. The electronics manufacturer may need to keep to this timeline to maintain its competitive advantage. Originality/value The purpose of this paper was to determine the competence gap of current quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer with the competencies required in industry 4.0. This led to the third objective, to identify the views of stakeholders based on the propositions derived from the gaps identified, to triangulate the findings, to conclude the competency gaps of the current quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer. Finally, the objective of this paper was to make a recommendation on how to prepare the quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer for their role in industry 4.0. The research identified the technical, methodological, social and personal competencies gap of the quality professionals in the electronics manufacturer by looking at the changes expected in industry 4.0 from four aspects, factory (people and process), business, product and customers.

J	Crick, JM				Crick, James M.			Unpacking the relationship between a coopetition-oriented mindset and coopetition-oriented behaviours	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article						Coopetition-oriented mindsets; Coopetition-oriented behaviours; Industry experience; Degree of internationalisation; Relational view; Resource-based theory	RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; INTERFIRM MARKETING COOPERATION; MODERATED MULTIPLE-REGRESSION; STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; EXPORT PERFORMANCE; CLUSTERS INSIGHTS; SCALE DEVELOPMENT; FIRM PERFORMANCE	Purpose Earlier work has suggested that assumptions, values and beliefs about the importance of cooperating with competitors (a coopetition-oriented mindset) should manifest into behavioural forms of coopetition, such as resource and capability-sharing activities. Yet, limited research surrounds the complexities of this link. The purpose of this study is to unpack the relationship between a coopetition-oriented mindset and coopetition-oriented behaviours under the moderating roles of industry experience and degree of internationalization, guided by resource-based theory and the relational view. Design/methodology/approach The chosen empirical context was the Canadian wine industry because wine producers are often involved in coopetition strategies and have varying degrees of internationalisation. Preliminary interview data were collected from 18 managers to shape the operationalisations. Then survey data were collected from 195 Canadian wine producers. After checking the statistical data for all major assessments of reliability and validity (together with common method variance), the hypothesised and control paths were tested through hierarchical regression. Findings A coopetition-oriented mindset had a positive and significant association with coopetition-oriented behaviours. Surprisingly, this link was negatively moderated by industry experience. Additionally, degree of internationalisation yielded a positive moderation effect. These moderators highlight situations where a coopetition-oriented mindset is (and is not) likely to manifest into coopetition activities. Practical implications If firms aim to engage in behavioural forms of coopetition, they should manage assumptions, values and beliefs associated with the advantages of collaborating with their competitors. Industry experience can limit the extent to which business' coopetition-oriented mindsets manifest into coopetition-oriented behaviours. This could be explained by decision makers possessing information that discourages them from working with certain (untrustworthy) rivals because of the potential harmful effects on their performance. Companies should use their industry experience to avoid working with rival entities that will create negative outcomes, such as tensions (e.g., conflict, power imbalances and opportunistic behaviours), lost intellectual property and diluted competitive advantages. Nonetheless, industry experience might signify that there are more risks than rewards linked with these business-to-business marketing strategies. Higher levels of internationalisation can help firms to recognise that coopetition-oriented behaviours may lead to performance-enhancing opportunities in their overseas markets. Originality/value This investigation contributes to the business-to-business marketing literature with new evidence on how organisations can foster a coopetition-oriented mindset to engage in coopetition strategies. The negative moderation effect from industry experience highlights that knowledge of competitors' activities can limit the extent to which coopetition-oriented behaviours are implemented. Moreover, the positive interaction effect from degree of internationalisation extends the growing body of knowledge pertaining to coopetition in an international arena. Collectively, these results show that while a coopetition-oriented mindset is a critical driver of coopetition-oriented behaviours, there are certain contingencies that can strengthen or weaken this association. Finally, by integrating resource-based theory and the relational view, this paper could explore the different forms of coopetition, in terms of organisation-wide mindsets and firm-level behaviours. This paper concludes with some managerial recommendations, alongside a series of limitations and avenues for future research.

J	Benlian, A				Benlian, Alexander			A DAILY FIELD INVESTIGATION OF TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN SPILLOVERS FROM WORK TO HOME	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Technology-driven stress; challenge-hindrance stressors; technostress; spillover; work-home boundary; affective events theory; experience sampling; multilevel analysis	DOUBLE-EDGED-SWORD; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; FAMILY CONFLICT; BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT; JOB-SATISFACTION; DARK SIDE; PSYCHOLOGICAL DETACHMENT; SMARTPHONE USE; TIME PRESSURE; LINKING WORK	Although recent theoretical developments and empirical studies indicate that technology-related stress may have negative and positive consequences for employees across life domains, the majority of previous IS research on technostress has focused on its downsides at work and has neglected to study how and why technology-related stress may spill over from work to home. Furthermore, while much of our knowledge of technology-related stress and its effects derives from cross-sectional studies examining between-person differences, there is a need for longitudinal, daily investigations that take a within-person view. Integrating the challenge-hindrance stressor framework with affective events theory and work-home spillover literature, we propose a broader conceptualization of technology-related stressors, referred to as technology-driven (TD) stressors, which comprise technology-driven challenge (TCS) and hindrance (THS) stressors, and examine how and why daily TCS and THS experienced at work affect the relationship between employees and their partners at home. In an experience sampling study of 115 employees who responded to daily surveys both at work and at home over a two-week period, we found that while THS are negatively related to partnership satisfaction via negative affect, TCS are positively related to partnership satisfaction via positive affect. We also investigated the moderating effect of work-home role integration (WHI) and perceived organizational support in work-home boundary management (POS) on the strength of the within-individual spillover processes. Our results show that WHI acts as a double-edged sword for letting TCS- and THS-triggered positive and negative affect spill over to partnership satisfaction, whereas POS serves as a facilitator of positive affect and as a buffer against negative affect. Broadly, our study shows that understanding daily TD work stressors is important because their negative and positive downstream effects often do not stop at employees' workplace boundaries but actually penetrate and shape their everyday lives at home.

J	Dadanlar, HH; Abebe, MA				Dadanlar, Hazel H.; Abebe, Michael A.			Female CEO leadership and the likelihood of corporate diversity misconduct: Evidence from S&P 500 firms	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Female CEOs; Diversity misconduct; Discrimination lawsuits; Social role theory; Strategic leadership	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; WOMEN; DISCRIMINATION; MANAGEMENT; MEDIATION; MODELS; ISSUES; VALUES; BIAS	Large-scale discrimination lawsuits-as major types of corporate diversity misconduct-pose significant challenges for the reputation and financial well-being of firms. This study explores the role female CEOs play in reducing the likelihood of such lawsuits. Drawing from social role theory, we propose that female CEOs, given their high-profile position, past career experiences and general sensitivity to diversity misconduct, play a critical role in minimizing the occurrences of discrimination lawsuits. We tested our predictions using a panel data from S&P 500 U.S. firms between 2010 and 2015. The findings indicate that firms that are led by female CEOs have a reduced likelihood of discrimination lawsuits. Furthermore, female CEOs can be particularly effective in reducing such lawsuits in firms with more frequent past diversity misconduct. Finally, our findings show that female CEO-led firms with favorable diversity ratings experience reduced likelihood of large-scale discrimination lawsuits. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

J	Yamane, T; Chun, PJ				Yamane, Tatsuro; Chun, Pang-jo			Crack Detection from a Concrete Surface Image Based on Semantic Segmentation Using Deep Learning	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED CONCRETE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MACHINE	Due to their wide applicability in inspection of concrete structures, there is considerable interest in the development of automated crack detection method by image processing. However, the accuracy of existing methods tends to be influenced by the existence of traces of tie-rod holes and formworks. In order to reduce these influences, this paper proposes a crack detection method based on semantic segmentation by deep learning. The accuracy of developed method is investigated by the photos of concrete structures with lots of adverse conditions including shadow and dirt, and it is found that not only the crack region could be detected but also the trace of tie-rod holes and formworks could be removed from the detection result with high accuracy. This paper is the English translation from the authors' previous work [Yamane, T. and Chun, P., (2019). "Crack detection from an image of concrete surface based on semantic segmentation by deep learning." Journal of Structural Engineering, 65A, 130-138. (in Japanese)].

Building on agency and imprinting theories, we introduce the concept of informality costs, that is, the higher agency costs from adverse selection and moral hazard problems caused by a firm's informal creation. These informality costs become imprinted and affect internal agency relationships among employees and managers and external agency relationships with suppliers and distributors, constraining the firms' incentives and ability to innovate even after formalization. As a result, informally created firms engage more in imitative and less in innovative new product development. We further propose that changes in ownership and the innovation environment alter the persistence of informality costs. Specifically, foreign firm and business group ownership reduces the persistence of informality costs and results in more innovativeness, while state ownership heightens informality costs and leads to less innovativeness. Moreover, improvements in national innovation systems decrease informality costs, strengthening the innovativeness of informally created firms. Managerial Summary We study how the informal creation of new ventures in emerging economies affects their innovation after they become formal firms. We propose that informally created new ventures suffer from informality costs established as a result of being informal at the beginning of their lives that reduce their incentives and ability to innovate. As a result, these firms tend to introduce new products that are imitative rather than innovative. We also propose that changes in the firm's ownership and in the national innovation system alter the persistence of informality costs and their impact on innovation. First, informally created new ventures acquired by foreign firms or private business groups have reduced informality costs and innovate more, while those acquired by the state have enhanced informality costs and imitate more. Second, national innovation system improvements reduce informality costs and support innovativeness.

Methods and implications for safety	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE			English	Article						Coronavirus; dosimetry; irradiance; respirator; ultraviolet		The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a global decrease in personal protective equipment (PPE), especially filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of decontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light irradiance varies significantly on different respirator angles and propose a method to decontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 x 55 x 33 cm with three 15 W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 x 41 x 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different flat fold respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3 M of dimensions 17 x 9 x 4 cm (tri-fold), and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR (bi-fold) with dimensions 17 x 6 x 5 cm. An STN-SilverNova spectrometer was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. The data obtained reveal that the irradiance received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the lamps' plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance and angle of incidence of the light source. Careful irradiance measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.

Standard ownership concepts-mainly derived from agency and incomplete contracting theories-focus on its incentive effects. However, these concepts and theories neglect ownership's role as an instrument to match judgment about resource use and governance with the firm's evolving environment under uncertainty. We develop the concept of ownership competence-the skill with which ownership is used as an instrument to create value-and decompose it into matching competence (whatto own), governance competence (howto own), and timing competence (whento own). We describe how property rights of use, appropriation, and transfer relate to the three ownership competences and show how our theory offers a fresh perspective into the role of ownership for value generation. Managerial Summary Business owners own with different levels of competence, and differences in ownership competence matter for value creation. We argue that ownership competence consists of competence aboutwhatto own (matching competence), competence abouthowto own (governance competence), and competence aboutwhento own (timing competence). We clarify the role played by each of the three competences for value creation. We also show how the importance of ownership competence for value creation alters depending on ownership concentration, life cycle effects, uncertainty of the environment, and the efficiency of resource markets. With our paper, we prepare the ground for a fuller understanding of the strategic role of owners for value creation.

Optimized inventory control is an integral part of supply chain management. In inventory control problems, determining the ordering times and the order quantities of products are the two strategic decisions either to minimize total costs or to maximize total profits. This paper presents three models of inventory control problems. These three models are deterministic single-product, deterministic multi-product, and stochastic single-product. Due to the high computational complexity, the presented models are solved using the Emperor Penguins Colony (EPC) algorithm as a metaheuristic algorithm and a soft computing method. EPC is a newly published metaheuristic algorithm, which has not yet been employed to solve the inventory control problem. The results of applying the proposed algorithm on the models are compared with the results obtained by nine state-of-the-art and popular metaheuristic algorithms. To justify the proposed EPC, both cost and runtime criteria are considered. To find significant differences between the results obtained by algorithms, statistical analysis is used. The results show that the proposed algorithm for the presented models of inventory control has better solutions, lower cost, and less CPU consumption than other algorithms.

J	Padash, A; Ghatari, AR				Padash, Amin; Ghatari, Ali Rajabzadeh			Toward an Innovative Green Strategic Formulation Methodology: Empowerment of Corporate Social, Health, Safety and Environment	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Corporate social; Health; Safety and environment strategies (SHSE); Innovative green strategy; Organization of special economic petrochemical organization; Delphi; AHP; SWOT; SPACE	SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; PRODUCT INNOVATION; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; BUSINESS MODELS; SWOT ANALYSIS; SUPPLY CHAIN; RESPONSIBILITY; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS	Nowadays, developing empowering strategies based on health, safety and the environment is one of the most important issues of management in organizations. This research provides a model for the implementation of innovative green strategies model. The model contemplates four topics (e.g., social, environment, health, and safety); three organizational types (e.g. oil, gas and petrochemicals company); four strategies combined model (PESTEL, SWOT, AHP, SPACE). On this basis, 25 outsourcing strategic factors (including 13 opportunities and 12 outsourcing threats) and 21 internal factors (including 7 strengths and 14 weaknesses) were identified. Hence, the strategic elements of the outsourcing and internal have been ranked, and the most important opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses of the organization have been introduced to develop SHSE-based environmental protection. Afterward, using strategic positioning tool and strategy design, 18 strategies have been developed. The results show the Organization of Special Economic Zone of Petrochemicals is strategically positioned in the face of opportunities to threaten and overcome the weak points of strength. Accordingly, using "Weakness-Opportunity Strategies" can be mainly used to take advantage of the opportunities offered to compensate for the weaknesses of the organization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Fayek, AR				Fayek, Aminah Robinson			Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Hybrid Techniques for Construction Engineering and Management	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy hybrid techniques; Fuzzy logic; Machine learning; Multicriteria decision making; Optimization; Simulation	DEFAULT PREDICTION MODEL; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM	Construction engineering and management are vital for successful project execution, and both researchers and practitioners continually seek ways to improve construction processes. Fuzzy logic plays an important role in many construction engineering and management applications, which are reviewed in this paper. This paper discusses the limitations of fuzzy logic and how this theory has been combined with other modeling techniques to develop fuzzy hybrid techniques, and describes the aspects of construction problems and decision making that are most effectively modeled using these techniques. Fuzzy hybrid techniques that are most common in construction are presented and examples from construction literature and the author's research program are provided. The author shares her vision of future research in this area, which is based on her expertise and experiences collaborating with construction industry partners, who have helped shape her research program and its impact on industry. Finally, the author presents her thoughts on the challenges construction researchers face in translating research to practice and measuring its impact, and she discusses some potential solutions from her research program. This paper is based on the 2019 Peurifoy Construction Advancement Address, which the author presented in Montreal, Canada, in June 2019.

J	Feldman, E; Reid, EM; Mazmanian, M				Feldman, Elana; Reid, Erin M.; Mazmanian, Melissa			SIGNS OF OUR TIME: TIME-USE AS DEDICATION, PERFORMANCE, IDENTITY, AND POWER IN CONTEMPORARY WORKPLACES	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT ANNALS			English	Article							WORK-FAMILY CONFLICT; BOUNDARY CONTROL; ORGANIZATIONAL CONTROL; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; TECHNOLOGY USE; FACE TIME; FLEXIBILITY; GENDER; HEALTH; EXPECTATIONS	Time-use refers to the amount of time spent working and how that time is allocated over a particular period. A growing number of scholars are considering how social context-people's immediate social environments (e.g., colleagues and managers, norms, work groups, and nonwork demands)-shape time-use. However, this research is fragmented across disciplines, methods, and levels of analysis. To integrate and advance knowledge in this area, we review empirical studies that inform current understanding of social context and time-use. In doing so, we develop a framework that reveals how the extant literature coalesces around four taken-for-granted social meanings: time-use as dedication, time-use as performance, time-use as identity, and time-use as power. These four meanings are anchored in broadly shared societal ideologies but are enacted and interpreted locally as people engage time in a specific context. Looking across the four social meanings, we discuss how they are interconnected, and identify overarching themes that unite them. Building on these insights, we suggest important directions for future research on the social context of time-use.

J	Friedrich, D				Friedrich, Daniel			How regulatory measures towards biobased packaging influence the strategic behaviour of the retail industry: A microempirical study	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Cross-sectional study; Retail industry; Biobased plastics composites; Market regulation; Pigou tax	WOOD-POLYMER COMPOSITES; CONSUMER; PLASTICS; SUSTAINABILITY; PURCHASE; CHOICES; WASTE; PREFERENCES; PERCEPTIONS; ACCEPTANCE	Germany set a new record in waste production in 2017 and thus occupies one of the top ranks in the EU in terms of garbage creation. However, whether and how much of the waste can be recycled at all depends strongly on the material and its properties, whereby the recycling rate for plastics is still moderate. Environmental damage from plastic packaging can be avoided by using biobased substitute materials. To achieve this, the costs for plastic must first be increased in order to make these alternatives attractive in terms of price. This paper reports on a study dealing with regulatory measures to mitigate the waste problem from an economic point of view. It discusses the results of a choice-based experiment with 253 industrial decision-makers from the German Food and Technics retail segment. Regulatory scenarios, such as Pigou tax on plastic packaging or product labelling about environmental impact, were specified as a means to avoid market failure, and the attitude of the respondents were measured. The data analysis showed that the additional costs of switching to biomaterials are more likely to be passed on to the market by SMEs (100%) in the form of price increases (p = .01; phi = .28) and that quality reductions tend to be considered by the food industry (p < .05; phi = .39). Hence, large companies (65.2%) and the Technical goods traders (35.7%) showed a tendency to be prepared to bear part of the change costs. The packaging weight was favoured by the majority as the basis for taxation (>48%), and it was proposed to indicate the packing's CO2-emissions using a traffic light scheme (>47%). Finally, it was found that trading companies in general had only a small influence on the packaging properties of their suppliers' products (<32%). From this it can be concluded that impulses for plastic avoidance should rather be set by government regulatory instruments than by self-regulation on the part of the retail industry, which, however, with an average of 30% plastic recycling in packaging, is already making a significant contribution to avoidance. Finally, it is recommended that economic explanatory models should integrate the variables Company Size and Product Category for reliable economic predictions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hardy, C; Maguire, S; Power, M; Tsoukas, H				Hardy, Cynthia; Maguire, Steve; Power, Michael; Tsoukas, Haridimos			ORGANIZING RISK: ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT THEORY FOR THE RISK SOCIETY	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT ANNALS			English	Article							HIGH-RELIABILITY ORGANIZATIONS; ENTERPRISING SELF; UNCERTAIN RISKS; SAFETY CLIMATE; WORK; CULTURE; DISCOURSE; STRATEGY; BLAME; SENSEMAKING	Risk has become a crucial part of organizing, affecting a wide range of organizations in all sectors. We identify, review, and integrate diverse literatures relevant to organizing risk, building on an existing framework that describes how risk is organized in three "modes"-prospectively, in real-time, and retrospectively. We then identify three critical issues in the existing literature: its fragmented nature, its neglect of the tensions associated with each of the modes, and its tendency to assume that the meaning of an object in relation to risk is singular and stable. We provide a series of new insights with regard to each of these issues. First, we develop the concept of a risk cycle that shows how organizations engage with all three modes and transition between them over time. Second, we explain why the tensions have been largely ignored and show how studies using a risk-work perspective can provide further insights into them. Third, we develop the concept of risk translation to highlight the ways in which the meanings of risks can be transformed and to identify the political consequences of such translations. We conclude the article with a research agenda to elaborate these insights and ideas further.

ONTOLOGY, LEVELS OF SOCIETY, AND DEGREES OF GENERALITY: THEORIZING ACTORS AS ABSTRACTIONS IN INSTITUTIONAL THEORY	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS; SOCIAL SKILL; INHABITED INSTITUTIONS; WORLD SOCIETY; US FIRMS; DYNAMICS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; RATIONALIZATION; LOGICS; FIELD	The term "actor" is a central yet contested construct in institutional theory. Regardless of one's position, institutional theory requires a scaffolding that acknowledges the novelty and diversity of actor analyses and facilitates the commensurability, application, and reach in scholarly uses of the term. We put forth a view of actor as an abstraction that consists of three core elements: (1) the level(s) of society that claims about actors occupy (e.g., from individual to organizational to societal), (2) the degree of generality that claims about actors reach (i.e., from concrete to abstract), and (3) the essential features that constitute actors (i.e., ontology). Our lens pushes beyond the prolific use of the term by providing a foundation for identifying and positioning actor-based studies. It also delineates reference sets of actor-based scholarship, even absent of the term altogether, so as to identify where conceptual specifications converge, expand, complement, or compete. Our lens also provides a means of relating actor-based analyses to one another in ways that distinguish the quality of the actor specification from its novelty or empirical validity. In so doing, we move the agenda forward on the analyses of actor as both explanandum and explanans.

We focus the comparison on three different outcomes: descriptive statistics, link reconstruction, and model parameters. The results indicate that the often used methods (analysis of available cases and null-tie imputation) lead to considerable bias on descriptive statistics with moderate or large proportions of missing data. Multiple imputation using sophisticated imputation models based on exponential random graph models (ERGMs) lead to acceptable biases in descriptive statistics and model parameters even under large amounts of missing data. For link reconstruction multiple imputation by simple ERGM performed well on small data sets, while missing data was more accurately imputed in larger data sets with multiple imputation by complex Bayesian ERGMs (BERGMs).

J	Luciano, MM; Nahrgang, JD; Shropshire, C				Luciano, Margaret M.; Nahrgang, Jennifer D.; Shropshire, Christine			STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP SYSTEMS: VIEWING TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS AND BOARDS OF DIRECTORS FROM A MULTITEAM SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article							TRANSACTIVE MEMORY-SYSTEMS; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; HIGH-VELOCITY; REPRESENTATIONAL GAPS; COLLECTIVE TURNOVER; MODERATING ROLE; DECISION SPEED; RISK-TAKING; CONSEQUENCES	Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 x 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

J	Nath, P; Bharadwaj, N				Nath, Pravin; Bharadwaj, Neeraj			Chief marketing officer presence and firm performance: assessing conditions under which the presence of other C-level functional executives matters	JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Chief marketing officer; Executive dyad; Inter-functional interfaces; Organizationally embedded view of marketing; TMT functional dyads; Financial performance; Contingency	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MODERATING ROLE; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; SHAREHOLDER VALUE; UPPER ECHELONS; MANAGEMENT; SALES; POWER; CAPABILITIES	This research extends understanding of the relationship between chief marketing officer (CMO) presence and firm performance by investigating how it is affected by the presence of three other functional heads (or CXOs) under various environmental and strategic contingencies. Results based on a panel of 401 U.S. manufacturers reaffirm the positive CMO presence-firm performance relationship and establish that the linkage is (a) strengthened by chief sales officer presence when industry sales volatility is high, (b) strengthened (weakened) by chief technology officer presence when industry innovation and firm differentiation (cost leadership) are high, and (c) strengthened (weakened) by chief supply chain officer presence when firm diversification (differentiation) is high. The study: expands top management team research by investigating executive dyads formed by the pairing of heads of functions advocated in the organizationally embedded view of marketing; delineates CXOs' roles and orientations to clarify mechanisms that aid or hamper the CMO; and, identifies industry and firm-level contexts that affect the CMO-CXO interfaces. Additionally, the findings underscore the importance of appointing CMOs and, of CMOs spanning organizational silos.

Use of steel slag as a catalyst in CO2-cofeeding pyrolysis of pine sawdust	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Lignocellulosic biomass; Catalytic pyrolysis; Carbon dioxide; Steel slag; Waste-to-energy	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY; BIOMASS PYROLYSIS; SOLAR-ENERGY; WILT DISEASE; TECHNOLOGIES; PERFORMANCE; KINETICS; SYSTEM; IMPACT	To seek an innovative way for simultaneous waste management and energy recovery, two waste materials (pine sawdust PSD and steel slag: SS) were used in the pyrolysis process. PSD was used as a carbonaceous material for pyrolysis, and SS was used as a catalyst. Also, to achieve a more sustainable conversion system, a viable use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a raw material in the non-catalytic/catalytic pyrolysis process was evaluated. Hence, the present study laid great stress on the CO2 effects. The present study pointed the optimistic technical features in line with the use of CO2 in the pyrolysis process. Exploiting CO2 in pyrolysis of PSD offered a strategic way to control carbon reallocation from liquid to gaseous pyrolysates by the gas phase reactions (GPR5). The reactions of CO2 and volatile pyrolysates led to CO enhancement, which was only observed at >= 600 degrees C due to the slow reaction kinetics of the GPR5 of volatile pyrolysates and CO2. Such the slow reaction kinetics was expedited remarkably when SS was acted as a catalyst. Moreover, CO2 expedited thermal cracking of volatile pyrolysates including dehydrogenation, which led to the enhanced formation of CH4 and H-2.

J	Sarta, A; Durand, R; Vergne, JP				Sarta, Andrew; Durand, Rodolphe; Vergne, Jean-Philippe			Organizational Adaptation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						adaptation; fit; congruence; topic modeling; evolution; strategic change; performance	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; STRATEGIC CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL SELECTION; INCUMBENT ADAPTATION; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; SECURITIES ANALYSTS; FIRM HETEROGENEITY	Organizational adaptation is equivocal. On the one hand, the concept is ubiquitous in management research and acts as the glue binding together the central issues of organizational change, performance, and survival. On the other hand, it lurks around in various guises (e.g., "fit," "alignment," "congruence," and "strategic change") studied from multiple theoretical streams (e.g., behavioral, resource based, and institutional) and at different levels of analysis (e.g., organization and industry levels). In a novel approach to reviewing 443 adaptation articles that leverages both computational and hand-coded analysis, we produce an interactive visual of the themes most studied by adaptation scholars. We inductively draw out a definition of adaptation as intentional decision making undertaken by organizational members, leading to observable actions that aim to reduce the distance between an organization and its economic and institutional environments. We then review the literature across three main areas of inquiry and six theoretical perspectives that surfaced from our analysis and identify 11 difficulties that have hampered adaptation research in the past 50 years. Our review suggests ways to address these difficulties to enable future research to develop and cumulate.

J	Boadu, EF; Wang, CCX; Sunindijo, RY				Boadu, Elijah Frimpong; Wang, Cynthia Changxin; Sunindijo, Riza Yosia			Characteristics of the Construction Industry in Developing Countries and Its Implications for Health and Safety: An Exploratory Study in Ghana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						construction industry; health and safety; developing countries; characteristics	OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; SECTOR; DIFFICULTIES; PERFORMANCE; EMPLOYMENT	From both practical and theoretical perspectives, understanding the health and safety (H&S) implications of the characteristics and foundation upon which the construction industry in developing countries is built and operates is essential for H&S management within the industry. While many studies have provided evidence of factors affecting construction H&S in developing countries, none has fully considered the H&S implications of the industry's characteristics. The current study thus examined how the peculiar characteristics of the construction industry in developing countries impact on the industry's H&S management. Data were collected using questionnaire surveys from construction industry professionals in Ghana. Nine distinct characteristics were identified and ranked, as well as their relationships and statistical significance determined through correlation and analysis of variance (ANOVA), respectively. The findings showed that these characteristics of the construction industry in developing countries, particularly the lack of skilled and educated workforce, reliance on labour intensive methods and lack of single regulatory authority, present huge challenges to the management of H&S. Accordingly, this research recommended strategic interventions which are tailored towards the context of the industry's characteristics. With the construction industry in developing countries exhibiting similar characteristics, the findings of this research can serve as a framework for country-specific study. The study contributes to the broader H&S performance improvement research in developing countries by throwing light on the characteristics of the industry that pose challenges to H&S performance.

Along the upper reach of Yellow River in northern China, a large number of reservoirs have been built or are being built, while information about the distribution and impoundment of these reservoirs is rather limited. Here we compiled an inventory of reservoirs ( > 0.01 km(2)) in two catchments in the upper reach of the Yellow River and estimated the seasonal water storage variations of reservoirs associated with impoundment during 2000 and 2018, by using a suite of remote sensing observations. The inventory of 149 reservoirs in the study region consists of 102 existing reservoirs (built before 2000) retrieved from Google Earth high-resolution imagery or available publications and 47 new reservoirs (constructed during 2000-2018) which we detected by using time-series analysis of NDWI derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data. To estimate water storage changes of all reservoirs associated with impoundment, we combined representative inundation extents of reservoirs in each season of the year retrieved from sequential Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and shoreline topography information derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The results demonstrate significant seasonal variations (mostly impoundment in autumn/winter and release in spring/summer) as well as a rapid increasing trend of water storage held in reservoirs. Particularly in Catchment A - the headwater of the Yellow River, the total water storage increased by about 16 Gt from 2000 to 2018, about 25% percent of which is due to impoundment of newly constructed reservoirs. The remote sensing-based results were validated by long-term in-situ water level data of 2 reservoirs and construction information of 14 new reservoirs. Uncertainty analysis shows acceptable accuracy in monitoring storage changes on the annual scale, indicated by high confidence in area-volume curves for most reservoirs (102 reservoirs with R-2 of area-volume curve higher than 0.9), while uncertainty is unneglectable on the seasonal scale. In accordance with streamflow variation data from 2000 to 2016 provided by published literature, our estimation indicates that the water resource in the upper Yellow River has been more highly regulated by reservoir impoundment and the seasonal regulation exerts significant impact on catchment runoff process (averagely about 17% of annual discharge).

The approach is based on managers identifying and managing tensions between the three priorities, by employing one of the three strategic responses. Although recent work has provided a theoretical basis for such tension acknowledgment and management, there is a dearth of empirical studies. We interviewed 32 corporate sustainability managers across 25 forestry and wood-products organizations in Australia. Study participants were divided into two groups: (1) those considered effective at corporate sustainability and (2) a status-quo group. Contrary to current theory, our findings showed that acknowledgment of organizational tensions was widespread in the Australian forestry and wood-products industry and not limited to those managers who are effective at managing corporate sustainability. What differed was the degree to which managers did something about the perceived tensions-with the effective group more consistently acting to manage and resolve paradoxical scenarios. Our findings suggest that existing theoretical constructs of tension management may not adequately capture the individual-level complexity involved with managing tensions in practice.

J	Kim, Y; Lim, H				Kim, Young; Lim, Hyunji (Dana)			Activating constructive employee behavioural responses in a crisis: Examining the effects of pre-crisis reputation and crisis communication strategies on employee voice behaviours	JOURNAL OF CONTINGENCIES AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						constructive employee voice; crisis response strategies; destructive employee voice; pre-crisis reputation; stealing thunder	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; PERCEIVED EXTERNAL PRESTIGE; STEALING THUNDER; ORGANIZATIONAL REPUTATION; SELF-DISCLOSURE; IMPACT; LOYALTY; EXIT; PERFORMANCE; OUTCOMES	This study explores how organizational management can promote employee voice behaviours, as positive behavioural reactions with constructive ideas, in responding to organizational crisis. Using an experimental study (N = 640) among full-time employees in the United States, the study found that pre-crisis internal reputation and crisis communication strategies-accommodative response and stealing thunder-positively and directly affected constructive employee voice behaviours in a crisis situation. Furthermore, the study revealed how post-crisis internal reputation mediates the influences of pre-crisis internal reputation and stealing thunder on positive/constructive and negative/destructive employee voice behaviours. The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical development of crisis communication in the internal context of an organization, especially with respect to employee voice behaviours. The study also highlights an important practical implication for crisis managers who can activate and promote positive employee behaviour voices, thereby influencing leadership's strategic decision-making in an organizational crisis.

Study focus: This study has developed a hydrological model using multi-site calibration approach for a large basin, the Karnali-Mohana (KarMo) in Western Nepal, which has a lot of potential for water resources development and contribute to the national prosperity. It further applies the model to characterize hydrology and water resources availability across spatio-temporal scales to enhance understanding on water availability and potential uses. The newly developed hydrological model in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is capable of reproducing the hydrological pattern, the average flows, and the flow duration curve at the outlet of the basin and five major sub-basins. New hydrological insights for this region: The model simulated results showed that about 34 % of average annual precipitation in the KarMo basin is lost as evapotranspiration, but with a large spatio-temporal heterogeneity. The Hills and Tarai are relatively wetter than the Mountains. The average annual flow volume at the basin outlet is estimated as 46,250 million-cubic-meters (MCM). The hydrological characterization made in this study are further used for climate change impact assessment (Part-B in the same journal), environmental flows assessment and evaluating trade-offs among various water development pathways, which are published elsewhere. This model, therefore, has potential to contribute for strategic planning and sustainable management of water resources to fuel the country's prosperity.

Two broad research questions guided the empirical work that was carried out within the specific sector: (a) what variables characterize the behavior of the innovation driven firm? (b) what is the relationship (direct/indirect) between the firm's dynamic capabilities and its networking abilities? The empirical evidence emerged from a quantitative research study of 3.500 Italian manufacturing SMEs. Graphical log-linear models were applied to understand the interactions of networking firms and their ability to innovate.

From the cross-border knowledge management perspective, this paper aims to analyze the improvement path of innovation quality of MNCs and construct the functional path of the relationships among the knowledge creation, knowledge application and innovation quality of MNCs in the cross-border knowledge management process, so as to achieve the success of their business models. Based on this, this paper introduces cultural distance to further analyze how such relationships will change with the cultural distance level. Design/methodology/approach Using data from Chinese A-share listed MNCs with production operations located in the Asia-Pacific region from 2014 to 2018, this paper constructs a panel data model to test the mediating effect of knowledge application and the moderating effect of cultural distance on such relationships. Findings This paper obtains the following research findings: knowledge creation and knowledge application each have a significant, inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation quality; knowledge creation has a significantly positive correlation with knowledge application and knowledge application has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between knowledge creation and innovation quality; cultural distance has a moderating effect on such relationships. The specific moderating direction depends on the extent of the knowledge creation and knowledge application. Practical implications The findings are helpful to MNCs' managers, providing guidance and serve as a reference for them to make strategic decisions on cross-board knowledge management and business models innovation.

J	Ozemre, M; Kabadurmus, O				Ozemre, Murat; Kabadurmus, Ozgur			A big data analytics based methodology for strategic decision making	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Big data analytics; Strategic decision making; Trade volume forecasting; Machine learning	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EXPORT; CHALLENGES; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; COUNTRIES; SYSTEMS; MODEL	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a novel framework for strategic decision making using Big Data Analytics (BDA) methodology. Design/methodology/approach In this study, two different machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are employed to forecast export volumes using an extensive amount of open trade data. The forecasted values are included in the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix to conduct strategic market analysis. Findings The proposed methodology is validated using a hypothetical case study of a Chinese company exporting refrigerators and freezers. The results show that the proposed methodology makes accurate trade forecasts and helps to conduct strategic market analysis effectively. Also, the RF performs better than the ANN in terms of forecast accuracy. Research limitations/implications This study presents only one case study to test the proposed methodology. In future studies, the validity of the proposed method can be further generalized in different product groups and countries. Practical implications In today's highly competitive business environment, an effective strategic market analysis requires importers or exporters to make better predictions and strategic decisions. Using the proposed BDA based methodology, companies can effectively identify new business opportunities and adjust their strategic decisions accordingly. Originality/value This is the first study to present a holistic methodology for strategic market analysis using BDA.

Across 141 studies published over 20 years, our meta-analysis shows that apart from the factors related to the three traditional categories of PO antecedents (i.e., control, knowing, and investment), safety (e.g., organizational justice, trust, perceived organizational support, and relational closeness) is an emerging antecedent leading to PO. In addition, we find that PO is related not only to employees' attitudinal and performance outcomes but also to some dark-side outcomes (e.g., territorial behaviors). Furthermore, after applying two advanced methods, that is, two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling and dominance analysis, to the analysis of 294 studies (including 291 primary studies and three published meta-analyses), the results reveal that PO has an incremental validity above that of organizational commitment and organizational identification in predicting employees' in-role performance and organizational citizenship behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

It is clear that this is a rather short-sighted definition not taking into account how much a company is product or service-oriented, i.e. its servitization level. The idea herein discussed is to formalize the concept of a servitization scale, trying to operationalize the concept of servitization level shared by researchers and practitioners. The goal is to provide a conventional tool to measure or compare the servitization level of different manufacturing companies. To provide a preliminary evidence the possible use of the proposed scale, the paper presents: (i) an in-depth analysis of the servitization level of medium-large size Italian companies in the manufacturing sector; (ii) some examples of possible applications of the scale to support the strategic decision-making process and planning of the servitization process.

J	Morgan, T; Anokhin, SA				Morgan, Todd; Anokhin, Sergey Alexander			The joint impact of entrepreneurial orientation and market orientation in new product development: Studying firm and environmental contingencies	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Article						Entrepreneurial orientation; Market orientation; NPD performance; Environmental turbulence; Firm size; Services; Strategic orientation	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP; STRATEGIC ORIENTATIONS; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; VALUE APPROPRIATION; MODERATING ROLE; VALUE CREATION; INNOVATION; INFORMATION	Previous research has suggested important environmental and firm factors may be involved in the individual and joint implementation of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and market orientation (MO). In a sample of 179 SMEs, we examine firm-level and environmental-level contingencies regarding EO and MO's joint impact on new product development performance. This study provides further context to which firms should avoid or pursue an EO-MO dual implementation. Contrary to our arguments, the results show that larger firms may be more adept at managing EO and MO simultaneously, whereas inefficiencies may arise with smaller firms. In support of our arguments, we empirically show that firms that focus on services rather than goods benefit from the joint impact of EO and MO. Additionally, environmental turbulence and industries characterized by high technological intensity provide benefits for EO-MO implementation due to opportunities in volatile environments aligning with EO and hedging risk by staying close to customers.

Besides drawing on their legacy resources, pre-entrants during industry incubation commonly use alliances and acquisitions to obtain technical capabilities and complementary assets, thereby creating a portfolio of sourcing modes that collectively shapes the firms' paths to potential market entry. We identify a key pattern at the intersection of type of sourcing mode and type of resource: pre-entrants to the incubation stage are more likely to use alliances to source technical capabilities, while using acquisitions to source specialized complementary assets. Our empirical context is the agricultural biotechnology industry. Managerial summary Firms typically seek new resources when they begin exploring potential industries, before any products have reached the market, yet the needed investments face substantial uncertainties. This article highlights a pattern in how firms use alliances and acquisitions for technical capabilities and complementary resources during the incubation stage of the agricultural biotechnology industry. We focus on two key features of the external sourcing activity, differing based on the type of resource: developing new core technologies, which often starts early, tends to leverage external alliance partners; by contrast, establishing complementary assets tends to start later through acquisitions. The logic underlying these patterns can help managers make effective decisions about their external sourcing strategies during the incubation stage of a new industry.

J	Calabro, A; Torchia, M; Jimenez, DG; Kraus, S				Calabro, Andrea; Torchia, Mariateresa; Jimenez, Daniela Gimenez; Kraus, Sascha			The role of human capital on family firm innovativeness: the strategic leadership role of family board members	INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Family firms; Human capital; Innovativeness; Board of directors; Generations; STEP Project	UNIFIED SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; SOCIOEMOTIONAL WEALTH; MODERATING ROLE; CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PRINCIPAL-PRINCIPAL; CONCEPTUAL ISSUES; AGENCY COSTS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT	Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, this study investigates the relationship between human capital (employees' experience, knowledge and technical skills, managerial talent) and innovativeness (propensity to innovate) in a sample of 478 family firms taken from a cross-country dataset (STEP Project). Furthermore, we consider the moderating effect of the proportion of family members sitting on the board of directors (family board ratio). The main findings highlight that there is a positive relationship between human capital and family firm innovativeness. Moreover, family board ratio positively moderates the relationship between human capital and innovativeness in such a way that when the family board ratio is high, the relationship between human capital and innovativeness is stronger. This result is weaker when multiple family generations are actively involved in the firm. In summary, family members sitting on the board of directors focus more attention on people and for this reason, play an important strategic leadership role in valorizing human capital that fosters more innovativeness.

J	Zhou, BH; Qi, Y; Liu, YW				Zhou, Binghai; Qi, Yi; Liu, Yuwang			Proactive preventive maintenance policy for buffered serial production systems based on energy saving opportunistic windows	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Energy saving; Condition-based maintenance; Throughput; Opportunity window; Serial production system	MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; MANUFACTURING-INDUSTRY; MACHINE-TOOLS; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; SUSTAINABILITY; TIME	Nowadays the manufacturing enterprises are driven towards significant energy improvements by increasing energy costs and sustainability awareness, and energy consumption and energy efficiency are taking a more and more dominating position in the decision-making process of manufacturing enterprises. However, in the process of production, existing researches rarely integrate energy management with conducting preventive maintenance at the strategic level, ignoring energy-saving opportunities that may arise during machines' downtime. This paper considers a serial production system with intermediate finite buffers. Based on the concept of "energy-saving opportunity window" and the modelling of the continuous deterioration process of each machine, the window of energy-saving opportunity of the production system is regarded as a window of opportunity for the preventive maintenance, thus a proactive preventive maintenance strategy is proposed. The serial production system is modeled and the impact of different maintenance thresholds on the energy efficiency is explored by means of Monte Carlo simulation. For purpose of maximizing the energy efficiency of the entire production system, an iterative algorithm for solving the optimal preventive maintenance thresholds is presented as well. The numerical analysis with other maintenance strategies shows that the proposed strategy is more competitive in improving the effective throughput while reducing the overall energy consumption.

J	Belderbos, R; Tong, TW; Wu, SB				Belderbos, Rene; Tong, Tony W.; Wu, Shubin			Portfolio configuration and foreign entry decisions: A juxtaposition of real options and risk diversification theories	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						flexibility; market entry; multinational firm; portfolio; real options; risk diversification	DIRECT-INVESTMENT; JOINT VENTURES; EXCHANGE-RATES; DOWNSIDE RISK; FLEXIBILITY; STRATEGIES; MULTINATIONALITY; FIRM; RELATEDNESS; EXPANSION	Research Summary Research on foreign market entry has rarely considered that multinational firms' new entries may be affected by the configuration of their existing affiliates. We argue that in making entry decisions, firms take into account how an entry into a new location helps increase the operational flexibility of their affiliate portfolios due to options to switch operations across affiliates in case of diverging labor cost developments across host countries. We juxtapose this real options-based explanation with a risk diversification explanation. Analysis of Japanese multinational firms' foreign entry decisions suggests that the two explanations are complementary. We also establish portfolio-level boundary conditions to the influence of operational flexibility considerations on entry, in the form of product diversification and the nature of dispersion of labor cost levels. Managerial Summary When deciding on whether to enter a foreign market, managers of a multinational firm are intuitively aware that they need to consider how the economic environment of the target host country is related to the environments of the existing countries in which the firm operates. The less the environments are correlated with each other, whether in terms of input cost or market demand conditions, the greater the chance that the firm may capture cost savings and reduce sales volatility globally. These benefits arise from a switching option to shift operations flexibly across countries and from an ability to reduce risk by holding a portfolio of diversified global investments. Our findings support both sets of considerations, suggesting that companies do give due attention to correlations in labor cost and market demand between the target host country to enter and the existing host countries.

But how do these effects play out in the strategies of platform providers and complementors as the ecosystem evolves? We study how user preferences for ecosystem innovativeness (complement novelty and quality) and ecosystem size (number of complementors/complements), and demand-based economies of scale, shape the strategic interactions between the platform provider and the complementors in the ecosystem. Using an analytical model, we identify the conditions that give rise to a trade-off between ecosystem innovativeness and size; when (and why) this trade-off generates a tension between value co-creation and appropriation among ecosystem participants; and the strategic implications for ecosystem competitiveness and for the different stages of the ecosystem's evolution. Managerial summary Managing complementors' incentives is critical for the success of a platform ecosystem. Such incentives may be offered not only for joining the platform, but also for contributing high-quality, innovative complements throughout the ecosystem's evolution. In this article, we show that demand-side economies of scale are the driving force of complementors' incentives, and hence the key success factor for platform strategies. The strength of user preferences ultimately determines whether a larger ecosystem can also be more innovative, in which case all ecosystem participants can gain; or if instead there is a trade-off between size and innovativeness, which could also lead to a tension between value co-creation and appropriation among the platform provider and its complementors. The different stages of the evolution of a platform ecosystem call for different strategies that adapt to the evolution of user preferences.

In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Multi-Level Theory for Supplier Participation on Digital Platforms	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Digital platforms; multi-level theory; induction; abduction; decision trees; big data; emerging markets; platform growth; platform participation	DECISION-MAKING; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITION; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; GOVERNANCE; STRATEGY; DYNAMICS; DESIGN; ENVIRONMENT	Digital platforms have transformed various industries, with profound changes witnessed in settings characterized by repeated, low value, and novel transactions, such as ride sharing, household services, and food delivery. Platform providers need to understand the factor(s) that suppliers consider before choosing to participate on their platforms. We argue that multi-level theorizing is necessary to explain the patterns of decision criteria that constitute the complex, yet boundedly-rational decision of platform participation. We draw on multiple theoretical perspectives which include predictors from firm-level strategic behavior, firm-level digital predictors, institutional predictors, and platform level, competition and contextual (environmental) predictors to model restaurant's decision to participate on food delivery platforms, which are an exemplar of platforms that digitize transactions of ubiquitous and episodic nature. The population of 95,735 restaurants, serving a total of 135 different cuisines, located in the 37 largest cities of India, forms the dataset for developing our multi-level theory. Our decision tree induction methodology, which employs high levels of pruning, empowers us to discover context-specific rules that serve as credible approximations of the partial ordering of decision flows tacitly used by restaurants in deciding to participate on platforms. We identify six combinations of predictors, that is, decision rules, which are situated in at least four theoretical perspectives, to succinctly explain supplier participation on digital platforms. Finally, we abduct away from these specific decision rules to develop generalizable theoretical propositions. The decision trees, context-specific rules, general forms of the rules, and generalized propositions together form our multi-level theory for supplier participation on digital platforms. Our findings aid platform providers identify suppliers who can be the focus of efforts to increase platform participation, and help suppliers identify the participation status of competitors. For policymakers, our findings imply that incentives at the ends of the pricing spectrum can increase supplier participation on digital platforms.

However, mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate and environmental changes. The protection and sustainable management of mountain ecosystems are thus of great importance and are listed as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 15.4) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. The mountain green cover index (MGCI, SDG 15.4.2), which is defined by measuring the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas, is one of the two SDG indicators for monitoring the conservation status of mountain environments. However, as a country indicator, it is challenging to use the current MGCI data to quantify the detailed changes in highly heterogeneous mountain areas within each country, and correspondingly, the measures is limited when supporting sustainable development and protection strategy decisionmaking for mountain environments. In this paper, a new global high resolution gridded-MGCI calculation method that depicts the varying details in the MGCI from both the spatial and temporal domains was proposed based on 30-m Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. In the method, first, a grid-based MGCI calculation model was proposed by that considers the true surface area instead of the planimetric area of each mountain pixel. The global green vegetation cover was then extracted using all available 30-m Landsat-8 satellite observations within the calendar year on the GEE platform via a new frequency- and phenology-based algorithm. The mountain true surface area was finally calculated and introduced into the MGCI calculation model for global MGCI mapping. The results showed that the green vegetation cover extracted from 30 m Landsat images can reach an overall accuracy of 95.56%. In general, 69.73% of the global mountain surface had 1.05 times more surface area than planimetric area. The average difference between the MGCIs considering the surface area and planimetric area can reach 11.89%. According to the statistics of the global grid MGCI, 68.79% of the global mountain area had an MGCI higher than 90%, 16.94% of the global mountain area had no vegetation cover and 3.81% of mountain area had an MGCI lower than 10%. The proposed MGCIs were further aggregated at the country level and compared with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) MGCI baseline data from 2017. The comparison indicated good consistency between the two datasets, with an R-2 of 0.9548 and a mean absolute difference of 4.26%. The new MGCI calculation method was based all available Landsat-8 observations from a year, which reduced the dependence of the MGCI on the updating frequency of the land cover product. Furthermore, the method has great potential for getting the spatio-temporal continuous MGCI with a high spatial resolution for characterizing explicit mountain vegetation dynamics and vegetation-climate change interactions to advance our understanding of global mountain changes. The new MGCI data will be available on the CASEarth data-sharing platform.

J	Ho, J; Pang, C; Choy, C				Ho, John; Pang, Christopher; Choy, Crisann			Content marketing capability building: a conceptual framework	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN INTERACTIVE MARKETING			English	Article						Content marketing; Marketing strategy; Brand values; Capability building; Social media; Digital marketing; Online marketing; Social media marketing; Facebook; Value; Digital growth; Digitalisations	MEDIA	Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual framework that identifies engaging CM practices, specifically how compelling content is created. Content marketing (CM) is fast becoming a key pillar in a company's marketing mix. It is also a requisite for companies seeking to modernise their marketing practices through digitalisation to enhance online branding. However, overlapping definitions and interchangeable terms arising from different perspectives and methodological practices confound what exactly constitutes CM. Although CM is generally accepted as sharing brand content via owned media to gain earned media, a strategic approach, based on evidence-driven research, is needed to navigate through the overwhelming confusion so that companies can better plan and implement CM. Design/methodology/approach This paper addresses the scarcity of work with regard to CM practices in Asia. To address this research gap, the study examines content creation practices of five successful companies, based in Singapore, through case studies, interviews and content analyses, to propose a CM capability development framework. Findings The findings point to the need for content creation to align with brand values and value creation to create and socialise compelling content for positive impact. Content created for audiences and marketed by brands can generate value when it is consumed and shared. The paper also provided much needed clarity in terms of how CM capability can be gained to minimise costly trial and error. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to companies operating in Asia. The framework will require implementation in other regions. Another limitation of the study was that it did not extend to how consumers responded to CM posts. This is an area for further research that can help validate the proposed framework. Practical implications - The analytical framework adopted in this study can also be used as a functional CM model for marketing managers to construct better CM strategies and informed standards of practice by growing capabilities. Social implications CM is also a requisite for companies seeking to modernise their marketing practices through digitalisation to enhance online branding, particularly for small- and medium-sized companies. Originality/value This paper addresses the scarcity of work with regard to CM practices in Asia.

Specifically, adopting the sustainability disclosure framework, we analyse how firms within the airport industry achieve the SDGs 11 and 17 showing how the initiatives are developed and implemented. Drawing from a broad review of the main contributions in the research and practice, we conduct a qualitative study through the reading and processing of financial statements and nonfinancial reports (sustainability and social reporting) of seven major strategic airport infrastructures in Italy to outline the initiatives implemented for meeting the SDGs. The main Italian airport infrastructures investigated still are not able to completely meet the SDGs goals, especially the SDGs 11 and 17, although they mention the SDGs in their financial and non-financial reporting, they still continue to develop and implement some specific initiatives to achieve high sustainable performance. This article outlines the need to create conditions for developing and better implementing the accounting and reporting practices, like the SBSC (Sustainable Balanced Scorecard), as well as adequate organisational architectures and educational training and management programs for achieving the SDGs goals within firms.

Researchers worldwide have paid great attention to identifying and exploiting the main drivers of innovation management, which has led to many research articles that have adopted different approaches and identified several factors that are related to innovation. Nevertheless, there is some ambiguity about the critical behavioral factors for innovation. Therefore, this study aims to identify behavioral incentives, or key factors, that impact business innovation and financial stability, mainly in the field of strategic management, and to reveal the latest trend in corporate innovation policy by using bibliographic mapping. The purpose is to precisely define specific incentives that can influence the overall productivity and profitability of a business, and this list of innovation factors can be of benefit to a strategic manager in introducing or supporting innovative activities. The analysis is preceded by an in-depth study of publications from the Web of Science and Scopus databases and based on the VOS Viewer method (which is a mapping and clustering program for network data), the available keywords are analyzed, and then a list of incentives in strategic innovation is compiled.

J	Johnson, JP				Johnson, Justin P.			The agency and wholesale models in electronic content markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Agency model; Lock-in; Electronic books; e-books; Antitrust	COMPETITION; INCENTIVES; CHOICE	I analyze a model of dynamic competition between retail platforms in the presence of consumer lock-in. Two different revenue models are considered, one in which platforms set final retail prices and one in which the suppliers set final retail prices. Platforms have long-term (or strategic) pricing incentives but suppliers do not, which implies that the inter-temporal price path faced by consumers depends on the revenue model in place. When suppliers set prices instead of platforms, prices may be higher in early periods but lower in later periods, suggesting that appropriate antitrust enforcement ought to consider more than initial price changes when an industry shifts to the agency model. Indeed, consumers may (but need not) prefer the agency model even when prices increase in initial periods. A potential downside of the agency model is that it may align the incentives of suppliers and platforms and thereby encourage platforms to lower the competitiveness of the supplier market, harming consumers; no such incentives exist under the wholesale model. I relate my results to events in the market for electronic books. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This agility often requires the collaboration with supply chain partners. However, how a manufacturing firm collaborates with its suppliers to achieve agility remains an understudied issue. This study holds that manufacturing firms and their suppliers need to develop manufacturer-supplier flexibility accompanied with well-built integrated information systems and associated analytical systems (such as business intelligence) to enable manufacturer agility. To deepen our understanding of the roles of manufacturer-supplier flexibility and IOS technologies in facilitating manufacturer agility, we build and test a model based on the real options theory and bounded rationality. Based on 141 matched-pair samples of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our findings demonstrate the importance of manufacturer-supplier flexibility in achieving higher manufacturer agility, wherein IOS integration enables better flexibility. We also show IOS-enabled analytical ability can strengthen the effect of such flexibility on manufacturer agility. Implications of the results for practices and academics are provided.

J	Sunder, MV; Prashar, A				Sunder, Vijaya M.; Prashar, Anupama			Empirical examination of critical failure factors of continuous improvement deployments: stage-wise results and a contingency theory perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Continuous improvement; Critical failure factors; contextual variables; competitive advantage; quality management	LEAN 6 SIGMA; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; SIX-SIGMA; IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; CONTEXT; IMPACT; PROGRAMS	Organisations implement various Continuous Improvement (CI) practices such as Total Quality Management, Lean, Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) for improving their processes. Drawing from the success and failure stories of these structured CI practices, scholars enumerated Critical Success Factors and Critical Failure Factors (CFFs). This study empirically examines the occurrence of various CFFs across different stages of CI deployment. Further, from a contingency theoretic perspective, this study investigates their associations with contextual variables by collecting survey data from 213 business units from the USA, the UK, China, and India. Principal Component Analysis is used to group CFFs across five CI deployment stages leading to an empirically refined framework for CI. Crosstab analysis using the chi-square likelihood ratio presented associations of CFFs with contextual variables. Findings reveal significant differences in the occurrence of CFFs across countries. There is evidence that LSS is less prone to failures when compared with TQM, Lean and Six Sigma. The occurrence of CFFs has been relatively lower in smaller and medium-sized enterprises operating in the service sector. Findings also reveal that lessons learned from each CI deployment cycle, contribute to organisational learning, and thence, leading to success at the strategic CI level of maturity.

J	Silvestre, WJ; Fonseca, A				Silvestre, Winston Jeronimo; Fonseca, Ana			Integrative Sustainable Intelligence: A holistic model to integrate corporate sustainability strategies	CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						corporate sustainability; integrative sustainability; stakeholders; sustainable development; sustainable strategy	HYBRID BOTTOM-LINE; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; BUSINESS MODELS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; CERTIFICATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; GOVERNANCE; CAPACITY	Organizations have been showing a growing awareness regarding the importance of corporate sustainability. However, the integration of sustainability concerns in companies' long-term planning, strategic management, processes, and activities is still challenging, disconnected, and often conducted in isolation. Based on a qualitative exploratory research combining different perspectives found in the literature, the present research presents a theoretical framework that is expected to enhance the adequate development and management of organizational sustainability-oriented practices - the Integrative Sustainable Intelligence model. This model provides organizational managers with a structured framework to adequately understand, select, implement and assess sustainability promoting actions, based on the development of structural and systematic disruptive tools and involving the exchange of collaborative ideas between organizational stakeholders. The adoption of the Integrative Sustainable Intelligence model is expected to foster change processes and innovations in the search for solutions for sustainability-oriented business models.

J	Lee, MY; Mazmanian, M; Perlow, L				Lee, Michael Y.; Mazmanian, Melissa; Perlow, Leslie			FOSTERING POSITIVE RELATIONAL DYNAMICS: THE POWER OF SPACES AND INTERACTION SCRIPTS	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY; UNDERSTANDING CONFLICT; SELF-DISCLOSURE; EMPLOYEE VOICE; WORK; COMMUNICATION; BEHAVIOR; SENSEMAKING; INTEGRATION; INCIVILITY	Despite well-accepted understanding that relational dynamics characterized by respect, openness, and connectedness are critical for healthy team functioning, we know little about how to foster such dynamics. Drawing on observation and interview data from an intervention that fostered positive change in the relational dynamics of a global distributed team, this paper theorizes the mechanisms that enabled a move toward positive relational dynamics. We find that the intervention brought about relational changes by not only creating spaces where the team could experiment with new forms of interaction, but also by utilizing "interaction scripts"-concrete guidelines for interaction that specify content parameters and participation rules. We establish that the combination of spaces and interaction scripts was critical for helping the team enact counter-normative forms of interpersonal sharing that led to the emergence of positive relational dynamics. While existing research has highlighted the importance of spaces for enabling positive relational change, this paper theorizes the complementary role that interaction scripts can play in the change process. These findings have implications for research on positive relationships at work, organizational change, and global and geographically dispersed teams.

J	Rahimi, B; Sharifzadeh, M; Feng, XT				Rahimi, Behrooz; Sharifzadeh, Mostafa; Feng, Xia-Ting			Ground behaviour analysis, support system design and construction strategies in deep hard rock mining - Justified in Western Australian's mines	JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Ground management; Support system design; Sequential excavation; Stress management; Geotechnical monitoring; Deep underground mines	TUNNELS	Development of deep underground mining projects is crucial for optimum extraction of mineral deposits. The main challenges at great depth are high rock stress levels, seismic events, large-scale deformation, sudden failures and high temperatures that may cause abrupt and unpredictable instability and collapse over a large scale. In this paper, a ground control and management strategy was presented corresponding to the three stages of projects: strategic design, tactical design and operational design. Strategic design is results in preparing a broad plan and primary design for mining excavations. The tactical design is to provide detail design such as stabilisation methods. Operational design stage is related to monitoring and updating design parameters. The most effective ground control strategies in this stage are maintenance, rehabilitation, monitoring and contingency plan. Additionally, a new procedure for design of ground support systems for deep and hard rock was proposed. The main principles are: static and/or dynamic loading types, determination of loading sources, characterisation of geological conditions and the effects of orientation of major structures with openings, estimation of ground loading factor, identification of potential primary and secondary failures, utilisation of appropriate design analysis methods, estimation of depth failure, calculation of the static and/or dynamic demand ground support capacity, and selection of surface and reinforcement elements. Gravitational force is the dominant loading force in low-level stresses. In high stress level, failure mechanism becomes more complex in rock mass structures. In this condition, a variety of factors such as release of stored energy due to seismic events, stress concentration, and major structures influence on ground behaviour and judgement are very complicated. The key rock engineering schemes to minimise the risk of failures in high-stress levels at great depth involve depressurisation and quality control of materials. Microseismic and blast monitoring throughout the mining operations are required to control sudden failures. Proper excavation sequences in underground stopes based on top-down, bottom-up, centre-out and abutment-centre were discussed. Also, the performance of a ground support system was examined by field observation monitoring systems for controlling and modifying ground support elements. The important outcome of the research is that the proposed procedure of selecting ground support systems for static and dynamic situations was applied in several deep underground mines in Western Australia. Ground behaviour modes and failure mechanism were identified and assessed. Ground demand for static and dynamic conditions was estimated and an appropriate ground support system was selected and evaluated in site-specific conditions according to proposed method for ground support design at great depth. The stability of rock masses was confirmed, and the reliability of the design methodology for great depth and hard rock conditions was also justified.

(Richu); Evans, Tiffany			Preferences for End-of-Life Care and Decision Making Among Older and Seriously Ill Inpatients: A Cross-Sectional Study	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						End-of-life; acute care; Australia; communication	PALLIATIVE CARE; HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; OUTCOMES; QUALITY; DISCUSSIONS; FAMILIES; PLACE; COMMUNICATION; DISTRESS; RECEIPT	Context. Older and seriously ill Australians are often admitted to hospital in the last year of their life. The extent to which these individuals have considered important aspects of end-of-life (EOL) care, including location in which care is provided, goals of care, and involvement of others in decision making, is unclear. Objectives. To determine, in a sample of older and seriously ill Australian inpatients, preferences regarding location in which they receive EOL care and reasons for their choice; who is involved in EOL decisions; disclosure of life expectancy; goals of care; and voluntary-assisted dying. Methods. Cross-sectional face-to-face survey interviews conducted with 186 (80% consent) inpatients in a tertiary referral center aged 80 years and older; or aged 55 years and older with progressive chronic disease(s); or with physician-estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months. Results. Home care was preferred (69%), given the perceived availability of family/friends, familiarity of environment, and likelihood of having wishes respected. If unable to make decisions themselves, inpatients wanted family to decide care alone (31%) or with a doctor (49%). Of those who had not discussed life expectancy, 23% wished to. Most (76%) preferred care that maintained quality of life and relieved symptoms. There was some agreement for being sedated at the EOL (63%) and able to access medication to end life (43%). Conclusion. Most inpatients would prefer EOL care that maintains quality and relieves suffering compared with life extension and to receive this care at home. Family involvement in resolution and documentation of EOL decisions should be prioritized. (C) 2019 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Decoding the way that the final demand influences water consumption patterns is helpful for understanding the discrepancy between water supply and demand. Especially in the current time, when China has experienced socioeconomic transition and its government has proposed a series of water conservation policies over the years, exploring the transition in the water consumption pattern is necessary for further water conservation in China. Meanwhile, there exist distinct economic levels and stages of development among provinces, making it necessary to develop more refined water management strategies in the various provinces. This study comprehensively investigates the trend, spatial distribution and structure of the water footprint in mainland China. Furthermore, it explores the effects of socioeconomic factors on transitions in water footprint patterns with the aid of multi-regional input-output analysis, structural decomposition analysis, and linear regression. The results show that the water footprints of almost all the provinces were decoupled from economic growth from 2007 to 2012. Several northern provinces dramatically increased their water footprints, further enlarging the difference between north and south. The north also showed a wider urban-rural gap in per capita water footprint than did the south. From the viewpoint of structural transitions, household consumption (as the primary contributor) remained stable while an obvious increase in the water footprint was induced by fixed capital formation, in which agriculture and strategic emerging manufacturing played important roles. From the perspective of driving forces, water intensity improvement and changes in the final demand structure saved water. However, these effects were counteracted by the change in the final demand level and the composition of the final products. By identifying China's water footprint patterns and its transitions, our results clarify China's strategic water demand pattern and provide refined insights for future water conservation.

Importance of factors driving firms' decisions on spatial distribution structures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Spatial distribution structure; distribution channel layout; distribution centre location; warehouse location; Best-Worst Method (BWM)	DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; LOGISTICS SPRAWL; LOCATION; TRANSPORT; QUALITY; DESIGN; LAND; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT	The design of a spatial distribution structure is of strategic importance for companies, to meet required customer service levels and to keep logistics costs as low as possible. Spatial distribution structure decisions concern distribution channel layout - i.e. the spatial layout of the transport and storage system - as well as distribution centre location(s). This paper examines the importance of seven main factors and 33 sub-factors that determine these decisions. The Best-Worst Method (BWM) was used to identify the factor weights, with pairwise comparison data being collected through a survey. The results indicate that the main factor is logistics costs. Logistics experts and decision makers respectively identify customer demand and service level as second most important factor. Important sub-factors are demand volatility, delivery time and perishability. This is the first study that quantifies the weights of the factors behind spatial distribution structure decisions. The factors and weights facilitate managerial decision-making with regard to spatial distribution structures for companies that ship a broad range of products with different characteristics. Public policy-makers can use the results to support the development of land use plans that provide facilities and services for a mix of industries.	[Onstein, Alexander T.

J	Ben Mohamed, I; Klibi, W; Vanderbeck, F				Ben Mohamed, Imen; Klibi, Walid; Vanderbeck, Francois			Designing a two-echelon distribution network under demand uncertainty	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Supply chain management; Two-echelon distribution network design; Location models; Uncertainty; Multi-period	STOCHASTIC-PROGRAMMING APPROACH; FACILITY LOCATION; SUPPLY CHAINS; LOGISTICS NETWORKS; MULTIPERIOD; OPTIMIZATION; MULTIECHELON; SCENARIOS; QUALITY	This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for the stochastic multi-period two-echelon distribution network design problem (2E-DDP) where product flows to ship-to-points are directed from an upper layer of primary warehouses to distribution platforms (DPs) before being transported to the shipto-points. A temporal hierarchy characterizes the design level dealing with DP location and capacity decisions, as well as the operational level involving transportation decisions as origin-destination flows. These design decisions must be calibrated to minimize the expected distribution cost associated with the two-echelon transportation schema on this network under stochastic demand. We consider a multi-period planning horizon where demand varies dynamically from one planning period to the next. Thus, the design of the two-echelon distribution network under uncertain customer demand gives rise to a complex multi-stage decisional problem. Given the strategic structure of the problem, we introduce alternative modeling approaches based on two-stage stochastic programming with recourse. We solve the resulting models using a Benders decomposition approach. The size of the scenario set is tuned using the sample average approximation (SAA) approach. Then, a scenario-based evaluation procedure is introduced to post-evaluate the design solutions obtained. We conduct extensive computational experiments based on several types of instances to validate the proposed models and assess the efficiency of the solution approaches. The evaluation of the quality of the stochastic solution underlines the impact of uncertainty in the two-echelon distribution network design problem (2E-DDP). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN: REGULATORY FOCUS AND THE PHASES OF CEO RETIREMENT	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article							FIRM PERFORMANCE; HORIZON PROBLEM; UPPER ECHELONS; RISK-TAKING; ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMISM; MANAGERIAL DISCRETION; SELF-DISCREPANCY; STRATEGIC CHANGE; PROMOTION PRIDE; IDENTITY WORK	CEO retirement represents the most common reason for executive succession in the United States and globally, with important implications for many stakeholders. Yet a comprehensive theory of late-career-stage executives-such as those approaching retirement-is absent from the management literature. Building on the literature on liminality, we develop theory centered on late-stage CEOs by conceptualizing executive retirement as a process that unfolds in three phases. In our framework we integrate upper echelons theory with regulatory focus theory to examine the relationship of promotion and prevention focus with the timing, pace, and nature of retiring executive role separation, transition, and reincorporation. We then construct four CEO ideal types-icon, custodian, balancer, and chairwarmer-which are based on configurations of the orthogonal dimensions of promotion and prevention focus, and by following each type along a unique pathway, we show how an integrated view of these dimensions leads to nuanced predictions. Finally, we highlight the dynamic nature of our model by investigating the role of two salient contextual factors-CEO age and past achievements-and show how they can alter retirement pathways. We discuss how a deeper understanding of executive retirement informs strategic leadership research.

FACTORS INFLUENCING URBAN INVESTMENT ATTRACTIVENESS: AN FCM-SD APPROACH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decision aid; (fuzzy) cognitive mapping; strategic planning; system dynamics; urban investment attractiveness; urban planning	FUZZY COGNITIVE MAPS; CITY; COMPETITIVENESS; SUSTAINABILITY; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; MCDA	The increasing concentration of populations in urban areas in recent decades has strengthened the interest in and the importance given to - these zones. Cities have become quite attractive from investors' point of view because of the wide array of opportunities and growing need for investment in urban areas. Thus, city strategic planning quite often requires an understanding of the determinants that attract investment to urban zones. This study sought to identify the factors that strengthen urban investment based on the knowledge of a panel of experts. Fuzzy cognitive mapping techniques were applied to understand the concepts and decision criteria included in the decision-support model and their cause-and-effect relationships. The results provide insights into which determinants most strongly influence urban investment, namely, infrastructure, supporting services, and political-administrative factors. Diverse scenarios at the intra- and inter-cluster levels were created to clarify the impacts of variable changes on the model developed. The findings were validated by both the expert panel members and the vice-president of the Portuguese Association of Real Estate Developers and Investors. Advantages and limitations of the proposed framework are presented, as well as recommendations for future research.	[Correia, Joana S. R.; Ferreirai, Fernando A.

Contrarily, deciphering the missing hereditability on BC, through identification of novel candidates, remains a challenge. We aimed to investigate the mutation prevalence and spectra in a highly selected cohort of Greek patients with BC, questioning an extensive number of genes, implicated in cancer predisposition and DNA repair, while calculating gene-specific BC risks that can ultimately lead to important associations. Methods To further discern BC susceptibility, a comprehensive 94-cancer gene panel was implemented in a cohort of 1382 Greek patients with BC, highly selected for strong family history and/or very young age (<35 years) at diagnosis, followed by BC risk calculation, based on a case-control analysis. Results Herein, 31.5% of patients tested carried pathogenic variants (PVs) in 28 known, suspected or candidate BC predisposition genes. In total, 24.8% of the patients carried BRCA1/2 loss-of-function variants. An additional 6.7% carried PVs in additional genes, the vast majority of which can be offered meaningful clinical changes. Significant association to BC predisposition was observed for ATM, PALB2, TP53, RAD51C and CHEK2 PVs. Primarily, compared with controls, RAD51C PVs and CHEK2 damaging missense variants were associated with high (ORs 6.19 (Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)) and 12.6 (Fabulous Ladies Over Seventy (FLOSSIES)), p<0.01) and moderate BC risk (ORs 3.79 (ExAC) and 5.9 (FLOSSIES), p<0.01), respectively. Conclusion Studying a large and unique cohort of highly selected patients with BC, deriving from a population with founder effects, provides important insight on distinct associations, pivotal for patient management.

We address this challenge by developing a maturity model for big data readiness for airline network planning. The development of the maturity model is grounded in literature, expert interviews and case study research involving nine airlines. Four airline business models are represented, namely full-service carriers, low-cost airlines, scheduled charter airlines and cargo airlines. The maturity model has been well received with seven change requests in the model development phase. The revised version has been evaluated as exhaustive and useful by airline network planners. The self-assessment of airlines revealed low to medium maturity for most domains. Organizational factors show the lowest average maturity, IT architecture the highest. Full-service carriers seem to be more mature than airlines with different business models.

Results of the meta-analysis of exponential random graph models for 12 classes (347 students, 4 schools) show that both self-declared Roma and non-Roma students are more likely to report that they bully peers they perceive as Roma compared to peers they perceive as non-Roma. This is after controlling for gender, socio-economic status, and structural characteristics of the bullying networks. Similar associations have not been found, however, analysing victims' reports.

J	Kusumasondjaja, S				Kusumasondjaja, Sony			Exploring the role of visual aesthetics and presentation modality in luxury fashion brand communication on Instagram	JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Luxury brand; Fashion; Content analysis; Instagram; Presentation modality; Visual aesthetics	SOCIAL MEDIA; PRODUCT INVOLVEMENT; CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT; PURCHASE INTENTION; FACEBOOK; INFORMATION; RICHNESS; DESIGN; GENDER; COMPLEXITY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the strategic importance of visual aesthetics and presentation modality for consumer responses to fashion luxury brand content posted on Instagram. Design/methodology/approach - A content analysis of 40,679 posts on the official Instagram accounts of 15 global luxury brands was conducted. Findings - Brand posts using expressive aesthetic image received more likes and comments on Instagram than those with classical aesthetics. Brand video content received more likes and comments than static content. There was also a significant interaction between visual aesthetics and presentation modality in generating likes and comments. Brand content adopting expressive aesthetic and audio-visual modality generated more responses when using audio-visual modality, while content using classical aesthetics produced more responses in a visual-only format. Practical implications - As visual aesthetics and modality resulted in different responses to Instagram ads, luxury marketers should consider using appropriate approaches when creating brand posts on Instagram. Originality/value - This is one of the few studies examining the effectiveness of visual aesthetics and presentation modality in Instagram advertising, especially in luxury fashion brand context.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LOW-LEVEL MANAGEMENT'S ATTITUDE TO MARKETING AND INNOVATIONS IN THE LUXURY FASHION INDUSTRY: PRO - OR ANTI-CSR?	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); luxury fashion; management; sustainability	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; BRAND VALUE; SUSTAINABILITY; ETHICS; BUSINESS; COMMUNICATION; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN; FIRM	The senior management of several luxury fashion businesses proclaim a commitment to sustainability and an engagement in all CSR categories. However, how is this projected in the lower levels of management, i.e. do 'low-level' managers exercise their marketing and innovations tasks in a manner compatible with the proclaimed CSR? An investigative pioneering case study of the attitude of the low-level management of top luxury fashion businesses in Prague reveals that their marketing and innovation endeavours have very little in common with the CSR strategies and priorities set officially for the business. The comparative holistic Meta-analysis of three rounds of interviews points to critical problems generated by both systematic and individual deficiencies of the lower level managers that lead to their reduced knowledge and/or interest towards linking the marketing and innovation functions with CSR commands This new discovery of the asymmetry of the attitude to marketing and innovations has strong implications for management research at the academic level, as well as for the practical drive for a more effective and efficient management. In this paper, the 1st objective identified rather a satisfactory attitude of owners and senior managers, but the 2nd investigative objective showed that low-level management often has a reduced knowledge and/or interest in linking the marketing and innovation functions with CSR best practice. The differences across even the same groups, as well as other intrinsic data proposed with respect to the 3 R1 objective suggest that the causes for such a deplorable situation are both systematic and individual. The consequences include a loss of clientele. It is amazing that luxury fashion businesses with such developed CSR statements and advertised marketing and innovation actions linked to basically all CSR categories have front-line employees, including managers, who do not share such commitments, and, instead, excessively go into auxiliary aspects and ultimately frustrate CSR approaches.

J	Rouse, ED				Rouse, Elizabeth D.			WHERE YOU END AND I BEGIN: UNDERSTANDING INTIMATE CO-CREATION	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article							PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP; PRODUCTIVITY LOSS; SELF-DISCLOSURE; POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS; BRAINSTORMING GROUPS; INTEGRATIVE MODEL; WORK; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONS; IDENTITY	Creative work is a social process that requires effective collaboration between individuals. Accordingly, theories account for the ways creativity takes place in teams and groups and the role that social networks play in shaping creativity. However, scholars have largely overlooked the role that dyads play in creative work within organizations. This article builds theory on how intimate co-creation occurs and how it influences the generation of creative ideas over time. I theorize that as people create together, they engage in intimate creative interactions, which under certain circumstances lead to the development of a shared interpersonal boundary (i.e., a sense of "we"). This shared interpersonal boundary influences creativity by circumscribing a closed, safe space in which the dyad can explore divergent ideas and manage the paradoxes of creativity; it also enables shared scripts and schemas that help the dyad move through creative blocks. By integrating theories of intimate interactions, psychological ownership, and interpersonal relationships, this article advances our understanding of how dyads-specifically, intimate co-creation-influence creative work.

Focusing on the specific design features of technologies, their availability, and their use, we present a conceptual framework to examine how health technologies may benefit some groups more than others by combining the theory of fundamental causes with a technology-in-practice approach. We examine three classes of technologies that have been associated with health inequities: once-advanced technologies such as kidney dialysis and transplantation for end-stage renal disease, which have been plagued by issues of scarcity and fair distribution, generating racial disparities; the highly anticipated precision medicine promising to change the focus from population to individualized medicine; and digital technologies, which may herald a democratization of health care.

National Wetland Map 5: An improved spatial extent and representation of inland aquatic and estuarine ecosystems in South Africa	WATER SA			English	Article						wetland inventory; National Wetland Map; inland aquatic ecosystems; estuarine functional zone; macro estuaries; micro estuaries; National Biodiversity Assessment; Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) reporting; Ramsar	CONSERVATION; DELINEATION; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; AREAS; LAKES	The improved representation of freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and associated data was a key component of the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment, and is an essential step in enhancing defensible land use planning and decision making. This paper reports on the enhancement of the National Wetland Map (NWM) version 5 for South Africa and other data layers associated with the South African Inventory of Inland Aquatic Ecosystems. Detail is provided on (i) the extent of wetlands mapped in NWM5, compared to previous versions of the NWMs; (ii) the improved extent of inland wetlands mapped in focus areas in NWM5 relative to NWM4; (iii) the type of cover associated with the wetlands (inundated, vegetated or arid); (iv) the ecotone between rivers and estuaries; and (v) level of confidence for the inland wetlands in terms of how well the extent and hydrogeomorphic units were captured for each sub-quaternary catchment of South Africa. A total of 4 596 509 Ira (3.8% of South Africa) of inland aquatic ecosystems and artificial wetlands have now been mapped, with NWM5 delineating 23% more inland wetlands (2 650 509 ha or 2.2% of SA) compared with NWM4. The estuarine functional zone, which encapsulates all estuarine processes, and associated habitats and biota, was refined for 290 systems totalling 200 739 ha, with the addition of 42 micro-estuaries totalling 340 ha, Nearly 600 000 ha (0.5% of SA) of artificial wetlands were mapped in SA. Inland wetlands are predominantly palustrine (55%), with some arid (34%) and a few inundated systems (11%). Ecotones between rivers arid estuaries, ecotones where biota and processes continuously vary from freshwater to estuarine, formed a small fraction (<1.5%) of river total extent (164 018 km). Most inland wetlands (similar to 70%) had a low confidence ranking for designation of extent and typing, because they were not mapped by a wetland specialist and not verified in the field. Future improvements of the map should be focused on catchment-based improvements, particularly in strategic water-source areas, areas of high development pressure and those with low confidence designation.

J	Wang, X; Ng, CT; Dong, CW				Wang, Xuan; Ng, Chi To; Dong, Ciwei			Implications of peer-to-peer product sharing when the selling firm joins the sharing market	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Sharing economy; Peer-to-peer product sharing; Pricing; Quality	SECONDARY MARKETS; QUALITY; STRATEGIES; ECONOMY; MODEL	In peer-to-peer product sharing markets, the consumers, who own some products but do not fully utilize them, may share their products with some renters who do not own the products. In this paper, we consider a peer-topeer product sharing problem, in which a firm that sells a product in a selling market may also directly share the product with the consumers. There are two types of consumers with high and low usage levels of the product. They may (1) buy the product to become an owner, and rent it out when they do not use it; (2) not buy the product but be a renter to rent the product for usage; or (3) neither buy nor rent the product. By analyzing a novel model, we study the effects of the firm's direct involvement in the product sharing and the firm's strategic decision of the product quality on equilibrium outcomes. We find that the firm will join the sharing market only when the proportion of high-usage consumers and the cost of joining are relatively low. When the firm can strategically decide the product quality, it is optimal for the firm to improve the product quality when it joins the sharing market.

By constructing a sound theoretical foundation for GMCR based upon assumptions reflecting what actually occurs in reality, a fascinating story is narrated on how GMCR was able to expand in bold new directions as well as take advantage of many important legacy decision technologies built within the earlier Metagame Analysis and later Conflict Analysis paradigms. From its predecessors, for instance, GMCR could benefit by the employment of option form put forward within Metagame Analysis for effectively recording a conflict, as well as preference elicitation techniques and solution concepts for defining chess-like behavior when calculating stability of states from the realm of Conflict Analysis. The key ideas outlined in the paper underlying the current and projected capabilities of GMCR include the development of four different ways to handle preference uncertainty in the presence of either transitive or intransitive preferences; a wide range of solution concepts for describing many kinds of human behavior under conflict; unique coalition analysis algorithms for determining if a given decision maker can fare better in a dispute via cooperation; tracing the evolution of a conflict over time; and the matrix formulation of GMCR for computational efficiency when calculating stability and also theoretically expanding GMCR in bold new directions. Inverse engineering is mentioned as an AI extension of GMCR for computationally determining the preferences required by decision makers in order to reach a desirable state, such as a climate change agreement in which all nations significantly cut back on their greenhouse gas emissions. The basic design of a decision support system for permitting researchers and practitioners to readily apply the foregoing and other advancements in GMCR to tough real world controversies is discussed. Although GMCR has been successfully applied to challenging disputes arising in many different fields, a simple climate change negotiation conflict between the US and China is utilized to explain clearly key concepts mentioned throughout the fascinating historical journey surrounding GMCR.

Many of the papers cited in this article were written jointly with other researchers while other referenced work did not involve the authors. The academic home at which they completed much of their GMCR research is the Conflict Analysis Group located in the Department of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to Dr. Yi Xiao, a Postdoctoral Fellow within the Conflict Analysis Group and its Executive Manager (2017 to 2019), for his timely advice and work in preparing the current paper. Ms. Yu (Jasmine) Han, an International Visiting Graduate Student within the Conflict Analysis Group (November 2018 to November 2019) who is from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China where she is a Ph.D. student, kindly assisted the authors to incorporate reviewers' comments into this paper. They are also grateful to Mrs. Sheila Hipel for carefully reading many versions of the paper to enhance its presentation quality. They are thankful to a number of professional organizations for sponsoring academic journals and conferences in which papers dealing with GMCR were published and presented over many years. These include the Group Decision and Negotiation Section of INFORMS (The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences) which is affiliated with the Springer journal Group Decision and Negotiation and hosts an annual international conference, as well as the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society which publishes the journal named the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems and holds a yearly international conference. The authors have organized special sessions on conflict resolution at all international GDN and SMC conferences since 2001 and 1991, respectively. Special sessions on conflict resolution have been included in all conferences sponsored by the International Conferences on Water Resources and Environment Research (ICWRER) since the founding of this sequence of conferences at Waterloo in 1993. The research appearing in this paper and other published work involving the authors were funded by Discovery Grants separately held by the authors from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada (Grant Nos.

J	Liu, B; Li, XF; Zheng, G				Liu, Bin; Li, Xiaofeng; Zheng, Gang			Coastal Inundation Mapping From Bitemporal and Dual-Polarization SAR Imagery Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							MODEL	This study develops an effective and robust method to mine bitemporal and dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery information for coastal inundation mapping, based on deep convolutional neural networks. The specially tailored deep convolutional neural network-based SAR coastal flooding mapping network (SARCFMNet) leverages two modifications to improve the accuracy and robustness: the physics-aware input information design and the regularization. The proposed SARCFMNet is applied to the mapping and impact analysis of the coastal inundation caused by 2017 Hurricane Harvey near Houston, Texas, USA. Six pairs of Sentinel-1 SAR images are analyzed along with corresponding ground truth data from Copernicus Emergency Management Service Rapid Mapping products and land-cover types from Google Earth and OpenStreetMap. Flooded areas of 4,000 km(2) are extracted and analyzed. In an analyzed scene, 76% of the flooded area was agriculture area like pasture and cultivated crops field. A flooding map series shows the inundation shrinking rate is about 1% of the analyzed scene per day after the passage of Harvey. However, there was a delayed inundation in Glen Flora, Texas, after the heavy raining period. The average mapping accuracy and F1 score, that is, the harmonic mean of recall and precision, are 0.98 and 0.88, respectively. The impact of wind and cost-sensitive loss functions on the development of SARCFMNet is also discussed. This study demonstrates the proposed method can accurately map hurricane-induced inundation. The method can also be readily extended to other multitemporal SAR imagery classification applications.

The first tier refers to the transportation between the city distribution centers, in the outskirts of the city, and intermediate facilities, while the second tier refers to the transportation of goods between the intermediate facilities and the (pickup and delivery) customers. We focus on the second tier, and consider that customers and facilities have time windows in which they can be visited. Waiting is possible at waiting stations for free or at customers and facilities at a given cost or penalty. Therefore, it is relevant to coordinate the arrivals of vehicles at facilities and customers with the corresponding time windows. The MT-PDTWCF calls for determining minimum (fixed, routing and waiting) cost multi-trip routes, for a given fleet of vehicles, to service separately pickup and delivery customers, while taking into account vehicle capacity and time windows both at customers and facilities. We propose the first exact algorithm for MT-PDTWCF, namely a Branch-and-Cut-and-Price algorithm. It is based on column generation, where the pricing problem is solved by a bi-directional dynamic programming algorithm designed to cope with the features of the problem. Subset-row and rounded capacity inequalities are adapted to deal with MT-PDTWCF and inserted in the Branch-and-Cut-and-Price algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on benchmark instances with up to 200 customers, showing its effectiveness. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Do associations of sex, age and education with transport and leisure-time physical activity differ across 17 cities in 12 countries?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY			English	Article						Social epidemiology; International health; Physical activity domain; IPAQ; Health disparities	ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE; ENVIRONMENTS; PITFALLS; PROGRESS	Background: Leisure-time and transport activity domains are studied most often because they are considered more amenable to intervention, but to date evidence on these domains is limited. The aim of the present study was to examine patterns of socio-demographic correlates of adults' leisure-time and transport physical activity and how these associations varied across 17 cities in 12 countries. Methods: Participants (N = 13,745) aged 18-66 years in the IPEN Adult study and with complete data on socio-demographic and self-reported physical activity characteristics were included. Participants reported frequency and duration of leisure-time and transport activities in the last 7 days using the self-administered International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form. Six physical activity outcomes were examined in relation with age, education, and sex, and analyses explored variations by city and curvilinear associations. Results: Sex had the most consistent results, with five of six physical activity outcomes showing females were less active than males. Age had the most complex associations with self-report transport and leisure-time physical activity. Compared to older people, younger adults were less likely to engage in transport physical activity, but among those who did, younger people were likely to engage in more active minutes. Curvilinear associations were found between age and all three leisure-time physical activity outcomes, with the youngest and the oldest being more active. Positive associations with education were found for leisure-time physical activity only. There were significant interactions of city with sex and education for multiple physical activity outcomes. Conclusions: Although socio-demographic correlates of physical activity are widely studied, the present results provide new information. City-specific findings suggest there will be value in conducting more detailed case studies. The curvilinear associations of age with leisure-time physical activity as well as significant interactions of leisure-time activity with sex and education should be further investigated. The findings of lower leisure-time physical activity among females as well as people with low education suggest that greater and continued efforts in physical activity policies and programs tailored to these high-risk groups are needed internationally.

J	Zhao, NG; Wang, Q; Cao, P; Wu, J				Zhao, Nenggui; Wang, Qiang; Cao, Ping; Wu, Jie			Dynamic pricing with reference price effect and price-matching policy in the presence of strategic consumers	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						Dynamic pricing; reference price effect; price-matching policy; two-period model; strategic consumers	MODEL MISSPECIFICATION; REFUND; GUARANTEES; BEHAVIOR	In this paper, we consider a retailer that sells a product with high storage cost over a two-period horizon. The goal is to investigate the single and combined effects of reference price and price-matching (PM) on the purchasing behavior of consumers and determine how these affect the retailer?s optimal pricing decisions and optimal total discounted revenue. We first present a discrete-time dynamic pricing (DP) model over a two-period horizon with a reference price effect in the presence of strategic consumers. Then we subsequently extended to another DP model in which the retailer implements a PM policy. The results show that under the reference price effect, the retailer?s revenue will always decrease, even when a PM policy is implemented. The PM policy is not always beneficial for the retailer, especially when the discount factor is infinitely close to 1. Second, we propose a model misspecification approach to investigate the effect of the reference price. Furthermore, the value of a PM policy is discussed. We find that the value of a PM policy is generally best when the discount factor is at a threshold value and also that the value of PM is much greater in the presence of strategic purchasing behavior.

J	Bernardi, R; Sarker, S; Sahay, S				Bernardi, Roberta; Sarker, Suprateek; Sahay, Sundeep			THE ROLE OF AFFORDANCES IN THE DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN KENYA: AN IDENTITY WORK PERSPECTIVE	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Health information systems; information technology; institutional theory; deinstitutionalization; affordances; identities; healthcare; LMICs	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; GROUNDED THEORY; TECHNOLOGY; SOCIOMATERIALITY; CONTEXT; AMAZON; ICT4D	Improving the state of citizens' health is an urgent priority in many low and middle income countries (LMICs), and health management information systems (HMIS) are widely seen as valuable tools for pursuing this priority. Yet, the potential of HMIS has been difficult to materialize in the LMIC context since routines and practices that work against effective use of HMIS are often deeply embedded in historical institutions and, consequently, are difficult to change. Using a longitudinal case study of HMIS in Kenya, we investigate the crucial role of identity work as a mechanism that links information technology (IT) affordances to institutions. In particular, our study revealed four types of identity work (disruptive, legitimizing, reinforcing, and transformative) that, through different affordances, led to distinct institutional consequences in terms of either maintaining or deinstitutionalizing existing dysfunctional HMIS-related routines and practices. We demonstrate the importance of context for theorizing the societal and development impact of IT and the role of IT materiality in influencing deinstitutionalization.

However, in allowing practically anyone to enter, such platforms enable opportunistic suppliers to flood the market with offerings, many of which are of low quality. This situation creates choice overload for potential backers and may thus influence their investment decisions. To empirically study the implications of this phenomenon for crowdfunding performance, we use a quasi-natural experiment in the form of an exogenous media shock that occurred on Kickstarter.com. The shock was followed by a sharp increase in the number of campaigns, particularly low-quality ones, offered on the supply side of the market; no such increase was observed on the demand side of the market. These unique conditions enable us to estimate how crowdfunding platforms are affected by the presence of an atypically large number of low-quality campaigns, while controlling for fluctuations in demand. We use two identification strategies, which enable us to control for changes in quality, to show that an increase in low-quality supply significantly decreases the performance of the average crowdfunding campaign, manifested in a lower likelihood of success (reaching funding goals) and less money raised per campaign. We also offer a new measure to estimate campaign quality and study the moderating role of campaign quality in the observed effects. We find that high-quality campaigns are less affected than low-quality campaigns by the influx of low-quality offerings. We discuss theoretical implications as well as managerial implications for entrepreneurs and platform designers.

Future Directions for Meningitis Surveillance and Vaccine Evaluation in the Meningitis Belt of Sub-Saharan Africa	JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Africa; meningitis epidemics; meningococcal; NmC; surveillance	MENINGOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINE; PNEUMOCOCCAL MENINGITIS; SEROGROUP C; BURKINA-FASO; EPIDEMIC; OUTBREAK; IMPACT; MENAFRIVAC; CARRIAGE; NIGER	In sub-Saharan Africa, bacterial meningitis remains a significant public health problem, especially in the countries of the meningitis belt, where Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A historically caused large-scale epidemics. In 2014, MenAfriNet was established as a consortium of partners supporting strategic implementation of case-based meningitis surveillance to monitor meningitis epidemiology and impact of meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine (MACV). MenAfriNet improved data quality through use of standardized tools, procedures, and laboratory diagnostics. MenAfriNet surveillance and study data provided evidence of ongoing MACV impact, characterized the burden of non-serogroup A meningococcal disease (including the emergence of a new epidemic clone of serogroup C), and documented the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. New vaccines and schedules have been proposed for future implementation to address the remaining burden of meningitis. To support the goals of "Defeating Meningitis by 2030," MenAfriNet will continue to strengthen surveillance and support research and modeling to monitor the impact of these programs on meningitis burden in sub-Saharan Africa.

The chalcones with the best docking scores obeying the Lipinski rule of five were subsequently prepared by base-catalyzed aldol reactions. The activity of these compounds as inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction was investigated using a yeast-based screening assay. Using this approach two chalcones (3 and 4) were identified as putative small molecule inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction. The activity of both chalcones was further investigated in a panel of human tumor cells. Chalcones 3 and 4 revealed a pronounced tumor cell growth inhibitory effect on tumor cell lines. Additionally, chalcone 4 caused alterations in the cell cycle profile, induced apoptosis and increased the levels of p53, p21 and PUMA proteins in NCI-H460 cells. Computational docking studies allowed to predict that, like nutlin-3A (a well-known small-molecule inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction), chalcones 3 and 4 bind to the p53-binding site of MDM2. The results here presented will be valuable for the structure-based design of novel and potent p53-MDM2 inhibitors. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

HPP led to more than a 5 log (cfu/g) reduction in initial bacterial total viable counts and altered the bacterial microbiome, reducing the proportion of food spoilage genera. Lightness and hardness of the fish flesh significantly increased after HPP and were associated with modified muscle tissue histology, with fibers appearing fused and more compact in comparison to the unprocessed control. Sensory evaluation (based on a lower limit of 5 for overall acceptability scoring) indicated a shelf life of 11 days for untreated control samples and 2 months for the HP-treated fillets. Quantitative SWATH proteomics revealed 281 proteins that had modified levels between control and HP-processed fish flesh. The metagenomics and proteomics provided detailed insight into how the change in HP-processed sea bass fillets is linked to the modifications in the microbiome and proteome.

J	Wang, TK; Piao, YM				Wang, Ting-Kwei; Piao, Yanmei			Development of BIM-AR-Based Facility Risk Assessment and Maintenance System	JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES			English	Article						Facility maintenance; Risk assessment; Fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making; Building information modeling; Augmented reality	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; INFORMATION MODELING BIM; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; AUGMENTED REALITY; BUILDING INFORMATION; MATERIAL SELECTION; ARCHITECTURE; MANAGEMENT; SAFETY; FMEA	Although research has shown the potential for integrating building information modeling (BIM) and facility management systems (FMS) and has indicated the importance of using efficient maintenance strategies to reduce facility maintenance management (FMM) costs, there is a paucity of literature that assesses facility risk and strategic actions based on the prioritization of equipment maintenance at the component level. To bridge this gap, this paper developed a facility risk assessment and maintenance system prototype that will enable facility managers to select the maintenance policy for a single piece of equipment and determine the maintenance priorities of equipment components in the initial stage of operation and maintenance (O&M). The maintenance policy was selected by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and facility risk assessment based on fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) was performed to determine the maintenance priorities of equipment components. In this way, the failure modes of the equipment components and the risk order can be analyzed to support facility maintenance decision-making. A facility maintenance system that has embedded policy and maintenance decisions was then developed. Disruptive technologies, such as BIM and augmented reality (AR), were applied to guide the maintenance processes. Finally, a case study demonstrated system implementation.

However, natural drivers and their relative contributions to global TWS changes (TWSC) are still poorly understood. In this study, based on two global precipitation (P) datasets, three global evapotranspiration (ET) datasets, and one global runoff (R) dataset, the responses of TWSC to the three major water fluxes, P, ET, and R, were comprehensively examined for 168 river basins. In addition, by using hierarchical partitioning (HP) analysis, the corresponding relative contributions (RC) of P, ET, and R to TWSC were quantified. The results showed that for the period Jan. 2003-Dec. 2011, significant increases in terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) were observed over 49 basins, whereas 42 basins presented significant decreases in TWSA. A robust positive relationship between P and TWSC was observed in low-latitude basins, but strong negative relationships of TWSC with ET and R were identified in mid- and high-latitude basins. Averaging the degree of explanation of 168 basins for all P-ET-R combinations, we found that three independent variables explained an average of 61.4% of TWSC. The corresponding RC of P, ET, and R were 42.6%, 43.2% and 4.2%, respectively. In spatial terms, a larger contribution of P to TWSC was found in low-latitude basins, and larger contributions of ET and R were identified for mid-and high-latitude basins. The findings of this study were important for improving our understanding of global TWSC responses to climate change.

Competitive advantage of carbon efficient supply chain in manufacturing industry	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Competitive advantage; Carbon efficiency; Sustainable production; Strategic implementation; Supply chain	MANAGEMENT; FOOTPRINT; ENERGY; IMPLEMENTATION; FUTURE	The competitiveness of the manufacturing industry is fundamentally intertwined between sustainable production and carbon efficiency in the supply chain. There is a growing level of alertness to environmental protection vis-a-vis emission control and the climate change. Apart from the cost reduction, network optimization, profit maximization, risk mitigation, and value-added services, the modern manufacturing has added carbon footprint reduction to their performance indices. Therefore, the focus is changing to green manufacturing and carbon efficient supply chain, which is intended to improve their production and product consumption as a result of competitive advantage. However, mitigating the climate change demands a more fundamental shift in the way the manufacturing industry delivers products and services to the end users. This research investigates how the competitive advantage of a carbon efficient supply chain can be sustained. Some automobile manufacturing company in the United Kingdom were considered as the case study. Data were sourced through interview, survey questions and from the existing literature. The cross-case synthesis was applied to draw comparison among different companies used as the case study. Influencing drivers and barriers associated with the automobile manufacturing supply chain were identified. The investigation revealed that consumers are the major driver of competitive advantage in manufacturing, with the competition now moved to supply chain which is associated with a different level of product consumption. The impact of other existing strategic factors was also identified. A flow chart for the strategic implementation of carbon efficiency practices along the supply chain was developed. In overall, the study revealed the need for the implementation of carbon reduction strategies in business development. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the aim to overcome some of these difficulties, the high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model is run over the Tianshan mountains area driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Double nesting method was used with a horizontal resolution of 40 and 8 km covering the period 1980-2018. A decade of simulation from 1980 to 1989, a period when most abundant station observations are available, is considered for validation. These downscaled results are compared against station observations, ERA-Interim reanalysis, and three widely used spatially interpolated products in order to investigate the added value of the dynamical downscaling approach. Results of these comparisons show that the WRF-downscaled data outperform and add significant details to ERA-Interim reanalysis. A remarkable improvement of the WRF simulation is found at reproducing the observed seasonal cycle of daily extreme temperatures and precipitation. Due to better representation of orography, WRF simulations are able to capture extreme precipitation events that are missing in the high-quality interpolated products. Refining the resolution from 40 to 8 km further improves the model performance, particularly at depicting orographic enhancement of precipitation. The validated WRF model can be used in future climate projections studies, and this high-resolution as well as high-quality climatological data set we present here is useful for impact and further downstream studies.

J	Guarnieri, P; Gomes, RC				Guarnieri, Patricia; Gomes, Ricardo Correa			Can public procurement be strategic? A future agenda proposition	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT			English	Article						Partnerships; Acquisition; Environmental and social issues; Procurement; purchasing processes; Strategic procurement; purchasing; Supplier management	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; SECTOR; METHODOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; AUCTION; SERVICE	Purpose This paper aims to demonstrate how public procurement can be strategic. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following the protocol from Pagani, Kovaleski and Resende (2015), called Methodi Ordinatio, to select the relevant literature on this topic. The analysis of papers selected was carried out following the procedures of categorical content analysis (Bardin, 1977). Findings In all, 68 full papers were analyzed from Science Direct and Web of Science. The results present the main characteristics of publications analyzed and the authors propose some categories of strategic practices related to public procurement that are in turn related to: sustainability, partnerships and supplier management, information systems and technology and other issues. Social implications The incorporation of strategic practices in public procurement can result in the best expenditure of public resources and the reduction of corruption in the process of procurement. Originality/value This paper contributes to synthesize the knowledge on strategic procurement, a topic exploited by few people in the public organizations. It differentiates from other literature reviews already published, considering that these studies do not deal, specifically, with public procurement and, also, do not use protocols of SLR.

J	Lee, CW; Li, C				Lee, Chia-Wen; Li, Ching			The Process of Constructing a Health Tourism Destination Index	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						health tourism destination; analytic hierarchy process (AHP); health environment; health promotion; recreational resource management		The purpose of the study is to identify a set of key indicators with weightings for health tourism destinations by using an advanced analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, derived from the official, academic, and professional opinions of the experts. The AHP method allocated weightings to the evaluation criteria selected by the fifteen experts. After expert evaluations were conducted, the three dimensions and eleven sub-dimensions of the initial health tourism destination were obtained as follows: (1) special demands and indications-medical care, health promotion, and tourism and leisure; (2) natural environment-climate, air, water, and light; (3) leisure activities and general demands-sports, therapeutic activities, interactions with animals and plants, and diet. The results revealed that the dimensions of special demands and indications were given the most attention and that the sub-dimensions of sports promotion were the highest ranked by expert groups. The official and academic opinions suggested that health tourism destinations should focus on special demands and indications, while professionals tended to consider the natural environment as a primary concern. In particular, they considered that good air quality can help people release pressure, relax, activate lymphocytes, improve immune function, and enhance disease immunity. The health tourism destination index can contribute to the overall strategic planning process by identifying improvements in activities and enhancing competitiveness in health tourism management by using benchmarking to further improve tourists' experience and satisfaction.

This study enables SMEs to combine the external resources embedded in strategic networks with internal organizational capabilities including organizational agility and absorptive capacity to create an idiosyncratic competitive advantage in a chaotic business environment.

J	Nosrati, K; Collins, AL				Nosrati, Kazem; Collins, Adrian L.			A soil quality index for evaluation of degradation under land use and soil erosion categories in a small mountainous catchment, Iran	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Soil quality index; Land use; Erosion status; Soil enzyme activities; Multivariate statistical techniques	MINIMUM DATA SET; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; AGRICULTURAL LAND; CRITICAL LIMITS; ORGANIC-MATTER; CROP-ROTATION; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; IDENTIFICATION; FRAMEWORK	Soil erosion and land use type have long been viewed as being particularly important drivers of soil degradation. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to select a new soil quality index (SQI) which varies significantly with land use/soil erosion, and to evaluate the new SQI using expert opinion. In total, 18 soil physical, chemical, and biochemical properties (indicators) were measured on 56 soil samples collected from four land use/soil erosion categories (rangeland/surface erosion, rangeland/subsurface erosion, cultivated land/surface erosion and dry-farming land/surface erosion). Principal component and classification analysis (PCCA) identified five PCs that explained 77.7% of the variation in soil properties with the biochemical PC varying significantly with land use/soil erosion. General discriminant analysis (GDA) selected urease and clay as the most sensitive properties distinguishing the land use/soil erosion categories. The GDA canonical scores for the new SQI were significantly correlated with expert opinion soil surface summed scores (for soil movement, surface litter, pedestalling, rills and flow pattern) derived using the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM) method. A forward stepwise general regression model revealed that the new SQI values were explained by soil movement, surface litter, and the summed values of the soil surface factors. Overall, this study confirmed that soil quality in the study area in Iran is controlled by land use and corresponding soil erosion.

Such a strategic decision must be made efficiently by considering many conflicting key criteria such as economic, environmental, and technical. In this study, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution), and CODAS (COmbinative Distance-based ASsessment) methods which are distance-based Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods are applied to the hospital site selection problem. The weights of the hospital site selection criteria are derived from CRITIC (CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation) method whereas the complete ranking of the hospital site alternatives is obtained by using TOPSIS, EDAS, and CODAS methods. According to the results of the CRITIC method the most important criterion is ?market conditions?. The other criteria follow this criterion are cost, transportation, geological factors, land strategy, financial support by the government, environmental consideration, and demographic consideration, respectively. The complete ranking of the hospital site alternatives is also same according to the three distance-based methods. So it can be concluded that these methods can be used instead of each other as an alternative method for the various problem structures and overcoming the disadvantages of these methods.

The dimensionality of the market orientation construct	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING			English	Article						Market orientation; customer value; marketing concept; entrepreneurial marketing	ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; EXPORT PERFORMANCE; ORIENTED BEHAVIOR; CUSTOMER VALUE; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; MEASUREMENT ISSUES; ANTECEDENTS	Market orientation is the implementation of the marketing concept and the organisation-wide creation of customer value. While there have been various conceptualisations and operationalisations of the market orientation construct, marketing academics have focused on a set of information-processing activities that managers and employees use to create a superior customer value provision to competitors. Moreover, although most researchers have studied market orientation as a multi-dimensional construct, others have used uni-dimensional approaches. In this literature review, the different approaches of market orientation are explored; also, some recommendations are made about why marketing academics should not study market orientation as a uni-dimensional construct (based on conceptual and operational problems). That is, regardless of whether scholars investigate market orientation as a corporate culture or a set of firm-level behaviours (among other forms), there are several facets of the market orientation construct. This paper ends with some directions for future research.

J	Fantazy, K; Tipu, SAA				Fantazy, Kamel; Tipu, Syed Awais Ahmad			Exploring the relationships of the culture of competitiveness and knowledge development to sustainable supply chain management and organizational performance	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Culture of competitiveness; Knowledge development; Supply chain sustainability; Performance	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; CORPORATE-SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; FIRM; CAPABILITIES; ADVANTAGE; MODEL; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; BUSINESS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to draw upon the resource-based view of the firm to explore how a firm's resources (assets and capabilities) such as culture of competitiveness (CC) and knowledge development (KD) relate to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and organizational performance (OP). Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 242 supply chain and logistics managers in Pakistan and a structured equation modeling approach was used. Findings The results of the study provide support for the proposed hypotheses and indicate that CC and KD are positively related to SSCM and OP. This points out that the organizations in Pakistan are likely to emphasize CC and KD to achieve OP. However, the positive but weak association of CC and KD with SSCM highlights that the organizations in Pakistan show less concern for SSCM. Originality/value The literature did not reveal any study which examined the relationships of the CC and KD to SSCM and OP in developing countries.

J	Tjahjadi, B; Soewarno, N; Astri, E; Hariyati, H				Tjahjadi, Bambang; Soewarno, Noorlailie; Astri, Elga; Hariyati, Hariyati			Does intellectual capital matter in performance management system-organizational performance relationship? Experience of higher education institutions in Indonesia	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL			English	Article						Intellectual capital; Higher education institutions; Organizational performance; Performance management system	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; UNIVERSITIES; COMPETITION; FUTURE; DIRECTIONS; BUSINESS; SECTOR; POLICY	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether performance management system (PMS) has a positive effect on organizational performance. Furthermore, it also investigates whether intellectual capital (IC) mediates PMS-organizational performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach This study is designed as a quantitative research employing a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Using an online survey, data are collected from the HEIs managers under the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education, the Government of Indonesia (MRTH-GOI). This research uses a mediation model approach to test the indirect effect of IC. Findings The results reveal that PMS has a positive direct effect on organizational performance of the HEIs in Indonesia. Further analysis proves that IC partially mediates PMS-organizational relationship. Research limitations/implications - This research is context-specific for Indonesia and caution should be used when generalizing it to other countries. It implies that the better the organizational performance of the HEIs, the better the quality of life in the society. PMS and IC play a crucial role in the era of knowledge economy. Practical implications - The HEIs managers should design and implement a reliable PMS. They also should properly manage the IC (human capital, structural capital, relational capital) so that they can enhance organizational performance in areas of teaching, research and community service as the core business of the HEIs. Social implications - As the global education competition has become a serious issue in each HEI in Indonesia, the results of this study contribute to providing an approach on how to achieve a better organizational performance which brings more benefits to the society. The HEIs display a strategic role in improving the quality of life of society. The knowledge economy requires society to enhance the quality of education at all levels. This research model and results provide empirical evidence of the importance of IC which mediates the relationship between PMS and organizational performance. When the HEIs in Indonesia implement this model of managing IC, the society will get more benefits in terms of the improvements in the quality of education, teaching, research and community service from the HEIs. The better the HEIs performance, the better the quality of life of the society in the era of knowledge economy. Originality/value This research brings together issues that are usually examined separately in previous studies. It employs a mediation research model to explore the central role of IC in PMS- organizational performance relationship which is rarely researched. This is also the first study exploring the three constructs of PMS, IC and organizational performance in the Indonesian HEIs research setting.

J	Tasleem, M; Khan, N; Nisar, A				Tasleem, Muhammad; Khan, Nawar; Nisar, Asim			Impact of technology management on corporate sustainability performance The mediating role of TQM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						TQM; Performance; Corporate sustainability	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES; COEFFICIENT ALPHA; IMPLEMENTATION; PERSPECTIVE; INTEGRATION; COMPANIES; INTERNET; THINGS	Purpose Corporate sustainability is an evolutionary strategic management concept that has now attained much attention both in literature and practice. In the present globalization and digital age, the competitive strengths of technology management (TM) and TQM practices are widely accepted but to what extent these strategies can interact and impact the sustainability performance is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to portray the significant role of TM and TQM in pursuing corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and to investigate their integrated relationship as a common framework. Design/methodology/approach This is a survey-based empirical research that has been carried out by means of development of a survey questionnaire and its distribution to multifaceted business organizations in a developing country. Random sampling technique was used for the data collection from companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). Response from 209 companies was found useful for analysis in the study. After confirming the questionnaire items for reliability and validity (content, criterion-related and construct validity) correlation, regression, factor analysis, path analysis and mediation analysis were performed through SPSS and AMOS to assess the composition and causal association of factors. Findings Statistical results show that TQM does not only significantly impact CSP but also has an impact on each CSP dimension (economical, social and environmental sustainability performance), whereas TM has an insignificant direct effect on CSP and impacts economical sustainability dimension only. From nine hypotheses, two hypotheses are rejected suggesting that TM does not directly impact social and environmental sustainability. However, when mediation analysis was run by taking TQM as a mediator, the total effect of TM on CSP found significant suggesting that TQM significantly impacts the relationship. Originality/value The study is unique in the prescribed scope which has been carried out in a developing country with focus on strategic concepts, and their interacted relationship, of CSP, TQM and TM in form of proposed research framework. This framework can be used or further investigated for validation, by practitioners and managers working to lead sustainability management in respective areas.

A behavioral theory of alliance portfolio reconfiguration: Evidence from pharmaceutical biotechnology	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						alliance portfolios; innovation performance; organizational slack; performance aspirations; pharmaceutical biotechnology	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; NETWORKS; MARKET; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION; STRANGERS	Research Summary Extant research suggests that firms rationally evaluate external and/or internal contingencies when deciding how to reconfigure their alliance portfolios. We advance a behavioral perspective which assumes that managers are boundedly rational and thus rely on behavioral heuristics when making alliance portfolio reconfiguration decisions. In panel data on U.S.-listed biotechnology firms, we find that below-aspiration performance motivates a firm to form alliances with novel partners within the resource scope of its existing alliance portfolio. This effect is weakened by equity ties with existing partners and strengthened by firm-specific uncertainty. Conversely, above-aspiration performance leads to new alliances with existing partners but outside the resource scope of the firm's existing alliance portfolio. Finally, as organizational slack increases, a firm forms alliances with novel partners focusing on new-to-the-portfolio resources. Managerial Summary We study why and how firms change the configuration of their alliance portfolios over time. We find that actual performance relative to performance objectives, and firms' excess resources, are important drivers of such change. The more firms fail to meet their performance objectives, the more likely they are to form alliances with novel partners focusing on areas in which they already have one or more alliances with other partners. The more firms exceed their performance objectives, the greater their inclination to form alliances with their existing partners in areas in which they do not yet have alliances. The greater the stock of excess resources, the greater firms' propensities to form alliances with novel partners focusing on areas in which they do not yet have alliances.

J	Kilduff, GJ				Kilduff, Gavin J.			INTERFIRM RELATIONAL RIVALRY: IMPLICATIONS FOR COMPETITIVE STRATEGY	ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article							COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING; ASPIRATION-PERFORMANCE; MANAGERIAL COGNITION; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; SELF-EVALUATIONS; DYNAMICS; PARADOX; CONSEQUENCES; INDUSTRY; CATEGORIZATION	In this article I seek to apply findings from recent research on rivalry relationships to firm-level competitive strategy. I integrate microlevel and macrolevel theory in arguing that certain pairs of firms can, over time, develop rivalry relationships much like those between athletic teams or universities. In turn, these rivalry relationships can drive firms' competitive behavior above and beyond current market and competitive conditions (such as resource similarity or market overlap between firms). I then connect the relational rivalry literature and competitive dynamics literature and put forth a series of propositions centered on how relational rivalry between firms affects their competitive moves vis-alpha-vis one another. In doing so I aim to contribute to competitive strategy research by exploring social psychological and sociological factors, particularly by emphasizing the importance of pairs of firms' histories of interaction in driving future competitive action. This work also extends the existing literature on relational rivalry by pointing to institutionalization as a key difference between interfirm and interindividual relational rivalry and by examining the consequences of relational rivalry for macro-level strategic and competitive decisions.

J	Lee, K; Jung, H				Lee, Keeheon; Jung, Hosang			Dynamic semantic network analysis for identifying the concept and scope of social sustainability	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Social sustainability; Diffusion; Change point detection; Bass model; Co-keyword network; Network analysis	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIC APPROACH; MODELS; PERFORMANCE; DIMENSIONS; CENTRALITY; SOCIETY; GROWTH; GREEN	Social sustainability is important across disciplines in the era of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, many scholars note that its concept and scope are ambiguous regardless of public attention and importance. It limits the development of social sustainability research. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a data-driven approach for identifying the concept and scope of social sustainability. We apply dynamic semantic network analysis to the current social sustainability literature over time. This analysis partitions the diffusion of social sustainability in academia into several periods by detecting change points. It also builds semantic networks periodically to discover the concept and scope in the network analysis perspective. Our result shows that social sustainability penetrated into disciplines with minimal innovation and high imitation rates. The concept of social sustainability has been changed several times by including the humanity of community and individuals during its diffusion. The scope of social sustainability has been enlarged but is densely intertwined. That is, social sustainability more concerns quality of life in a society, which is independent from economic and environmental sustainability. And thus, it considers human factors and social effects in a supply chain of products and services. This statement means that social sustainability developed to include the various values of humanity in our society that we should retain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With rapid urbanization and industrialization in China, labor emigration relieves the cultivation of mountainous areas in regions with high poverty and leads to a significant land use transition. This research built an analysis framework for "land use transition - driving mechanism - effects - responses" for mountainous areas of China undergoing land use transition and then proposed the direction of mountainous land consolidation. The results showed that the turning point of land use morphology was the core of rural land use transition in mountainous areas. The expansion of cropland and the contraction of forestland have transitioned to the abandonment of cropland and the expansion of forestland; this transition was the main characteristic of the dominant land use change. Land marginalization and land ecological functional recovery were the main characteristics of the recessive land use transition in mountainous areas. Socioeconomic factors were the primary driving forces during land use transition in mountainous areas, with labor emigration being the most direct force. The rising costs of farming and the challenging living conditions causing labor emigration were fundamental driving forces. Rural land use transition in mountainous areas reduced the vulnerability of the ecological function of land ecosystems. The advantages and disadvantages of the socioeconomic effects should focus on rural development of mountainous areas as well as the livelihood of farmers; this should be further supported by empirical and quantitative research. Rural land use transition of mountainous areas improves natural restoration and is related to socioeconomic development. Rural land consolidation of mountainous areas should conform to land use transition, with the goal of shifting from the increase of cultivated land to the synergies of ecological and environmental protection.

To understand this recurring phenomenon, we draw from socioemotional wealth literature and a philosophical account of the power-transfer paradox in ancient patriarchal monarchies to hypothesize that parent-incumbents tend to exert generational coercive control when their child-successors are seen as very unwilling and incapable or very willing and capable of taking over patriarchal family organizations. We test our hypotheses in three studies. In Study 1, we coded data from succession cases in Chinese patriarchal monarchies (403 BC to 959 AD) and found support for the predicted non-linear effects of successor-princes' willingness (63 cases) and capability (80 cases) on their father-kings' coercive control (persecuting or murdering the princes). In Study 2, based on survey data from parent-child dyads of 157 family firms in Taiwan and mainland China, again, we found U-shaped effects of child-successors' willingness and capability on parent-incumbents' coercive control (restraining successors' power). Moreover, parent-incumbents' highly narcissistic personality attenuated these U-shaped relationships because they tend to devalue their child-successors' willingness and capability. In Study 3, we conducted a survey of 103 parent-child dyads in family firms in mainland China and found a U-shaped relationship between capability and coercive control only when incumbents' roles in the family and at work were highly intertwined.

Urban regeneration through heritage tourism: cultural policies and strategic management	JOURNAL OF TOURISM AND CULTURAL CHANGE			English	Article						Urban regeneration; heritage tourism; policies; branding; Birjand; Iran	COMMUNITY; CITY; FOOD	In spite of its influential history of saffron production and carpet weaving, as well as its notable urban historic fabric, the historic city of Birjand, Iran, has lost its original appeal due to various social, cultural, economic, and physical problems. This research investigates the potential for heritage tourism to help regenerate a declining historic city by utilizing urban cultural capital. This case study utilizes a conceptual framework of current trends in urban renewal and cultural assets, as well as a SWOT-ANP approach to understand the primary ways in which a declining urban destination can utilize its cultural heritage to regenerate physically, socially and economically. Findings suggest that successful implementation or urban regeneration through heritage tourism occurs when a city makes maximum use of opportunities in four areas: cultural policy-making, holding cultural events, participatory management, and enhancement of public urban spaces through competitive/pro-action, diversification, revision and defence strategies.

In this study, we investigated the effects of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), an exercise-responsive myokine, on glucose metabolism in human and mouse skeletal muscle. SPARC-knockout mice showed impaired systemic metabolism and reduced phosphorylation of AMPK and protein kinase B in skeletal muscle. Treatment of SPARC-knockout mice with recombinant SPARC improved glucose tolerance and concomitantly activated AMPK in skeletal muscle. These effects were dependent on AMPK-gamma 3 because SPARC treatment enhanced skeletal muscle glucose uptake in wild-type mice but not in AMPK-gamma 3-knockout mice. SPARC strongly interacted with the voltage-dependent calcium channel, and inhibition of calcium-dependent signaling prevented SPARC-induced AMPK phosphorylation in human and mouse myotubes. Finally, chronic SPARC treatment improved systemic glucose tolerance and AMPK signaling in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet-induced obese mice, highlighting the efficacy of SPARC treatment in the management of metabolic diseases. Thus, our findings suggest that SPARC treatment mimics the effects of exercise on glucose tolerance by enhancing AMPK-dependent glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.-Aoi, W., Hirano, N., Lassiter, D.

J	Cortina, JM; Koehler, T; Keeler, KR; Nielsen, BB				Cortina, Jose M.; Koehler, Tine; Keeler, Kathleen R.; Nielsen, Bo Bernhard			Restricted Variance Interaction Effects: What They Are and Why They Are Your Friends	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						multilevel modeling; hierarchical; research methods; statistical methods; personality	MULTIPLE-REGRESSION; MODERATION; MEDIATION; VARIABLES; POWER	Although interaction hypotheses are increasingly common in our field, many recent articles point out that authors often have difficulty justifying them. The purpose of this article is to describe a particular type of interaction: the restricted variance (RV) interaction. The essence of the RV interaction is that, as the value of one variable in a system changes, certain values of another variable in the system become less plausible, thus restricting its variance. This, in turn, influences relationships between that variable and other variables. These types of interactions are quite common, even if they are not recognized as RV interactions, and they exist at every level of analysis. The advantage of the RV interaction is that, as compared with other interaction types, it is relatively simple to justify. The different forms of RV interaction do, however, contain complexities of which a researcher must be aware. This article explains and illustrates the forms that RV interactions can take and their often counterintuitive implications. It also describes how one should go about testing them. Our intention is to help researchers strengthen and focus their interaction arguments.

It argues that e-Government maturity models are characterized by relatively-stable trajectories which are punctuated by radical shifts toward fullblown e-Government transformation. Far from being a prescriptive and linear process, e-Government maturity is an unpredictable process where turning points (or radical shifts) play a crucial role in the e-Government strategizing process.

The future changes in the legislation and technology development influences the way the waste is being treated. Thus the method, location and capacity of processing sites are unknown. The realization of future projects can be supported by the developing of transportation infrastructure. Such a feature may be represented by a robust transfer station grid, which can be designed to handle all possible future realizations and technological solutions (establishment of waste treatment facilities). The paper presents an approach utilising a mathematical model for the design of transfer stations. It is formulated as a multi-objective two-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming problem, where the trade-off between the environmental aspect and the economic viability is considered. The model is tested through a case study for the Czech Republic, where the waste treatment of over 6,000 municipalities is analysed. The solutions for different preferences are assessed throughout the principle called out-of sample stability with 10,000 scenarios. The optimal decision consists of the robust transfer station grid with selected locations and their respective capacity. The particular solution with respect to the potential trade-off suggests to save 1.148 mil of travelled kilometres with only 0.77 mil EUR. The output in the form of decision support can serve possible stakeholders from the field of waste management to plan more sustainable projects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
